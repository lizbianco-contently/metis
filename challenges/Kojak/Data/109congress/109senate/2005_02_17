Madam President, as we begin to debate the budget sent to \nus by President Bush, there will be a lot of discussion in the Chamber \nabout spending restraints, about being conservative, and so on. The \nbudget sent to us by President Bush proposes the highest budget deficit \nin the history of our country. I will be going to a hearing later this \nmorning on the proposal to spend $82 billion more on Iraq and \nAfghanistan. That is not in the budget. It is an emergency request.\n  The President's proposed budget, with a deficit well over $400 \nbillion in history, is short by somewhere around $80 billion that will \nbe spent on an emergency in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it also uses the \nSocial Security trust fund, which could not be used for other purposes. \nSo the real budget deficit is around $650 billion, which is a very \nserious problem. Our fiscal policy is off track, and we need to get it \non track.\n  We are going to talk about spending issues as we go along in this \nbudget process. There will be some discussion about big issues, and \nsome about small issues.\n  Let me talk for a moment about two issues that represent, I think, a \nprofound waste of taxpayers' money.\n  Let me introduce you to Fat Albert. This is an AEROSAT blimp, an \nAEROSAT balloon. Fat Albert has been around for some while. In fact, \nFat Albert is tethered about 20,000 feet above the ground with \nthousands of feet of cable, and it is used with camera equipment to \nsend television signals into Cuba to tell the Cuban people how \nwonderful life is in our country. Of course, they know how wonderful \nlife is in our country, which is why they get on a boat to try to cross \nthe waters to come to America. And if they decide not to get on the \nboat, they can simply tune into a Miami radio station and hear a little \nabout America. But we are sending television signals into Cuba through \nTV Marti, which has been funded by the American taxpayers for 16 years.\n  We are broadcasting television signals which no one can see because \nCastro easily jams the signal. We did for a long while televise it from \n3 o'clock in the morning until 8 o'clock in the morning. My guess is \nthat, even if the signals got through, there aren't a lot of Cuban \npeople up at 3 o'clock in the morning watching television. But, \nnonetheless, the signals don't get through because they are jammed by \nthe Cuban Government.\n  For 16 years, despite the fact that we are broadcasting signals which \nno one can see, we have spent $189 million broadcasting signals from \nFat Albert, tethered 20,000 feet above the ground, to Cubans who can't \nsee it.\n  This year, what does the budget request? The budget request is to \ndouble the funding for TV Marti. It is unbelievable. People will not \nunderstand this when they look back and say, Wait a second; they spent \nnearly a quarter of $1 billion sending television signals no one could \nsee for over 16 years? They will say, do you mean that at a time with \nrecord deficits the President wanted to double the budget for \ntelevision signals no one can see?\n  Fat Albert once got loose with 20,000 feet of tethered cable \nfollowing it. Fat Albert wandered into the Everglades. So the thing \ngets loose and goes over the Everglades, and they are chasing it with \nhelicopters. Finally, it lands on the top of some trees in the \nEverglades. They had to find a way to get it off. Helicopters had to \ncome down and commandos rappelled down to salvage the equipment. It is \na comedy of errors.\n  But the administration has a plan now. They have decided they are \ngoing to get rid of Fat Albert, or maybe continue to use it but only \npart time. Now they want to buy an airplane for $8 million so they can \nsend an airplane up to send television signals to TV Marti to the Cuban \npeople who can't see them; $8 million for the airplane, $11 million for \nthe broadcast, and $2 million for maintenance on the plane.\n  It is like Katy bar the door; it is as if there is no deficit.\n  It is unbelievable to me that we are going to continue to spend money \nwe do not have on something we do not need, and send television signals \nfrom an aerostat balloon and now an airplane that viewers cannot see. \nThis does not pass the laugh test.\n  I am no fan of Fidel Castro. I want the Cuban people to be free. I \nwant democracy to come to Cuba.\n  But our country has decided, with China and with North Vietnam, both \nCommunist countries, the best way to move a Communist country in the \nright direction is through travel and trade, through engagement. We \nhave followed that rule with Communist China and Communist Vietnam, \nencouraging people to travel there and encouraging trade with both. The \nsole exception is with Cuba, where we have had an embargo for over 40 \nyears. Fidel Castro has lived through 10 U.S. Presidencies. His message \nto the Cuban people is, of course, Our economy is in tatters; we have a \n500-pound gorilla with its fist around our neck with an embargo.\n  The quicker way to remove Castro from office, in my judgment, is to \nopen trade and travel to Cuba. Nonetheless, the administration does not \nwant to do that.\n  So we have travel restrictions in Cuba. I have held up a poster of \nJoni Scott who went to Cuba to distribute free Bibles on the street \ncorners in Havana. Do you know what happened to her? She got discovered \nby the U.S. Treasury Department and they slapped her with a $10,000 \nfine. I held up a picture of Joan Sloat who was a retired senior \nbicyclist who joined a Canadian bicycle troop to go biking in Cuba. \nThey tracked her down as she was by her son's bedside, dying of brain \ncancer, and they decided to slap her with a big fine and then decided \nto attach her Social Security payments.\n  They are so obsessed in this administration with the issue of Cuba it \ndoes not matter how much money they waste. We have something called the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control, OFAC, down in the Treasury \nDepartment. It is supposed to be tracking the financing of terrorist \norganizations. Do you know what? They have nearly twice as many people \nworking on tracking Americans suspected of taking a vacation in Cuba \nthan they do tracking terrorists' moneys that are supporting Osama bin \nLaden's organization. It is unthinkable that is what they are doing, \nbut that is what they are doing.\n  On top of all of that obsession, what we have is a program called \nTelevision Marti which does not work, which wastes every dollar it \nspends, and the President says, Let's double the funding, at a time \nwhen we have the highest budget deficit in the history of this country.\n  There are some areas of Federal spending that ought to be abolished. \nI, along with my colleague Senator Wyden and others, will offer \nlegislation to abolish this spending. It is unbelievable.\n  I didn't mention that on October 10, 2003, the President held a Rose \nGarden event to say he was going to supplement the efforts of Fat \nAlbert to send signals to the Cubans because they are jammed, by taking \na high-tech airplane, called a Commando Solo C-130. There are only a \nhandful in the world and we have used them in big trouble spots in the \nworld to be able to broadcast emergency signals to people. But the \nPresident announced he was going\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\nto use a National Guard Commando Solo C-130 to broadcast signals into \nCuba. So they have been using Defense Department funds to broadcast \nsignals to Cuba that are jammed. It is not enough, apparently, to \nbroadcast signals from a big old aerostat balloon that the Cuban people \ncannot see, now we have a highly sophisticated C-130. And now even that \nis not enough. Now they want to buy a new airplane in this budget.\n  My hope is there are enough people in the Congress who understand \nwaste is waste, not Republican waste or Democratic waste. Just waste. \nWhen it does not stand the test of common sense, and it does not even \nstand the basic laugh test with this kind of spending, my hope is \nMembers of the Senate will join and decide this is the sort of thing \nthat ought to be abolished.\n\n  One final point. I don't come here to try to abolish Radio Marti, \nalthough I don't think it is necessary. Radio Marti is broadcasting \nradio signals into Florida. They are often not jammed. The Cuban people \nreceive them. I have been to Cuba and talked to the dissidents. They \nreceive Radio Marti's broadcast. I don't propose we abolish it. But \nthey do not see the Television Marti broadcast. We still have expensive \nstudio space, pay expensive salaries, have aerosat balloons and now \nairplanes to broadcast it, despite the fact we know it is a complete, \ntotal waste of money. We know better than this. We ought to understand \nit and abolish it in this year's budget submitted by the President.\n  Let me mention one other area of spending that desperately needs to \nbe abolished in this budget. It is not giant; it is $8 million. But \ntake $11 million for Fat Albert and the new airplane and Television \nMarti and $8 million here and there, and pretty soon we have a \nsignificant amount of money.\n  Last year and this year, the President recommended we build \nadditional nuclear weapons--begin planning the design--and they \nespecially talked about the earth-penetrating bunker buster nuclear \nweapon. Last year, the Congress said no. The President put it in his \nbudget again this year. He wants $8 million to revive the project to \ncreate new earth-penetrating bunker buster nuclear weapons. The \nimplication of creating a designer nuclear weapon is, we do not have \nenough nuclear weapons at the moment and they are perfectly usable if \nwe find someone crawled in a cave or carrying on operations in a cave \nthat we want to get to that we cannot get to.\n  If a country like ours is to send a signal to the rest of the world \nthat we do not have enough nuclear weapons, that we believe we should \ndesign more nuclear weapons, that designer nuclear weapons make sense, \nand that nuclear weapons are usable, that is exactly the wrong signal \nto send to anyone in this world. The exclusive opportunity and \nrequirement for us is to send a signal to the world that nuclear \nweapons should never again be used in anger under any circumstance.\n  We have thousands of them. The loss of one would cause an apoplectic \nseizure among the cities in our country. There was a time when it was \nthought one nuclear weapon from the Russian arsenal was stolen and it \ncaused a great seizure among intelligence organizations and others \nbecause were a terrorist able to steal one nuclear weapon and threaten \nto detonate one nuclear weapon in a major American city, we are not \ntalking about 100 deaths or 1,000 deaths, we are talking about hundreds \nof thousands of deaths. The loss of one nuclear weapon would be \ndevastating if it got into the hands of terrorists.\n  We have thousands and thousands of nuclear weapons in this country. \nThe estimate is somewhere--of course, it is classified--the estimate \nrange of the Russian stockpile is somewhere perhaps in the area of \n15,000 nuclear weapons; ours is something less than that but not much \nless than that. We have thousands and thousands and thousands of \nnuclear weapons between us and the Russians, with some other countries \nwho have now joined that club who have nuclear weapons but are fewer in \nnumber.\n  The suggestion somehow that we do not have enough nuclear weapons, \nthat we need more nuclear weapons, and that nuclear weapons are usable, \nespecially if we have an issue with people holing up in a cave or \nstrategic materials holed up in a cave, that we cannot get to that, so \nwe can lob in an earth penetrator, a designer bunker buster nuclear \nweapon, and that we can use it--that message from this country is a \ndevastating message that sets back the opportunity for this country to \nplay a leadership role in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons \neverywhere, making sure we do not ever have testing of nuclear weapons \nanywhere. It is our job, our responsibility, to be a world leader on \nthis issue.\n\n  Given the new reality of the war on terrorism and what terrorists \nwould like to do with respect to weapons of mass destruction, if our \ncountry does not try to do everything humanly possible to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons and make people understand it is unthinkable \nthat nuclear weapons will once again be used on this Earth, then we \nwill have failed. Our children and grandchildren will almost certainly \nsee at some point an expansion of those countries that have nuclear \nweapons, the stealing of a nuclear weapon by a terrorist organization \nand the detonation of a nuclear weapon in a major city in this world \nand perhaps in this country. We must exert every possible effort to see \nthat does not happen.\n  Sending a budget that says we need to begin work on designing \nadditional nuclear weapons, new nuclear weapons, and nuclear weapons \nthat are designed for specific purposes such as penetrating the Earth \nand busting caves, with the implication that it is clearly something we \ncould, should, and would use under certain circumstances, is exactly \nthe wrong approach and a dangerous message from this country, \nespecially.\n  The burden falls on our shoulders to be a leader in stopping the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. It retards rather than advances those \ninterests to see from this administration talk in some circles that is \nreckless and recommendations that are counterproductive to suggest we \nought to begin, again, building nuclear weapons.\n  In addition to this recommendation to spend $8 million to revive the \nproject of a nuclear earth-penetrator bunker buster, there is talk of \ntesting nuclear weapons, resuming testing of nuclear weapons which, of \ncourse, then would be a green light for others to say, if the United \nStates is going to test, we are going to test.\n  My hope is we can understand the profound danger that exists if we do \nnot take this proliferation issue seriously and if we do not \nimmediately assume the mantle of responsibility to be the world leader \nto stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is not about a nuisance. \nThis is not about a threat. This is about a potential catastrophe \nunlike anything we have discussed or thought about with respect to \nweapons of mass destruction in the hands of the wrong people. That is \nwhy the responsibility is such an ominous responsibility that falls on \nour shoulders. It is one that we can meet, in my judgment, but we have \nto be clear thinking.\n  We need a President and a Congress, together, that will reject the \napproach that says we should begin building additional nuclear weapons \nor begin researching and talking about the need for additional weapons \nwe can use for designer purposes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today because this Senate \nneeds to act now to save our children's future. We all know that Social \nSecurity is one of this country's greatest success stories in the 20th \ncentury. But why? Is it the hundreds of thousands of elderly who were \nsaved from poverty or is it the millions of seniors who have retired \nwith the stability of their monthly Social Security checks?\n  Actually, there are two reasons. For me, the first is an Army \nsergeant who served in World War II and went to the\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\nEuropean Theater. The second is the woman from Alabama he married. \nAlthough they were never a family of great means, they worked hard, \npaid into the system all their lives, and got the money they were owed \nfrom Social Security when they retired.\n  Of course, those two people I am referring to were my parents. It is \nbecause of what Social Security did for them and their friends that we \nall know it is a success story. I am sure millions of Americans feel \nthe same way.\n  Today, I would like to make absolutely sure Social Security is the \nsame success for my children as it was for my parents.\n  Let's get one thing out of the way right up front: This debate is \nabout saving the future, not defacing the past. Every senior who now \nreceives Social Security benefits or who is going to receive them \nwithin the next 10 years will get full benefits for their entire--their \nentire--retirement. They deserve that piece of mind, and they have it. \nThis Congress will not touch Social Security in any way for Americans \n55 or older, period. This debate is not about seniors today. It is \nabout our children tomorrow.\n  I said Social Security was one of the greatest accomplishments of the \n20th century. But this is the 21st century. We need to strengthen and \nsave Social Security for today's workers. If we do not act now, this \nsystem, born out of the New Deal, will become a bad deal for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  When Social Security was created in 1935, it was still common to see \na Ford Model T on the road. Today's young adults drive hybrid electric \ncars while listening to their I-Pods. A system designed for the 1930s \njust does not fit the 21st century.\n  Something must be done and done now. Some critics say there is no \ncrisis; that we do not have to do anything about this problem, even \nthough we can all see it coming; that we can put it off until later. \nTheir response to this healthy debate on the future of Social Security \nhas been to poke their fingers in their ears and bury their heads in \nthe sand.\n  Well, that is simply not acceptable. We were elected to get things \naccomplished for America, not to mark time around here. Someday I will \npass this desk, right here--the very same desk used by Henry Clay--\nalong to another Senator from Kentucky. I do not intend to pass this \nproblem along as well.\n  That is why I applaud the President's vision and courage in tackling \nthis important but certainly tough issue. He deserves our gratitude for \nsparking this national discussion on saving Social Security. You might \nnot agree with the various options laid out by the President--that is \nfine--but you have to agree that action ought to be taken.\n  In 1935, most women did not work outside the home. Today, about 60 \npercent do. In 1935, the average American did not typically live long \nenough to collect Social Security benefits. Today, our life expectancy \nis 77 years. In 1935, there were 16 Americans in the workforce for \nevery retiree collecting benefits. Today, there are only slightly more \nthan three.\n  And before the next President is sworn in, the baby boomers will \nbegin to retire, creating four new retirees for each new worker over \nthe next 30 years. Yet benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over \nthe next few decades.\n  What that means is the current system will begin to pay out more \nmoney than it takes in within just a very few years--by the time \ntoday's kindergarteners graduate from high school. At that point, the \nGovernment will have to borrow money or raise taxes to keep up with the \nbenefits. When today's workers retire in 2042, the system will be \ninsolvent.\n  If we do nothing until then--just keep putting it off--the only \nsolution will be to borrow massive amounts of money, impose crippling \ntaxes, or drastically cut benefits, or all three.\n  So at a minimum, we need to repair the system to keep it afloat. But \nwe can do, if we chose to, a lot more than that. There is a lot of room \nfor improvement in Social Security. We owe our children the most \nfinancially sound system possible. They will have paid into it their \nentire working lives. They deserve to be protected. I know a lot of \nyounger people consider the portion of their paycheck that goes to \nSocial Security to be like any other tax--money they will never see \nagain. More young people believe they will see a UFO than that they \nwill see their own Social Security benefits. That is how confident they \nare that it will be there for them in the future. That tells me we are \nletting down our children and grandchildren. They can see that \nWashington has done a terrible job managing their investment. Social \nSecurity pays out about 1 cent per dollar paid in, but IRAs and money \nmarkets pay on average seven times more.\n  I have a message for every younger worker who is about to enter or \nwho has just entered the prime of working life: The money that goes \ninto Social Security is not the Government's money. It is your money. \nYou paid for it. You paid for it with sweat and toil to provide for \nyourself and your family. If the Government didn't take that money, you \nwould have spent it on yourself or your spouse or a parent or a child \nor put it in the bank. The point is, it would have been your decision.\n  There is a way we can strengthen and save Social Security, still \nguarantee that it will fulfill its promises in the future, and also \ngive younger workers the power to decide how best to grow their money \nand build a nest egg for retirement. We do that with voluntary personal \nretirement accounts. Voluntary personal retirement accounts are the \nbest way to ensure that Social Security remains strong for our children \nand grandchildren. The money in these accounts will grow over time at a \ngreater rate than what the current system now offers. The nest egg they \nbuild will be theirs and Government can never take it away. Most \nimportantly, Americans will be able to pass on the money in these \naccounts to their children or grandchildren. It is a smarter, fairer \nsystem.\n  I hear some of my colleagues say: People will waste the money in \nthese accounts, playing the lottery or betting on horses at the track. \nTake it from this Senator from a horse racing State, such claims are \nnonsense and only meant as scare tactics. This Congress and President \nBush will only pass legislation that will save and strengthen Social \nSecurity once and for all. That means we will set careful guidelines \nfor these personal accounts. The money will only be invested in \nconservative bonds and stock funds. We will keep fees and transaction \ncosts low. We will install appropriate safeguards, and we will phase in \npersonal accounts gradually over a period of time.\n  Voluntary personal retirement accounts are very similar to the Thrift \nSavings Plan that every Federal worker, like all of us, has access to. \nIf we can offer this deal to Federal employees, including Senators, why \ncan't we offer it to all Americans?\n  The accounts are also similar to an IRA or a 401(k) plan. So most \nAmericans will already know how a personal account will work. They are \neasy to understand. They will be completely voluntary, so if anybody is \nuncomfortable with it, they don't have to do it. No one who does not \nwant a personal account will be forced to have one.\n\n  On top of the voluntary personal retirement accounts, we need to do \nmore to save and strengthen Social Security. The President said he is \nopen to all reasonable ideas. So are all of us. But it is crucial that \nwe tackle the problem now and not continue to kick the can down the \nroad. Democrats and Republicans are going to have to work together to \ndo this.\n  I have spoken before of my hopes that this 109th Congress will be \nable to work together in a spirit of bipartisanship, and we certainly \ngot off to a good start last week with the class action bill. I believe \nwe should start now by rolling up our sleeves and working together.\n  A few days ago the new chairman of the Democratic National Committee \nsaid:\n\n       I hate the Republicans and everything they stand for.\n\n  Well, it is pretty tough to sit across the table from somebody with \nthat kind of an attitude. But I think most Democrats recognize that \nattitude is not productive and I don't think it is the view of \nDemocrats in the Senate. I have already heard several of my Democratic \nfriends say Social Security does, indeed, have a problem, and we do \nneed to do something about it. That is good. Denying there is a problem \nis denying the obvious. We need their voices\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\nin this great national discussion. They recognize that when it comes to \nSocial Security, what Republicans stand for is the same thing Democrats \nstand for--preserving the system for today's seniors and restoring its \npromise for our children and for our grandchildren.\n  Social Security was there for my parents. It will be there for me. \nBut I have three daughters. They are all grown up and have blossomed \ninto accomplished young women. I don't want them to question whether \nthere will be anything left when they retire. We should not let a \nsystem that provided so spectacularly for my parents and for me to die \ndue to our reluctance to tackle big, tough issues. We need to restore \nthe system so it is fair for everyone. Working in a bipartisan manner, \nwe have the opportunity to do that.\n  An increasing number of Senators on the other side of the aisle are \nacknowledging that there is a problem, and it seems to me a good place \nfor us all to start is to acknowledge the obvious, which is that unless \nwe address this problem, we are going to have a serious problem later, \nleading to massive tax increases or unacceptably large benefit cuts for \nour children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise to echo the words that were just \nspoken by my colleague, the Senator from Kentucky, distinguished \nmajority whip, with respect to an issue that is incredibly important to \nthe Senate and to the people of this country. The issue is the future \nof Social Security. The program as we know it today will not last. It \nis headed for bankruptcy. That is why President Bush and others have \ndone the responsible thing--to begin to raise the issue of reform.\n  The question before us is, How do we fix the system for our children \nand for our grandchildren? I would like to commend the Republicans and \nthe Democrats who have acknowledged and agreed that a problem exists \nwith the current system and that we can do better.\n  Going back to 1998, President Bill Clinton at that time called Social \nSecurity ``a looming crisis'' and then went on to detail the deep \nbenefit cuts or massive payroll tax increases that would be required if \nnothing was done in the very immediate future.\n  It takes political courage for Members of both parties to be open to \nreform. Members of both parties have expressed their concern about the \ncurrent system and about the possible improvements brought about by \nadding personal retirement accounts.\n  Social Security is an extremely complicated program. Sometimes it is \ndifficult to grasp numbers in the trillions and dates that are decades \nfrom now. That is why it is helpful to tackle this issue in a way we \ncan all understand. For me, the decision to find a fix for Social \nSecurity became clear when I thought about two extremely important \npeople in my own life--my father Harold and my daughter Brittany.\n  My father Harold Thune turned 85 this last December. He is a retired \nteacher, still living in the town I grew up in, Murdo, SD, with my \nwonderful mother who was the school librarian. My father also served \nhis country as a decorated World War II fighter pilot. He is the \nessence of hard work and sacrifice. He has put in his time. I would \nnever do anything to the Social Security benefit that he has earned. \nBecause my parents never struck it rich working for the Murdo public \nschool system, they depend upon their Social Security check. Many other \nretired Americans are in similar situations.\n  For one-third of Americans over the age of 65, Social Security \nbenefits constitute 90 percent of their total income. As President Bush \noutlined his principles regarding Social Security reform last month in \nthe State of the Union, he made it very clear that Social Security \nbenefits would remain unchanged for anyone 55 years of age and older. \nThis includes everyone in retirement and those nearing retirement age.\n  The system will be there for those who have paid into the system with \na lifetime of hard work. No politician is proposing to cut benefits \nfrom my father's generation. Despite what we might hear from those who \nare defending the status quo, reform proposals work to solve the \nproblem for younger workers, not take away the benefits from America's \nseniors.\n  That brings me to another important person in my life who has helped \nme better understand the need to fix Social Security. That is my oldest \ndaughter Brittany. Brittany is 17 years old, and she is a junior in \nhigh school at Roosevelt High School in Sioux Falls, SD. Soon she will \nbe entering the workforce. God willing, she will live a full life and \nreach retirement age in 2055. The Social Security trustees tell us that \nSocial Security will no longer be able to pay full benefits by 2042, \nwhich is 13 years before my daughter Brittany could retire. That means \neven though Brittany will have paid into Social Security throughout her \nentire working life, the benefit promised to her will be cut by at \nleast 25 percent according to the trustees.\n\n  This is the problem. If we do nothing, our children and grandchildren \nwill not see the benefits that are promised to them. Brittany's \nbenefits would be cut by at least 25 percent and probably more.\n  The reason this will happen is nothing more than simple demographics. \nWhen my father Harold was working in the 1950s, there were 16 workers \nfor every Social Security beneficiary. Today there are only three \nworkers per beneficiary. When my daughter retires, there will be two \nworkers per beneficiary. The current pay-as-you-go Social Security \nsystem will not be able to handle the demographic shifts as the number \nof workers goes down and the number of retirees goes up.\n  A majority of younger voters understand there is a major problem with \nthe current system for their generation. A Newsweek poll earlier this \nmonth found that 62 percent of those age 18 to 34 believe Social \nSecurity will not be there for them when they retire. Predictably, \nyoung Americans are frustrated with the prospect of spending a lifetime \npaying into a system that is destined for bankruptcy.\n  Some in Washington believe the best approach is to push that problem \ndown the road; leave it for another Congress and for another President. \nI call that the ``sweep it under the carpet'' caucus. The American \npeople sent us here to solve problems, and they expect us to do just \nthat. To the sweep it under the carpet caucus, I say: Don't hide behind \nthe status quo. Don't resort to the politics of fear and to scaring \nseniors. Your constituents and my constituents deserve better of their \nelected representatives.\n  If we do nothing, we are looking at a $10 trillion shortfall. The \nlonger we wait, the more expensive the fix will become. If we find a \nsolution today, most experts agree it will most likely require $1 \ntrillion. One trillion today or $10 trillion tomorrow--those are the \noptions.\n  The predicament could be somewhat more manageable if we didn't start \nseeing problems until Brittany and her classmates start retiring. No, \nthe looming crisis is coming much sooner than that. The Social Security \ntrustees have told us that beginning in the year 2018, a little more \nthan a decade from now, Social Security will begin paying out more in \nbenefits than it is currently taking in.\n  This means we will need to start dramatically raising taxes, taking \non massive loads of new debt, or accept severe benefit cuts in just 13 \nyears to cover our promise to retirees.\n  We cannot wait on the sidelines and let this problem come to us. We \nneed to face it and we need to attack it by putting all ideas on the \ntable. We need to stop the quibbling, the partisan games, and political \nbrinkmanship to find a solution that saves and strengthens Social \nSecurity for the future.\n  I ask my colleagues not to engage in futile bickering over individual \nideas that may be put forward by some as part of the larger solution. \nMy guess is, the solution will involve a number of ideas packaged \ntogether. Let's not dismiss or attack individual ideas as being \ninadequate before we have had a chance to assess their positive effect \nas part of a whole solution.\n  I remind my colleagues that we must put all the good ideas on the \ntable. My two elderly parents and my two young daughters are constant \nreminders of what is at stake in this debate. We must ensure that \ntoday's seniors' benefits are rock solid and find a solution that fixes \nSocial Security for the next generation that is just entering the \nworkforce. We need Senators on both sides of the aisle to think not \nonly\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nabout what is good politics, but what is good for their children and \ntheir grandchildren.\n  As this debate engages, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to listen \nto the voices of the people around the country and to understand that \nthey expect us to come here to solve problems. That is why they have \nelected us, not to kick it down the road, not to sweep it under the \ncarpet for another Congress and another President to deal with. If we \nwait, the cost will be much higher and the American people, the \ntaxpayers, will experience a much higher degree of pain. It is the \ntaxpayers who are ultimately going to have to bear the burden for the \nlack of responsibility demonstrated by the leaders of today if we \nchoose to do nothing.\n  I look forward to this debate as it gets underway. I urge my \ncolleagues to acknowledge what is clear, what is obvious: We have a \nproblem. The second thing that is clear and is obvious is that the \nAmerican people sent us here to solve problems. Let's not sweep it \nunder the carpet or kick it down the road; let's do the responsible \nthing and acknowledge this is a problem that needs to be fixed. The \nsolution will require bipartisan support in this Chamber and in the \nHouse of Representatives. We must work together to save and strengthen \nSocial Security not just for my father's generation but also for my \ndaughters' generation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign).

Mr. President, last week, the Treasury Secretary, Mr. \nSnow, testified before the Senate Budget Committee that high energy \nprices act like a tax on consumers. Given that, what the Bush \nadministration has called for is a huge tax on consumers throughout the \nPacific Northwest. I am talking specifically about their proposal to \nrequire that people in our region pay $2.5 billion more for energy in \nthe days ahead because this administration wants to extract money from \nthe Bonneville Power Administration's ratepayers above and beyond their \ncosts.\n  I am very troubled about this proposal, particularly because when \nEnergy Secretary Bodman came to my office, I asked specifically about \nthe administration's plan for Bonneville, and not just in the office, \nbut when he came to the Senate Energy Committee for his confirmation \nhearing. Both times I was assured by Secretary-designate Bodman that he \nopposed proposals to privatize Bonneville. The assurances were provided \njust a couple of weeks before the Bush administration's budget was \nreleased with the plans that do, in fact, privatize Bonneville, for all \npractical purposes, by going to a different rate structure that seeks \nto extract money from Bonneville beyond its costs.\n  When I met with Dr. Bodman in my office, he was accompanied by Clay \nSell, the White House energy adviser. I learned last night that Mr. \nSell was well aware of the discussions within the administration that \nled to the Bonneville privatization proposal at the time Dr. Bodman was \nassuring me that he opposed privatization. In that meeting, and at his \nhearing, Dr. Bodman assured me that as far as he knew, the \nadministration also opposed privatization. Clearly, that was not the \ncase. Mr. Sell has since been nominated to be Deputy Secretary of \nEnergy.\n  I have come to the floor today because the White House and the \nadministration need to get the message. They cannot impose these \ndevastating electricity rate increases on our region, first, without \nchanging the law and, second, without an understanding that I and other \nMembers from our region, Democrats and Republicans, will do everything \nwe possibly can to prevent this misguided proposal to take huge amounts \nof dollars from our ratepayers and taxpayers. We are going to do \neverything we can to keep that proposal from passing in the Senate.\n  Now, I am not, this morning, going to announce a hold on the \nappointment of Mr. Sell as Deputy Secretary of Energy. In accord with \nthe policy that I and Senator Grassley have led the Senate on over the \nyears, I do announce my holds publicly; and unless something changes, \nunless the administration drops this misguided concept--a concept that \nwould be so punitive on our region at a time when we have very high \nunemployment and a world of economic hurt throughout our region--unless \nthe administration drops their proposal, I will be forced to come back \nto this floor and have a public hold placed on the Sell nomination.\n  I remain very troubled by Mr. Sell's role in the discussions that \ntook place in my office and Dr. Bodman's testimony before the Energy \nCommittee when I was assured in both instances that there was \nopposition to privatization. I and other Members of the northwest \ncongressional delegation are simply not going to let a sign be put up \non the Pacific Northwest saying: Closed for business and energy tax \nhikes headed through the roof. This is too important to our area.\n  I am very hopeful that, working with colleagues--and I am \nparticularly interested in working with my good friend, the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Domenici--we can resolve this matter out so our \nregion will not be devastated economically.\n  Senator Domenici, to his credit, has raised concerns about this \nmisguided proposal to raise our energy prices in the Northwest. I \nintend to work closely with him, and I am very hopeful I will not have \nto come back to this floor and put a public hold on Mr. Sell's \nnomination to be Deputy Secretary of Energy. But if this is not worked \nout and it is not worked out quickly, I will have no other option \nbecause the ratepayers of our part of the world, at a time when they \nhave experienced enormous economic pain, deserve to know there is not \ngoing to be a huge additional rate hike imposed on them and one that \nwould do so much to cripple their hopes and aspirations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today because my friends in the \nMinnesota Republican Party have started a petition online urging me to \nsupport President Bush's proposal to strengthen Social Security. I want \nto take this opportunity to assure the people of Minnesota that I would \nlike to strengthen Social Security just as much as anyone else, and if \nPresident Bush or anyone presents a proposal that would actually \nstrengthen Social Security, would protect its ability to pay its \npromised benefits to present and future retirees and other \nbeneficiaries and also create opportunities to provide additional \nbenefits, I will certainly support it.\n  I have not yet seen a proposal, including that from the President, \nthat would improve upon the present system while continuing its current \nbenefits.\n  For all the President's fine talk about helping Social Security's \nfinancial future, his current fiscal policies, the ones that are in \neffect right now, are seriously hurting Social Security's future \nfinances and also weakening the financial strength of the entire \nFederal Government.\n  It is a mystery to me why the President is so alarmed by the crisis \nthat he says will occur when Social Security starts running deficits at \nvariously said times, such as 2018, 2028, or 2042, when the rest of the \nFederal Government's budget, everything else besides Social Security, \nis running enormous deficits for this year, last year, and for every \nyear projected in the future under his proposed budget.\n  Last year's on-budget deficit was $567 billion. A deficit of $588 \nbillion is expected for the current fiscal year, 2005, and almost $2.5 \ntrillion more in deficits are projected over the following 5 years \nunder the President's proposed budget. That is the real financial \ncrisis the\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nFederal Government is in right now, running huge operating deficits, by \nfar the worst in our Nation's history, requiring massive Federal \nborrowing to finance them, adding over $1 trillion to the national debt \nover the last 3 years, and another $2 trillion over the next 5 years, \nwith no end in sight.\n  No wonder the nonpartisan Concord Coalition, a Government watchdog \norganization founded by former New Hampshire Republican Senator Warren \nRudman and businessman Warren Buffett, has called the President's \nfiscal policies the most reckless in our Nation's history.\n  In fiscal year 2000, which is the last full fiscal year under \nPresident Clinton's terms in office, the Federal Government ran \nsurpluses in both its Social Security and on-budget funds. The Office \nof Management and Budget just a month after President Bush took office \nin 2001 projected surpluses in both of those major Government funds for \neach of the next 10 years. President Bush and the majority in Congress \nturned those surpluses into oceans of red ink by cutting taxes and \nincreasing spending in each of the last 4 years. We also had 9/11. We \nhave undertaken two wars. We went through a recession. There are \ncertainly other factors.\n  In the midst of those, cutting taxes excessively was a primary \ncontributor to these record deficits, and continuing those policies \nwill only extend those deficits into the future. Yet that is what is \nbeing proposed again for this year's budget, next year, and the next. \nIn fact, the proponents want to make future deficits even worse by \nmaking those previous tax cuts permanent, which would pile up trillions \nmore in public debt which must be paid off, with interest, by today's \nchildren, teenagers, and young workers, the very people President Bush \ntells us will not have Social Security when they retire.\n\n  Unfortunately, with his current policies they will not have a country \nwhen they retire. The so-called ownership society will be the owe-the-\nship society.\n  The second financial disaster that is happening in this country right \nnow is that Social Security's current surpluses are being spent to pay \nfor other Federal programs. Remember the Social Security lockbox that \nPresident Clinton established so Congress would not spend the annual \nSocial Security surpluses but, instead, would invest it in ways that \nwould truly strengthen the program for its future? Well, in 2000, \nPresidential candidate George W. Bush promised to protect that lockbox. \nGuess what. It is unlocked and it is empty.\n  Last year's $155 billion surplus is gone. The previous year's $160 \nbillion surplus is gone. This year's $162 billion surplus is going, and \nthe next 5 years' surpluses in the Social Security trust fund, which \nwould total over $1 trillion, will also be gone under the President's \nproposed budget. They are gone to cover and to help continue part of \nthose much larger deficits in the Federal Government's current \noperations. So that instead of cash or other investments, the Social \nSecurity trust fund is left with IOUs from the main Federal fund that \nborrowed them.\n  President Bush is correct when he says that when those IOUs must be \nrepaid with interest to enable Social Security to meet its future \nobligations some date in the future, those additional payments will \nrequire additional Federal revenues from either higher taxes, less \nspending, or more Federal borrowing. If the President is right, if \nSocial Security or even the entire Federal Government then faces a \ndrastic financial meltdown, a bankruptcy, because workers and \nbusinesses at that time cannot afford those additional tax burdens, so \nthe Federal Government cannot meet its obligations, whether to Social \nSecurity or to other Government programs and services, it will be a \ndisaster that his fiscal policies have created, and that Congress \nthrough support or complicity created and made even worse, more severe, \nby the current deficit spending which the President proposes to \ncontinue doing right now, while at the same time he is talking about \nSocial Security's long-term future.\n  As long as the current fiscal follies continue, whatever anyone says \nabout doing whatever to Social Security years from now, as \nShakespeare's McBeth said, is ``full of sound and fury, signifying \nnothing.''\n  All of these Senate speeches, all of those Presidential forums, all \nthe millions of dollars of industry advertising, all sound and fury, \nsignifies nothing, except signifying the financial greed that has \ndriven the current fiscal policy and the political cowardice that is \nallowing it to continue.\n  What is needed right now, as my sons would say, is to get real, to \nstop all the speeches, forums, and advertising about what might or \nmight not happen many years into the future and act on what is \nhappening right now. It is very damaging to our country right now, and \nit is even more damaging to our country's future unless we act right \nnow, this year, to stop it.\n\n  Acting right and acting now will take a lot of political courage. The \nPresident's budget shows a little but not nearly enough. It reduces \nspending by some $20 billion next year. That leaves another $560 \nbillion to go in order to balance the Federal operating budget and \nleave the Social Security surplus in its lockbox--in other words, just \nto restore us to the level of fiscal responsibility that President \nClinton left. That is a lot of political courage. It would require a \nmajor truth telling to the American people about how we got into this \nfiscal mess and how we are going to get out of it, starting right now, \nwith no gimmicks, no games, just straight, honest accounting to balance \nthe Federal budget without spending the Social Security money; to \nprotect Social Security's surpluses and use them only for Social \nSecurity; to stop borrowing for current spending and adding that to the \nincreasing national debt and then to start to pay down that debt.\n  If the President and the Congress are really serious about \nstrengthening Social Security's future, that is what we must do now, \nand that is the best that we can do now. Straightening out the current \nbudget mess and putting the Federal Government back on a responsible \nand sustainable course of balanced operating budgets and accumulating \nSocial Security surpluses is a real action plan. Everything else is \njust posturing and pretending. Because sound Federal fiscal policy now \ncontributes to future economic growth, it increases the likelihood that \nSocial Security, as it is currently structured, will be able to pay its \npromised benefits with future revenues and income for many decades to \ncome.\n  Because Social Security's financial future is not cast in stone, \nthere is nothing preordained that will happen at some future date. \nSocial Security's finances will depend upon the future growth in the \nU.S. economy. The Social Security trustees make this very clear in \ntheir annual report by making three long-range projections based on \ndifferent assumptions about the country's future economic growth. Their \nintermediate forecast is the one many people cite, incorrectly, as what \nwill happen to Social Security. That projection assumes that growth in \nthe U.S. economy over the next 75 years will be less than two-thirds of \nthe past 40 years.\n  In the last 40 years in this country, real GDP grew at 3.3 percent a \nyear. The trustees' intermediate forecast projects real GDP growth of \n2.9 percent from 2004 to 2013 but then only 1.8 percent from 2015 to \n2080.\n  Another one of the trustees' forecasts assumes real GDP growth of 3.4 \npercent per year over the next decade and then 2.6 percent per year \nfrom 2015 to 2080. That still is less on average than the 3.3 percent \nover the last 40 years. Yet with that rate of growth the Social \nSecurity trust fund's annual income is more than enough to pay for all \npromised benefits beyond the year 2080, the last year in the current \nreport.\n  Social Security, under that growth scenario, runs an annual surplus \nevery year into the indefinite future. In fact, in the last year in the \nprojection, 2080, it would have income of $4.2 trillion, make promised \npayments of $3.5 trillion, leaving a surplus in that one year of $700 \nbillion, which would add to its assets that would end that year at \nalmost $18 trillion. That is not bankruptcy, that is prosperity.\n\n  What we need to do right now to assure not just Social Security's \nfuture solvency but its future prosperity is to keep the U.S. economy \nhealthy and growing. The best help we can give to the future of Social \nSecurity is a sound fiscal policy right now of balanced operating \nbudgets and minimal Federal spending. On the other hand, the worst\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\nthat we could do to jeopardize Social Security's future solvency and to \nnecessitate the kind of drastic across-the-board cuts in future \nretirement benefits that are in the President's proposal is to continue \nthe current fiscal policy of deficits and more deficits, to continue \nthe proposal of making the tax cuts for the rich permanent, abolishing \nthe estate tax, cutting capital gains, eliminating or reducing the tax \non dividends, as if the rich are not rich enough already in this \ncountry and the superrich are not superrich enough. And, if the truth \nbe known, most of them already pay far less than their fair share in \ntaxes and many pay no U.S. taxes at all.\n  To continue the tax giveaway frenzies and the fiscal follies of the \nlast 4 years is to doom Social Security's future and this country's \neconomic future. To borrow more and more money from the rest of the \nworld and spend the Social Security surpluses so the rich don't have to \npay their share of taxes is, as the Concord Coalition said, ``reckless \nfiscal policy.'' It is also destructive social policy, and it is the \nwrong public policy--wrong for the future of Social Security and wrong \nfor the future of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past 10 years, VA has made \ntremendous strides in its delivery of health care. In fact, VA's \nquality of care currently surpasses that of the private sector, \naccording to several notable studies.\n  Though VA has been able to provide high-quality care despite less \nthan generous budgets, we cannot count on that holding true. Indeed, if \nthe administration's proposed cuts for VA care come to fruition, VA \nwill no doubt begin to lose its footing. The President's budget offers \na very modest increase for VA care--one that does not even cover \nmedical inflation.\n  Veterans groups are united in saying that the proposed budget is not \nsufficient. The Disabled American Veterans has called the \nAdministration's budget, ``one of the most tight-fisted, miserly \nbudgets in recent memory.'' The Paralyzed Veterans of America says that \nthis budget shortchanges America's ``sick and disabled veterans.''\n  The President's budget calls on VA to save some $600 million by \nsqueezing efficiencies out of the system. I have been to VA hospitals \nand clinics, and I can tell my colleagues that $600 million worth of \nefficiencies are not possible without cutting staff and services, the \nvery services that have made VA care excellent.\n  As many of my colleagues know, VA already obtains some of the best \nprices on pharmaceuticals. VA's costs are far below retail prices--in \nsome cases 55 percent of average prices. It is unfortunate that the \nadministration does not believe that Medicare's costs would be lowered \nif the Government could negotiate with drugmakers. VA has proven that \nit works. My point is that there really are not any more efficiencies \nto be gleaned from VA drug purchasing.\n  I will be working to increase the VA health care budget--to move from \nthe realm of miserly to what is truly needed to care for all veterans. \nIn the meantime, we should focus now on the tremendous advances VA has \nmade and do our best to maintain VA care at the highest levels.\n  One of these studies, done by RAND Corporation, found that VA \noutpaces private health care systems in delivering care to patients. \nAmong its findings, RAND found that VA patients were more likely to \nreceive recommended health services than those in a national sample of \npatients using a private provider. It also concluded that VA patients \nreceived consistently better care across the board, including \nscreening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.\n  Additionally, an article---which I highly command to my colleagues--\nin Washington Monthly titled ``The Best Care Anywhere'' explained at \nlength how, in just 10 years, VA hospitals went from less than \nexcellent care to the pinnacle of quality health care. Fostering the \nchange is the focus on new technology to reduce medical errors. Such \ncomputer systems allow clinicians to electronically pull up all medical \nrecords for any patient. Doctors are able to enter their orders into a \ncomputer system that immediately checks that order against the \npatient's records. If the software then detects a dangerous combination \nof medicines or a patient's allergy to the newly prescribed drug, a red \nflag goes up on screen. The technology also reminds doctors to \nprescribe appropriate care for veterans after they have been discharged \nfrom the hospital, and it keeps track of which patients are due for \nfollow-up services.\n  VA has made several other important strides in recent years, steps \nthat have been crucial to VA's assent to the top of the medical care \nfield. Until the mid-1990s, VA was considered by most to be in crisis. \nStarting in 1996, however, Congress forced VA to focus on primary care \nand outpatient services. This change, known as eligibility reform, led \nto improvement in care at VA. I am proud that we made those changes. \nVeterans are coming to VA like never before. Rather than closing the \ndoors--as the President is proposing--let us welcome all veterans into \nthe system.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I will work \nto ensure that VA continues to be a leader in health care by fighting \nfor additional funding. We must all work to guarantee that all of our \nNation's veterans get the care they so greatly deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the RAND study be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Improving Quality of Care--How the VA Outpaces Other Systems in \n                        Delivering Patient Care\n\n       In its 2001 report Crossing the Quality Chasm, the \n     Institute of Medicine called for systematic reform to address \n     shortfalls in U.S. health care quality. Recommended reforms \n     included developing medical informatics infrastructure, a \n     performance tracking system, and methods to ensure provider \n     and manager accountability. The Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA), the country's largest health care provider, has \n     been recognized as a leader in improving the quality of \n     health care. Beginning in the early 1990s, the VA established \n     system-wide quality improvement initiatives, many of which \n     model the changes the Institute of Medicine would later \n     recommend.\n       How does the VA measure up against other U.S. health care \n     providers? To address this question, RAND researchers \n     compared the medical records of VA patients with a national \n     sample and evaluated how effectively health care is delivered \n     to each group. Their findings:\n       VA patients received about two-thirds of the care \n     recommended by national standards, compared with about half \n     in the national sample.\n       Among chronic care patients, VA patients received about 70 \n     percent of recommended care, compared with about 60 percent \n     in the national sample.\n       For preventive care, the difference was greater: VA \n     patients received about 65 percent of recommended care, while \n     patients in the national sample received 20 percent less.\n       VA patients received consistently better care across the \n     board, including screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-\n     up.\n       Quality of care for acute conditions--a performance area \n     the VA did not measure--was similar for the two populations.\n       The greatest differences between the VA and the national \n     sample were for indicators where the VA was actively \n     measuring performance and for indicators related to those on \n     which performance was measured.\n\n\n                   va delivers higher quality of care\n\n       Using indicators from RAND's Quality Assessment Tools \n     system, RAND researchers analyzed the medical records of 596 \n     VA patients and 992 non-VA patients from across the country. \n     The patients were randomly selected males aged 35 and older. \n     Based on 294 health indicators in 15 categories of care, they \n     found that overall. VA patients were more likely than \n     patients in the national sample to receive recommended care. \n     In particular, the VA patients received significantly better \n     care for depression, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and \n     hypertension. The VA also performed consistently better \n     across the spectrum of care, including screening, diagnosis, \n     treatment, and follow-up. The only exception to the pattern \n     of better care in VA facilities was care for acute \n     conditions, for which the two samples were similar.\n\n\n                 va changes helped improve performance\n\n       The VA has been making significant strides in implementing \n     technologies and systems to improve care. Its sophisticated \n     electronic medical record system allows instant communication \n     among providers across the country and reminds providers of \n     patients' clinical needs. VA leadership has also established \n     a quality measurement program that holds regional managers \n     accountable for essential processes in preventive\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\n     care and in the management of common chronic conditions.\n\n\n            performance measurement plays an important role\n\n       How does performance measurement affect actual performance \n     in health care delivery? To answer this question, the \n     researchers conducted another analysis focused solely on the \n     health indicators that matched the performance measures used \n     by the VA. They found that VA patients had a substantially \n     greater chance of receiving the indicated care for these \n     health conditions than did patients in the national sample. \n     They also observed that performance measurement has a \n     ``spillover effect'' that influences care: VA patients were \n     more likely than patients in the national sample to receive \n     recommended care for conditions related to those on which \n     performance is measured. For example, VA outperformed the \n     national sample on administering influenza vaccinations, a \n     process on which the system tracks performance. However, it \n     also outpaced the national sample on other, related \n     immunization and preventive care processes that are not \n     measured. This provides strong evidence that, if one tracks \n     quality, it will improve not only in the area tracked but \n     overall as well.\n\n\n               these results have important implications\n\n       The implications of this study go far beyond differences in \n     quality of care between the VA and other health care systems. \n     The research shows that it is possible to improve quality of \n     care and that specific improvement initiatives play an \n     important role. First, health care leaders must embrace and \n     implement information technology systems that support \n     coordinated health care. Second, they should adopt monitoring \n     systems that measure performance and hold managers \n     accountable for providing recommended care. If other health \n     care providers followed the VA's lead, it would be a major \n     step toward improving the quality of care across the U.S. \n     health care system.\n\n     THE VA OUTPERFORMS THE NATIONAL SAMPLE ON NEARLY EVERY MEASURE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  National\n         Health indicator            VA score      sample     Difference\n                                                   score\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall..........................           67           51           16\nChronic care.....................           72           59           13\nChronic obstructive pulmonary               69           59           10\n disease.........................\nCoronary artery disease..........           73           70            3\nDepression.......................           80           62           18\nDiabetes.........................           70           57           13\nHyperlipidemia...................           64           53           11\nHypertension.....................           78           65           13\nOsteoarthritis...................           65           57            8\nPreventive care..................           64           44           20\nAcute care.......................           53           55           -2\nScreening........................           68           46           22\nDiagnosis........................           73           61           12\nTreatment........................           56           41           15\nFollow-up........................           72           58           14\nVA-targeted performance measures.           67           43           24\nVA-target-related performance               70           58           12\n measures........................\nMeasures unrelated to VA targets.           55           50            5\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business and \naddress the issue which has become central to our debate about the \ndomestic agenda for America. There is a lot of time being spent by the \nPresident and Members of Congress talking about the privatization of \nSocial Security. Social Security is a very important program for \nmillions of Americans. It brought dignity to senior citizens and gave \nthem a chance in their retirement years to live with enough money to \nget by.\n  Before Social Security, if a person were fortunate enough to save \nenough money during their lifetime, they were OK. If they happened to \nhave a generous family, the family would bring their mother and father \nto live with them in their later years. That was one of the outcomes. \nBut if things went poorly, a lot of senior citizens before Social \nSecurity ended up in county poorhouses. They are still sitting around \nout there. They are not used for that purpose anymore, but you can find \nthem across America. That is where you went when there was no place \nelse to go, no money to take care of yourself, and no children to take \ncare of you.\n  Along came Franklin Roosevelt back in the 1930s, who said: I think we \nhave learned a lesson here. We need to create a program that gives \neverybody a chance during their lifetime to pay into Social Security \nwith the guarantee that when you retire, there will always be some \nmoney there to help you. Nobody is going to get rich on Social \nSecurity. I don't think they ever could. But the idea was there would \nbe this thing they could count on, kind of a bedrock savings plan for \nAmericans--more of an insurance policy than a savings plan. It worked.\n\n  For the 60 years or more we have had Social Security, it has made \nevery single payment with cost-of-living adjustments, and seniors in \nAmerica, many of them, lead comfortable lives because Social Security \nhelps. You cannot live on it alone--I guess you could, but you would \nbarely scrape by--but with Social Security you have something to count \non.\n  You do not care if the corporation you worked for for 30 or 40 years \ngoes bankrupt and takes away your retirement benefits. You do not care \nin this respect: You know Social Security will still pay you. If you \nget bad news about that pension plan you invested in for a long time \ntaking a bad turn and not having enough money to pay you what you \nexpected, at least there is Social Security.\n  Over time, things change in America. We live longer. Thanks to good \nhealth habits, good medicine, people are living longer lives. A Social \nSecurity Program anticipated to pay out for a few years pays for many \nyears, so we have adjusted for many years. The amount of money paid \ninto it, the benefits paid out, and the eligibility age for retirement \nhave all changed, but Social Security is still there. It keeps on \nticking because we count on it so much.\n  Along comes President Bush who says we have a problem with Social \nSecurity. We have to do something. Some call it a crisis. Some call it \na challenge. Some call it a problem. But the argument is, we have to do \nsomething. You just cannot leave it alone.\n  What would happen if we left Social Security alone? What if Congress \nsaid: We are not going to do a thing to Social Security this year, \nnothing. We are not going to change one word in the law, not going to \nchange any of the benefits, any of the contributions, what would happen \nto Social Security? It would make every single promised payment to \nevery single retiree in America every single month of every single year \nwith a cost-of-living adjustment until at least 2042, 37 years from \nnow. The program is strong, and we have to talk about making it \nstronger.\n  The President proposes privatizing Social Security, changing the \nconcept of Social Security. Instead of paying payroll tax and receiving \nyour Social Security benefits, the President suggests taking part of \nthat payroll tax and investing it. If you are fortunate, you will do \nbetter. Your investment has risk, but the President believes by and \nlarge most people will do better.\n  There is nothing wrong with savings and investment. Everyone should \ntake that seriously for their own lives and for their families. We do \nin my household. For my wife and me, that is working, saving for \nretirement, for ourselves, for our family. It is a smart thing to do. \nBut what we do is over and above what we pay into Social Security. \nSocial Security is still there. Members of Congress pay it, \nincidentally. Despite some of the talk radio comments otherwise, \nMembers of Congress pay Social Security, as my wife does on her job. \nAnd we have some savings accounts. It is a smart thing to do. We have \ndone pretty well. We are not getting rich, but we will be comfortable.\n  Now comes the President and says take the money out of Social \nSecurity, put it in the stock market. The obvious question is, if you \ntake the money out of Social Security and out of the trust fund, how \nwill it make its payments?\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nThe President cannot answer that question.\n  There was a suggestion coming from the White House that we would \nchange the index for Social Security, we would reduce the amount of \npayments to seniors in years to come. That can get serious. Right now, \n1 out of 10 seniors is in poverty. Without Social Security, half of \nseniors in America would be classified as living in poverty. If we \nstart reducing Social Security payments, we move more and more of our \nseniors toward poverty. That is not an outcome that anyone would cheer. \nYet the President's plan moves America in that direction. It takes \nmoney out of Social Security with no explanation on how to pay it back, \nit cuts benefits for retirees in the years to come, and it creates a \ngreater deficit for America, a deficit increase of $1 trillion to $4 \ntrillion depending on how many years it is calculated.\n  We have to step back and say, if Social Security is strong for 37 \nyears, why in the world would you want to engage in the President's \nprivatization plan which will reduce benefits for retirees and add $2 \ntrillion or more to or national debt? It is because the President \ncannot answer those basic questions that many people are skeptical \nabout his privatization plan. They believe, I believe, President Bush's \nplan to privatize Social Security will weaken Social Security, it will \nnot strengthen it.\n  There is no one in the White House who suggests that taking money out \nof the Social Security trust fund makes it stronger. It makes it \nweaker. Instead of making every payment for 37 years, the President's \nplan would, frankly, make Social Security unable to make its payment \nsooner. Why would we ever do that? That is moving in the wrong \ndirection.\n  My colleague, Senator Schumer of New York, has put together a \ncalculator to help people estimate what the impact of privatization of \nSocial Security will do. Plug in what you think your income is going to \nbe, roughly, and this tells the kind of cuts you will take under \nPresident Bush's proposal. It is harsh. It is unnecessary. It certainly \ndoes not strengthen Social Security.\n  Let me add one footnote. Adding to our national debt means giving \nAmerica's mortgage holders, America's creditors, more power over our \nlives. Who owns America's debt today? Many do who buy bonds and \nsecurities in government, but most of it is owned by foreign countries. \nCentral banks in countries such as China and Japan buy our debt. So \nstep back and look at them as you would look at the company, the bank, \nthat issues your mortgage. You owe them that payment every month. You \nbetter make that payment. And if your mortgage comes to a close and \nthey do not want to renew your mortgage, go out and look for a new one, \nand you may have to pay higher interest rates. That is roughly what is \ngoing on in the world today.\n  America entices China, Japan, and Korea to be our mortgage holders, \nto be our creditors by paying interest on our debt. What happens should \nthe day come in the future when the Chinese or the Japanese say: We do \nnot really trust the American dollar; you people have too much debt. \nWhy aren't you doing something about your current debt? In fact, we \nhave lost so much confidence in the dollar, we think from now on, we \nare going to base our future on the Euro rather than the dollar.\n  Hold on tight, because it means that America's dollar is going to be \nthreatened in terms of its stability.\n  Here comes the President with Social Security privatization adding $2 \ntrillion to $4 trillion to our debt, depending more on China, Japan, \nand Korea to sustain us, making us more vulnerable.\n  There is another issue that troubles me. Why is it the countries you \nmention--China, Japan, and Korea--are the same countries that are \ntaking away American jobs and businesses? Why is it that companies are \nmoving over there? Sure, lower wage rates--we understand that. But \nthere is something else at work. The same countries that hold America's \ndebt hold the future of our economy. The fact they hold our debt gives \nthem the ability to invest in companies that compete with American \nworkers and businesses. The fact we are losing manufacturing jobs has a \nlot to do with our debt being held by the same countries taking those \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  Alan Greenspan came to Capitol Hill yesterday. Some days I think he \nhas great insight, and some days I think he is just plain wrong. I am \nsure he feels the same way about me and my views. Yesterday, he warned \nus about our debt. He said, though he liked privatization, personal \naccounts, be cautious, be careful, he said. Good advice--the same \nadvice I wish Mr. Greenspan had given when the President pushed for the \ntax cuts. Unfortunately, the tax cuts now account for half of our debt. \nThey go primarily to the wealthiest people in America. We are, \nunfortunately, in a spot where we are cutting back in health care, \ncutting back in education, unable to do what Americans think we should \ndo for America. Greenspan said yesterday, when it comes to debt, \nAmerica, be cautious. How can it be cautious to add $2 trillion to $4 \ntrillion to America's debt as President Bush's Social Security \nprivatization plan requires? It is not cautious. It is not sensible. It \ndoes not help this younger generation appreciate the greatness of \nAmerica.\n\n  I think the President's privatization plan has run into trouble \nbecause it cannot answer the hard questions. The President did not \ninclude one penny in his budget for privatizing Social Security. Do you \nknow why? He cannot figure out how to pay for it, and he cannot figure \nout how to explain it.\n  That is why not just seniors but families across America are \nskeptical. They take a look at what the President proposes, which will \nresult in reductions in Social Security benefits. For the average wage \nearner, born in 1970, who retires in 2035, there will be a 3-percent \nrisk adjusted rate of return on their personal account under the \nPresident. Under the current law benefits, that person would receive \nannually $17,700. Then along comes the President's proposal to change \nthe index for Social Security, and that payment goes down to $12,841. \nThen comes the privatization tax on top of that, and that same retiree \nwould receive less than half of what he would receive under Social \nSecurity today.\n  President Bush argues that this plan makes Social Security stronger. \nTell that to the retiree whose benefit has been cut in half by \nPresident Bush's proposal. You may say: Well, you Democrats, you are \ngoing to exaggerate this. You just want to get on the floor of the \nSenate and criticize the President.\n  Well, let me tell you where these numbers come from.\n  The Boston College Economics Department just did their own analysis. \nThey came to exactly the same conclusion. They are not in this for any \npolitical gain. They are just trying to analyze what the President \nproposed.\n  So if that is what we face--cutting benefits under Social Security, \nadding $2 trillion to $4 trillion to our national debt--is it any \nwonder a lot of us here say it is time to move on? It is time to find a \nSocial Security answer that is truly bipartisan and makes common sense. \nThe privatization plan of President Bush does not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, I rise today to join some of my friends on \nboth sides of the aisle to talk about and to do something about taking \naction regarding the Department of Agriculture's decision to open the \nborder to Canadian beef on March 7.\n  I have been vocal about this for some time. We have been negotiating \nwith the powers that be in trying to improve this controversial \nregulation.\n  First, I congratulate and appreciate Secretary Johanns of the \nDepartment of Agriculture for his candid responses on this issue and \nfor his timely decision to limit beef to cattle slaughtered at under 30 \nmonths. That action took care of most of the concerns I had with \nreopening the border since the outbreak of BSE in May of 2003.\n  We have all been trying to find answers to this situation, but my \nproducers still have some serious concerns about Canada's compliance \nwith the feed ban and the firewalls that have been put in place up \nthere. There has been a team representing the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture in Canada looking at this situation. The feed ban \ncompliance appears to be the best way to reduce outbreaks of BSE, so it \nis a critical component of our negotiations and it is a critical \ncomponent of what actions we take from here on.\n  Compliance with that feed ban must be consistent, but they also must \nbe long term. Because BSE, or mad cow, can lay dormant in a cow for \nsuch a long period of time, feed ban violations from years ago can \nstill be a problem today. Thus, the 30-month rule. Products from \nanimals or live animals older than 30 months was taken from the rule. \nWe had to work very hard to do that, and I know it took great \nleadership on the part of the Secretary of Agriculture to change that \npart of the rule.\n  Now the technical team we had in Canada is back in the United States. \nUnfortunately, we will not get their report for another week. Congress \nwill be on break. So very few of us will be able to get hold of that \nreport, analyze it, and make a judgment on how we should handle a rule \nthat goes into effect on March 7. It leaves us very little time. Thus, \nthe resolution that will come before this Congress puts a hold on the \nrule and gives Congress some time to operate. We just cannot afford to \nallow this situation to move any further with the information that we \nhave now. If the USDA will not delay the implementation of this rule \nand allow Congress to consider its findings, then I am left with no \nother choice but to support the disapproval resolution.\n\n  Again, I thank the Secretary for doing what he did. That took care of \na lot of the concerns about the rule. The decision is critical for our \ncattlemen, and the Secretary showed tremendous leadership in taking \nthat action so quickly.\n  It is also important to the entire cattle industry and it is \nimportant to consumers to have confidence in one of the safest products \nthey find in their grocery store. We know the border will be open at \nsome point, but what we do and the steps we take are very important, \nboth to our friends in Canada and to our consumers and producers in the \nUnited States.\n  If this rule should go into effect and we have another situation, I \nam afraid of the erosion that could take place in my industry. So I \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution, not as a means of \ncutting off trade with Canada indefinitely but as a way of ensuring \nthat Congress has the time and takes the time, all the time it needs, \nto consider the provisions of this rule. It is important for producer \nand consumer alike for this industry we call the great beef industry.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it gives me a great honor to comment on the \nresolution commending Howard Baker that we just addressed. I first met \nHoward Baker when I was considering the run for the U.S. Senate in \n1994. It is\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\nsurprising to me now, today, with our close friendship, that I had not \nmet him other than just in passing before. At the time, unlike Senator \nBaker, I had absolutely no political credentials whatsoever. Nobody \nfrom my family had run for public office, served in public office. But \nhe was kind enough to see me, a physician in Nashville, TN, and to \nlisten very patiently. I think a lot about it now, as people make \nappointments and come in to talk to me, even if they had absolutely no \nexperience in the political arena. Very quickly after that first \nmeeting he realized that the smart politician in my family was not me \nbut was my wife, so the very next meeting, it was me and Karyn sitting \nin his office.\n  Since then, I have had the real privilege and the honor of Senator \nBaker's friendship and his wise counsel, both as leader currently, \ntoday, and also as a U.S. Senator and then as a candidate. It is with \ngreat admiration that I rise to speak a few moments on his retirement \nfrom public service. I use that very advisedly, because Howard Baker \nwill never, ever retire from public service.\n  He has distinguished himself as one of America's most trusted and \nvalued public servants. A former U.S. Senator, minority leader, \nmajority leader, Republican Presidential candidate, Senator Baker has, \nas we all know, reached the pinnacles of political life, serving most \nrecently as America's Ambassador to Japan, a position reserved for our \nmost highly respected political figures, our statesmen.\n  Senator Baker turns 80 this year. He was born in 1925, on November \n15, in Huntsville, TN, near the Kentucky border, right where he lives \ntoday. His grandmother, Lillie ``Mother Ladd'' Mauser, was Tennessee's \nfirst female sheriff. His father and stepmother both served in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Yet despite this illustrious family history, as a young man Howard \njunior was not interested in a career in politics. After graduating \nfrom a military preparatory school in Chattanooga, he enrolled in the \nU.S. Navy, where he trained as an officer. He earned his bachelor's \ndegree in electrical engineering at Sewanee and Tulane. He then went on \nto law school at the University of Tennessee law school. During his \nsenior year, however, he saw that first glimpse, that first tantalizing \ntaste of winning elections as he served as student body president.\n  In 1950, Senator Baker ran his father's first successful bid for the \nU.S. Congress. Howard senior won a seat in the House, and Howard junior \nwon the hand of Joy Dirksen, the daughter of Illinois Senator Everett \nDirksen. For the next 16 years, he and Joy settled into life in \nHuntsville with their two children, Darek and Cynthia. Senator Baker \npracticed law and devoted his time to family, to church, and to a \nvariety of civic groups.\n  In 1964, Senator Baker decided to run in the special election for \nSenator Estes Kefauver's seat. He narrowly lost to Democrat Ross Bass \nbut came roaring back in 1966, to be elected with 56 percent of the \npopular vote, making him the first popularly elected Republican Senator \nin Tennessee's history.\n  He handily won reelection in 1972. That was at the height of \nWatergate, and Senator Baker was known on both sides of the aisle for \nbeing scrupulously fair and levelheaded. Within months, the Senator was \nnamed cochair of the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign \nActivities.\n  Initially, Senator Baker believed that President Nixon was innocent \nof any wrongdoing. Over the years, Senator Baker had become a friend \nand adviser to President Nixon. But as the investigation unfolded and \nthe evidence mounted, he became convinced of wrongdoing within the \nadministration, leading to his most famous questioning during the \ninvestigation: ``What did the President know, and when did the \nPresident know it?''\n\n  At Senator Baker's right hand during the investigation was our former \ncolleague and friend Fred Thompson and my late chief of staff Howard \nLiebengood. It was a grueling and intense ordeal for Senator Baker and \nthe country. But at its conclusion, Senator Baker had won the respect \nof millions of Americans.\n  In 1976, Senator Baker was chosen to be the keynote speaker at the \nRepublican Convention and was the next year voted by his colleagues to \nlead them in the Senate.\n  He won a third Senate term in 1978, and 2 years later made a bid for \nthe Republican Presidential nomination. He ran on a platform at the \ntime of restraining Government spending, balancing the budget, \nincreasing domestic energy production, and cutting taxes and excessive \nregulations--all positions that are very familiar 25 years later.\n  In 1980, Senator Baker became Senate majority leader, a post he held \nuntil his retirement in 1985.\n  He was a strong proponent of the citizen legislator, one who came to \nWashington, DC as a legislator for a period of time but returning home \nto be with real people and real communities all across the United \nStates. Indeed, that concept and that counsel and those conversations \nof a citizen legislator have had a huge impact on my life as well.\n  As majority leader, Senator Baker had a list of rules. He called them \nhis Baker's Dozen. The list included: Listen more than you speak; have \na genuine respect for differing points of view; tell the truth, whether \nyou have to or not; be patient; and be civil.\n  He expounded on his governing philosophy a few years ago during the \nLeader's Lecture series down the hall in the Old Senate Chamber. I \nwould like to quote a few of his words, as they apply as much today as \nthey did when Senator Baker led this great institution. He said that \n``the Founders didn't require a nation of supermen to make this \ngovernment and this country work, but only honorable men and women \nlaboring honestly and diligently and creatively in their public and \nprivate capacities.''\n  Always sensible, always decent, Senator Baker was a giant in this \ninstitution and deeply admired by his colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. It has been my great good fortune to have his example before me \nas I try to apply his insights on a daily basis.\n  Senator Baker is known and respected around the world. He has met \nheads of state, and advised American Presidents, but it is interesting \nbecause it is home where his heart still is. There is no place he would \nrather be than in Scott County, TN, surrounded by his friends, his \nfamily, his dogs, and taking in the view of what is called the New \nRiver--I would really say it is his new river--out the back of his \ncabin.\n  I remember one of my first visits--it may have been my first visit--\nto Scott County and to Huntsville, and to his home. Karyn and my three \nboys were with me. He said, Bill, you and Karyn look around. He took my \nthree boys back to his darkroom. We all know about his passionate love \nfor Photography. He patiently walked them through the process. That has \nbeen burned in their minds as they remember slowly watching pictures \ncome alive in the developing solutions. In fact, I remember one \nphotograph that day was of his soon to be bride Senator Nancy \nKassebaum. I was touched that he would take such time to spend with my \nboys talking about the art of photography, which is his favorite, and \nremains his favorite, avocation.\n\n  As a husband and father, I am grateful for the warmth and the caring \nhe has so generously shared with Karyn and me and our three boys, and \nas an American, I am deeply grateful for the service he has rendered in \nso many capacities to our country.\n  I have that opportunity every morning bright and early, indeed, \nwalking back and forth down this hall behind me every day, to enter the \nHoward H. Baker Suites, which is the Republican leader's office, and to \nwalk through those doors, seeing his portrait at the end of the first \nroom in those suites. We feel his influence every day, and we think \nabout it in everything we do.\n  Senator Baker understood that the Senate is like a family, not unlike \nhis hometown of Huntsville in Scott County. As he reminded us a few \nyears ago, ``What really makes the Senate work is an understanding of \nhuman nature, an appreciation of the hearts as well as the minds, the \nfrailties as well as the strengths, of one's colleagues and \nconstituents.''\n  Winner of the Medal of Freedom, our country's highest civilian award, \nhe set a standard of civility, courage, of goodwill and wisdom that \ncontinues to serve as an example for all to follow.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate and a grateful nation, I commend our \nformer\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\ncolleague the Honorable Howard Henry Baker, Jr., for a lifetime of \ndistinguished service to the country, and I wish him and Nancy \nKassebaum all the best in this new chapter of their life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I feel honored to be here today to \nsupport this resolution recognizing the lifetime achievements of my \ngood friend Howard Baker. Howard and I have been friends for a very \nlong time. We arrived in the Senate at about the same time. Howard was \nelected in 1966, and I was appointed in 1968. In 1977, Howard became \nminority leader. I was elected minority whip. We became leaders of the \nmajority in the Senate in 1981. Being part of the Senate leadership was \na new chapter in my life, and I was privileged to start out on that \npath with Howard Baker.\n  After the 1980 elections, we traveled together to the White House \nalmost every couple of weeks to meet with President Reagan. I cherish \nthose trips to the White House to this day. They remain some of my \nfavorite memories of the time I have spent here in the Senate.\n  Howard Baker is a great leader. He understands how to bring people \ntogether to accomplish great things. Those who were here during \nHoward's tenure, I am sure, remember his commitment to collegiality and \nfairness. It earned him tremendous respect among his colleagues in the \nSenate. He was a great choice for majority leader. All of us were \nhonored to serve with him.\n  In early 1984, I went to his office to discuss the future. Howard \nconvinced me I should plan to stay in the Senate. Later that year, \nhowever, Howard announced his own retirement. And, as we know, he later \nbecame President Reagan's Chief of Staff.\n  Catherine and I were sad when Howard lost his first wife, Joy. She \nwas a wonderful woman. We were glad when he and Nancy found each other. \nNancy, who is also a friend, served as a distinguished Senator here in \nher own right. She has been a great friend and partner for our friend \nHoward.\n\n  In 1989, the day before Catherine and I were married, Howard called \nto tell me he needed to go to China, but Joy was ill--she was in the \nhospital--and Howard could not leave. Deng Xiaoping had called, as \nleader of China, and wanted to understand what ``Reaganism'' meant. \nWhen Howard could not go on the trip which Ronald Reagan asked him to \ntake to answer that question, Howard dispatched me on that mission. \nAgain, it was a wonderful memory for me, and I appreciated that honor.\n  Catherine and I were married on December 30 and left for China on \nDecember 31. There was no time for a honeymoon. But we got on that \nplane to China at Howard's request, and we haven't stopped since. I am \nreminded of that every year now, and it has finally caught up with me. \nCatherine and I are scheduled to take that honeymoon this spring. So I \nam not allowed to call Howard to congratulate him because we cannot \nrisk being dispatched again to some foreign country.\n  Howard's time as Ambassador to Japan is only one chapter in the long \nand distinguished career the leader just talked about, a career that he \nspent serving the American people so well. Few men are more deserving \nof the honor of such a resolution, and Catherine and I wish our good \nfriend and his good lady great luck in their pursuits.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to cosponsor today's \nSenate resolution that honors my good friend and former colleague, \nSenator Howard Baker, for his lifetime of public service.\n  As the Senate Democratic leader from 1977 to 1980, I had the pleasure \nto work with Senator Baker, first when he served as the Senate minority \nleader. From the start, I found my leadership relations with Senator \nBaker to be excellent, and that never changed. Make no mistake, he was \na tough competitor, but he always remained amiable and friendly to work \nwith, in short, a gentleman in the true sense of the word. He was \nnecessarily partisan, but not overly so. I will never forget his \nextraordinary cooperation in obtaining consent for ratification of the \nPanama Canal Treaties. The legislative accomplishments of the 94th and \n95th Congresses were a testament to our cooperation.\n  My admiration for Senator Baker increased even more when he became \nmajority leader in 1981. He remained co-operative, friendly, and easy \nto work with. When I paid tribute to Senator Baker on the occasion of \nhis birthday in 1983, I stated that Senator Baker was ``the most \ncongenial and likable of all the majority leaders in my time here.'' \n``He is accommodating,'' I pointed out, and I marvel at his equanimity. \nHe takes everything in stride. He does not appear to be overwhelmed by \nthe power of his office. I recall quite clearly how all Senators, on \nboth sides of the aisle, liked Howard Baker and had a genuine fondness \nfor him.\n  One of my saddest days in the Senate came that same year when I \nlearned of Senator Baker's decision not to seek reelection. I expressed \nmy deep regrets, stating: ``Having worked with Howard Baker in the \nleadership in one fashion or another for a long period of time, I have \na real and a very deep admiration for him, and I have a warm glow of \nfriendship that has never ceased to burn brightly.'' I finished that \ntribute by reciting a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson, ``A Nation's \nStrength,'' as testament to my high regard for Senator Baker.\n  Since leaving the Senate, Senator Baker has gone on to serve our \ncountry in a number of other, important capacities, including Chief of \nStaff to President Ronald Reagan, a member of the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Board, and U.S. Ambassador to Japan.\n  Therefore, on this special occasion, when the Senate is honoring this \ngreat man for his service to our country, I wish once again to \nrecognize his service to our Nation.\n\n     God give us men!\n\n     A time like this demands strong minds,\n     great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie.\n\n     Men who can stand before a demagogue\n     And brave his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n\n     Tall men, sun--crowned;\n     Who live above the fog,\n     In public duty and in private thinking.\n     For while the rabble with its thumbworn creeds,\n     It's large professions and its little deeds,\n     mingles in selfish strife,\n     Lo! Freedom weeps!\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men!\n\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty;\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n     Men of dependable character;\n     Men of sterling worth;\n     Then wrongs will be redressed, and right will rule the earth.\n     God Give us Men!\n\n  6I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for giving me this \nopportunity. I am glad to join with the President pro tempore and the \nmajority leader in cosponsoring this resolution. I would like to add a \nfew words about Howard Baker.\n  When Howard Baker left for Japan, there was an enormous ceremony \nhosted by the President of the United States in the East Room. It was a \nsignal of the importance of our country's relationship with Japan. It \nwas a demonstration of the long list of distinguished United States \nAmbassadors to the country of Japan. It was a reminder of the \nimportance of the job Ambassador Baker would have at this listening \npost and action post in Asia.\n  Howard Baker's coming home deserves a little bit of fanfare, too. The \nrelationship between Japan and the United States has never been better. \nA good bit of that credit goes to President Bush and Prime Minister \nKoizumi for their close relationship, but Howard Baker had a lot to do \nwith it, too. His homecoming helps to bring to a close, as Senator \nStevens and Senator Frist have said, another chapter in one of the most \ndistinguished public careers in our country.\n  Howard Baker was a very successful Senator. There would not have been \na\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\nReagan Presidency, as we know it, without Howard Baker. I remember \nHoward Baker told me that when the tax cuts passed in the early 1980s, \nafter the Republican majority was elected, he, Senator Baker, the \nmajority leader, took the tax cuts and walked them over to the House of \nRepresentatives and handed them to Tip O'Neill. Then, of course, \nSenator Baker put his own Presidential aspirations aside a few years \nlater and served as Chief of Staff for President Reagan. I was living \nin Australia at the time, and I remember the relief the Australians had \nin 1987 hearing on the radio that Howard Baker was going to the White \nHouse to help straighten out some problems.\n\n  I saw him up close, and I have seen him up close for a long time. I \ncame here to this body in 1967, as his legislative assistant, 1 year \nbefore the President pro tempore became a Member of this Senate. Howard \nBaker was not a shy first-termer. We sat around in staff seats in the \nback of the Chamber and waited until he and Ted Kennedy, then another \nyoung Senator, took on Everett Dirksen and Sam Ervin on ``one man, one \nvote.'' The youngsters beat the oldsters on that vote.\n  He ran for leader twice, I think, in the first 6 years. In 1977, he \nchanged the name ``Minority Leader'' to ``Republican Leader'' on the \nwall out here. He began to talk about the second-best view in \nWashington being in the leader's office. And we knew he was thinking \nabout trying for the first-best view in Washington, which is from the \nWhite House.\n  When he accepted this post in Japan, at President Bush's request, \nsome people said to me: Why in the world would Howard Baker do that, \nwith all he has already done in his life? I was not one bit surprised \nthat he did. Howard Baker has always had the bit in his teeth. He has \ndone everything he has ever done with consummate skill.\n  He is the reason I am in public service today. We once said there was \na whole generation of us--former Senator Thompson, the late Howard \nLiebengood--a number of us who were a generation of people inspired by \nHoward Baker. Now there is a second generation, including our majority \nleader.\n  There really would not be a two-party system in Tennessee without \nHoward Baker.\n  We used to say the best thing about Howard was that when people saw \nhim on TV, he always made Tennesseans look good. We can now say that \nabout the country. When people see Howard Baker around the world, he \nmakes us Americans look even better. He represents the best of us.\n  We welcome him home just in time for his 80th birthday on November \n15, and just in time, I am quite confident, to prepare for another \nsparkling chapter in one of our country's most distinguished public \ncareers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this week marks the end of the career of a \ndedicated public servant. David Nexon will be leaving the staff of the \nHELP Committee after 22 years of remarkable service. He is the minority \nstaff director of the Health Subcommittee, and over the years he has \nably served the Senate and the Nation. Senators get the credit for \nsuccessful legislation, but the public does not see the many thousands \nof hours of work that staff put in crafting the final legislative work \nproduct.\n  David was instrumental, for example, in the passage of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program legislation, which brought health care to 6 \nmillion children. He was also deeply involved in the passage of \nlegislation which permits workers to maintain health insurance when \nthey change or lose their job. These are just two of the many ways \nwhere David's work has enriched the lives of millions of Americans. \nIndeed, the bill we pass today dealing with genetic nondiscrimination \nis just one more example of his imprint on this Nation's health care \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I spent 6 years on the Senate floor, and I got to know \nSenate staff really well, because sometimes they spend hours and \nsometimes days getting ready for legislation that comes to the Senate \nfloor. David is someone whom I got to know. When I saw him, I always \nknew Senator Kennedy was nearby, or would be here soon. Senator \nKennedy, of course, can speak for himself, but this man was invaluable \nto Senator Kennedy, the committee, and, I believe, the Senate and this \ncountry.\n  As David leaves the Senate, we thank him and his family for all of \nhis sacrifices. He is the epitome of what a public servant should be. I \nwish him well. I wish him the best of luck in his retirement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander).

Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will pass the \nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. When this legislation \nbecomes the law of the land, it will prevent health insurers from \ndenying coverage to healthy individuals, or charging higher premiums \nbased on genetic information. It will also prohibit employers from \nusing genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or \njob promotion decisions.\n  I thanked them earlier this morning, but once again I thank Senator \nOlympia Snowe, the lead sponsor of this legislation, and one of its \nleading champions over the years, as well as Senator Mike Enzi, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Judd Gregg. So many people have been involved over \nthe last 7 years on this legislation. I am gratified we are on the cusp \nof seeing it pass in the Senate and look forward to working with the \nHouse of Representatives to have it pass as soon as possible there, so \nwe can get it to the President of the United States.\n  I think it is a model demonstration of how we are leading today on \ntomorrow's problems, problems we know increase over time.\n  Just 2 years ego, the Human Genome Project completed the sequencing \nof the human genome one year ahead of schedule. With this historic \nachievement, the pace of scientific discovery has accelerated. The \ncoming years will bring a wave of new genetics-based treatments and \nmore powerful predictive tests for maladies like cancer, Alzheimer's, \nand heart disease.\n  Late last year, for example, the FDA approved a new test that helps \ndoctors determine the most effective medications for treating a \nparticular patient's case of everything from heart disease to cancer. \nOther new measures can detect genes that can spare women with breast \ncancer the need to undergo chemotherapy and affect an individual's \nchances of developing lung cancer. When science detects these genetic \nsequences, doctors and patients can do a great deal to preempt and \nprevent the conditions they can cause.\n  However, the information might also be used to harm. If people run a \nrisk of losing jobs, promotions, or insurance policies on the basis of \ntheir genes, many will avoid getting tested and learning about them.\n  By acting now, we are averting widespread discrimination before it \nhappens--before health insurers are tempted to use powerful new gene \ntechnology to decide who gets coverage and who does not.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Genetics Information Non-\nDiscrimination Act.\n  Congess should be forward thinking in the policies we set, instead of \nwaiting until catastrophe looms. This is not a political or partisan \nissue. It is a matter of civil rights.\n  In the past, Congress has acted to protect the civil rights of its \ncitizens, most notably through the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, and the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act.\n  Today, we take another critical step forward to protect individuals \nfrom the threat of discrimination based on their genes by building on \nthose time-tested laws. The Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act \nis comprehensive, reasonable and fair. It is both practical and \nforward-looking.\n  Once again, I want to recognize the leadership of Senator Snowe and \nSenator Enzi and the broad bipartisan coalition that has finally \nbrought us to this day. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe House to send this to the President' desk for his signature.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to say \nanything quickly?\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have supported the \n``Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005,'' a bill that will \nprohibit discrimination based on genetic information with respect to \nemployment and health insurance. This bill represents much cooperation \non the part of my colleagues, and I want to thank them for all the hard \nwork done on this important issue.\n  I am extremely pleased with today's passage of the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act as it marks a great milestone for \nthose of us involved in the Human Genome Project. It seems only a short \ntime ago that the Human Genome Project was created as a joint effort \nbetween the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health. \nWhat progress we have made.\n  In the last 2 years, there have been many events celebrating the \ncompletion of maps of the human genome. The genome map has brought a \npromise of improved health through revolutionary new treatments for \nillness and disease. The ultimate result of mapping the human genome is \na complete genetic blueprint, a blueprint containing the most personal \nand most private information that any human being can have. We will now \nhave a wealth of knowledge of how our countless individual traits are \ndetermined. And perhaps more important, we will have fundamental \nknowledge about the genes that can cause sickness and sometimes even \ndeath.\n  Our personal and unique genetic information is the essence of our \nindividuality. Our genetic blueprint is unique in each of us. However, \nas genetic testing becomes a more frequently used tool, we now must \nbegin to address the ethical and legal issues regarding discrimination \non the basis of genetic information. Questions regarding privacy and \nconfidentiality, ownership and control, and consent for disclosure and \nuse of genetic information need to be carefully considered.\n  An unintended consequence of this new scientific revolution is the \nabuses that have arisen as a result of our gathering genetic \ninformation. Healthy people are being denied employment or health \ninsurance because of their genetic information. By addressing the issue \nof nondiscrimination, we are affirming the right of an individual to \nhave a measure of control over his or her personal genetic information.\n  Genetic information only indicates a potential susceptibility to \nfuture illness. In fact, many individuals identified as having a \nhereditary condition are, indeed, healthy. Some people who test \npositive for genetic mutations associated with certain conditions may \nnever develop those conditions at all. Genetic information does not \nnecessarily diagnose disease. Yet many people in our society have been \ndiscriminated against because other people had access to information \nabout their genes, and made determinations based on this information \nthat the individual was too risky to ensure or unsafe to employ.\n  While the issue is complex, our objective is clear; people should be \nencouraged to seek genetic services and they should not fear its \ndiscriminatory use or disclosure. The Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act is an important first step toward protecting \naccess for all Americans to employment and health services regardless \nof their genetic inheritance. There is simply no place in the health \ninsurance or employment sector for discrimination based solely upon \ngenetic information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1595-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1595-S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the promise of genomics.\n  ``Dazzling thrilling astonishing breathtaking''. Even for a group \ngiven to hyperbolic speech, the language my\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\ncolleagues used in this Chamber 2 years ago to describe advances in \nhuman genetics is both extraordinarily intense and factually accurate. \nLittle has changed since 2003. Indeed, little has changed in the 9 \nyears we have been considering this legislation. What remains the same \nis that the tremendous promise of this fundamental scientific advance \nremains incompletely realized. I am truly concerned that, at the very \ntime in healthcare that we need innovation the most, we tacitly accept \nlimitations on the application of this ``tremendously powerful tool.''\n  It is vital to understand that we have hurtled forward, over a \nremarkably short period of time, into an entirely new era of medical \npractice, one the majority leader believes will be characterized by \n``advances . . . more dramatic than any . . . I had the opportunity to \n. . . participate in over twenty years in . . . medicine''. Barely 50 \nyears ago, Drs. James Watson and Francis Crick completed the work begun \nby the 19th century Austrian monk, Gregor Mendel, when they discovered \nthe double-helix structure of DNA, the substance of which genes are \ncomposed. Four nucleotides, a simple combination of phosphate, nucleic \nacids and sugar, are arranged in an infinite variety of pairs within \ngenes that, in turn, are distributed amongst the 46 chromosomes, which \nconstitute the normal human genome. Operating according to the \ninstructions contained in the DNA, cells in the body produce proteins \nthat control the expression of our individual heredity, e.g. color of \nhair and eyes, and determine, in part, whether we will be sick or well.\n  Hardly 2 years ago, Dr. Francis Collins and colleagues at the NIH \nNational Human Genome Research Institute completed mapping of the human \ngenome, determining the exact location of the 3.1 billion base pairs \nthat constitute our ``blueprint of life''. It is encouraging to note \nthat, in an era where government programs are beginning to receive the \nscrutiny the public deserves regarding results, this program completed \nits Herculean task 2 years ahead of schedule. As representatives of the \npeople, we now have the opportunity and the responsibility to help \nscientists and clinicians bring this basic research forward to the \nhospital, the clinic, even to our very workplaces and homes. There are \nmany, both sick and well, who are counting on us to help put that \nblueprint to use.\n  How does the science of genetics, simple and straightforward as it \nmay be to the experts, translate into something with meaning to those \noutside the scientific community: the Congress; and the citizens whom \nwe represent? In particular, why should the rancher in Cody or small \nbusinessman in Gillette care? I can think of three ways.\n  First, our Declaration of Independence states that we are ``endowed \nby our Creator with . . . unalienable rights (including) life, liberty \nand the pursuit of happiness''. Clearly, the state of our health can \ndetermine how successfully we exercise at least two of those rights. \nFor example, patient care can be much more individualized if it is \nbased on an understanding of the human genome. Current medical practice \napplies the results from studies obtained in groups of patients to the \ntreatment of the individual; within each group, however, there are \npatients who respond better or worse to the therapy offered, compared \nto the response of the group as a whole. The former may be undertreated \nby standard therapy--they could recover faster or more completely, \nwhile the latter may be overtreated--developing complications of \ntherapy that may prove worse than the disease itself. Providers need a \nway to predict what an individual's response to treatment is likely to \nbe so that a particular course of therapy can be modified intelligently \nand expeditiously. That flexibility in treatment, guided by an \nunderstanding of the patient's unique, genetically determined response, \nshould result in better outcomes. Even today, oncologists are treating \ncancer patients with protocols that take into account genetically \ndetermined differences in how individuals absorb, metabolize and \nexcrete drugs. Drug therapy for other diseases should show similar, \nclinically relevant variability. Similarly, cardiologists caring for \npatients with hereditary long QT-interval syndrome, a disturbance in \nheart rhythm that can lead to sudden death in healthy young people \nduring exercise, are beginning to use genetic testing to help select \npatients for treatment or observation and to choose amongst the \ntherapeutic options available--lifestyle changes, drug therapy and \nsurgery--the ones most likely to be of benefit.\n  Second, we recognize, based on long experience, that prevention is \nbetter than cure, both for the individual and for society as a whole. \nEarly identification of a genetic predisposition to develop a specific \ndisease can be crucial to an effective intervention, one that, quite \noften, will be less costly, too. For example, cystic fibrosis--an \ninherited disease producing life-threatening digestive and respiratory \nsymptoms--is the most common, recessively inherited condition \nafflicting white American children. Scientists have identified over 700 \ngenetic variations of cystic fibrosis, some of which help to define the \nclinical manifestations of the disease. Treatment programs for cystic \nfibrosis that emphasize preventive therapies are associated with the \nbest outcomes. Early identification of those at risk and more precise \ncharacterization of what those risks will be facilitates a more \nproductive program of monitoring, more aggressive preventive care and \nfocused treatment. Likewise, sickle cell anemia, an inherited \nabnormality in the production of hemoglobin, the molecule in the blood \nthat carries oxygen to the cells, is prevalent in African Americans. \nSickle cell disease, the most severe variant of this condition, carries \na significantly increased risk of disability and early death through a \nvariety of infectious and thrombotic complications. Changes in \nlifestyle and compliance with regimens of preventive care, e.g. \nprophylactic antibiotic therapy, are easier for affected individuals to \ntolerate if they believe that the risks and benefits really apply to \nthem.\n  Some might argue that diseases like these, though unquestionably \nworthy of public attention, represent a lesser national priority when \ncompared to the other health care needs. In addition, other pressing \ndomestic and international concerns--deficit reduction and national \nsecurity--figure prominently, as they should, in the national debate. \nWyoming has relatively few citizens at risk for some of the diseases I \nhighlighted today, so most citizens of my state might, understandably, \nfocus their thoughts elsewhere.\n  I think there are two reasons why they don't. The people of Wyoming \ntake appropriate responsibility for one another's well-being. They lend \na hand whenever help is necessary, not in the expectation that to do so \nwill be of direct benefit to them, but because it is, simply, the right \nthing to do. There is a direct benefit, however, to be realized. Full \nimplementation of the results of the human genome project will have a \nrevolutionary impact on diseases that are of concern to all of us, in \nWyoming and across the United States, regardless of our age, gender, or \nethnicity. Already, experts recognize the practical and the potential \napplications of genetic research to the diagnosis and treatment of \ncancer--e.g., breast, colorectal and ovarian--heart disease, \ndegenerative neurological disease--e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's--\ndiabetes, and asthma. No longer is it science fiction to anticipate \nthat primary healthcare providers will, by combining environmental risk \nassessment and education with genetic evaluation, be able to develop, \nimplement and monitor a comprehensive, life-long health plan that \nmaximizes wellness.\n  Third, and, perhaps, most important of all, Americans must recognize \nthat they have a civic responsibility not only to care for their own \nhealth, but to participate in the research yet to come that moves the \nscience of healthcare forward for everyone. Those of us, including \nmyself, who have contributed to this discussion over the last 9 years \nhave all noted the remarkable ``explosion of knowledge'' and the \n``great strides'' in healthcare that have resulted from research \nalready performed. More importantly, though, we recognize that, while \nthe science of human genomics has ushered in a new era of vast \npotential, that promise has not yet been fully realized. There is much \nthat remains to be done to ``unleash the power'' of this science to \nchange permanently the practice of healthcare for the better. Clinical \ntrials are still necessary, to validate\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nreasonable hypotheses and to determine where innovations should fit \ninto practice. Once integrated, the actual effect of these innovations \nmust be accurately and precisely assessed, recognizing that experience \nis the great teacher. We must work to foster a culture of enlightened \nself-interest in the American people, underscoring their altruistic \nmotivation to do what's right. Finally, we have a responsibility to \nencourage our fellow citizens to participate fully in their own \nhealthcare by working with their providers to incorporate advances in \nscience into their personal health plans as quickly as possible.\n  Inherent in discharging this responsibility is the need to remove \nbarriers to action. Thomas Jefferson said, ``Laws and institutions must \ngo hand in hand with the progress of the human mind.'' No better \nexample of this truism exists than the challenge we face in fulfilling, \ncompletely, the promise of the genomic revolution. Our objective is \nclear: to encourage people to seek genetic services, and to participate \nin essential genetic research, by reducing fears about misuse or \nunwarranted disclosure of genetic information.\n  I applaud my colleagues in voting for the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act of 2005.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson).

Mr. President, getting a good deal for our senior citizens \non prescription medicines is too important for word games. In the \npublic debate over the prescription drug benefit, it is regrettable, \nbecause the administration seems to be confusing the matter of \nnegotiation to get the seniors a good price with what constitutes price \ncontrols. This afternoon I would like to set the record straight.\n  First, I want to be clear: I am against price controls for this \nprogram. I am not in favor of mandating prices. I am against the whole \nconcept. But what I have been talking about over the past 3 years, \nparticularly with the bipartisan legislation I have with Senator Snowe, \nis negotiating, which has Medicare sitting down and negotiating for the \nmillions of older people who are going to be relying on this benefit in \nthe years ahead.\n  If anybody is not sure what negotiating is, if anybody can't tell the \ndifference between negotiation and price controls, I want to be \nspecific about what constitutes negotiation. First, with negotiation, \nyou simply sit down at the table. You say to the people you are \nnegotiating with: I am one of your best customers. And third, you say: \nSo, buddy, what are you going to do for me. And this, of course, is \nwhat goes on in the private sector in Minnesota, in Oregon, in Florida, \nevery part of the country.\n  To tell the truth, I guess I have more faith in the folks over at \nMedicare than they do in themselves, because I noted that the Medicare \nchief actuary said yesterday this kind of negotiating power isn't going \nto do anything, isn't going to produce any savings, and talked about \nhow this was going to lead to price controls and that sort of thing.\n  I happen to think that Medicare, through their talented folks, does \nhave the ability to negotiate better prices, as does the private \nsector. But if they don't think they do, they can bring in some \nnegotiators who make sure that the older people do get a good deal.\n  The story that has been trotted out in the last 24 hours is about \nprevious and fruitless negotiations for other drugs. Cancer drugs have \nbeen cited, for example. I think that is comparing apples to oranges. \nThere wasn't any negotiation in the past. Medicare paid up. Medicare \npaid up, and that was the end of it.\n  What I hope the Senate will see is that there is a real distinction \nbetween the kind of bargaining power Senator Snowe and I want to see \nthis program have at a critical juncture and the notion of price \ncontrols, which we do not support and oppose strongly.\n  It comes down to whether the Senate wants Medicare to be a smart \nshopper. I have said that Medicare purchasing of prescription drugs is \nlike the fellow in Price Club buying toilet paper one roll at a time. \nNobody would go out and do their shopping that way. Yet that is \nessentially what the country faces, if there are no changes at all.\n  One other point on this issue is also worth noting. Yesterday \nSecretary Leavitt came to the Finance Committee and was asked by me and \nSenator Snowe and others about this question of how to contain costs \nfor prescription drugs. The Secretary said he was hopeful that in July \nand August Senators and Members of Congress and others would go home \nand make the case to constituents this was a good program and that \nolder people and their families would sign up for the benefit. I said \nto the Secretary during the course of questioning, as somebody who \nvoted for the benefit, I hoped that was the case, that folks would sign \nup, but that the big barrier to older people signing up is they were \nskeptical that the costs would be restrained. Older people were \nconcerned about the costs of medicine in Georgia and Oregon and \neverywhere else.\n\n  The Secretary's comment was: Well, there are going to be plenty of \nprivate plans, and the private plans are going to hold the costs down.\n  My response was, I certainly hope that is the case. That was one of \nthe reasons I felt it was important to get started with the program and \nwhy I voted for it. But I pointed out to the Secretary that may be the \nideal, but what would be done in areas where there weren't a number of \nprivate plans and the opportunity to hold the costs down. That will \ncertainly be the case in areas where there are what are called fallback \nplans. My guess is in rural Georgia and rural Oregon, we are going to \nsee a number of those fallback plans because those are communities \nwhere you are not going to see multiple choices for the seniors. You \nwill be lucky to have one plan, if there is to be any coverage for the \nolder people.\n  What Senator Snowe and I have said is that at a minimum, let's make \nsure in those areas where the older people don't have any bargaining \npower, it is possible for the Government to step in and make sure \nseniors and taxpayers can get the best possible deal on medicine.\n  In effect, what Senator Snowe and I have been talking about is the \nposition of Mr. Leavitt's predecessor, Secretary Thompson. At Secretary \nThompson's last press conference he said, almost verbatim, that he \nwished the Congress had given him the power Senator Snowe and I believe \nis important for this program.\n  In saying so, the Secretary made it clear, also, he was not for price \ncontrols; he wasn't interested in a one-size-fits-all approach to \ncontaining costs. He simply made clear that if it is apparent in a \ncommunity that the older people won't have any bargaining power at all \nbecause choices are limited, the Secretary wanted essentially a kind of \nfallback authority, which would mean the Government at that point could \nmake sure the older people and taxpayers were in a position to have \nsome leverage in the marketplace.\n  I asked the Secretary why he disagreed with his predecessor. I asked \nspecifically: Why do you see it differently than Secretary Thompson? \nEssentially, he said he simply believes in the marketplace, and there \nare going to be lots of choices. I hope he is right. I know he is \ncertainly sincere in his views.\n  What I am concerned about is, I think it is going to be very hard for \nthe Senator from Georgia and other colleagues to go home in July and \nAugust and get the older people to sign up for this program if they \ndon't see this body is taking additional bipartisan steps to control \ncosts. The older people are reading the newspaper and walking into \ntheir pharmacies, and they are seeing what is going on.\n  Regrettably, the cost of the program has continued to go up. We can \ndebate how much it has gone up. I am not interested in some kind of \npartisan wrangle on it. But the cost of the benefit has gone up. And \nthe number of seniors who have signed up for the first part of the \nbenefit was really very low. So what this has created is a situation \nfor\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\nthe prescription drug benefit, where there is a real likelihood that a \nhuge amount of Government money will be spent on a very small number of \npeople. That is not a prescription for the survival of the program. \nCertainly, as somebody who voted for the program, I want to see it \nsurvive. So I will keep up my end of the bargain. I will keep working \non a bipartisan basis.\n  I want to express my continued interest in working with the Bush \nadministration to save this prescription drug benefit that we worked so \nhard to get off the ground. We need to have an honest conversation \nabout how to do it. I don't think that conversation is helped by this \nconfusion about what is the difference between negotiating--which I and \nSenator Smith and Senator Snowe have advocated--what goes on in the \nprivate sector and what constitutes price controls. Senator Snowe and I \nwant to be for what goes on in the private sector. We are against price \ncontrols.\n  This will certainly not be the last time this topic is discussed on \nthe floor of the Senate. It certainly won't be the last time that I \ndiscuss it. I am glad to have the chance to take a few minutes to set \nthe record straight because I think there was needless confusion on \nthis point in the last 24 hours. I think the remarks of the Medicare \nchief actuary were unfortunate. I guess I have more faith in the folks \nat Medicare to be able to negotiate good deals than they apparently do \nin themselves. I simply urge that there be a continued focus on this \nprogram during this crucial month, where it is going to be important to \nget older people to sign up. The key to getting them to sign up will be \nto hold down the cost.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, my first statement refers to first \nresponders and the tremendous progress made over the last several years \nin addressing responses to emergencies of all types. On Tuesday, the \ndirector of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency came to \nWashington to brief me and the entire Tennessee delegation on our \nState's homeland security needs. It was fitting, I was thinking at the \ntime, for him to be here on the day that we voted on the nomination of \nJudge Michael Chertoff.\n  It has been 3\\1/2\\ years since we were attacked on September 11. \nSince then we have taken significant steps to strengthen and improve in \nso many ways our homeland security, from information and technology to \ntraining and to overall preparedness. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity was established in March of 2003 and has been central in \noverseeing and coordinating all of these efforts. It is a huge job. I \napplaud Secretary Tom Ridge for his skillful leadership during those \nvery uncertain times.\n  Since the September 11 tragedy, we have taken a number of steps. We \nhardened cockpit doors on 100 percent of large passenger aircraft; 100 \npercent of all baggage is screened. We have deployed thousands of \nFederal air marshals and professionally trained screeners at our ports. \nWe now screen 100 percent of high-risk cargo. We have also launched the \nUS VISIT system which creates a database of pictures and finger scans \nof everyone entering the United States with a nonimmigrant visa. All of \nthese preventive measures, along with many others, are indeed making \nAmerica safer and more secure.\n\n  September 11 taught us that the front lines of a catastrophic terror \nattack are not here or in policy but are local, in communities all \nacross this country. It is the folks in our fire departments, in our \npolice stations, in our emergency rooms, and in the volunteer corps. It \nis the brave men and women who rush to an attack site with almost \nsuperhuman stamina and compassion, working to save their fellow \ncitizens.\n  I am reminded of the Memphis and Shelby County Urban Search and \nRescue Task Force that traveled to Washington to help at the Pentagon \nafter September 11. All airplanes were shut down. The team loaded two \ntractor trailers, three buses, and a few cars, and drove all through \nthe night from Tennessee until they arrived early in the morning of \nSeptember 12th. It was a team of firefighters, doctors, nurses, \ncomputer technicians, and rescue dog handlers who worked 12-hour \nbackbreaking shifts every day for days--believe it was a total of 8 \ndays--to help secure the Pentagon's structure and save lives.\n\n  Two or three days after September 11, I had the opportunity to go and \nvisit with this rescue task force and to thank them. I remember vividly \nthe day, with the large American flag still on the debris of the \nPentagon behind the setup of the task force, and that large Tennessee \nflag. At that time, all I could say was: Thank you for being on the \nfront line, for responding so immediately, for leaving the comfort of \nyour own homes to volunteer to respond. Like so many brave and \ncommitted first responders from around the country, their assistance \nwas invaluable.\n  Tennessee received $32.4 million for fiscal year 2004 and $32.6 \nmillion for fiscal year 2005 to continue training and strengthening our \nfirst responders and local capabilities.\n  This month, fire departments across the State were awarded grants to \npromote fire safety and prevention. Meanwhile, Tennessee has \nestablished 26 Citizen Corps Councils to help coordinate emergency \nvolunteers. As we learned on 9/11, we are all in this together.\n  Another area that must be addressed is our biohazard preparedness. We \nknow that at least 11, and as many as 17, nations already have \noffensive biological weapons programs--at least 11 nations. Experts \nbelieve these countries' arsenals are stocked with agents that could be \ndevastating as weapons. The United States must be prepared for the \neventuality of another bioterror attack. That is why in the last \nCongress we passed Project Bioshield, which authorizes $5.6 billion \nover 10 years for the development of vaccines and a whole range of \nother countermeasures against potential biological attacks. Such \npotential attacks could include those of smallpox, anthrax, and \nbotulism toxin, as well as other dangerous pathogens such as Ebola and \nplague.\n  This sort of legislation shows us leading on the challenges of \ntomorrow. These are proactive pieces of legislation that are \npreventive, that make us safer and more secure. This legislation will \nhelp ensure that our public health agencies focus, in a deliberate and \ncomprehensive way, on developing drugs and countermeasures and vaccines \nand devices whether it is against a biological attack or chemical \nattack or radiological attack or an attack by nuclear agents or dirty \nbombs.\n  This year, we hope to build on these measures with another bioshield \nact which is designed to better protect and strengthen our domestic \npublic health infrastructure. Specifically, this legislation improves \nthe availability and accessibility of vaccines. It strengthens our \ncapacity to respond efficiently in the event of a public health \nemergency. And it gets more first responders into the field by offering \nloan repayments in return for service at the FDA, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nCDC, or the National Institutes of Health, or other public health \nagencies.\n  Well, there is much to do to make America safer and more secure, from \nthe war on terror, to strengthening the homeland. Next week, I will be \nreturning to my State, as most of our colleagues will be doing during \nthis period of recess, and attending a conference in Tennessee on a \nstudy of what our current plans are and to also explore ways in which \nwe can maximize our efforts. It is hard to plan when we do not know \nwhat might be next. That is why we must be ever vigilant and ever \ncreative in securing ourselves from attack. From our Federal officials, \nto our local volunteers, protecting the homeland is everyone's duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1598-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1598-S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE SENATE AND LOOKING AHEAD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, before wrapping up, I will look back, very\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nbriefly--which I tend to do right before we go into a recess--and also \nlook forward, very briefly.\n  Let me summarize the last 3 weeks as being gratifyingly productive. I \nsay that because last Thursday, by a vote of 72 to 26, the Senate \npassed the Class Action Fairness Act. The process was bipartisan \nthroughout. It was a great legislative victory for the Senate and, \nsubsequently, for the House of Representatives, which passed the bill \ntoday. Soon the President will sign this very important issue that \naddresses lawsuit abuses.\n  Senator Grassley, who was the lead sponsor of the bill, had been \nworking on class action reform for over a decade. Last week, we finally \ndelivered. I commend my colleagues for their fairness and their \ncooperation.\n  I applaud also Senator Arlen Specter, who has not been with us the \nlast couple of days, but I talked to him a few minutes ago, and he is \ndoing very well. I applaud him for his leadership because it was \nthrough his committee, the Judiciary Committee, that class action was \nfirst addressed and brought to the floor, again, with a bipartisan \nvote, and ultimately passed. I thank Senator Specter for his tremendous \nleadership.\n  Building on the momentum of the class action bill, we passed the \nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination Act today, not too long ago, with \na vote of 98 to 0. I once again thank Senator Olympia Snowe, who was \nthe lead sponsor of that legislation and has been one of its leading \nchampions for many years. It was a bipartisan piece of legislation, \nobviously, with a vote of 98 to 0.\n\n  On the other side of the aisle, Senator Kennedy, and on our side of \nthe aisle, Senator Gregg and Senator Mike Enzi--all of them have been \nthanked over the course of the day. I thank them. And I thank the \nDemocratic leader, as well, Senator Reid, for facilitating passage of \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  When this bill becomes the law of the land, it will prevent health \ninsurers from what can be very tempting for an unscrupulous health \ninsurer, and that would be to reach down and grab information that is \nimportant to a patient but that information could be used against the \npatient.\n  It will prevent insurers from charging higher premiums based on the \nresults of genetic testing. It will also prohibit employers from \npotentially using genetic information when considering hiring or firing \nsomebody or considering job promotions.\n  This bill, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, is a model \nof how again we can lead today on tomorrow's problems. As the science \nadvances, genetic tests will be used with increasing frequency, and the \nlikelihood, without this bill, would be for abuse of this genetic \ninformation. It is hugely powerful for the patient, but if misused, \ndetrimental to the patient. This legislation addresses that potential \nproblem right up front and prevents that from happening.\n  Over the last 3 weeks, we also confirmed the last of the President's \nCabinet nominees. We approved Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State, \nAlberto Gonzales as Attorney General, Samuel Bodman to lead the Energy \nDepartment, and Michael Chertoff as head of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Earlier today, the President announced his selection of John \nNegroponte to serve as the Director of National Intelligence. We had \nthe opportunity last night to have a presentation, an exchange of \ninformation, with Ambassador Negroponte, who is serving us so well \ntoday in Iraq.\n  Ambassador Negroponte, as Director of National Intelligence, will be \nresponsible for revamping and integrating America's 15 intelligence-\ngathering services. As the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the United \nNations, he has proven his ability to manage complicated organizations \nand tackle the difficult challenges we face today under intense \npressure.\n  He understands the needs of policymakers, and he understands how the \nexecutive branch works. I look forward to his swift confirmation. I \nlook forward, personally, to working with Ambassador Negroponte in the \nweeks and months ahead. I hope we will be able to consider his \nconfirmation process in the very near future.\n  The Senate has spoken out on some of the most important issues of the \nday as well: the Iraqi elections, the Palestinian elections, the \nassassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri.\n  When we return from our short recess--and, again, most people will be \ngoing back to their States in order to be with their constituents over \nthe next week--we will continue keeping our eye on events at home as \nwell as abroad. We will return after our recess to look at issues such \nas bankruptcy, which we will address as soon as we come back. We will \naddress the supplemental the President has delivered to us. And, of \ncourse, we will be addressing the budget as well.\n  As I promised when we began the 109th Congress, it is our job to \ndeliver meaningful solutions on the challenges that are ahead.\n  It is our duty and our privilege to keep America moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1599-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RULES OF PROCEDURE--COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

By written notice to the \n     Chairman of the Subcommittee any time before the record vote \n     on the measure or matter concerned is taken, the member may \n     withdraw a proxy previously given. All proxies shall be kept \n     in the files of the Committee.\n\n\n                           Rule 4. Witnesses\n\n       [a] Filing of statements.

Mr. President, today President Bush nominated Ambassador \nJohn Negroponte to be the new Director of National Intelligence. Rarely \nwill a nominee so clearly go from the frying pan to the fire.\n  Ambassador Negroponte will face enormous challenges in his new \nposition just as he has in his current position as our Ambassador to \nIraq. His experience there will serve him well, since the war with Iraq \nhas made the country a breeding ground for terrorism that did not \npreviously exist. His new top priority must be to keep America's \nintelligence community focused on the real threat to our national \nsecurity--the war against al-Qaida.\n  This will not be an easy task. The ongoing war in Iraq is sapping our \nmilitary, diplomatic, and intelligence resources. It is a war that did \nnot need to be fought. There were no weapons of mass destruction. There \nwere no persuasive links to al-Qaida. America should not have rushed to \nwar with Iraq. We should have stayed focused on the imminent threat \nfrom al-Qaida, a threat that remains strong more than three years after \nthe 9/11 attacks.\n  CIA Director Porter Goss' statement yesterday that ``Al Qaeda is \nintent on finding ways to circumvent US security enhancements to strike \nAmericans and the homeland'' is a timely reminder that al-Qaida is \nstill the gravest threat to our national security, and the war in Iraq \nhas ominously given al-Qaida new incentives and new opportunities to \nattack us.\n  The warning about al-Qaida's threat was emphasized Admiral James Loy, \nDeputy Secretary of Homeland Security. He told the Intelligence \nCommittee, ``We believe that attacking the homeland remains at the top \nof Al Qaeda's operational priority list. We believe that their intent \nremains strong for attempting another major operation here.''\n  The danger was also emphasized by Robert Mueller, the FBI Director, \nwho told the Intelligence Committee, ``The threat posed by \ninternational terrorism, and in particular from Al-Qaeda and related \ngroups, continues to be the gravest we face.'' Director Mueller said, \n``Al Qaeda continues to adapt and move forward with its desire to \nattack the United States using any means at its disposal. Their intent \nto attack us at home remains and their resolve to destroy America has \nnever faltered.''\n  In addition, the threat was emphasized by the Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, Admiral Lowell Jacoby, who said, ``The threat from \nterrorism has not abated. . . . The primary threat for the foreseeable \nfuture is a network of Islamic extremists hostile to the United States \nand our interests. The network is transnational and has a broad range \nof capabilities to include mass casualty attacks.''\n  Most ominously of all, CIA Director Porter Goss emphasized that \nterrorists are doing all they can to acquire nuclear materials that can \nbe used in a nuclear attack against any American\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\ncity. He spoke specifically about the materials missing from Russian \nnuclear facilities. He said, ``There is sufficient material unaccounted \nfor, so that it would be possible for those with know-how to construct \na nuclear weapon.'' His assessment is that ``It may be a only a matter \nof time before Al Qaeda or another group attempts to use chemical, \nbiological, radiological and nuclear weapons.''\n  Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jacoby concurred, saying, ``We \njudge terrorist groups, particularly Al Qaeda, remain interested in \nchemical, biological radiological and nuclear weapons.''\n  Admiral James Loy, Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security warned, \n``Al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups have demonstrated an operational \ncapability to conduct dramatic, mass-casualty attacks against both hard \nand soft targets inside the United States and abroad . . . The most \nsevere threats revolve around al-Qaeda and its affiliates' long-\nstanding intent to develop, procure, or acquire chemical, biological, \nradiological, and even nuclear, weapons for mass-casualty attacks.''\n  CIA Director Porter Goss also said that we've created a breeding \nground for terrorists in Iraq and a cause worldwide for the continuing \nrecruitment of anti-American extremists.\n  His assessment was clear. ``The Iraq conflict, while not a cause of \nextremism, has become a cause for extremists . . . Islamic extremists \nare exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti-U.S. jihadists . \n. . These jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced in and \nfocused on acts of urban terrorism. They represent a potential pool of \ncontacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups, and networks \nin Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries.''\n  American forces served bravely and with great honor in Iraq. But the \nwar in Iraq has made it more likely--not less likely--that we will face \nterrorist attacks in American cities, and not just the streets of \nBaghdad. The war has clearly made us less safe, and less secure.\n  It has significantly increased the challenges to our intelligence \ncommunity. And it underscores the vital need to have a Director of \nNational Intelligence who understands that it is al-Qaida not Iraq--\nthat has always been and remains the greatest threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  In my view, we have no higher priority than to do everything we \npossibly can to track down and secure the nuclear materials missing \nfrom Russian stockpiles or from any other source that might be \navailable to terrorists. The nuclear clock is ticking, and we are \nliving on borrowed time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1602-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW ENGLAND BOARD OF HIGHER EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on June 2, 1955, the Governors of six New \nEngland States recognized the importance of higher education to the \nregion and entered into the New England Higher Education Compact to \nshare the region's higher education resources and to cooperate in \nmeeting the needs of the New England workforce.\n  The original signers of the New England Higher Education Compact were \nGovernor Abraham Ribbicoff of Connecticut, Governor Edmund Muskie of \nMaine, Governor Christian Herter of Massachusetts, Governor Lane \nDwinell of New Hampshire, Governor Dennis J. Roberts of Rhode Island \nand Governor Joseph B.

Access and affordability have \nbecome the hallmark of the Regional Student Program of the New England \nBoard of Higher Education.\n  The New England Board of Higher Education has, over the course of the \nlast 50 years, saved New England students and their families millions \nof dollars in annual tuition bills. The New England Board of Higher \nEducation provides professional development training to prepare the \nregion's high school teachers and college faculty to teach in the \nfields of math, science and technology for thousands of New England's \nmiddle, high school and college students.\n  The Excellence Through Diversity program of the New England Board of \nHigher Education provides an academic support network to inspire, \ninform and motivate underrepresented high school students to apply to \ncollege, performs research relating to underrepresented groups enrolled \nin science, technology, engineering and mathematics programs in New \nEngland, and supports efforts to increase the number of minority \ndoctoral scholars at New England colleges and universities.\n  Connection: The Journal of the New England Board of Higher Education \nis America's only regional magazine on higher education and economic \ndevelopment that provides a key policy forum for New England educators, \nbusiness leaders, and policymakers to share best practices and current \nviews on higher education and economic development.\n  For the past 50 years, hundreds of New England's leading citizens in \ngovernment, education, and business have served as delegates to the New \nEngland Board of Higher Education to encourage regional cooperation, \nincrease educational opportunities for residents of the region, and \nstrengthen the relationship between higher education and the region's \neconomy.\n  We join to congratulate the New England Board of Higher Education on \nthe occasion of its 50th anniversary, and commend the New England Board \nof Higher Education for its service to New England residents and its \ncommitment to excellence in higher education, and in particular, its \ndistinguished Board of Delegates led by the Honorable Louis \nD'Allesandro of New Hampshire and its president and CEO, Dr. Evan S. \nDobelle of Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1602-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, I discuss a rare strain of HIV that is \nhighly resistant to most antiretroviral drugs and causes a rapid onset \nof AIDS that was recently discovered in a patient in New York City. The \nstrain, identified as 3-DCR HIV, is resistant to 3 of the 4 classes of \nantiretroviral drugs, which means that 19 of the 20 available \nantiretroviral drug combinations\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\nwould be ineffective for a person with this HIV strain.\n  Although drug-resistant HIV strains are common in patients who have \nbeen treated with antiretroviral drugs, multiple-drug-resistant HIV is \nextremely rare in patients who are newly diagnosed and previously \nuntreated. Moreover, while HIV infection usually takes about 10 years \nto progress to AIDS, this patient apparently progressed to AIDS in a \nmatter of months. Combination of a highly drug resistant HIV infection \nand rapid disease progression has the potential to become a very \nserious public health problem with global health implications.\n  The ultimate significance of the new strain is still unknown. Only \ntime will tell whether this was an isolated case or part of an outbreak \nof similar cases. It is imperative, however, that we take action to \nidentify and halt the spread of aggressive, multiresistant HIV/AIDS \nstrains.\n  We must continue to build upon and fund existing prevention programs \nand to strengthen our infectious disease monitoring systems. The CDC, \nin collaboration with community, state, national, governmental and \nnongovernmental partners, employs a number of programs designed to \nprevent HIV infection and reduce the incidence of HIV-related illness \nand death. By providing financial and technical support for disease \nsurveillance; risk-reduction counseling; street and community outreach; \nschool-based education on AIDS; prevention case management; and \nprevention and treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases that \ncan increase risks for HIV transmission, such programs have played a \nkey role in reducing HIV transmission.\n  Stopping the spread of this strain is also critical in order to \npreserve the effectiveness of existing HIV/AIDS therapies. Not only do \nsuch therapies prolong and improve the quality of life of those \naffected by HIV/AIDS, but they also play a vital role in preventing the \nspread of the disease. A recent study found that HIV therapies reduce \ninfectiousness by 60 percent. Consequently, that is why I recently \nreintroduced S. 311, the Early Treatment for HIV Act, ETHA. Supported \nby a bipartisan group of 31 Senators, ETHA redresses a fundamental flaw \nunder the current Medicaid system that provides access to care only \nafter individuals have developed full blown AIDS.\n  ETHA brings Medicaid eligibility rules in line with Federal \nGovernment guidelines on the standard of care for treating HIV. ETHA \nhelps address the fact that increasingly, in many parts of the country, \nthere are growing waiting lists for access to life-saving medications \nand limited access to comprehensive health care. Access to HIV \ntherapies reduces the amount of HIV virus present in a person's \nbloodstream, viral load, a key factor in curbing infectiousness and \nreducing the ability to transmit HIV.\n  Early access to HIV therapies as provided under ETHA would not only \ndelay disease progression and increase life expectancy, but it would \nalso reduce the need for more expensive treatment and costly hospital \nstays. According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, ETHA \nwould reduce gross Medicaid costs by 70 percent, saving the Federal \nGovernment approximately $1.5 billion over 10 years. With the \nadministration looking for ways to reduce Medicaid costs, passing ETHA \nwould be a good start. It's also the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1603-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SAFE GUN STORAGE SAVES LIVES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the debate on how to most effectively \ncombat gun violence frequently centers on the ability of criminals to \naccess dangerous firearms. Today, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to another important issue in our fight against gun violence: \nthe ability of our teenagers and children to access firearms. Safe \nstorage and child access prevention laws are critical steps as we seek \nto reduce the occurrence of accidental shootings and suicides involving \nguns. Such tragedies have claimed the lives of thousands of young \npeople and destroyed families even though many of these occurrences \ncould have been prevented by common sense legislation.\n  According to a Journal of the American Medical Association study \nreleased in 2001, suicide is the third-leading cause of death among \nyouth aged 10 to 19. Between 1976 and 2001, the period of the study, \nnearly 40,000 youth aged 14 to 20 committed suicide using a gun. The \nstudy also found that there was a significant reduction in youth \nsuicide rates in States that had child access prevention laws. Unlike \nsuicide attempts using other methods, suicide attempts with guns are \nnearly always fatal. These children get no second chance.\n  The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reported in 2004 that \nteenagers and children are involved in more than 10,000 accidental \nshootings in which close to 800 people die each year. Further, about \n1,500 children age 14 and under are treated in hospital emergency rooms \nfor unintentional firearm injuries. About 38 percent of them have \ninjuries severe enough to require hospitalization. Blocking \nunsupervised access to loaded guns is the key to preventing these \noccurrences.\n  A study published last week in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation found that the risk of unintentional shooting or suicide by \nminors using a gun can be significantly reduced by adopting responsible \ngun safety measures. According to the study, when ammunition in the \nhome is locked up, the risk of such injuries is reduced by 61 percent. \nSimply storing ammunition separately from the gun reduces such \noccurrences by more than 50 percent.\n  During the 108th Congress, I joined with 69 of my colleagues in \nvoting for Senator Boxer's trigger lock amendment. Senator Boxer's \namendment would have required that all handguns sold by a dealer come \nwith a child safety device, such as a lock, a lock box, or technology \nbuilt into the gun itself that would increase the security of the \nweapon while in storage. The underlying gun industry immunity bill to \nwhich this amendment was attached was later defeated in the Senate, but \nthe need and support for this legislation is clear. In light of the \nbipartisan support for this trigger lock amendment during the last \nCongress, I am hopeful that the 109th Congress will take up and pass \ncommon sense trigger lock legislation.\n  While the problems of youth suicide and accidental shooting cannot be \nlegislated away, trigger locks and other sensible gun safety measures \ncan help limit children's access to firearms. It is clear that reducing \nour kids' access to guns can save lives. The time has come to support \nthe efforts of States who have enacted common sense child access \nprevention laws and make responsible storage of firearms standard \naround the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1603-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1603-S1605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, last week, I reintroduced the HEALTH Act \nto address the national crisis our doctors, hospitals and those needing \nhealthcare face today.\n  Every day, patients in Nevada and across America are losing access to \nhealthcare services. Several states are losing medical professionals at \nan alarming rate, leaving thousands of patients without a healthcare \nprovider to serve their needs.\n  Because of increasing medical liability insurance premiums, it is now \ncommon for obstetricians to no longer deliver babies, and for other \nspecialists to no longer provide emergency calls or perform certain \nhigh-risk procedures.\n  Women's health in Nevada and elsewhere in the country is in serious \njeopardy as new doctors turn away from specialties and as practicing \ndoctors close their doors.\n  I have been told that one in seven fellows of the American Academy of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists have stopped practicing obstetrics \nbecause of the high risk of liability claims.\n  When Ms. Jill Forte of Las Vegas, found out that she was pregnant \nwith her second child, she called her doctor. The doctor told her that \nbecause of insurance costs, she could no longer deliver her baby. So \nJill started calling around. She was told the same thing by five \ndifferent doctors. She even considered going to California for care.\n  Fortunately, Ms. Forte was able to make a connection through a friend \nfor a local doctor to take her case. She said:\n\n       I was in total shock. I didn't know what was going on until \n     it happened. Looking for a doctor, worried about finding a \n     doctor when you're pregnant is a stress that is an \n     unnecessary stress. It's a stress caused by\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\n     frivolous and junk lawsuits. It doesn't make any sense to \n     have a society that sues so often that expectant mothers are \n     worried about finding a doctor.\n\n  Unfortunately, her story is becoming too commonplace.\n  Additionally, hundreds of emergency departments have closed in recent \nyears. Emergency departments have shut down in Arizona, Florida, \nMississippi, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, among others. During this same \ntime, the number of visits to the Nation's emergency departments \nclimbed more than 20 percent. While more Americans are seeking \nemergency medical care, emergency departments are losing critical staff \nand essential resources.\n  In my home State of Nevada, our only Level I trauma care center \nclosed for 10 days in 2002, leaving every patient within 10,000 square \nmiles unserved by a trauma unit. In fact, Ms. Mary Rasor's father died \nin Las Vegas last year when he could not obtain access to emergency \ntrauma care because of the closure.\n  Doctors are also limiting their scope of services. More than 35 \npercent of neurosurgeons have altered their emergency or trauma call \ncoverage because of the medical liability crisis. As a result, many \nhospitals, including Level II trauma centers, no longer have \nneurosurgical coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Consequently, \npatients with head injuries or in need of neurosurgical services must \nbe transferred to other facilities, delaying much-needed care.\n  An example of this problem was recently brought to my attention by \nDr. Tony Alamo of Henderson, Nevada. During his tenure as chief of \nstaff at Sunrise Hospital, Dr. Alamo was presented with a teenager \nsuffering from a Myasthenia Gravis crisis in need of immediate medical \ntreatment. This condition involves shortness of breath due to muscle \nweakness. Such shortness of breath can become severe enough to require \nhospitalization for breathing support, as well as treatment for the \nunderlying infection. If the problem is not identified and treated \ncorrectly, it could lead to death.\n  Dr. Alamo told me that because of the medical liability situation, \nthere was no emergency room neurologist on call to assist this young \nwoman. Many neurologists are afraid to become involved in difficult \ncases like this because of the high risks of medical liability. \nConsequently, Dr. Alamo had the young woman transported to California \nby helicopter to receive the care she needed. Because of the reasonable \nlaws in California, neurologists aren't afraid to take call.\n  The bottom line is that patients cannot get the healthcare they need \nwhen they need it most. By definition, this is a medical crisis. The \ncrisis boils down to two factors: affordability and availability of \nmedical liability insurance for providers.\n  With regard to affordability, the Medical Liability Monitor found \nthat in 2004, obstetricians in Dade County, FL, were paying as much as \n$277,241 in annual medical liability insurance premiums. Similarly, in \nIllinois, some obstetricians were paying more than $230,000 a year. In \nmy home state of Nevada, some OB/GYNs were paying approximately \n$133,904 for medical liability insurance, an increase of 15 percent \nfrom 2003.\n  Faced with increasing medical liability insurance premiums, some \nphysicians are no longer accepting discounted rates for the services \nthey provide. A legislative assistant in my office recently received a \nletter from her OB/GYN, which I would like to submit for the \nCongressional Record. The letter indicates that her physician's medical \nliability insurance premium for 2005 increased by over 50 percent to \nmore than $250,000. Instead of closing the practice or choosing to stop \ndelivering babies, the physician has decided to no longer accept \ndiscounted insurance reimbursements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENSIGN. We cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand and avoid \nthis issue. Medical liability insurance premiums are affecting real \npeople in need of timely and efficient healthcare services.\n  On the issue of availability, thousands of doctors nationwide have \nbeen left with no liability insurance as major insurers are either \nleaving the market or raising rates to astronomical levels. Why are \ninsurers raising rates and leaving the market? Because there is no \nstability in the marketplace for providing medical liability insurance. \nWhy is there no stability in the marketplace? Because our healthcare \nsystem is being overrun by frivolous lawsuits and outrageous jury \nawards.\n  This excessive litigation is leading to higher healthcare costs for \nevery American and provides little piece of mind for our healthcare \nproviders. Even medical students are affected by the current crisis. \nAccording to a recent American Medical Association survey, the current \nmedical liability environment is a significant factor for students \nselecting a specialty.\n  And, because the litigation system does not accurately judge whether \nan error was committed in the course of medical care, physicians are \nadjusting their behavior to avoid being sued. Many physicians are using \ndefensive medicine practices to avoid lawsuits. They are providing \npatients with tests and treatments that they would not otherwise \nperform to protect themselves against the risk of possible litigation.\n  Every unnecessary test and additional treatment poses a risk to the \npatient, and takes away funds that could be used to provide healthcare \nto those who need it most. A 2002 study by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services found that defensive medicine is costing the Federal \nGovernment an estimated $28 billion to $47 billion per year in \nunnecessary health care costs.\n  In addition to the Federal Government, who else is paying for these \nunnecessary costs? Every American with health insurance is paying for \nthese unnecessary expenses in the form of higher out-of-pocket payments \nand premiums.\n  Too often, medical costs are so great that employers have to stop \noffering health insurance coverage altogether, therefore increasing the \nnumber of uninsured in America. And who is paying for the uninsured to \nobtain health care services? We all are. And the cycle goes on and on. \nThis cycle has to be stopped and we can do that by passing national \nmedical liability reform right now.\n  Comprehensive medical liability reform is essential on a national \nlevel because the existing medical crisis is not confined within State \nlines and because every American should have access to affordable high \nquality healthcare. Likewise, every responsible member of the \nhealthcare community should not be afraid to provide high quality care \nbecause of the fear of litigation.\n  In order to achieve these critical reforms, I am reintroducing the \nHEALTH Act. This legislation includes several reform provisions, \nincluding a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, joint liability and \ncollateral source improvements, and limits on attorney fees according \nto a sliding award scale.\n  In addition, my legislation includes an expert witness provision to \nensure that relevant medical experts serve as trial witnesses instead \nof so-called ``professional witnesses'' who are used to further abuse \nthe system.\n  This legislation is modeled after California's successful Medical \nInjury Compensation Reform Act, also known as MICRA. MICRA has brought \nabout real reform to California's liability system. The number of \ndubious and frivolous lawsuits going to trial has declined \ndramatically.\n  Injured patients receive a larger share of their awards and \ndisciplinary actions against incompetent healthcare providers have \nincreased. The bottom line is that California's medical liability \nsystem works. These types of outcomes should be shared by every state, \nand ultimately every patient in America.\n  It is important to recognize that neither MICRA, nor my legislation \nlimits the amount of economic damages that an injured patient can \nrecover. Like every other profession, mistakes are sometimes made by \nhealthcare providers. Patients who suffer from these mistakes should \nhave access to unlimited economic compensation and should be able to \nrecover losses, such as loss of past and future earnings.\n  Injured patients should also have access to punitive damages where \nproviders are found to be grossly negligent. But, there is no way to \nquantify\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\na patient's ``pain and suffering,'' and most often, no dollar amount is \never enough. Therefore, placing a reasonable limit on these non-\neconomic damages helps bring accountability back to our civil justice \nsystem by weeding out frivolous lawsuits. This would allow physicians \nto concentrate fully on providing superior health care services, and \nhelp curb the skyrocketing costs of healthcare for patients.\n  Every step Congress can take to help increase patient safety and \nmaintain access to quality health care services should be taken, and we \nare on track to do that this year.\n  Medical liability reform is not a Republican or Democrat issue or \neven a doctor verses lawyer issue. It is a patient issue. With the \nmedical crisis occurring in Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Nevada, \nand many more states around the Nation, our opportunity to enact true \nreform is here. Comprehensive medical liability reform is the right \nprescription and the time for action is now.\n  Let's make sure that expectant mothers have access to ob-gyns and \nthat trauma care victims have access to necessary services in their \nmost critical hour of need. And, let's make sure we continue to provide \npatients in America with the opportunity to receive affordable, \naccessible, and high quality healthcare for years to come.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                      Women OB/GYN Physicians,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2004.\n       To Our Patients: We have all been reading and talking about \n     the crisis in our health care system. As your doctors, our \n     most important commitment and mission is to provide you with \n     the highest quality medical care. We are writing to tell you \n     how the current situation is affecting our ability to \n     practice medicine at the level you deserve and expect.\n       Doctors in our area are being squeezed between decreased \n     reimbursement from insurance carriers and steeply rising \n     malpractice premiums. We were just notified that our \n     malpractice premium for next year was increased by over 50 \n     percent to more than $275,000.\n       Faced with this increase we had to consider some difficult \n     choices. We could close our practice. We could stop \n     delivering babies--something we both love and at which we \n     excel. We could markedly increase the number of patients we \n     see each day and reduce the time we spend with each patient. \n     This would mean insufficient time for discussion, education \n     and thoughtful consideration of your individual needs. We \n     rejected all of these options. Instead we chose to stop \n     accepting extremely discounted rates for the services that we \n     provide.\n       Effective March 1, 2005 we will no longer participate with \n     CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. Therefore, we will not accept \n     any discounted insurance reimbursements. Of course, We hope \n     to continue to see our Blue Cross Blue Shield patients, but \n     payment is expected at the time of service. We will then \n     prepare a claim form that you can submit to your insurance \n     carrier to streamline your reimbursement. As a courtesy, we \n     will continue to submit claims for deliveries and surgeries \n     to the insurance carriers on your behalf.\n       We are committed to provide state-of-the-art women's health \n     services in a caring, efficient, and professional manner. We \n     look forward to our continued relationship.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about a very \nimportant speech that was presented, on January 25, to the Organization \nof American States, OAS, by former President Jimmy Carter.\n  Broadly speaking, former President Carter's speech was about the \npromise and perils of democracy in our hemisphere. In my view, no topic \ncould be more relevant.\n  Our hemisphere has come a long way over the past 30 years--in no \nsmall part due to the efforts of Jimmy Carter. From the beginning, he \nrealized the importance of the OAS in our hemisphere, and he \ndemonstrated this understanding by addressing every OAS General \nAssembly meeting held in Washington during his presidency.\n  He spearheaded the promotion of human rights, and his tireless work \ncontributed to the establishment of the Inter-American Convention on \nHuman Rights. That important document has encouraged greater civilian \nparticipation and helped facilitate the transition in many countries \nfrom rule by military dictator to that of democratically elected \ngovernment.\n  Simply put, Jimmy Carter's efforts sent a clear message throughout \nthe hemisphere that the U.S. not only valued democracy but was \ncommitted to ensuring that people of all backgrounds had a stake in \nemerging democracies in their countries. Indeed, the InterAmerican \nDemocratic Charter, which enjoyed broad support, was signed on the \nfateful day of September 11, 2001, and stands in stark contrast to the \nilliberal forces at work in areas around the world.\n  The message of that document--that OAS member nations would stand \ntogether to protect democracy--and the wide support it enjoyed prove \nhow much progress can be made when the U.S. invests time and effort in \nour hemisphere.\n  Together, we've made tremendous progress over these past 30 years. \nHowever, our work in the hemisphere is far from over. We must continue \nto end impunity, protect emerging democratic institutions, and \nstrengthen the InterAmerican Democratic Charter.\n  Former President Carter continues to work toward these noble ends, \nand others, for the good of the U.S. and for the good of people from \nCanada to Argentina and across the world. I congratulate him on his \nefforts, on the magnificent work of the Carter Center, and on the \nvision he layed out in his January 25 statement before the OAS. I ask \nunanimous consent that his statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   The Promise and Peril of Democarcy\n\n                           (By Jimmy Carter)\n\n       I am honored to address the permanent council of the \n     Organization of American States. Thank you, Mr. Secretary \n     General, Mr. President, and Ambassador Borrea for the kind \n     invitation to inaugurate this lecture series of the Americas.\n       I have long been interested in this organization. Thirty \n     years ago, as Governor of Georgia, I invited the OAS General \n     Assembly to meet in Atlanta--the first meeting in the U.S. \n     outside of Washington. Later, as President, I attended and \n     addressed every General Assembly in Washington.\n       Back then, I realized that most of this hemisphere was \n     ruled by military regimes or personal dictatorships. Senate \n     hearings had just confirmed U.S. involvement in destabilizing \n     the government of Salvador Allende in Chile, and a dirty war \n     was being conducted in Argentina. I decided to stop embracing \n     dictators and to make the protection of human rights a \n     cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, not only in this \n     hemisphere, but with all nations.\n       When we signed the Panama Canal Treaties in this same \n     August hall in 1977, many nonelected or military leaders were \n     on the dais. Key Caribbean States were absent, not yet part \n     of the inter-american system. Then in 1979, Ecuador started a \n     pattern of returning governments to civilian rule. The Inter-\n     American Convention on Human Rights soon came into force, and \n     our hemisphere developed one of the strongest human rights \n     standards in the world.\n       These commitments have brought tremendous progress to Latin \n     America and the Caribbean. Citizens have become involved in \n     every aspect of governance: More women are running for \n     political office and being appointed to high positions; \n     indigenous groups are forming social movements and political \n     parties; civic organizations are demanding transparency and \n     accountability from their governments; freedom of expression \n     is flourishing in an independent and vibrant press; ombudsmen \n     and human rights defenders are active; and many countries are \n     approving and implementing legislation to guarantee that \n     citizens have access to information.\n       The English-speaking Caribbean has sustained vibrant \n     democracies. a democratic Chile is removing military \n     prerogatives from the Pinochet-era constitution and the \n     military has acknowledged its institutional responsibility \n     for the torture and disappearances of the 1970s. Central \n     America has ended its civil wars and democracy has survived. \n     The Guatemalan government offered public apology for the \n     murder of Myrna Mack, and a Salvadoran responsible for the \n     assassination of Archbishop Romero was tried and convicted \n     last year, although in absentia.\n       Venezuelans have avoided civil violence while enduring a \n     deep political rift in the last three years. Mexico developed \n     an electoral institution that has become the envy of the \n     world. Argentine democracy weathered the deepest financial \n     crisis since the 1920s depression and its economy is on the \n     rebound.\n       Four years ago, Canada and Peru took the lead in developing \n     a new, more explicit commitment to democracy for the \n     hemisphere. On the tragic day of September 11, 2001, the \n     Inter-American Democratic Charter was signed.\n       I am proud to have witnessed these demonstrations of the \n     courage, persistence and creativity of the people of this \n     hemisphere.\n       But I am also worried. I am concerned that the lofty ideas \n     espoused in the Democratic\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\n     Charter are not all being honored. I am concerned that \n     poverty and inequality continue unabated. And I am concerned \n     that we in this room, representing governments and, in some \n     cases, privileged societies, are not demonstrating the \n     political will to shore up our fragile democracies, protect \n     and defend our human rights system, and tackle the problems \n     of desperation and destitution.\n       Since our years in the White House, my wife Rosalynn and I \n     have striven to promote peace, freedom, health, and human \n     rights, especially in this hemisphere and in Africa. Our \n     dedicated staff at the Carter Center have worked in 54 \n     elections to ensure they are honest and competitive. Civil \n     strife has become rare, and every country but Cuba has had at \n     least one truly competitive national election.\n       Yet, tiny Guyana, where we have been involved for more than \n     a decade, remains wracked with racial tension and political \n     stalemate. Haiti, where we monitored the first free election \n     in its history and where the world contributed many tens of \n     millions of dollars in aid, has been unable to escape the \n     tragedy of violence and extreme poverty. In Nicaragua, I was \n     privileged to witness the statesmanship of Daniel Ortega \n     transferring power to Violeta Chamorro; yet today that \n     country continues enmeshed in political deadlock and poverty \n     that is second only to Haiti.\n       Across the hemisphere, UNDP and Latin barometer polls \n     reveal that many citizens are dissatisfied with the \n     performance of their elected governments. They still believe \n     in the promise and the principles of democracy, but they do \n     not believe their governments have delivered the promised \n     improvements in living standards, freedom from corruption, \n     and equal access to justice. We run the very real risk that \n     dissatisfaction with the performance of elected governments \n     will transform into disillusionment with democracy itself.\n       How can we protect the advances made and avoid the \n     dangerous conclusion that democracy may not be worthwhile \n     after all?\n       The greatest challenge of our time is the growing gap \n     between the rich and poor, both within countries and between \n     the rich north and the poor south. About 45 percent (225 \n     million) people of Latin America and the Caribbean live under \n     the poverty line. The mathematical coefficient that measures \n     income inequality reveals that Latin America has the most \n     unequal income distribution in the world, and the income gap \n     has continued to increase in the past fifteen years.\n       When people live in grinding poverty, see no hope for \n     improvement for their children, and are not receiving the \n     rights and benefits of citizenship, they will eventually make \n     their grievances known, and it may be in radical and \n     destructive ways. Governments and the privileged in each \n     country must make the decision and demonstrate the will to \n     include all citizens in the benefits of society.\n       Democratic elections have improved, but we have also \n     witnessed a dangerous pattern of ruling parties naming \n     election authorities that are partisan and biased, \n     governments misusing state resources for campaigns, and \n     election results that are not trusted by the populace. I \n     include my own country in saying that we all need to create \n     fair election procedures, to regulate campaign finance, and \n     to ensure that every eligible citizen is properly registered \n     and has the opportunity to cast votes that will be counted \n     honestly.\n       But democracy is much more than elections. It is \n     accountable governments; it is the end of impunity for the \n     powerful. It is giving judiciaries independence from \n     political pressures so they can dispense justice with \n     impartiality. It is protecting the rights of minorities, \n     including those who do not vote for the majority party. It is \n     protecting the vulnerable--such as those afflicted with HIV/\n     AIDS, street children, those with mental illnesses, women \n     abused with domestic violence, migrants, and indigenous \n     peoples.\n       Governments of this hemisphere have carried out enormous \n     economic reform efforts in the last two decades, but these \n     efforts have not yet brought the needed reduction in poverty \n     and inequality. Too many governments still rely on regressive \n     sales taxes because the privileged classes can manipulate \n     governments and avoid paying taxes on their incomes or \n     wealth.\n       Military spending has been significantly reduced, but \n     additional reductions are advisable now that the region is \n     democratic and most border issues have been resolved.\n       Health and education are more important than expensive \n     weapons systems.\n       Access to land, small loans, and easier permits for small \n     businesses can harness the potential dynamism of each \n     nation's economy. Brazil has initiated a zero hunger program \n     to address poverty, and Venezuela is using oil wealth to \n     bring adult education, literacy, health and dental services \n     directly to the poor. These and other creative social \n     programs should be studied to see which might be appropriate \n     in other areas.\n       When political leaders do make the right choices to address \n     the needs of all citizens, those citizens have a \n     responsibility as well--to comply with the established rules \n     of the political process. Political honeymoons are short, and \n     sometimes a frustrated people are tempted to unseat an \n     unsatisfactory government, by violence or unconstitutional \n     means. Elected leaders deserve a chance to make the tough \n     decisions, or to be removed at ballot boxes.\n       News media play an especially important role in a free \n     society. Press freedom is vibrant in the hemisphere, and must \n     be kept that way. ``Insult'' (desacato) laws and harassment \n     of journalists should be eliminated. The media also have a \n     responsibility to investigate carefully and to corroborate \n     their stories before publication.\n       Those of us in the richer nations have additional \n     obligations. We must recognize that we live in an ever-closer \n     hemisphere, with mutual responsibilities. Trade and tourism \n     of the U.S. and Canada are increasingly connected with all of \n     Latin America and the Caribbean, as the sub-regions of the \n     hemisphere are forging closer economic ties.\n       We are also connected by the scourge of crime, which is a \n     two-way street. Drug demand in the U.S. fuels drug production \n     among our neighbors, undermining the ability of democratic \n     institutions to enforce the rule of law, and the easy \n     availability of small arms from the U.S. has made crime a \n     serious problem for governments in the Caribbean and Central \n     America.\n       Globally, Americans give just 15 cents per $100 of national \n     income in official development assistance. As a share of our \n     economy, we rank dead last among industrialized countries. \n     The recently announced millennium challenge account is \n     designed to provide additional help for governments pursuing \n     transparency and accountability, but in this hemisphere only \n     Bolivia, Honduras and Nicaragua are being considered for this \n     aid.\n       The United States has another role to play as well: of \n     setting an example of protecting civil liberties and \n     improving democratic practices at home, and by its unwavering \n     support of democracy and human rights abroad.\n       The international lending agencies also have important \n     roles to play: by being more flexible and responsive to \n     political pressures and social constraints when deciding \n     conditionality; by involving local citizens and governments \n     in developing consensus for poverty-reduction strategies; and \n     by helping the hemisphere carry out the mandates adopted by \n     Presidents at the periodic Summits of the Americas.\n       Finally, I call on all governments of the hemisphere to \n     make the democratic charter more than empty pieces of paper, \n     to make it a living document. The charter commits us to help \n     one another when our democratic institutions are threatened. \n     The charter can be a punitive instrument, providing for \n     sanctions when a serious challenge to the democratic order \n     occurs, but it is also an instrument for providing technical \n     assistance and moral encouragement to prevent democratic \n     erosion early in the game.\n       Let us strengthen the charter and not be afraid to use it. \n     Right now the charter is weak because it is vague in defining \n     conditions that would constitute a violation of the charter--\n     the ``unconstitutional alteration or interruption'' of the \n     democratic order noted in article 19. The charter also \n     requires the consent of the affected government even to \n     evaluate a threat to democracy. If the government itself is \n     threatening the minimum conditions of democracy, the \n     hemisphere is not prepared to act, since there would \n     certainly not be an invitation.\n       Two simple actions would help to remedy this problem and \n     allow the governments of this hemisphere to act when needed. \n     First, a clear definition of ``unconstitutional alteration or \n     interruption'' would help guide us. These conditions should \n     include:\n       1. Violation of the integrity of central institutions, \n     including constitutional checks and balances providing for \n     the separation of powers.\n       2. Holding of elections that do not meet minimal \n     international standards.\n       3. Failure to hold periodic elections or to respect \n     electoral outcomes.\n       4. Systematic violation of basic freedoms, including \n     freedom of expression, freedom of association, or respect for \n     minority rights.\n       5. Unconstitutional termination of the tenure in office of \n     any legally elected official.\n       6. Arbitrary or illegal, removal or interference in the \n     appointment or deliberations of members of the judiciary or \n     electoral bodies.\n       7. Interference by non-elected officials, such as military \n     officers, in the jurisdiction of elected officials.\n       8. Systematic use of public office to silence, harass, or \n     disrupt the normal and legal activities of members of the \n     political opposition, the press, or civil society.\n       We also need a set of graduated, automatic responses to \n     help us overcome the inertia and paralysis of political will \n     that result from uncertain standards and the need to reach a \n     consensus de novo on each alleged violation. When a \n     democratic threat is identified, the alleged offenders would \n     be requested to explain their actions before the permanent \n     council. A full evaluation would follow, and possible \n     responses could be chosen from a prescribed menu of \n     appropriate options, involving not only the OAS, but \n     incentives and disincentives from multilateral institutions \n     and the private sector.\n       There is also a role for nongovernmental leaders. We at the \n     Carter Center have convened a group of former hemispheric \n     leaders to aid in raising the visibility of the charter, to \n     engage the OAS, and to help it provide appropriate responses \n     when democracy is challenged.\n       Let me close by congratulating the OAS, which has come a \n     long way from my first association with it 30 years ago. As a \n     promoter of freedom, democracy, and human rights, the OAS is \n     one of the foremost regional organizations in the world. This \n     hemisphere\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\n     adopted the world's first anti-corruption convention and has \n     developed a multilateral evaluation mechanism on drugs. The \n     OAS has worked on de-mining, peacemaking, and providing \n     scholarships to students. It exemplifies the notion that our \n     best hope for the world is for sovereign states to work \n     together.\n       The OAS is going through a difficult transition at the \n     moment, but it will emerge even stronger. A new Secretary-\n     General will be chosen this year, and important discussions \n     will be forthcoming at the general assembly in Florida and \n     the fourth Summit of the Americas in Argentina.\n       We need each other. Let us work together to make our \n     hemisphere the beacon of hope, human dignity, and cooperation \n     for the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1607-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DVT AWARENESS RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined with my \ncolleague Senator Arlen Specter in submitting a resolution yesterday, \nS. Res. 56, that would designate March as ``Deep-Vein Thrombosis \nAwareness Month.''\n  Many Americans are probably unfamiliar with deep-vein thrombosis, \nDVT, but it is a serious medical condition that occurs in approximately \n2 million Americans each year. Given that it is both a common and \npreventable condition, it is important that more of us know about this \ndisease so we can take steps to stop it.\n  Americans might be more commonly familiar with deep-vein thrombosis \nas the condition that can result from sitting in a small space, such as \nan airline seat, for a long period of time. In fact, this condition is \nsometimes called ``economy-class syndrome,'' and many airlines now \nencourage their passengers to get up and move around or otherwise \nexercise their extremities during cross-country or international \nflights in order to prevent it.\n  DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in one of the large veins, usually \nin the legs, leading to either partially or completely blocked \ncirculation. Too often, this blood clot breaks loose from the wall of \nthe vein and moves to the lungs, where it is called a pulmonary \nembolism and can cause sudden death.\n  Deep-vein thrombosis can happen to virtually anyone at any time. In \nfact, one of our Nation's finest journalists, NBC News correspondent \nDavid Bloom, died from a pulmonary embolism caused by DVT in April, \n2003, while covering the war in Iraq at the early age of 39. But while \nDavid Bloom is one of the more well-known victims of DVT, he is not \nalone. Up to 200,000 die each year from pulmonary embolisms caused by \nDVT.\n  The resolution that Senator Specter and I submitted yesterday in \nhonor of the memory of David Bloom is an important first step towards \neducating Americans about this potentially deadly condition. The \nresolution is supported by the Coalition to Prevent Deep-Vein \nThrombosis, which is made up of more than 30 health and medical groups. \nIn addition, David Bloom's beloved wife Melanie has become an outspoken \nadvocate for raising awareness about DVT.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Specter, Melanie Bloom, the \nCoalition to Prevent Deep-Vein Thrombosis, and others to help make more \nAmericans aware of this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1607-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor legislation \nto authorize the awarding of the Congressional Gold Medal to the \nTuskegee Airmen. The Tuskegee Airmen overcame enormous obstacles, \nincluding blatant discrimination and racism, to become the first black \nairmen. Their success paved the way for reform and, ultimately, \nintegration of the United States' Armed Services.\n  These men stepped forward to defend our Nation against the horrors of \nNazi Germany, while continuing to battle racist treatment by their own \ncountrymen. They fought through this unjust treatment because their \nsense of duty to their country was greater than the obstacles in their \npath. The recognition of their persistence, courage and allegiance is \nlong overdue.\n  Of the 1,000 Tuskegee Airmen, 450 served in combat, 66 died in \ncombat, and another 33 were shot down and captured as prisoners of war. \nThe pilots were credited with destroying 261 aircraft, damaging 148 \naircraft, and flying 15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions over \nItaly and North Africa. They destroyed or damaged over 950 units of \nground transportation and escorted more than 200 bombing missions.\n  As a result of their heroic actions, members of the Tuskegee Airmen \nhave been awarded three Presidential Unit Citations and 150 \nDistinguished Flying Crosses and Legions of Merit, in addition to The \nRed Star of Yugoslavia, 9 Purple Hearts, 14 Bronze Stars and more than \n700 air medals and clusters.\n  I am proud to say that 16 of these airmen were from the State of West \nVirginia. Several attended West Virginia State University, a university \nwhich has graduated more military generals than any other non-military \ncollege in the Nation. The 16 West Virginians are listed below.\n  Alston, William R.\n  Carter, John\n  Eagleson, Wilson V.\n  Gamble, Howard C.\n  Gray, George E.\n  Hill, William L.\n  Johnson, Langdon E.\n  Jones, Hubert L.\n  Killard, James M., Jr.\n  Kydd, George H., III\n  Prewitt, Mexion O.\n  Roberts, George S.,\n  Robinson, Robert L., Jr.\n  Thompson, Floyd A.\n  Watkins, Edward Wilson\n  Whitehead, John L., Jr.\n  The Tuskegee Airmen have proven their valor and dedication to our \ncountry, and they have earned the Congressional Medal of Honor.

Mr. President, I have come to this floor repeatedly to \ntalk about the ongoing crisis in our domestic manufacturing sector and \nabout ways in which Congress should act to stem the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs and the shuttering of domestic manufacturing \ncompanies.\n  My State of Wisconsin has lost nearly 80,000 good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs since 2000. The country has lost more than 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion manufacturing jobs since January 2001, including more than \n25,000 jobs last month alone. And this hemorrhaging of jobs shows no \nsigns of stopping.\n  Much of this job loss can be blamed on the dismal trade policies of \nrecent years, which have contributed to many American companies--some \nof them household names--moving their operations overseas or shutting \ntheir doors entirely. These policies have a ripple effect in the \ncommunities that have lost manufacturing plants. The closure of the \nlocal plant is felt not only by those who worked there and their \nfamilies, but by the community as a whole.\n  Mr. President, Florence, WI is a town in the far northeastern corner \nof my home State, just a few miles from the border with the Upper \nPeninsula of Michigan. A few weeks ago, that small community got a \nsharp introduction to the realities of our country's trade policies. \nPride Manufacturing, the world's largest maker of golf tees, announced \nthat it would be closing down its plant in Florence and moving that \noperation and the hundred or so jobs that go with it to China.\n  That announcement probably was not noticed by many people outside of \nmy home State--one company in one small community in Wisconsin leaving \nfor China does not raise many eyebrows in Washington or on Wall Street. \nBut it is a serious matter for the families whose livelihood is \ndirectly affected by the move. And it will certainly have an impact on \nthe community in which they live. Some families may try to stay, but \nsome may be forced to look elsewhere for jobs. The local school \ndistrict is already trying to cope with declining enrollment and the \nchallenges of being a largely rural district. The prospect of losing \nadditional families will only make matters worse. Local businesses that \nrelied on the patronage of those families will be hit. Car dealers, \ngrocery stores, hardware stores, clothing stores--everyone in that \ncommunity will potentially be affected by the loss of Pride \nManufacturing.\n  There are too many stories like this taking place around my State and \naround our country. There are too many boarded-up factories and too\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\nmany parents struggling to make ends meet and to provide for their \nchildren after the plant closes and the jobs go to other countries. \nCongress can and should do more to support these hard-working Americans \nand their employers. These are the people who are bearing the brunt of \nthe bad trade agreements and other policies that have encouraged \ncompanies to close or to leave the United States.\n  In response to this crisis, this week I am introducing a series of \nbills intended to support American companies and American workers. \nThese measures alone will not solve this problem, but I believe that \nthey represent a first step in helping to save a core sector of our \neconomy.\n  My first proposal would set some minimum standards for future trade \nagreements into which our country enters. It is a break with the so-\ncalled NAFTA model and instead advocates the kinds of sound trade \npolicies that will spur economic growth and sustainable development. \nThe major trade agreements into which our country has entered in recent \nyears have resulted in a race to the bottom in labor standards, \nenvironmental standards, health and safety standards, in nearly every \naspect of our economy. A race to the bottom is a race in which even the \nwinners lose. We should ensure that future trade agreements do not \ncontinue down this perilous road.\n  The principles set forth in this resolution are straightforward and \nachievable. These principles include: calling for enforceable worker \nprotections, preserving the ability of the United States to enact and \nenforce its own trade laws, ensuring that foreign investors are not \nprovided with greater rights than those provided under U.S. law, \nproviding that food entering into our country meets domestic food \nsafety standards, and preserving the ability of Federal, State, and \nlocal governments to maintain essential public services and to regulate \nprivate sector services in the public interest.\n  Mr. President, my second bill, the Buy American Improvement Act, \nfocuses on the Federal Government's responsibility to support domestic \nmanufacturers and workers. The Buy American Act of 1933 is supposed to \nensure that the Federal Government supports domestic companies and \nworkers by buying American-made goods. This is an important law, but it \ncontains a number of loopholes that make it too easy for Government \nagencies to buy foreign-made goods.\n\n  The Buy American Improvement Act would make it harder to waive the \nBuy American Act. We should ensure that the Federal Government makes \nevery effort to give Federal contracts to companies that will perform \nthe work domestically. We should also ensure that certain types of \nindustries do not leave the United States completely, thus making the \nFederal Government dependent on foreign sources for goods, such as \nplane or ship parts, that our military may need to acquire on short \nnotice.\n  My bill would also, for the first time, make the Buy American \nrequirement applicable to Congress. I believe that Congress should lead \nby example and comply with the Buy American Act. And, in an effort to \nbring transparency and accountability to the process, it would require \nagencies to report on their purchases of foreign-made goods.\n  It is bad enough that our trade policies have encouraged companies to \nshut down or relocate overseas. Many of the same flawed trade \nagreements that have sent American jobs overseas have also weakened the \nBuy American Act.\n  Last year, the ranking member of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Lieberman and I asked the GAO to \nstudy the effect of trade agreements on domestic source requirements \nsuch as those contained in the Buy American Act. That study, which was \nreleased this week, found that the Government is required to give \nfavorable treatment to certain goods from a total of 45 countries as a \nresult of 7 trade agreements and 21 reciprocal defense procurement \nagreements.\n  In other words, at the same time that Congress has been paying lip \nservice to the Buy American Act, it has been carving out exceptions to \nthat Act in our trade and defense procurement agreements. It is time \nfor Congress to step up and support efforts to strengthen, not \nundermine, the Buy American Act.\n  In addition, Congress must make every effort to help workers who have \nlost their jobs as a result of our trade policies. Many of these \nworkers require retraining for new jobs that will enable them to \nsupport their families.\n  My third bill, the Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act, would \nauthorize a demonstration project to provide grants to community-based \ncoalitions, led by local workforce development boards, to retrain \nunemployed workers who wish to obtain new jobs in the health care \nprofessions. The funds could be used for a variety of purposes--from \nincreasing the capacity of our schools and training facilities, to \nproviding financial and social support for workers who are in \nretraining programs. This bill allows for flexibility in the use of \ngrant funds, because I believe that communities know best about the \nresources they need to run an efficient program.\n  By providing targeted assistance to train laid-off workers who wish \nto obtain new jobs in the fast-growing health care sector, we can both \nhelp unemployed Americans and improve the availability and quality of \nhealth care in our communities.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support each of my proposals, and I \nlook forward to working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to \nfind additional ways to support our domestic manufacturers and their \nemployees. I know that there are towns like Florence, WI, all over the \ncountry, and I hope that we will finally act this Congress to support \nthe jobs that are the bedrock of those communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1608-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1608-S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIVE IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

It will allow the Justice \nDepartment, upon a showing of probable cause to a Federal judge, \nauthority to obtain a wiretap order for a limited time period to \nmonitor communications between those suspected of engaging in illegal \nantitrust conspiracies.\n  The current Federal criminal code lists over 150 predicate offenses \nfor which the Justice Department may obtain a wiretap during the course \nof a criminal investigation. These offenses include such basic white \ncollar crimes such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud. However, \nunder current law, if the Government is investigating a criminal \nantitrust conspiracy such as a scheme to fix prices to consumers, the \nGovernment cannot obtain a wiretap of the suspected conspirators. This \ninability to obtain wiretaps unquestionably severely handicaps the \ndetection and prevention of such conspiracies. Only with the consent of \na member of the conspiracy who has already agreed to cooperate with the \nGovernment may the Government surreptiously record the meetings of the \nconspirators.\n  There is no logical basis to exclude criminal antitrust violations \nfrom the list of predicate offenses for a wiretap. A criminal antitrust \noffense such as price fixing is every bit as serious--and causes every \nbit as much financial loss to its victims--as other white collar crimes \nsuch as mail fraud or wire fraud. A price-fixing conspiracy raises \nprices to consumers, stealing hard-earned dollars from citizens as \nsurely as does as a salesman promoting a bogus investment from a \n``boiler room'' or, indeed, a thief with a gun. Moreover, by its secret \nnature as an agreement among competitors, such a conspiracy is likely \nharder to detect than a fraudulent offering over the phone or through \nthe mail. A properly issued wiretap, therefore, is even more necessary \nto detect criminal antitrust conspiracies than other white collar \noffenses.\n  Detecting, preventing, and punishing criminal antitrust offenses are \none of the principal missions of the Justice Department's Antitrust \nDivision. Such offenses are punished severely with corporations facing \nfines of up to $100 million and individuals subject to jail terms of up \nto 10 years for each offense.\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\nIndeed, last year we passed legislation raising criminal penalties to \nthese new levels. Yet despite the damage these conspiracies do to the \neconomy and individual consumers, our law enforcement agencies lack the \none vital tool essential to uncover these secret conspiracies--the \nability to obtain a wiretap to monitor communications between the \nsuspected conspirators upon a showing of probable cause. This \nlegislation will remedy this defect by granting to our law enforcement \nofficials this necessary means to protect consumers and end illegal \nantitrust conspiracies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1609-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RETIREMENT OF ARNOLD SCHOFIELD\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I acknowledge the retirement of \nArnold Schofield who is completing 25 years of service as site \nhistorian at Fort Scott National Historic Site, Fort Scott, KS.\n  Completing a 43-year career in Federal service, he remains passionate \nabout American cultural and military history. Arnold is highly \nrespected for his extraordinary knowledge and his ability to bring \nhistory to life. Those fortunate to have heard his presentations \nthroughout Kansas and the Midwest were left with a greater appreciation \nof the area's rich past and a desire to learn even more. For decades, \nArnold was a familiar figure in Fort Scott's countless tourism efforts \nand became one of the region's most recognizable and appreciated \nfigures.\n  While the loss at Fort Scott National Historic Site will be \nsignificant, Arnold will continue his public service near Pleasanton, \nKS, as site administrator at Mine Creek Battlefield State Historic \nSite. He looks forward to the challenge of preserving, protecting and \ninterpreting the site of the largest Civil War battle in Kansas and one \nof the largest cavalry engagements of the Civil War.\n  He will take with him rich memories of his earlier service at Harpers \nFerry National Historic Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia and \nNorth Carolina.\n  I welcome this opportunity to thank and congratulate Mr. Schofield on \nhis retirement from over four decades of Federal service and extend to \nhim our best wishes in his new position at Mine Creek \nBattlefield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1609-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LEXINGTON CATHOLIC GIRLS' BASKETBALL \n                                  TEAM\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

The Lady Knights are currently undefeated within \ntheir region and will go on to next month to compete within the State \nfor the State championship title.

In doing so they have \nbeaten the four highest-ranked regional teams in the Louisville \nCourier-Journal newspaper's Litkenhous Ratings by a combined 70 points.\n  I cannot think of a much better group of young people to represent \nKentucky. As a former Major League Baseball player, I appreciate their \nathletic excellence.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \noutstanding growth and service of the NASA Langley Pre-Service Teacher \nProgram. This year's national conference, which is being held this week \nfrom February 17 through 19, 2005, will mark the 10 year anniversary of \nthis highly successful educational program.\n  The Pre-Service Teacher Program is a project run through the \ncooperation of NASA's Langley Office of Education and Norfolk State \nUniversity's School of Science & Technology. Its mission is to provide \nPre-Service teachers and faculty members opportunities to enhance their \nknowledge and skill in teaching mathematics and science using \ntechnology at the elementary and middle school levels.\n  Since its humble beginnings as a small regional conference held in \nHampton, VA, in 1995, the Pre-Service Teacher Program has grown into a \nlarge national conference annually held in Alexandria, VA. The program \nbegan with only 25 member institutions representing 10 States and now \nboasts membership of over 104 institutions representing 31 States. It \nis important to recognize that of the 104 member institutions, there \nare representatives from Hispanic Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges \nand Universities, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n  The Pre-Service Teacher Program's continued growth led to the \naddition of a Pre-Service Teacher Institute in 1998. This 2-week long \nimmersion program allows more pre-service teachers the opportunity to \ninterface with NASA personnel, tour Langley's facilities, and learn \nways to incorporate NASA's cutting-edge research into lesson plans for \nelementary and middle school students. As the success of this program \nhas grown, the Pre-Service Teacher Program expanded in 2000 to seven \nsites beyond Hampton, VA, and, with time, I am sure it will continue to \ngrow.\n  I congratulate the Pre-Service Teacher Program's tremendous growth \nand impact on Virginia classrooms and schools across the Nation. They \nare to be commended for their hard work and attention to our Nation's \nfuture: our children. I wish them continued success, keep fighting and \nkeep succeeding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1609-4", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING HENRY HERZING\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN.

Four years ago, our economy was \nsliding into recession. The bursting of the high-tech bubble, \nrevelations of corporate scandals, and terrorist attacks hurt our \neconomy, leading to falling incomes and rising unemployment.\n  We acted by passing tax relief so American families could keep more \nof their own money. At the same time, we gave businesses incentives to \ninvest and create jobs. Last year, we gained over 2 million new jobs, \nand the economy's production of goods and services rose by 4.4 percent. \nThe unemployment rate is now 5.2 percent, which is lower than the \naverage of each of the past three decades and the lowest since the \nattacks of September 11, 2001. Our pro-growth policies are taking us in \nthe right direction.\n  As I start my second term, we must take action to keep our economy \ngrowing. I will not be satisfied until every American who wants to work \ncan find a job. I have laid out a comprehensive strategy to sustain \ngrowth, create jobs, and confront the challenges of a changing America.\n  I am committed to restraining spending by eliminating government \nprograms that do not work and by making government provide important \nservices more efficiently. I have pledged to cut the deficit in half by \n2009, and we are on track to do so.\n  The greatest fiscal challenges we face arise from the aging of our \nsociety. Because Americans are having fewer children and living longer, \nseniors are becoming a larger proportion of the population. This change \nhas important implications for the Social Security system, because the \nbenefits paid to retirees come from taxes on today's workers. In 1950, \nthere were 16 workers paying into Social Security for every person \nreceiving benefits. Now there are just over 3, and that number will \nfall to 2 by the time today's young workers retire. We will not change \nSocial Security for those now retired or nearing retirement. We need to \npermanently fix the Social Security system for our children and \ngrandchildren. I will work with the Congress to fix Social Security for \ngenerations to come.\n\n  The current tax code is a drag on the economy. It discourages saving \nand investment, and it requires individuals and businesses to spend \nbillions of dollars and millions of hours each year to comply with the \ncomplicated system. I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform our tax \ncode to make it simpler, fairer, and more pro-growth.\n  We are working to make health care more affordable and accessible for \nAmerican families. The Medicare modernization bill I signed gives \nseniors more choices and helps them get the benefits of modern medicine \nand prescription drug coverage. We have created health savings \naccounts, which give workers and families more control over their \nhealth care decisions. We will open or expand more community health \ncenters for those in need. To help control health costs and make health \ncare more accessible, we must let small businesses pool risks across \nstates so they can get the same discounts for health insurance that big \ncompanies get. We will increase the use of health information \ntechnology that will make health care more efficient, cur down on \nmistakes, and control costs.\n  Our litigation system encourages junk lawsuits and harms our economy, \nand the system must be reformed. I support medical liability reform to \ncontrol the cost of health care, keep good medical professionals from \nbeing driven out of practice, and ensure that patient care--not \navoidance of lawsuits--is the central concern in all medical decisions. \nI support class action reform to eliminate the waste, inefficiency, and \nunfairness of the class-action system. And I support reforms to the \nasbestos litigation system in order to protect victims with asbestos-\nrelated injuries and prevent frivolous lawsuits that harm our economy \nand cost jobs.\n  I will continue to push for energy legislation to help keep our \neconomy strong. We must modernize our electricity system to make it \nmore reliable. To make our energy supply more secure, we must explore \nfor more energy in environmentally friendly ways in our own country, \ndevelop alternative sources of energy, and encourage conservation.\n  I will work to further simplify and streamline federal regulations \nthat hinder growth and encumber our job creators. Our economy needs to \nallow entrepreneurs to spend more time doing business and less time \nwith their lawyers and accountants.\n  I believe that Americans benefit from open markets and free and fair \ntrade, and I am working to open up markets around the world and make \nsure that the playing field is level for our workers, farmers, \nmanufacturers, and other job creators. In the past four years, we \nconcluded free-trade agreements with Singapore, Chile, Australia, \nMorocco, Bahrain, Jordan, and six countries in Central America and the \nCaribbean. My Administration will continue to work to expand trade on a \nmultilateral, regional, and bilateral basis, and to enforce our trade \nlaws to help ensure a level playing field.\n  I have a plan to prepare our young people for the jobs of the 21st \ncentury. We have brought greater accountability to our public schools \nand are working to improve our high schools. We have made Pell grants \navailable to one million more students, and we will work to make \ncollege more affordable by increasing the size of Pell grants for low-\nincome students. We are reforming our workforce training programs to \nhelp Americans obtain the skills needed for the jobs that our economy \nis creating.\n  I have an ambitious agenda for the next four years. During my first \nterm, working with the Congress, I put policies in place to ensure a \nrapid recovery and to support strong growth. In my second term, \ntogether we will cut the budget deficit in half, fix Social Security, \nreform the tax code, reduce the burden of junk lawsuits, ensure a \nreliable and affordable energy supply, continue to promote free and \nfair trade, help make health care affordable and accessible for \nAmerican families, and expand the quality and availability of \neducational opportunities. These policies will produce an economic \nenvironment that continues to unleash the creativity and energy of the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1610-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the \n     Speciality Crop Competitiveness Act; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 279\n\n       Whereas, in 2001, Congress provided for speciality crop \n     block grant program to address difficult circumstances in \n     speciality crop segments of American agriculture. Through \n     this single-year program, states, including Michigan, \n     administered grants that helped specialty crop producers, \n     processors, and commodity organizations conduct research, \n     revamp marketing and promotion, and improve inspection \n     efforts; and\n       Whereas, the specialty crop block grant program, which is \n     distinct from traditional farm assistance programs, was \n     successful, especially in Michigan, in fostering improvement \n     in the competitiveness of many crop areas through a focus on \n     specific projects. The program's impact on Michigan \n     agriculture was widespread; and\n       Whereas, Congress has before it a measure that would \n     authorize a permanent specialty crop block grant program. The \n     Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act, H.R. 3242, would be a \n     most effective way to increase the competitiveness of \n     American agriculture in our fast-changing global economy. \n     With the great diversity of Michigan's farms, our state has a \n     major stake in this legislation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact the Specialty Crop Competitiveness \n     Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of the resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-2. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to specialty crops; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 69\n\n       Whereas, rapid conversion of California's farm and ranch \n     lands for nonfarm use has contributed to the state's \n     increased dependence upon imported food; and\n       Whereas, according to the National Agricultural Statistical \n     Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, 3.7 \n     million acres of farm land (more than 10 percent of total \n     farm land) was lost between 1990 and 2003; and\n       Whereas, increased dependence upon imported foods has \n     created increased vulnerability to exotic pests and diseases, \n     evidenced by 63,527 shipments of prohibited commodities \n     intercepted and destroyed or shipped back out-of-state in \n     2002; and\n       Whereas, according to the California Department of Food and \n     Agriculture's (hereafter CDFA) January 2004 report Protecting \n     California from Biological Pollution, interception of \n     quarantined pests at point-of-entry is the state's primary \n     defense against the introduction and spread of biological \n     pollution; and\n       Whereas, every dollar spent on early intervention against \n     exotic and invasive species, on average prevents seventeen \n     dollars ($17) in later expenses, as seen by the following:\n       (a) CDFA Plant Health Pest Prevention Services spent two \n     hundred fifty-eight million dollars ($258,000,000) to \n     eradicate Mediterranean fruit fly infestations between 1980 \n     and 1996. Just four million four hundred thousand dollars \n     ($4,400,000) has been spent since the Medfly Exclusion \n     Program was launched in 1996.\n       (b) CDFA Animal Health & Food Safety Services in 2002 \n     reported that Exotic Newcastle Disease, the most fatal vital \n     disease known to birds, required more than 3.4 million birds \n     to be destroyed at a cost of more than three million six \n     hundred thousand dollars ($3,600,000) to California and one \n     hundred sixty-six million four hundred thousand dollars \n     ($166,400,000) to the federal government.\n       Whereas, pest and disease prevention and exclusion is \n     critical to all states of this nation and to our populations, \n     in order to protect the health and welfare of the public and \n     the jobs within agriculture and its related industries; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislature recognizes the \n     importance of the partnership between federal and state \n     governments to protect California's food and fiber from \n     exotic pests and diseases, and the importance of promoting \n     the role local agriculture has in supporting the daily living \n     needs of all Californians and United States citizens; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature recognizes the farm worker's \n     importance to agriculture production and the dependence of \n     rural economies on agriculture; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislature recognizes the role the \n     United States Congress played in delivering the 64 million \n     dollar grant from the United States Department of Agriculture \n     in 2001, which was the basis for the Buy California \n     Initiative promoting California Grown products; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislature recognizes the value of \n     federal funds available to support important programming \n     including the Western Institute for Food Safety managed by \n     the University of California at Davis; the 5 A Day For Better \n     Health Nutrition Education Campaign managed by the state \n     Department of Health Services; and the Linking Education, \n     Activity and Food (LEAF) Program managed by the state \n     Department of Education; and\n       Whereas, the California Legislature believes that there is \n     a need, but no state funding, to expand programs that \n     integrate food nutrition and schools, including, but not \n     limited to, local fresh fruits and vegetables in school lunch \n     programs, and educating school officials about on the seasons \n     of state grown specialty crops; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress currently is \n     considering HR 3242, the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act \n     of 2003; and\n       Whereas, HR 3242 would continue the essential federal \n     funding that started in 2001 that helped to support \n     California's increasingly challenged food and fiber \n     production infrastructure with the tools necessary to support \n     food and fiber security, nutrition, and education: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully requests that the Congress of the \n     United States of America support the passage of HR 3242, the \n     Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act of 2003; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-3. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     relative to the Medal of Honor for Valor; to the Committee on \n     Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 848\n\n       Whereas, during the invasion of the Philippine Islands, \n     Sgt. Harvey Possinger, a resident of Stroud Township, Monroe \n     County, went above and beyond the call of duty by rescuing \n     two of his fellow soldiers, Emil Angel and Paul Baehr, who \n     were under intense mortar fire at Belete Pass, despite being \n     seriously injured himself; and\n       Whereas, in spite of his wounds, Sgt. Possinger selflessly \n     administered medical assistance to Emil Angel, inspiring his \n     unit, B company, which two days later secured the area with \n     the help of reinforcements and enabled the Allied campaign to \n     move forward; and\n       Whereas, Sgt. Possinger is a highly decorated combat \n     veteran of World War II, receiving five Purple Hearts, a \n     Distinguished Service Cross, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star \n     for his three years of outstanding military service; and\n       Whereas, Sgt. Possinger's commanding officer nominated him \n     for the Medal of Honor 60 years ago, but the nomination was \n     lost, destroyed or misfiled; and\n       Whereas, the Congress has rendered no decision on the \n     matter: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress to \n     award the Medal of Honor to Sergeant Harvey Possinger without \n     further delay; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-4. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to stabilizing \n     the steel market; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 241\n\n       Whereas, for many years, manufacturers in our country and \n     throughout our state have wrestled with fluctuations in the \n     prices of steel. There are many contributing factors, \n     including the notable impact of other nations subsidizing raw \n     steel products and ``dumping'' them on the American market. \n     The cumulative impact of this instability has been damaging \n     to many key industries; and\n       Whereas, a very significant and harmful development of late \n     is a steep rise in the cost of scrap steel. In only a few \n     months, major increases in purchases of scrap steel by other \n     countries, especially China and South Korea, have resulted in \n     skyrocketing costs of scrap steel, a key source of materials \n     used by manufacturers of many types of products, especially \n     within the automotive industry; and\n       Whereas, dramatically escalating scrap steel costs are a \n     serious threat to numerous auto supply companies throughout \n     Michigan. These companies rely upon the availability of this \n     material at fair prices to fill their contracts with the \n     major automakers. This situation is a major factor \n     threatening Michigan jobs in many communities. The \n     seriousness of this threat to jobs and our nation's \n     manufacturing capacity requires swift action to bring \n     stability to this market: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the President \n     and the Congress of the United States to explore what steps \n     might be necessary to stabilize the steel market in this \n     country in order to ensure the availability of this raw \n     material for domestic\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\n     market needs and help contain escalating prices; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-5. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives \n     of the Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the \n     transportation of liquid petroleum; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 320\n\n       Whereas, regulations restricting hours of service of motor \n     transport workers contribute to public safety as goods are \n     handled and moved across the country. As technology and \n     equipment have changed, these regulations have also evolved. \n     The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration sets these \n     standards to respond to changes that occur and situations \n     where the regulations clearly need to be adjusted; and\n       Whereas, the overall impact of hours of service regulations \n     can vary significantly from industry to industry. Currently, \n     for those hauling and delivering liquid petroleum products, \n     the regulations provide that a person doing so must take 10 \n     consecutive hours off for every 14 hours worked. Companies \n     that transport liquid petroleum locally, however, are finding \n     that these restrictions are a hindrance to their ability to \n     operate effectively and efficiently; and\n       Whereas, the most effective laws and regulations bring \n     balance to the situation or issue in question. The \n     regulations that determine the hours of service for a person \n     transporting liquid petroleum locally need to be modified to \n     reflect the vastly dissimilar nature of their jobs from \n     others transporting similar products: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the United \n     States Department of Transportation to exempt local liquid \n     petroleum distribution personnel from federal regulations \n     that require 10 hours of off duty for every 14 hours on duty; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Department of Transportation, the President \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-6. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the \n     confirmation of the United States Secretary of Commerce, to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 307\n\n       Whereas, President Bush has nominated Mr. Carlos Gutierrez, \n     the CEO of Kellogg Company, as the new Secretary of Commerce. \n     With the work Mr. Gutierrez has undertaken throughout his \n     long and distinguished career with one of Michigan's best \n     known international businesses and the record he has compiled \n     in community life in Battle Creek, the people of Michigan \n     harbor strong feelings of respect and admiration for this \n     talented and visionary gentleman; and\n       Whereas, Carlos Gutierrez clearly embodies the American \n     Dream in the path his life has taken. He came to the United \n     States as a young boy with his brother and parents, refugees \n     form Cuba beginning their lives anew. He proudly became an \n     American citizen, and he has never lost sight of the \n     significance of the opportunities and the responsibilities \n     before all of us in this country. His rise from selling \n     cereal out of a van in Mexico City to becoming the head of \n     Kellogg is an amazing tale of hard work and personal \n     integrity; and\n       Whereas, over the course of his career, Carlos Gutierrez \n     has gained invaluable understanding of the crucial issues of \n     manufacturing and trade in the international marketplace. He \n     has excelled in a wide range of posts, representing Kellogg \n     in Latin America, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Since \n     becoming the CEO in 1999, Mr. Gutierrez has had to make \n     difficult decisions with strong impacts on the economy of \n     Battle Creek and Michigan. His leadership in the face of \n     challenging circumstances has brought significant strength to \n     the company over the past five years; and\n       Whereas, as our country deals with the new realities of the \n     global economy, Mr. Gutierrez's experiences and insights are \n     just what our nation's businesses and working families need. \n     Our nation will be well served by his diligence, character, \n     and talent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we offer our strong \n     endorsement of Carlos Gutierrez and urge the United States \n     Senate to confirm him as the United States Secretary of \n     Commerce; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate and Senators Levin \n     and Stabenow.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-7. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to the United States Coast \n     Guard; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, the United States Coast Guard is a military, \n     multimission, maritime service that has answered the calls of \n     America continuously for over 210 years; and\n       Whereas, over that history the Coast Guard's roles as \n     lifesavers and guardians of the sea have remained constant, \n     while their missions have evolved and expanded with a growing \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard mission is to protect the American \n     public's most basic need, our safety and security, the \n     environment, and our economy; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard responds to more than 50,000 calls \n     for assistance and saves thousands of lives and billions of \n     dollars in property; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard's five operating goals: safety; \n     protection of natural resources; mobility; maritime security; \n     and national defense, define the focus of the Coast Guard's \n     service and enable it to touch everyone in the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, the goal of safety is pursued primarily through \n     its search and rescue and marine safety missions; and\n       Whereas, no other government agency or private organization \n     has the extensive inventory of assets and expertise to \n     conduct search and rescue of both recreational boaters as \n     well as commercial mariners, from the lakes, rivers, and \n     nearshore areas to the high seas; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard provides the first line of defense \n     in protecting the maritime environment through the marine \n     safety program, ensuring the safe commercial transport of \n     passengers, cargo, and oil through our waters, and by \n     guarding our maritime borders from incursions from foreign \n     fishing vessels; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard serves as a global model of \n     efficient military, multimission, maritime service for the \n     emerging coast guards of the world and helps friendly \n     countries become positive forces of peace and stability, \n     promoting democracy and the rule of law; and\n       Whereas, Coast Guard men and women are a highly motivated \n     group of people who are committed to providing essential and \n     valuable service to the American public; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard military structure, law \n     enforcement authority, and humanitarian functions make the \n     Coast Guard a unique arm of national security enabling it to \n     support broad national goals; and\n       Whereas, the Coast Guard is well known for being the first \n     to reach the scene when maritime disaster strikes, and \n     continues to be tasked with protecting our waters from \n     pollution, our borders from drug smuggling, and our fisheries \n     from overharvest as well as additional assignments that \n     stretch its people and resources thin: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State \n     California urges the President and Congress of the United \n     States to fully fund the Coast Guard's operational readiness \n     and recapitalization requirements to ensure this humanitarian \n     arm of our National Security remains Semper Paratus through \n     the 21st century; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States and all members of Congress of the \n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-8.

and\n       Whereas, exploration and discovery have been especially \n     important to the American experience, providing vision, hope, \n     and economic stimulus, from new world explorers and American \n     pioneers to the Apollo program; and\n       Whereas, just as Lewis and Clark could not have predicted \n     the settlement of the American west within a hundred years of \n     the start of their famous 19th century expedition, the total \n     benefits of a single exploratory undertaking or discovery \n     cannot be predicted in advance; and\n       Whereas, the desire to explore is part of our character, \n     and history has shown that space exploration benefits all \n     humankind through new technologies for everyday application, \n     new jobs across the entire economic enterprise, economic \n     contributions through new markets and commercial products, \n     education and inspiration, United States leadership, \n     increased security, and a legacy for future generations; and\n       Whereas, new technologies and commercial spin-offs from the \n     advancements made through National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration (NASA) programs have provided economic \n     expansion and improved life quality to residents not only \n     within the United States, but worldwide, and some of these \n     technologies include the following:\n       (a) Image processing used in CT scanners and MRI technology \n     came from technology developed to computer-enhance pictures \n     of the moon for the Apollo program\n       (b) Kidney dialysis machines were developed as a result of \n     a NASA-developed chemical process, and insulin pumps were \n     based on technology used on the Mars Viking spacecraft.\n       (c) Programmable heart pacemakers were first developed in \n     the 1970's using NASA satellite electrical systems.\n       (d) Fetal heart monitors were developed from technology \n     originally used to measure airflow over aircraft wings.\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\n       (e) Surgical probes used to treat brain tumors resulted \n     from special lighting technology developed for plant growth \n     experiments on space shuttle missions.\n       (f) Infrared hand-held cameras used to observe atmospheric \n     gas plumes in space from the space shuttles have helped \n     firefighters point out hot spots in wild fires; and\n       Whereas, this state has been a leader in the research, \n     design, exploration, and development of space enterprise \n     since the dawn of the space age; and\n       Whereas, space is a $24.2 billion enterprise in this state \n     and generates 133,000 direct and indirect jobs scattered \n     throughout the entire state; and\n       Whereas, our nation's new vision for space exploration \n     charts a new, building block strategy to explore destinations \n     across our solar system with robots and humans, allowing our \n     nation to remain competitive in the new industry of space \n     commerce; and\n       Whereas, the research and development necessary to rely on \n     the initial robotics goal is uniquely suited for the three \n     NASA centers located in our state; and\n       Whereas, the three NASA centers in this state--Ames \n     Research Center in Santa Clara County, Dryden Flight Research \n     Center in Antelope Valley, and the Jet Propulation Laboratory \n     in La Canada Flintridge jointly employ 7,250 people and \n     maintain a payroll in excess of $300 million; and\n       Whereas, NASA's economic benefit to this state already tops \n     $3 billion annually, including over $175 million worth of \n     science and engineering grants to California's public and \n     independent universities, and the proposed vision for space \n     exploration is expected to strengthen this economic impact: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Congress and the President of \n     the United States is requested to enact and fully fund the \n     proposed budget for space exploration, as submitted to the \n     Congress in the federal 2005 fiscal year budget, to enable \n     the United States and California, in particular, to remain a \n     leader in the exploration and development of space; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-9.

This heritage of expanding the \n     boundaries of our national experience has been paramount in \n     American priorities from the days of Lewis and Clark through \n     the exploration of the moon's surface by the Apollo \n     astronauts and of the surface of Mars using the Mars Rovers; \n     and\n       Whereas, the expansion of America's exploration boundaries \n     from the original 13 states to the lunar surface in the \n     relatively short period of 200 years has led to immeasurable \n     benefits to all humankind through the development of new \n     technologies, the creation of jobs across the entire economic \n     spectrum, economic growth through the creation of new \n     commercial products and markets, the creation of advanced \n     educational opportunities, and the establishment of a legacy \n     for future generations; and\n       Whereas, the potential of space exploration has ignited \n     American students' interests in science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics. In particular, the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research \n     Center's education programs are exemplary in inspiring the \n     next generation of explorers; and\n       Whereas, the State of Ohio has long played a leading role \n     in America's exploration initiatives, especially in our \n     nation's aeronautics and space program. Ohio is the home of \n     Orville and Wilbur Wright, 24 past and present astronauts, \n     including former United States Senator and astronaut John \n     Glenn and former astronaut Neil Armstrong, and countless \n     other air and space pioneers at every level of research and \n     exploration; and\n       Whereas, Ohio also is home to two federal laboratories, \n     NASA Glenn Research Center and Wright Patterson Air Force \n     Research Laboratory, both recognized by the United States \n     Department of Commerce for their outstanding innovative \n     activities contributing to economic development; and\n       Whereas, the NASA Glenn Research Center is a world-renowned \n     center for the research and development of many cutting-edge \n     technologies, especially power, propulsion, communications, \n     and microgravity research. It also is a model of creating a \n     consortium of university, government, and private sector \n     entities to foster collaborative research and development. \n     Finally, the Center is the winner of 89 of the 141 R & D 100 \n     Awards granted to NASA since 1966, including the first NASA R \n     & D 100 Award; and\n       Whereas, the talent, technology, and infrastructure exist \n     in Ohio to provide resources that will be key to carrying out \n     NASA's future missions: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 125th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, support the continuation of \n     research and development programs in space science missions \n     in order to take full advantage of the previous investments \n     made in the space stations and other NASA infrastructure, \n     support NASA's goal of returning to the moon as well as \n     conducting excursions to Mars and beyond and hereby encourage \n     the United States Congress to enact and fully fund the \n     proposed Vision for Space Exploration Program as submitted to \n     the Congress in the fiscal year 2005 budget in order to \n     enable the United States and Ohio in particular, to remain a \n     leader in the exploration and development of space; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, to the \n     Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and the Secretary \n     of the United States Senate, the members of the Ohio \n     Congressional delegation, and to the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-10. A Senate Concurrent Resolution adopted by the \n     General Assembly of the State of Ohio relative to mandatory, \n     national electric transmission reliability standards; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, on August 14, 2003, a massive failure of the \n     electric transmission grid caused a blackout affecting the \n     personal and economic lives of over 50 million citizens in \n     the Northeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States, \n     as well as in parts of Canada; and\n       Whereas, cited as one reason for the August 14 electric \n     system collapse was inadequate reliability management that \n     affected the integrity of the system, created an imbalance \n     between supply and demand, and exposed poor protocol \n     practices and communication between overseers of the grid; \n     and\n       Whereas, the result of these failures in grid management, \n     combined with other factors, was the cascading shutdown of \n     the electric grid, causing an electricity blackout of a \n     magnitude unequaled in the history of the United States; and\n       Whereas, electricity is a necessity integral to our health, \n     safety, and economic well-being; and\n       Whereas, the system reliability that is so crucial to our \n     lives currently is governed by voluntary, nonuniform, and \n     often conflicting standards, wholly inadequate to accommodate \n     the modern day electricity market and ever-growing demand in \n     electricity usage; and\n       Whereas, with the increasing demand for more electricity \n     and market transaction use of the grid, the issues of \n     reliability and coordination in the delivery of electricity \n     become paramount; and\n       Whereas, the electric grid originally was designed and \n     constructed to accommodate the transportation of generation \n     plant electrical output dedicated to utility service area \n     customers and interconnections with other utilities has \n     served as a means of ensuring greater electric supply \n     reliability; and\n       Whereas, there is an ever-growing demand on the electric \n     transmission grid to be used for the long-distance \n     transportation of increasing amounts of electricity, in \n     patterns and manners far different than those contemplated in \n     the original design and construction of the grid; and\n       Whereas, investments in our country's electric grid have \n     declined for decades, even as the demand for grid use has \n     increased; and\n       Whereas, the declining trend in grid investment requires \n     federal and state regulatory certainty, to ensure grid \n     reliability and encourage investment that enhances and \n     expands the grid to accommodate present and future demands on \n     the national electric system; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court recently \n     recognized that the transmission of electricity is inherently \n     interstate commerce: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 125th Ohio General \n     Assembly, in adopting this resolution, request that the \n     United States Congress enact laws enabling a national entity \n     to establish and enforce national standards and protocols for \n     the reliability and efficient management of the national \n     electric grid, irrespective of region; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Ohio General Assembly \n     also request Congress to enact laws that ensure that the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has oversight \n     regarding the national electric grid reliability entity; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Ohio General Assembly \n     request that Congress enact laws that ensure FERC authority \n     to require electric transmission owners to participate in an \n     appropriate regional transmission organization, to advance \n     reliability goals in complement with similar mandates of the \n     State of Ohio and other states; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the members of the Ohio General Assembly \n     request that Congress immediately take these actions to \n     protect and enhance the reliability of the national grid for \n     the health, safety, security, and economic viability of the \n     American people; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the Speaker and \n     Clerk of the\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\n     United States House of Representatives, to the President Pro \n     Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, to the \n     members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and to the news \n     media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-11.

The men and women who have served \n     since 1977 should have the same opportunity to take root in \n     the communities they have defended as was offered those who \n     ``made the world safe for democracy'' in World War II, or \n     were called upon to ``pay any price, bear any burden, support \n     any friend or oppose any foe to ensure the survival and \n     success of liberty . . .'' during the Vietnam and Cold War \n     eras; and\n       Whereas, the Directors of Veterans Affairs of the States of \n     Alaska, California, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin are desirous \n     of extending their respective veteran home loan programs to \n     include the men and women of the United States of America who \n     are dispatched to participate in any conflict that has \n     occurred or will occur on or after January 1, 1977; and\n       Whereas, nearly 3 million veterans reside in California. Of \n     those, 1.05 million, began their active military service on \n     or after January 1, 1977, and over one-quarter million of \n     those served in Desert Storm; and\n       Whereas, since 1922, California has operated, at no expense \n     to its General Fund, the Cal-Vet Farm and Home Loan Program. \n     Cal-Vet is a qualified veterans mortgage bond (OVMB) program \n     that has helped 408,000 California veterans become \n     homeowners; and\n       Whereas, opening participation in this home loan benefit to \n     post-1976 veterans requires no direct budget expenditure by \n     Congress and the well-established benefits of home ownership \n     to local communities will be enhanced and expanded; and\n       Whereas, veterans of all conflicts should receive benefits \n     consistent with the benefits available to veterans of \n     previous armed conflicts; and\n       Whereas, those veterans have been qualified for eligibility \n     into congressionally chartered veterans' organizations by \n     prior acts of the Congress of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the Congress and the \n     President of the United States to urge the Congress of the \n     United States to amend paragraph (4) of Section 143(l) of the \n     Internal revenue Code of 1986 to read: ``(6) Qualified \n     veteran--For purposes of this subsection, the term `qualified \n     veteran' means any veteran--(A) who meets such requirements \n     as may be imposed by the State law pursuant to which \n     qualified veterans' mortgage bonds are issued''; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, and to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the President of the Senate, and each Member \n     in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-12. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to border crossing deaths; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, on May 24, 2001, following an extensive rescue \n     search by the United States Border Patrol, 25 migrants who \n     were abandoned by their smugglers were found in the Cabeza \n     Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in southwest Arizona; and\n       Whereas, after being driven for one and one-half hours \n     through the wildlife refuge, the migrants were told by the \n     smugglers that it was only a short walk to a nearby highway; \n     and\n       Whereas, in fact, in order to reach their destination the \n     migrant were required to travel across 70 miles of harsh \n     desert in an area known as ``The Devil's Path'' and endure \n     air temperatures in excess of 115 degrees and desert floor \n     temperatures of 130 degrees; and\n       Whereas, fourteen of those victims died of exposure and \n     dehydration and 11 survivors were hospitalized in the \n     deadliest crossing of the border since 1987, when 18 Mexican \n     men died in a locked boxcar near Sierra Blanca, Texas; and\n       Whereas, since 1994, border enforcement initiatives such as \n     ``Operation Gatekeeper'' on the California-Mexico borden have \n     increased patrols and constructed steel walls near urban \n     areas, forcing migrants to make more dangerous crossings in \n     rural, often open desert areas; and\n       Whereas, most migrants are unaware and unprepared to make a \n     desert crossing, thereby leading to a substantial increase in \n     fatalities due to dehydration in the summer and hypothermia \n     in cold weather; and\n       Whereas, deaths of migrants along the desert areas of the \n     border have increased exponentially since the implementation \n     of these initiatives, with reported deaths increasing from 25 \n     in 1994 to 369 in 1999 and 491 in 2000, according to figures \n     released by the Mexican government, as well as an unknown \n     number of undiscovered and unreported deaths; and\n       Whereas, as a result of the increase in border crossings \n     and deaths in these desert areas, concerns have been \n     expressed by humanitarian organizations, civil rights \n     organizations, churches, and the Mexican government that the \n     United States Border Patrol's current enforcement program \n     effectively is operating as a channeling operation, rather \n     than a general border interdiction program; and\n       Whereas, immediately after this incident both the United \n     States and Mexican governments jointly announced that they \n     were launching an investigation of the incident, issued a \n     statement condemning the actions of smugglers, and reaffirmed \n     their commitment to combat the trafficking of migrants; and\n       Whereas, both governments also recognized the need for the \n     two nations to continue to work together to reach agreements \n     on migration and border safety; and\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush and President Vincente \n     Fox have established a high-level working group on migration \n     cochaired by Attorney general John Ashcroft and Secretary \n     Colin Powell of the United States and by Mexico's Foreign \n     Secretary and its Secretary of Government; and\n       Whereas, this working group on migration and border safety \n     plans to continue to meet to discuss specific measures to \n     prevent future occurrences of these tragedies and to promote \n     safe and orderly migration; and\n       Whereas, at a minimum, the potential solutions to this \n     tragic problem require a comprehensive examination of the \n     consequences of border initiatives, enhanced investigations \n     by the Mexican government of criminal gangs of smugglers, \n     providing the United States Border Patrol with increased \n     search and rescue resources such as lifesaving gear and \n     emergency medical training, and consensus on a long-term \n     agreement between the United States and Mexico on migration \n     and border security policies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California urges the President and Congress of the United \n     States and the United States Border Patrol to proceed in a \n     cooperative effort with the Mexican government through the \n     working group on migrations and border safety to achieve a \n     comprehensive examination of border safety and migration \n     issues, an assessment of the impact of United States border \n     initiatives, enhanced investigations and prosecutions of \n     criminal gangs of smugglers, and increasing search and rescue \n     operations along the border; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, all members of the Congress of the United States, and \n     the Mexican Consulate in Washington, D.C.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-13. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico relative to \n     the preferred approach through which to exercise self-\n     determination concerning the status of Puerto Rico; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 107\n\n       The right of the People to freely choose their system of \n     government and their political destiny in relation to the \n     other countries is an inalienable natural right: neither can \n     legislation contrary to this right be admitted nor can a \n     regime or legislation contrary to the full exercise of this \n     right be admitted. This is thus consigned in several \n     resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations \n     Organization applicable to Puerto Rico.\n       The regime of the political relations between Puerto Rico \n     and the United States of America remained subject for future \n     deliberation since the conclusion of the deliberations of the \n     Constitutional Convention on the political status of the \n     People of Puerto Rico in 1952, which drafted the Constitution \n     of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This by virtue of Public \n     Law 600 of the 81st Congress of the United States of 1950, \n     adopted in a referendum held in Puerto Rico, which limited \n     the deliberative and governmental framework of the \n     Constitutional Convention from 1951 to 1952.\n       The Constitutional Convention of 1952 expressed through \n     Resolution No. 23 that: ``The People of Puerto Rico reserve \n     the right to propose and accept modifications in the terms of \n     its relations with the United States of America, in order \n     that these relations may at all times be the expression of an \n     agreement freely entered into between the People of Puerto \n     Rico and the United States\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\n     of America.'' (Enacted February 4, 1952, and forwarded to the \n     President of the United States.)\n       This expression, based on a natural and constitutional \n     right and of the highest democratic nature, was subsequently \n     incorporated by the General Assembly of the United Nations \n     Organization in its Resolution 748 (VIII) of November, 1953, \n     regarding the documents submitted by the United States \n     Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico. It is thus stated in its ninth enabling paragraph where \n     it is expressed, ``its assurance that, in accordance with the \n     spirit of the present Resolution . . . due regard will be \n     paid to the will of both the Puerto Rican and American \n     peoples . . . in the eventuality that either of the parties \n     to the mutually agreed association may desire any change in \n     the terms of this association.''\n       Since the effectiveness of the present status of political \n     relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States, \n     untiring efforts have been made to review the political \n     status issue of Puerto Rico and the scope of the relationship \n     with the United States of America. Specifically, in 1967, a \n     consultation process of the people was held in which the \n     majority of the participants reaffirmed their support to the \n     Commonwealth option, and subsequently, in 1993, a second \n     plebiscite was held, and once again the Commonwealth option \n     was favored. Finally, in 1998, a new plebiscite was held in \n     which the Legislature of Puerto Rico, and not the political \n     parties or the representative groups of specific ideologies, \n     defined the status options to be presented to the people. In \n     said plebiscite, the ``None of the Above'' option was \n     favored.\n       Likewise, in the past fifty-two years several efforts have \n     been made to have the United States Congress enact \n     legislation that would allow further the discussion of this \n     issue. Specifically, we take notice of the efforts made \n     through the Status Commission during the decades of the 60s \n     and 70s; and from 1989 to 1991 by the U.S. Senate Resources \n     Committee, and in the mid 90s, by the U.S. House of \n     Representatives Resources Committee. None of these efforts \n     was able to produce legislation that would effectively attend \n     the discussion of status.\n       Having repeatedly approached through decades diverse \n     methods, the Legislature of Puerto Rico, exercising the \n     powers and faculties pursuant to the Constitution of the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, proposes a consultation of the \n     people so that they may determine the procedural mechanism \n     they deem proper to deal with the issue of the political \n     status of Puerto Rico, and the scope of the relationship with \n     the United States of America. In this referendum a \n     constitutional assembly will be presented as an alternative.\n       More than fifty years have elapsed since the establishment \n     of the present status, and considering the manifest \n     expressions of all representative sectors of the country on \n     the need to make changes to the present relationship, it is \n     proper for this Legislature to consult the people in order to \n     initiate the process to elect an adequate mechanism to deal \n     with the political status of Puerto Rico and its relationship \n     with the United States of America: Be it\n       Resolved by the legislature of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--Statement of Public Policy.\n       It is hereby declared that the People of Puerto Rico have \n     the inalienable natural right to self-determination and \n     political sovereignty. In accordance thereto, this \n     Legislature declares that, upon the failure of several \n     processes for the exercise of this right, it is imperative \n     for the people to exercise the same through a Constitutional \n     Assembly on the status of the relationship between Puerto \n     Rico and the United States of America.\n       Section 2.--The Legislature acknowledges the Report \n     rendered on March 11, 2002, as directed by Senate Resolution \n     201 and House Resolution 3873, both recommending the \n     mechanism of an Assembly of the People to consider the status \n     issue.\n       Section 3.--It is proper to study and draft the legislation \n     for the people to decide on the desirability of calling a \n     Constitutional Assembly on Status. The legislation shall \n     include the mechanisms to implement the election of delegates \n     and the organization of the Constitutional Assembly on \n     Status, if it is favored at the polls.\n       Section 4.--The Committee on the Judiciary of both Bodies \n     shall prepare a study and report which shall contain projects \n     of law for holding a referendum on the calling of said \n     Constitutional Assembly, appropriation of funds, and every \n     other measure or process needed to implement this public \n     policy. The following shall be assured:\n       a. The effective participation of the representatives of \n     the political parties and the civil society.\n       b. That the proposals to be submitted to the consideration \n     of the people arise from the principle of sovereignty in the \n     future political relationships of Puerto Rico, and be as such \n     defined outside of the territorial clause of the Constitution \n     of the United States of America.\n       c. That the Assembly shall enjoy deliberative and \n     negotiation attributes with the United States Government.\n       d. That every determination of the Assembly shall be \n     subject to ratification by the people at a referendum.\n       Section 5.--The Committee shall render its report before \n     December 31, 2004, and thereby be submitted for the \n     consideration of the next Regular Legislature.\n       Section 6.--A copy of this Concurrent Resolution, together \n     with the results of the vote for its approval, shall be \n     certified by the Office of the Secretary and of the Clerk of \n     both Chambers, and remitted to the Special Decolonization \n     Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, to the \n     White House Interagency Committee on the Status of Puerto \n     Rico, and to the Congress of the United States of America.\n       Section 7.--This Concurrent Resolution shall take effect \n     upon its approval and constitutes public policy until its \n     repeal or implemented.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-14. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to establishing the Northeast Detroit Community \n     Health Center as a Federally Qualified Health Care Center; to \n     the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 68\n\n       Whereas, Michigan's largest city faces enormous challenges \n     related to the health of its citizens. Difficult economic \n     conditions, including high rates of poverty and uninsured \n     residents, have contributed to a host of serious problems. \n     The health of Detroit's residents is clearly a major concern \n     and a threat to the state's future; and\n       Whereas, the northeastern region of the city is especially \n     underserved by medical professionals and facilities. The \n     eight-square mile area being targeted for the establishment \n     of a federally qualified health care center has an infant \n     mortality rate that is twice the state's, a lifespan of only \n     68.5 years, and a rate of uninsured residents over 45 \n     percent; and\n       Whereas, Advantage Health Centers has proposed to establish \n     the NorthEast Detroit Community Health Center, in partnership \n     with St. John Health, under the United States Health and \n     Human Services Section 330 federally qualified health care \n     center program. This initiative would represent a major step \n     in addressing the significant medical care needs of area \n     residents. The facility seeks to serve 10,450 clients through \n     26,100 patient encounters annually; and\n       Whereas, the new community center would provide \n     preventative and primary health care services, including \n     mental health and substance abuse care, as well as access to \n     the full range of the resources of St. John Health. The \n     overall impact of a federally qualified health care center \n     such as this would be substantial not only to the daily lives \n     of the individuals served, but also to the well-being of the \n     metropolitan area: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States and the Department of Health and Human Services to \n     establish the NorthEast Detroit Community Health Center as a \n     federally qualified health care center; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-15.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico relative to \n     the Federal Assault Weapons Act of 1994 continues in effect; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 4623\n\n       A furor has recently boomed on our Island regarding the \n     possible repeal of the Federal Assault Weapons Act of 1994, \n     whose term of effectiveness expires on September 14, 2004. \n     This Act, which bans the use, purchase and sale of 19 large \n     caliber weapons, with the exception of the exclusive use \n     thereof by the U.S. Department of Defense, was established by \n     an amendment to the Federal Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act. Said banned weapons, as they are appear in \n     literal detail in Title 18, Chapter 44, Section 921 of the \n     United States Code, are the following:\n       ``(A) any of the firearms, or copies or duplicates of the \n     firearms in any caliber, known as--\n       (i) Norinco, Mitchell, and Poly Technologies Avtomat \n     Kalashnikovs (all models);\n       (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil;\n       (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70);\n       (iv) Colt AR-15;\n       (v) Fabrique National FN/FAL, FN/LAR, and FNC;\n       (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11/9, and M-12;\n       (vii) Steyr AUG;\n       (viii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and\n       (ix) Revolving cylinder shotguns, such as (or similar to) \n     the Street Sweeper and Striker 12;\n       (B) a semiautomatic rifle that has an ability to accept a \n     detachable magazine and has at least 2 of--\n       (i) a folding or telecoping stock;\n       (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the \n     action of the weapon;\n       (ii) a bayonet mount;\n       (iv) a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to \n     accommodate a flash suppressor; and\n       (v) a grenade launcher;\n       (C) a semiautomatic pistol that has an ability to accept a \n     detachable magazine and has at least 2 of--\n       (i) an ammunition magazine that attaches to the pistol \n     outside of the pistol grip;\n       (ii) a threaded barrel capable of accepting a barrel \n     extender, flash suppressor, forward handgrip or silencer;\n       (iii) a shroud that is attached to, or partially or \n     completely encircles the barrel and that permits the shooter \n     to hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being \n     burned;\n       (iv) a manufactured weight of 50 ounces or more when the \n     pistol is unloaded; and\n       (v) a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm; and\n       (D) a semiautomatic shotgun that has at least 2 of--\n       (i) a folding or telescoping stock;\n       (ii) a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the \n     action of the weapon;\n       (iii) a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 5 rounds; and\n       (iv) an ability to accept a detachable magazine.''\n       In view of this situation, the Police Departments and \n     Mayors of several cities have been lobbying in the Congress \n     and with the Hon. George Bush, President of the United States \n     of America for the approval of the extension of said law, and \n     thus the continuation of the assault weapons ban.\n       The AWL, which bans the manufacture and sale of the above \n     specified military style weapons was passed 10 years ago, \n     however, it included a clause for its renewal this year and \n     for another ten year period until 2014. In order for this \n     clause to become effective it must have the support of the \n     Congress and be signed by the President of the United States.\n       In spite of the ban on the sale of assault weapons, Mr. \n     Bill Bratton, Chief of the Los Angeles Police, has stated \n     that it is not unusual to find this type of weapon in the \n     hands of criminals or gangmembers in his city; however, he \n     reaffirmed that thanks to this measure, local violent \n     delinquency has dropped by 67%. Chief Bratton and the Mayor \n     of Los Angeles, James Hahn, made this call to the Congress \n     and to the President, while other authorities have done so in \n     several cities of the United States.\n       It is proper to point out that these weapons are \n     manufactured for the Army and that they are being used, at \n     present, in the War against Iraq and in Afghanistan, and most \n     certainly are not to be used in the streets of our country. \n     It is imperative for the United States Congress to take \n     immediate action and that it protect us from this type of \n     weapon designed for mass destruction.\n       Furthermore, it is necessary to clarify that in spite of \n     the existence of said measure for ten years, one out of every \n     five fallen agents of the Los Angeles Police Department have \n     been gunned down by this type of weapon in the streets of \n     said city, as it appears in their records and from statements \n     of the Chief of Police of said city.\n       In the case of Puerto Rico, 16 year old Nicole Muniz was \n     gunned down accidentally through the indiscriminate and \n     illegal use of the weapons banned by the federal law. This \n     High Puerto Rican Legislative Body most certainly deems it \n     imperative to do all that is in its power to eliminate them \n     from the streets and the hands of criminals, who take lives \n     right and left, with no regard whatsoever for the innocent \n     people of our Island.\n       Likewise, it also appears in the records of the Puerto Rico \n     Police that most of the weapons seized are designed for the \n     battlefields, many of which became of public use during the \n     Viet Nam conflict and belong to the group of weapons banned \n     in the federal legislation. However, at present many persons, \n     particularly drug dealers, manage to obtain them and use \n     their powerful weapons against the authorities. The design of \n     many of these weapons is altered, including modifications to \n     make them more potent and lethal. Furthermore, police \n     authorities are constantly risking their lives since some \n     of these weapons have the capacity to penetrate the \n     bulletproof vests used as a means of protection.\n       In view of the above, several Island newspapers have \n     published articles on the fact that the majority of the \n     people of Puerto Rico are against allowing the possession, \n     sale and use of said assault weapons, and that the parents of \n     victims murdered with the banned weapons have also stated \n     that they favor the continuation of the effectiveness of the \n     federal law, supra. Therefore, after knowing of the \n     devastation that this type of military weapon can cause to \n     the civilian population in the hands of criminals, this High \n     Body has the moral imperative to make itself be heard, on \n     behalf of the people it represents, before the federal \n     authorities regarding the continuation of the effectiveness \n     of the Federal Assault Weapons Act, and that new and more \n     severe penalties be established for those who violate this \n     Law: Be it\n       Resolved by the senate of Puerto Rico: \n       Section 1.--To state the most vehement support of the \n     Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to the continuation \n     of the ban established in the Federal Assault Weapons Act of \n     1994, and for its effectiveness to continue as well as the \n     ban on the use of assault weapons (automatic rifles) by the \n     civilian population.\n       Section 2.--A copy of the Resolution of this High Body, \n     translated into the English language, shall be remitted to \n     all the members of the United States Congress and to the Hon. \n     George Bush, President of the United States of America.\n       Section 3.--Likewise, a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     delivered to the communications media for its corresponding \n     diffusion.\n       Section 4.--This Resolution shall take effect immediately \n     after its approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-17. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the \n     State of New Jersey relative to making the Republic of Poland \n     eligible for the United States Department of State's Visa \n     Waiver Program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 122\n\n       Whereas, the Republic of Poland is a free, democratic and \n     independent nation; and\n       Whereas, in 1999, the United States and the Republic of \n     Poland became formal allies when Poland was granted \n     membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of Poland has proven to be an \n     indispensable ally in the global campaign against terrorism; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Republic of Poland has actively participated \n     in Operation Iraqi Freedom and the Iraqi reconstruction, \n     shedding blood along with American soldiers; and\n       Whereas, the President of the United States and other high \n     ranking officials have described Poland as ``one of our \n     closest friends;'' and\n       Whereas, on April 15, 1991, the Republic of Poland \n     unilaterally repealed the visa obligation to United States \n     citizens traveling to Poland; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of State's Visa \n     Waiver Program currently allows approximately 23 million \n     citizens from 27 countries to travel to the United States for \n     tourism or business for up to 90 days without having first to \n     obtain visas for entry; and\n       Whereas, the countries that currently participate in the \n     Visa Waiver Program include Andorra, Australia, Austria, \n     Belgium, Brunei, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, \n     Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the \n     Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\n     Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and \n     the United Kingdom; and\n       Whereas, it is appropriate that the Republic of Poland be \n     made eligible for the United States Department of State's \n     Visa Waiver Program: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The General Assembly of the State of New Jersey \n     respectfully urges the President of the United States and the \n     Congress of the United States to make the Republic of Poland \n     eligible for the United States Department of State's Visa \n     Waiver Program.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested to by the \n     Clerk thereof, shall be transmitted to the President of the \n     United States, the presiding officers of the United States \n     Senate and House of Representatives, every member of the New \n     Jersey Congressional delegation, and Przemyslaw Grudzinski, \n     the Ambassador of the Republic of Poland to the United \n     States.\n       This resolution urges the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to make the Republic of Poland eligible for the \n     United States Department of State's Visa Waiver Program. The \n     Visa Waiver Program currently allows approximately 23 million \n     citizens from 27 countries to travel to the United States for \n     tourism or business for up to 90 days without having first to \n     obtain visas for entry.\n       The Republic of Poland is a member of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization, an ally of the United States and in the \n     global campaign against terrorism, and an active participant \n     in Operation Iraqi Freedom and the Iraqi reconstruction. It \n     provides visa-free travel for citizens of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-18. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to psychotropic drugs and youth; \n     to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 41\n\n       Whereas, Federal legislation, known as the Pediatric \n     Research Equity Act of 2003 (S. 650), was introduced in the \n     Senate of the United States on March 18, 2003, passed by \n     Congress in July, 2003, and signed by the President on \n     December 3, 2003; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of the Pediatric Research Equity Act \n     of 2003 is to provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     with clear authority to require pediatric studies of drugs to \n     ensure their safe and effective use for children and the act \n     applies to all medications whose intended use in pediatrics \n     is the same as adults, thus ensuring complete information \n     about the effects of the drug on children; and\n       Whereas, the Pediatric Research Equity Act is landmark \n     legislation that gives the FDA the full authority to require \n     drug manufacturers to test new medicines in children and the \n     full power to order testing of older drugs, including \n     psychiatric medications, that are widely prescribed in \n     children if companies do not conduct studies voluntarily; and\n       Whereas, the Pediatric Research Equity Act will provide \n     child and adolescent psychiatrists with safety and efficacy \n     information about medications they prescribe for children and \n     adolescents with mental illnesses; and\n       Whereas, there are an estimated six million children in the \n     United States between the ages of six and 18 years of age \n     taking psychotropic drugs, including stimulants such as \n     Ritalin, antidepressants such as Paxil, Prozac, or Zoloft, \n     and amphetamines such as Dexedrine; and\n       Whereas, the Pediatric Research Equity Act is timely \n     legislation, especially in light of a recent study published \n     in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine that \n     identified a rapid increase in the proportion of children \n     and adolescents in the United States taking all types of \n     psychiatric medications from the mid-1980s to the mid-\n     1990s and that spotlighted the relative lack of knowledge \n     about the unknown long-term effects of these medications \n     on the pediatric and adolescent population; and\n       Whereas, the Pediatric Research Equity Act will prompt the \n     development of a solid body of long term research and testing \n     that is needed to determine the long-term safety of \n     psychiatric medications in light of earlier ages of \n     initiation and longer duration of treatment and that is \n     needed to examine drug concentrations in body fluids and \n     tissues over time in children and adolescents to determine \n     the appropriate dosage and frequency for youth of different \n     ages and body sizes; and\n       Whereas, prior to the enactment of the Pediatric Research \n     Equity Act and, as cited in the landmark 2000 Report of the \n     U.S. Surgeon General on Mental Health, physicians, \n     specifically child and adolescent psychiatrists, relied on \n     data from studies in adults, any clinical or anecdotal \n     reports of use in child and adolescent patients, studies \n     conducted outside the United States, and the experience of \n     colleagues when making decisions to prescribe drugs, \n     including psychotropic medications, to the pediatric and \n     adolescent population; and\n       Whereas, when prescribed appropriately by a psychiatrist, \n     preferably a child and adolescent psychiatrist, taken as \n     prescribed, and used in conjunction with a comprehensive \n     treatment plan that includes psychotherapy, medication may \n     reduce or eliminate symptoms and improve the daily \n     functioning of children and adolescents diagnosed with \n     psychiatric disorders, and\n       Whereas, the Pediatric Research Equity Act is important \n     legislation that will raise awareness that, because children \n     and adults react to drugs in different ways, trying to \n     calculate dosages on the basis of what is appropriate for \n     adults risks over- and under- medicating children; and\n       Whereas, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, \n     only approximately 25 percent of all drugs on the market \n     today have been tested or labeled for safe and effective use \n     in children; and\n       Whereas, according to the FDA, pediatric testing has been \n     done on 91 medications, which is far less than the 400 drugs \n     for which the agency has requested studies in children; and\n       Whereas, as a result of the Pediatric Research Equity Act, \n     increased testing and research on drugs prescribed for \n     children will help guide sound treatment planning, increase \n     access to more effective treatment options for children and \n     adolescents living with physical and mental illnesses, and \n     destigmatize child and adolescent mental illnesses; and\n       Whereas, children are a unique population with special \n     medical needs and access to drugs that have been properly \n     tested for pediatric use will ensure that they are safe and \n     will work to ease children's pain and suffering or make them \n     healthy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California commends the Congress and the President of the \n     United States for enacting the landmark Pediatric Research \n     Equity Act of 2003 and thereby recognizing the importance of \n     testing the safety and effectiveness of drugs for pediatric \n     use, a victory for children's health and well-being; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Commissioner of the Food and \n     Drug Administration, to the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-19. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to veterans benefits; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 36\n\n       Whereas, in addition to the benefits provided by the United \n     States Department of Veterans Affairs, various states have \n     recognized and rewarded the tremendous sacrifices made by our \n     nation's veterans; and\n       Whereas, the State of California acknowledges the failure \n     to fully recognize and support the sacrifices made by our \n     military veterans, most notably after the Vietnam War; and\n       Whereas, the California Department of Veterans Affairs is \n     committed to conferring and administering veterans benefits \n     provided by a grateful State of California to its deserving \n     veterans and their dependents; and\n       Whereas, in the past decade, the California Department of \n     Veterans Affairs actively lobbied federal legislators to \n     enact changes in current federal legislation that would \n     extend home ownership opportunities for Vietnam War veterans; \n     and\n       Whereas, home ownership is viewed by many as a cherished \n     component of the American dream; and\n       Whereas, enabling veterans to achieve home ownership at a \n     lower cost is but a small reward for their faithful service \n     in the United States Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas, in appreciation of this service on behalf of our \n     state and nation, the States of California, Wisconsin, Texas, \n     Oregon, and Alaska have offered low interest rates on home \n     loan mortgages to eligible veterans for many decades; and\n       Whereas, these programs have assisted over a million \n     veterans in obtaining affordable housing and in making a \n     better life for themselves and their dependents; and\n       Whereas, these states utilize tax-exempt bonds known as \n     Qualified Veterans Mortgage Bonds (QVMBs) to fund almost all \n     of the home purchase and home improvement loans made to \n     veterans; and\n       Whereas, current federal law governing the use of tax-\n     exempt bonds used to fund these loans, as contained in \n     Section 143(l)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, unfairly \n     limits these programs to only those veterans who served prior \n     to January 1, 1977; and\n       Whereas, this restriction unfairly prevents all veterans \n     serving active duty post-1976 from using QVMBs, including \n     over 500,000 men and women who served in Operation Desert \n     Shield and Operation Desert Storm and over 380,000 members \n     serving in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom; and\n       Whereas, these courageous men and women, many serving in \n     harm's way even today, deserve the same benefits offered to \n     their earlier comrades in arms, yet the states in which they \n     and their families reside are being denied the opportunity to \n     use QVMBs; and\n       Whereas, Congress has failed to remedy this discriminatory \n     federal provision on behalf of these deserving men and women, \n     despite the fact that it will not increase federal \n     discretionary spending: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to support legislative action to immediately \n     remove the discriminatory portion of\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\n     Section 143(l)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code so that \n     today's veterans and their families might enjoy the same \n     benefits as their earlier counterparts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States, and to the Secretary of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-20.

A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to State Highway Route 99; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 63\n\n       Whereas, the State Highway Route 99 corridor has the \n     largest urban area not in the interstate highway system and \n     Fresno is the largest city in the United States not served by \n     an interstate highway; and\n       Whereas, studies have long shown that economic development \n     is enhanced in areas that are close to interstate highways; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Central Valley of California has the highest \n     concentration of unemployment in the United States, and \n     unemployment has been a persistent problem that needs to have \n     extraordinary efforts applied to it; and\n       Whereas, the interstate highway system was designed to help \n     all regions of the nation and promote interstate commerce and \n     international trade; and\n       Whereas the omission of highways in the urban areas of the \n     Central Valley from the interstate highway system cannot be \n     justified and should be remedied; and\n       Whereas, Interstate Highway 5 has been designated the NAFTA \n     corridor, even though most of the trucks engaged in \n     international trade and commerce travel on State Highway \n     Route 99; and\n       Whereas, truck cargo volumes on State Highway Route 99 \n     exceed those on Interstate Highway 5 and are among the \n     highest in the entire nation, and this is the only segment of \n     the federal highway system with this level of traffic not in \n     the interstate highway system; and\n       Whereas, any effort to reduce truck congestion and other \n     traffic congestion contributes to the reduction of air \n     pollution, which is critically needed in the Central Valley; \n     and\n       Whereas, tourists to national parks adjacent to the Central \n     Valley generally travel State Highway Route 99 although \n     families prefer to travel to their designations along \n     interstate highways that are known to be twice as safe as \n     other highways, and tourism would be enhanced if State \n     Highway Route 99 is upgraded to an interstate highway; and\n       Whereas, the Central Valley is the most rapidly growing \n     part of California, and one of the most rapidly growing areas \n     of the nation, and future demand will make all of the \n     arguments for upgrading State Highway Route 99 even more \n     urgent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, that the Legislature of the State of \n     California hereby respectfully memorializes the President and \n     the Congress of the United States to enact legislation to \n     include State Highway Route 99 in the interstate highway \n     system only when the following actions take place:\n       (a) The President or Congress requests and is granted an \n     exemption for State Highway Route 99 from all federal \n     interstate requirements or that the state be exempted from \n     financing any costs to upgrade the highway pursuant to those \n     requirements.\n       (b) The current $16.1 million from the Traffic Congestion \n     Relief Program designated for State Highway Route 99, which \n     is currently contingent upon proceeds that would result from \n     the Governor reaching pacts with tribal gaming interests, are \n     expended on State Highway Route 99.\n       (c) State Highway Route 99 is granted a historic \n     designation of ``Historic Route 99''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-22. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to Equal Pay Day; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 66\n\n       Whereas, forty-one years after the passage of the Federal \n     Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964, American women continue to suffer disparities in \n     wages that cannot be accounted for by age, education, or work \n     experience; and\n       Whereas, according to the United States Census Bureau, in \n     2002, American women working full-time year-round earned on \n     average 76.6 cents for every dollar earned by full-time \n     working American men; and\n       Whereas, a General Accounting Office report on women's \n     earnings show that there exists an inexplicable wage gap of \n     approximately 20 percent, even after taking into account work \n     experience, education, occupation, industry of current \n     employment, and other demographic and job characteristics; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the 41 years since the Equal Pay Act, the gap \n     has narrowed by less than half, from 41 cents per dollar to \n     22 cents, and research by the Institute for Women's Policy \n     Research finds that recent change is due large in part to \n     men's real wages falling, not women's wages rising; and\n       Whereas, California ranks fifth among all states in equal \n     pay, yet it ranks 39th among all states in progress in \n     closing the hourly wage gap, and at the current rate of \n     change California working women will not have equal pay for \n     another 40 years; and\n       Whereas, the consequences of the wage gap reach beyond \n     working women and extend to their families and the economy, \n     to the extent that, in 1999, even after accounting for \n     differences in education, age, location, and the number of \n     hours worked, America's working families lost $200 billion of \n     annual income to the wage gap, with an average of $4,000 per \n     family; and\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\n       Whereas, women play a crucial role in maintaining the \n     financial well-being of their families by providing a \n     significant percentage of their household incomes and, in \n     many cases, women head their own households; and\n       Whereas, pay inequity results in a higher poverty rate for \n     women, particularly in women-headed households, as evidenced \n     by figures from the McAuley Institute which indicate that for \n     families that are headed by a woman and have children under \n     the age of five years, the poverty rate is an astonishing \n     46.4 percent; and\n       Whereas, women currently account for 47 percent of the \n     labor force, and by 2005 are expected to comprise 48 percent \n     of the labor force; and\n       Whereas, educated women are not exempt from pay disparity; \n     and\n       Whereas, in 2001 the median weekly earnings of female full-\n     time workers with a college degree was 72.5 percent of their \n     male counterparts; and\n       Whereas, according to the United States Census Bureau March \n     2002 Current Population Survey, women with a master's degree \n     on average earn less than men with a bachelor's degree; and\n       Whereas, the wage gap is even wider for women of color, as \n     evidenced by a 2001 statistic that reported that African-\n     American women earned 69 percent and Hispanic women earned 56 \n     percent of average white male earnings; and\n       Whereas, the wage gap is also prevalent within minority \n     communities, as shown by a 2002 report that African-American \n     women earned 91 percent of what African-American men earned, \n     and Hispanic women earned 88 percent of what Hispanic men \n     earned; and\n       Whereas, even in professions in which women comprise a \n     majority of workers, such as nursing and teaching, men earn \n     an average of 20 percent more than women working in these \n     same occupations; and\n       Whereas, according to the data analysis of over 300 jobs \n     classifications provided by the United States Department of \n     Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, women are paid less in \n     every occupational classification for which sufficient \n     information is available; and\n       Whereas, the wage gap continues to affect women in their \n     senior years as lower wages result in lower pensions and \n     incomes after retirement, and affect a women's ability to \n     save, thereby contributing to a higher poverty rate for \n     elderly women; and\n       Whereas, the average 25-year-old woman who works full-time, \n     year-round, is projected to earn $523,000 less over the \n     course of her career than the average 25-year-old man who \n     works full-time year-round; and\n       Whereas, if women were paid the same as men who work the \n     same number of hours, have the same education and same union \n     status, are the same age, and live in the same region of the \n     country, then the annual family income of each of these women \n     would rise by $4,000, and the number of families who live \n     below the poverty line would be reduced by half: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature hereby declares \n     April 20, 2004, to be ``Equal Pay Day'' in California and \n     urges California citizens to recognize the full value and \n     worth of women and their contributions to the California \n     workforce; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature respectfully urges the \n     Congress of the United States to protect the fundamental \n     right of all American women to receive equal pay for equal \n     work, and to continue to provide more effective remedies to \n     victims of discrimination in the payment of wages on the \n     basis of sex; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to \n     each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-23. A Joint Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the \n     State of California relative to hybrid electric vehicles; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 74\n\n       Whereas, the price for gasoline has reached record levels \n     in California, climbing to an all-time high in Los Angeles \n     and the bay area, and potentially rising even higher during \n     the summer; and\n       Whereas, increasing gasoline prices can have a negative \n     impact on California's economy because rising oil prices \n     drive up the average cost of production of goods and services \n     throughout the economy and reduce the real income of \n     consumers through higher fuel prices; and\n       Whereas, California is susceptible to chronic price spikes \n     in gasoline due to tight supplies of refined gasoline and a \n     lack of competition among the companies that produce and sell \n     gasoline; and\n       Whereas, California's demand for petroleum transportation \n     fuels will continue to grow, and is expected to increase by \n     50 percent in the next 20 years, as the number of registered \n     vehicles in California increases to 31.5 million by the year \n     2020; and\n       Whereas, California's refining capacity has not been able \n     to keep up with the growing demand for transportation fuels \n     and is increasingly dependent on the importation of foreign \n     crude oil, much of which comes from politically unstable \n     regions of the world; and\n       Whereas, this growing dependence on oil from unstable \n     regions makes the state's economy more vulnerable to external \n     disruptions and volatile fuel prices; and\n       Whereas, increasing use of petroleum fuels results in \n     additional climate change emissions including carbon dioxide, \n     and global climate change is projected to cause environmental \n     and economic damage to California; and\n       Whereas, increasing use of gasoline causes a decline in air \n     quality, thereby adversely affecting public health; and\n       Whereas, the world supply of petroleum is expected to fall \n     short of demand after the year 2020, causing the price of \n     petroleum products to increase significantly; and\n       Whereas, on-road fuel economy of cars and light-duty trucks \n     has remained relatively constant since 1985, and has actually \n     decreased in years as consumers purchase greater percentages \n     of sport utility vehicles; and\n       Whereas, most technological improvements to engines and \n     vehicles have been used to increase performance and overcome \n     gains in weight, rather than to improve fuel economy; and\n       Whereas, Californians would consume 30 percent less \n     gasoline by 2020 if fuel efficiency in new model light-duty \n     vehicles were doubled to at least 40 miles per gallon, and \n     that reduction in gasoline consumption would result in \n     increased air quality throughout the state as well as a \n     reduction in the state's dependency on foreign sources of \n     petroleum; and\n       Whereas, hybrid electric drive train technology can \n     significantly increase vehicle fuel efficiency and, \n     simultaneously, greatly reduce a vehicle's smog-forming \n     emissions; and\n       Whereas, several vehicle models, using hybrid electric \n     drive train technology that achieves at least 45 miles per \n     gallon and as much as 70 miles per gallon fuel efficiency \n     ratings, are readily available to consumers in California; \n     and\n       Whereas, Californians would greatly reduce their gasoline \n     dependence, improve their own economic condition, and \n     significantly better the environment and public health if \n     they were to embrace the use of hybrid electric vehicles that \n     achieve at least 45 miles per gallon ratings; and\n       Whereas, the primary purpose of High Occupancy Vehicle \n     (HOV) lanes is to relieve traffic congestion by offering \n     persons who carpool an easier commute; and\n       Whereas, in many instances, California's HOV lanes have \n     excess capacity that could allow them to accommodate single-\n     occupant hybrid electric vehicles temporarily, without \n     degrading the HOV lanes' traffic flow or diminishing their \n     attractiveness to carpools: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the President and the Congress of \n     the United States of America are urged to take legislative \n     action to allow single-occupant hybrid electric vehicles that \n     achieve a fuel economy highway rating of at least 45 miles \n     per gallon, and conform to any additional emissions category \n     of the federal Environmental Protection Agency or the \n     California Air Resources Board, or meet any other \n     requirements identified by the responsible agency, to travel \n     in California's High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes;

A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to protect \nthe right of Americans to vote through the prevention of voter fraud, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Voter \nProtection Act of 2005, and I am pleased to be joined again by my good \nfriend from Missouri, Senator Bond. I also acknowledge the deep \ninterest and expertise of the occupant of the chair in this important \nsubject of how we have increasingly honest elections in our country.\n  In the wake of the 2000 election, as chairman of the Rules and \nAdministration Committee, and then its ranking member, Senators Bond, \nDodd, and I worked together to address the problems brought to light in \nthe 2000 elections. In January of 2001, I introduced the first of what \nwould become several election reform bills. Nearly 2 years later, all \nthe hard work and long hours paid off with the President of the United \nStates signing the Help America Vote Act of 2002, commonly referred to \nas HAVA.\n  This legislation passed with near unanimous support in both Chambers. \nHAVA set forth several minimum standards for States to meet and was \ncoupled with a new Election Assistance Commission to provide advice and \ndistribute $3 billion to date. The goal was and is to make it easier to \nvote and harder to cheat.\n  The 2004 elections were the first conducted under HAVA. There are \nreports of many successes attributable to HAVA, including a new Cal-\nTech/MIT study, which found a decrease in the residual vote rate, or \nballots that did not record a vote for President. Further, there were \nnew requirements for identification while registering or, at the polls, \nnew voting technology, statewide databases, and a broad Federal \nrequirement for the casting of provisional ballots.\n  HAVA was a tremendous success, but all of the cosponsors were careful \nto avoid a complete Federal takeover of elections. As was stated by \nprominent election expert Doug Lewis, after conducting elections for \nover 200 years, State and local officials didn't become stupid in just \none election. Throughout the bill, we remained respectful of the States \nrights and left methods of implementation to the discretion of States.\n  Today, we bring before this body a new piece of legislation which \nbuilds upon the successes of HAVA and clarifies some of the \nmisinterpretations that occurred in the last election. This bill \nprovides State and local officials more tools to ensure every eligible \nvoter casts their vote, but make sure it is counted only once.\n  First, the most important part of this election process is an \naccurate and secure registration list. This legislation clarifies \nseveral provisions related to ensuring that those who register are \nlegally entitled to do so, do so only once, and in only one State. \nFurther, we address the problem brought about by voter registration \ndrives which dumped impossible numbers of new registrations on the last \nday of registration. The bill ensures that only real-life, eligible \nMary Poppins registers to vote.\n  Second, the process of actually casting a ballot is sacred to all \nAmericans. The legislation will ensure accurate poll lists and photo \nidentification at the polls, and will reaffirm HAVA's goal of \npermitting State law to govern counting provisional ballots.\n  Further, for absentee ballots, having them returned by election day \nand requiring authentication of their request is critical. Thus, if a \nreal, eligible, registered Mary Poppins goes to the polls, she can show \nidentification and vote--but just once.\n\n  Third, grant money will be available to pay for photo identification \nfor those who don't have one or cannot afford one. The Election \nAssistance Commission will conduct a pilot program for the use of \nindelible ink at the polls, reminiscent of the Iraqi elections on \nJanuary 30. We were all moved by the picture we saw from the Iraqi \nelections of voters proudly showing their ink-sustained fingers. Aside \nfrom being an act of national pride, it was also an act to ensure that \nall those who voted did so only once.\n  Lastly, the 2004 elections saw new tactics which must be addressed by \nnew criminal penalties for buying and conspiring to buy voter \nregistrations. Further, the destruction or damaging of property with \nintent to impede voting is something that must be prosecuted.\n  Again, I am proud to have been the Senate Republican sponsor of the \nHelp America Vote Act of 2002 and believe it has and will continue to \nimprove the conduct of elections in this country. But much more needs \nto be done. The Voter Protection Act of 2005 builds upon that important \npiece of legislation to combat voter fraud and ensure the integrity of \nthe entire election process.\n  I know Senator Bond, a cosponsor, is on the way to the floor. I \ncommend him for his important contribution to HAVA. I repeat my earlier \ncomments about the occupant of the chair and his expertise and interest \nin this issue. We look forward to working with both of them to advance \na piece of legislation for America that would make it easier to vote \nand harder to cheat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nSenator McConnell in introducing the\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\nVoter Protection Act of 2005. This legislation builds upon the progress \nmade by the Help America Vote Act toward our goal of making it easier \nto vote and harder to cheat, while addressing some additional issues \nthat came to light during the previous election.\n  This legislation will clarify the intent of our previous bill and try \nto alleviate some of the administrative burdens and misguided policies \nplaced on dedicated, hard-working election workers by previous \ncongressional intrusions into the State functioning of running \nelections.\n  Make no mistake about it, record numbers of Americans went to the \npolls in 2004. The overwhelming number of Americans were greeted by \ninformed, dedicated, and properly trained election workers and were \nable to cast their ballot in a timely manner and in a secure \nenvironment. In Missouri, my home State, the elections were extremely \nwell run. Large numbers of voters were accommodated at the polls in a \ntimely fashion, and very few questions have been raised about \nadministration or integrity.\n  I believe our recent enactment of HAVA, the Help American Vote Act, \nhelped make it easier for States and localities to administer their \nelections.\n  I might add that once again Missouri voters voted on punch cards. \nContrary to the bogeyman of hanging chads and other problems we heard \nabout in the past, punch cards have served the voters of Missouri well, \nproving that trained poll workers, coupled with informed voters, can \nparticipate in clean and fair elections using punchcard voting \nmachines.\n  I live in Audrain County, MO, which is a rural county with a wide \ndiversity. It is very average and representative, although I think it \nis an outstanding county. I asked the county clerk: How many problems \nhave you had with these punchcard voters? We have the whole range of \nvoters, a very wide diversity. She told me in her memory and the memory \nof those in the county clerk's office, they had never had a single \nproblem with hanging chads or punchcard machines.\n  Some people are saying the Help America Vote Act required getting rid \nof punchcard machines. It did not do that. Let's be clear, that is not \nrequired by the Help America Vote Act.\n  The smoothness leading up to the elections in Missouri was not the \ncase everywhere. I continue to have concerns about the registration \nprocess and voter registration lists. Election officials are still \nlaboring under an unnecessarily burdensome system heaped upon them by \nthe motor voter bill. Motor voter required States to accept anonymous \nmail registration cards without supporting documents and voter \nregistration cards from election drives. Motor voter prohibited \nauthentication of registrations, making it extremely difficult for \nnames to be removed from voter rolls, such as Mickey Mouse, the \ndeceased, or those who had left the State years before. That is why to \nmany of us, motor voter had become auto-fraudo, and we took steps in \nthe Help America Vote Act to change that.\n  The evidence is still overwhelming that this poor policy continues to \nresult in tremendous administrative burdens on our election officials, \nwith registration lists being bloated and inaccurate but limited \nrecourse for election officials to address the situation. All this \nmakes it more difficult to run clean, fair, and accurate elections.\n\n  The Help America Vote Act required minimum identification for first-\ntime voters who take advantage of the mail-in voter registration \nprocedures. While the law is clear, some States chose to find ways \naround this reasonable requirement. This bill makes it clear that \nvoters who do not register before a government official in person will \nhave to provide the ID requirement. We heard reports of partisan \nelection workers who brought in bundles of voter registration cards, \nand when they told the governmental election officials they had seen \nthe voter ID, those cards were accepted. Anybody who would accept that \nought to be buying the 14th Street bridge. To say somebody who is not a \ngovernment official and is partisan is going to fulfill the \ngovernmental requirements is a stretch too far.\n  Furthermore, in some Federal elections, I think it is past time to go \nto a full ID provision. So this legislation requires voters in Federal \nelections to present identification at the polls while creating a \nprogram to ensure that all voters have access to an ID if they cannot \nafford one.\n  We now ask our citizens to provide a photo ID for so many tasks of \neveryday life. To provide it once more for election officials on \nelection day seems a small request in order to help ensure our \nelections are fair and accurate.\n  If a person does not have a photo ID and cannot afford to procure \none, our bill provides the requirement and the resources to ensure that \none is provided.\n  Let's make sure every legal vote gets counted, and only the legal \nvotes and only one vote per person, only one vote per human. No dogs, \nplease.\n  The practice of dropping off registration cards in bulk at the \nregistration deadline continues. It is proving to be a huge burden on \nelection officials. The practice of submitting cards for fictitious \npeople, deceased, and ineligible voters is alive and well, so to speak.\n  Also, a troubling practice by some voter registration groups has come \nto light--registrations not being delivered to the election \nauthorities. Whether intentional, through oversight or neglect, this is \nsimply unacceptable. Would-be voters place their faith in those \nconducting registration drives, and the States accept the registration \ndrives will be conducted on the level. Sloppy practices can only result \nin people being denied the right to vote. So there must be oversight.\n  This legislation will bring some accountability to voter registration \ndrives while relieving some of the burdens on election authorities by \nmass dumping of registrations.\n  I call on our law enforcement officials, the Department of Justice, \nand our U.S. attorneys to review the process and look at those areas \nwhere fraud has been suggested to find out if it is prosecutable, if \nFederal criminal procedure is required and warranted. I can tell you \nthat we will pass all the laws in the world, but until we see some \nvoter fraud proponents going to jail, spending time in the cells, we \nare not going to have the effect this bill and our previous bill \nanticipated.\n  We need to clean up the registration process by permitting States to \nuse Social Security numbers. I think this bill brings some sense to \nvoter rules by clarifying the provision in motor voter for name \nremoval. The bill also includes a provision for dealing in a reasonable \nmanner with registration cards that are incomplete.\n\n  We found in the past, if you did not specifically indicate you were a \nU.S. citizen, the courts refused to prosecute those knowing they were \nnot eligible to vote because they were not citizens; they could not be \nprosecuted. Now there is a specific requirement that you indicate you \nare a U.S. citizen, eligible to vote. If you do not do that, the card \nshould not be accepted, and if you falsely certify you are a U.S. \ncitizen, you ought to be prosecuted.\n  As we expressed throughout the debates on Help America Vote Act, \nminimum standard requirements for elections are to be implemented by \nthe State. On provisional voting, the language is explicit. Questions \non the implementation of provisional balloting are for State \nlegislators and election officials to decide. But as is too often the \ncase in this country, what cannot be achieved through legislation will \nbe pursued in the courtroom. Some 65 lawsuits were pursued to overturn \ndecisions to preserve the precinct system used at the State level. This \nwas a conscious effort to screw up the elections. Fortunately, the \ncourts got it right. They overruled them 65 times. But there will be \nmore litigation. Therefore, this legislation clarifies further the \nclear language of HAVA that the decision on the precinct system and \ndecision on the proper polling place for voters is a State question.\n  The goal of the lawsuits, as I said, seemed to introduce complete \nchaos which would have ensued were voters allowed simply to vote \nanywhere they wanted. Additionally, those voters would not have been \nable to vote in local elections and balloting initiatives. The purpose \nof the suits did not make sense, but they were filed anyhow. The \narguments for throwing out State law made less sense. It is simply the \nheight of illogic to argue on one hand that States should permissively \nallow voters to cast ballots from anywhere in the State they chose, \nonly to\n\n[[Page S1627]]\n\ncomplain later that the number of election machines at a polling place \nwas inadequate.\n  Many people lodging this complaint also complained it rained on \nelection day. Sorry, we cannot change that by law. So their concerns \nmust be evaluated accordingly. Among other things, the precinct system \nallows election officials to plan for election day, assign voters to \nvoting places in manageable numbers, and dispatch the proper level of \nresources.\n  Once again, after election day, the newspapers were filled with \nstories pointing out irregularities on election day. The election day \nproblems have grown out of bloated and inaccurate voting lists and \nsloppy registration procedures. The stories clearly establish that \nsloppy laws, poor lists, and chaos at the polls invite efforts to cheat \non election day. That is unacceptable to voters and to candidates and \npeople who depend upon a free, fair system of democracy. If a voter has \nhis or her vote canceled by a vote that should never have been cast, \nwhether cast by fraud or ineligible voter, he or she has lost the civil \nright to be heard and to have the vote counted. It is a \ndisenfranchisement of the voter. It also is a grave offense to the \ncandidates who spend countless amounts of their time and their \nsupporters' resources on elections.\n  Our goal should be elections that are free of suspicion, doubt, and \ncynicism about the results. There are steps that remain to be taken to \nensure that elections are conducted in a sound and secure manner so \nthat the integrity of the ballot box remains beyond doubt. These simple \nsteps will begin to clean up the mess created in the registration \nprocess, while taking away the remains of enticements to game the \nsystem.\n\n  I look forward to the debate on the floor about these reasonable \nmeasures. I commend our deputy majority leader for his work on this \neffort, and look forward to discussing this and pursuing it with our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I can very briefly say to my good \nfriend and colleague from Missouri, it is a pleasure to team up with \nhim once again in our pursuit of better elections in this country and \nto report to him on the prosecution front there actually was a \nconviction. I know the occupant of the Chair is interested in this as \nwell. There actually was a conviction in my State for vote fraud--two \nof them--over the last 6 months. We will see whether that has an impact \non habits of many decades that exist in my State and I know in several \nparts of the State of Missouri as well.\n  I congratulate the Senator for his statement.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I salute my two colleagues, Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Bond, for their leadership in this very important \narea, along with Senator Dodd. They spearheaded the improvements that \nwere made to our election, registration, and voting procedures in the \naftermath of the 2000 election difficulties. Clearly, the experience \nover last November's election shows that we have more work before us \nthat has to be bipartisan. They have shown strong leadership, combined \nwith others, and I look forward to being part of that as a member of \nthe Senate Rules Committee. Senator Lott, the chairman of that \ncommittee, will hold hearings in the very near future on this and other \nproposals. I believe it is imperative that we get that process underway \nso, as Senator Bond knows, every American knows they have the right to \nvote, and vote expeditiously, and every one of those votes is going to \nbe counted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct \nresearch on indicators of child well-being; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday know as the State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2005. This \nbill is designed to enhance child well-being in every State by \ncollecting data on a State-by-State basis to provide information to \nadvocates and policy-makers\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\nabout the well-being of children. Developing a set of indicators and \nmeasuring progress of child well-being deserves to be a priority.\n  My hope is to incorporate this important research initiative into the \nwelfare reform reauthorization package. I believe that the Senate \nshould reauthorize our welfare program, known as Temporary Assistance \nto Needy Families, TANF, and we should do it this year. Chairman \nGrassley's interest in a bipartisan process is very encouraging.\n  In 1996, Congress passed bold legislation to dramatically change our \nwelfare system, and I supported it. The driving force behind this \nreform was to promote work and self-sufficiency for families and to \nprovide flexibility to States to achieve these goals. States have used \nthis flexibility to design different programs that work better for \nfamilies who rely on them.\n  Nine years later, it is obvious that we need State-by-State data on \nchild well-being to measure the results. The current Survey of Income \nand Program Participation (SIPP) is used to evaluate the progress of \nwelfare, and it has been an important national longitudinal study \ndesigned to provide rich, detailed data; the kinds of data most useful \nto academic researchers. It does not, however, provide States with \ngood, timely data to help them more effectively accomplish the goals \nset forth in welfare reform. This is why is makes sense to invest in \nboth types of surveys, the SIPP and this bill. As social policy and \nflexibility shifts to the States, the data measuring its effects should \nbe specific.\n  This bill, the State Child Well Being Research Act of 2005, is \nintended to fill this information gap by collecting timely, State-\nspecific data that can be used by policy-makers, researchers, and child \nadvocates to assess the well being of children. It would require that a \nsurvey examine the physical and emotional health of children, \nadequately represent the experiences of families in individual States, \nbe consistent across States, be collected annually, articulate results \nin easy to understand terms, and focus on low-income children and \nfamilies.\n  The proposed legislation will provide data for all States, including \nsmall rural States that cannot be covered under SIPP because the sample \nsize is too small. A modest investment in this bill would offer State \ndata for the twenty-three rural states of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, \nHawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, \nNebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, \nOregon, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. \nMoreover, data from a cross-sectional survey would be available to \nState policy-makers on a far more timely basis than those of a national \nlongitudinal study, a matter of months instead of years.\n  Further, this bill avoids some of the other problems that plague the \ncurrent system by making data files easier to use and more readily \navailable. As a result, the information will be more useful for policy-\nmakers managing welfare reform and programs for children and families.\n  This legislation also offers the potential for the Health and Human \nService Department to partner with several private charitable \nfoundations, including the Annie E. Casey, John D. and Catherine T. \nMacArthur, and McKnight foundations, who are interested in forming a \npartnership to provide outreach and support and to guarantee that the \ndata collected would be broadly disseminated. This type of public-\nprivate partnership helps to leverage additional resources for children \nand families and increases the study's impact. Given the tight budget \nwe face, partnerships make sense.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this effort to learn about the \nwell-being of our children in rural States. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 415\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Child Well-Being \n     Research Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The well-being of children is a paramount concern for \n     our Nation and for every State, and most programs for \n     children and families are managed at the State or local \n     level.\n       (2) Child well-being varies over time and across social, \n     economic, and geographic groups, and can be affected by \n     changes in the circumstances of families, by the economy, by \n     the social and cultural environment, and by public policies \n     and programs at both the Federal and State level.\n       (3) States, including small States, need information about \n     child well-being that is specific to their State and that is \n     up-to-date, cost-effective, and consistent across States and \n     over time.\n       (4) Regular collection of child well-being information at \n     the State level is essential so that Federal and State \n     officials can track child well-being over time.\n       (5) Information on child well-being is necessary for all \n     States, particularly small States that do not have State-\n     level data in other federally supported data bases, such as \n     the Survey of Income and Program Participation.\n       (6) Telephone surveys of parents, on the other hand, \n     represent a relatively cost-effective strategy for obtaining \n     information on child well-being at the State level for all \n     States, including small States.\n       (7) Data from telephone surveys of the population are used \n     to monitor progress toward many important national goals, \n     including immunization of preschool children with the \n     National Immunization Survey, and the identification of \n     health care issues of children with special needs with the \n     National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs.\n       (8) A State-level telephone survey can provide information \n     on a range of topics, including children's social and \n     emotional development, education, health, safety, family \n     income, family employment, and child care. Information \n     addressing marriage and family structure can also be obtained \n     for families with children. Information obtained from such a \n     survey would not be available solely for children or families \n     participating in programs but would be representative of the \n     entire State population and consequently, would not only \n     inform welfare policymaking, but policymaking on a range of \n     other important issues, such as child care, child welfare, \n     and education.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESEARCH ON INDICATORS OF CHILD WELL-BEING.\n\n       Section 413 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 613) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k) Indicators of Child Well-Being.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, through grants, \n     contracts, or interagency agreements shall develop \n     comprehensive indicators to assess child well-being in each \n     State.\n       ``(2) Requirements.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The indicators developed under paragraph \n     (1) shall include measures related to the following:\n       ``(i) Education.\n       ``(ii) Social and emotional development.\n       ``(iii) Health and safety.\n       ``(iv) Family well-being, such as family structure, income, \n     employment, child care arrangements, and family \n     relationships.\n       ``(B) Other requirements.--The data collected with respect \n     to the indicators developed under paragraph (1) shall be--\n       ``(i) statistically representative at the State level;\n       ``(ii) consistent across States;\n       ``(iii) collected on an annual basis for at least the 5 \n     years following the first year of collection;\n       ``(iv) expressed in terms of rates or percentages;\n       ``(v) statistically representative at the national level;\n       ``(vi) measured with reliability;\n       ``(vii) current;\n       ``(viii) over-sampled, with respect to low-income children \n     and families; and\n       ``(ix) made publicly available.\n       ``(C) Consultation.--In developing the indicators required \n     under paragraph (1) and the means to collect the data \n     required with respect to the indicators, the Secretary shall \n     consult and collaborate with the Federal Interagency Forum on \n     Child and Family Statistics.\n       ``(3) Advisory panel.--\n       ``(A) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish an \n     advisory panel to make recommendations regarding the \n     appropriate measures and statistical tools necessary for \n     making the assessment required under paragraph (1) based on \n     the indicators developed under that paragraph and the data \n     collected with respect to the indicators.\n       ``(B) Membership.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The advisory panel established under \n     subparagraph (A) shall consist of the following:\n\n       ``(I) One member appointed by the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services.\n       ``(II) One member appointed by the Chairman of the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.\n       ``(III) One member appointed by the Ranking Member of the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.\n       ``(IV) One member appointed by the Chairman of the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate.\n       ``(V) One member appointed by the Ranking Member of the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate.\n       ``(VI) One member appointed by the Chairman of the National \n     Governors Association, or the Chairman's designee.\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\n       ``(VII) One member appointed by the President of the \n     National Conference of State Legislatures or the President's \n     designee.\n       ``(VIII) One member appointed by the Director of the \n     National Academy of Sciences, or the Director's designee.\n\n       ``(ii) Deadline.--The members of the advisory panel shall \n     be appointed not later than 2 months after the date of \n     enactment of the State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2005.\n       ``(C) Meetings.--The advisory panel established under \n     subparagraph (A) shall meet--\n       ``(i) at least 3 times during the first year after the date \n     of enactment of the State Child Well-Being Research Act of \n     2005; and\n       ``(ii) annually thereafter for the 3 succeeding years.\n       ``(4) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated for each of fiscal years 2006 \n     through 2010, $15,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out \n     this subsection.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 417. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a refundable wage differential credit for activated military \nreservists; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with Senator Shelby, to provide a financial safety net for the \nfamilies of our young men and women who proudly serve in the Nation's \nmilitary reserve and National Guard.\n  Our country is demanding that our military reservists and members of \nthe National Guard play a more crucial and sustained role in \nsupplementing the activities of our traditional Armed Forces than at \nany other time in our recent history. In response to the Iraq war and \nhomeland security needs, the country has called up hundreds of \nthousands of our reservists and Guard members for extended tours of \nduty of up to 18 months.\n  Today, almost 184,000 National Guardsmen and reservists are on active \nduty. Military leaders expect the total number of reservists and \nGuardsmen on active duty for the war on terrorism to remain above \n100,000 for the indefinite future.\n  Since September 11, 2001, more than 2,000 of North Dakota's Guardsmen \nand reservists have been called to duty and placed in harms way around \nthe globe. One of the issues I hear most often about from those service \nmembers and their families is how hard it is for them to make ends meet \non their military incomes.\n  When Guard members or reservists are mobilized, it has an enormous \nimpact not only on their lives, but also on the lives of their loved \nones. In many cases when an individual is mobilized, his or her family \nmay experience a serious loss of income. This is because active duty \nmilitary compensation often falls below what reservists earn in \ncivilian income. In addition, some reservists experienced continuing \nfinancial losses after return to civilian life due to neglected \nbusinesses or professional practices.\n  These income losses are often exacerbated by the additional family \nexpenses that are associated with military activation, such as the need \nfor extra day care.\n  The Pentagon doesn't track the number of reservist families who have \nto live on diminished incomes during deployment. But it is clearly a \nsignificant problem. The Pentagon's Reserve Forces Policy Board says \nthat one-third of all mobilized Reserve component members earn less \nthan their private sector and civilian salaries while on active duty. \nOther estimates are even higher. For example, 45 percent of reserve \nofficers and 55 percent of enlisted members who were activated for the \n1990 Gulf War reported income loss. And a 1998 survey of junior \nenlisted members of the California National Guard's 40th Infantry \nDivision showed that the great majority risked cutting their household \nincome somewhere between 16 percent and more than 65 percent if they \nwere called to active duty.\n  The most recent information on mobilization income loss comes from \nthe year 2000. Some 41 percent of Guardsmen and reservists who were \nmobilized that year reported income losses ranging from $350 to more \nthan $3,000 per month. Self-employed reservists reported an average \nincome loss of $1,800 per month. Physicians and registered nurses in \nprivate practice reported an average income loss of as much as $7,000 \nper month.\n\n  Those were big losses. But when that survey was conducted in 2000, \nreservists were mobilized for an average of only 3.6 months. Today \nmobilizations of up 14 to 18 months are common. So the cumulative \nimpact of lost wages is much bigger.\n  The loss of income that reservists and Guardsmen incur when they are \nordered to leave their good-paying private sector or civilian jobs to \nserve their country often creates an unmanageable financial burden that \ndisrupts the lives of their families who are already trying to cope \nwith the emotional stress and hardship caused by the departure of a \nbeloved spouse, father or mother who has been ordered to active duty.\n  In the mid-1990s the Pentagon tried to deal with this problem by \noffering members of the National Guard and Reserve the opportunity to \nbuy insurance to guard against their risk of being called to active \nduty and losing income. The program sold coverage for income losses of \nup to $5,000 per month. Unfortunately, the program was poorly planned \nand executed, and Congress had to appropriate substantial money to bail \nout the program before it was terminated. Since then the private sector \nhas not shown any interest in reviving the mobilization income \ninsurance program. Thus, we need to find another way to deal with the \nissue. The solution I propose is one suggested by the Pentagon's \nReserve Forces Policy Board, that is, an income loss tax credit.\n  The legislation that Senator Shelby and I are introducing provides a \nfully refundable, 100-percent income tax credit of up to $20,000 \nannually to a military reservists on active duty based upon the \ndifference in wages paid in his or her private sector or civilian job \nand the military wages paid upon mobilization. For this purpose, a \nqualified military reservist is a member of the National Guard or Ready \nReserve who is mobilized and serving for more than 90 days.\n  In conclusion, we owe a great deal to those Americans who put on \ntheir uniforms and serve in the military in the most difficult of \ncircumstances. We can never fully repay that debt. However, we can do \nmuch more to remove the immediate financial burden that many reserve \nand National Guard families experience when a family member is ordered \nto active duty. This legislation will provide those families with some \nmuch-needed financial assistance. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport my efforts to get this tax relief measure enacted into law as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenator Dorgan to provide a financial safety net for the families of \nour servicemembers who proudly serve in our Nation's military Reserve \nand National Guard.\n  Today, our National Guard and Reserve units are being called upon \nmore than ever and are being asked to serve their country in a very \ndifferent way than in the past. The Global War on Terror and the high \noperational tempo of our military require that our Reserve components \nplay a more active role in the total force.\n  In the past, our Reservists were exactly what their name implied--a \nbackup force called upon one weekend a month and two weeks a year. \nHowever, as the Cold War melted away, so did much of our military. \nActive Duty numbers were reduced as our major threat, the Soviet Union, \nfell apart. Since this reduction in our Active Duty armed forces, the \nburden has fallen to the Reservists to ``pick up the slack.''\n  Unlike any other time in our Nation's history, we now depend heavily \non our Reserve component and have called on many of them to participate \nin major deployments, including Operation Enduring Freedom and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. These deployments frequently necessitate \nextended tours of duty, many of them exceeding twelve months, for these \ncitizen-soldiers.\n  These long tours and frequent activations have a profound and \ndisruptive effect on the lives of these men and women and on the lives \nof their families and loved ones. Many of our reservists suffer a \nsignificant loss of income when they are mobilized--forcing them to \nleave often higher paying civilian jobs to serve their country. Such \nlosses can be compounded by additional family expenses associated with \nmilitary activation, including the cost of long distance phone calls \nand the need for\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\nadditional child care. These circumstances create a serious financial \nburden that is extremely difficult for reservists' families to manage. \nWe can and should do more to alleviate this financial burden.\n  Previously, the Pentagon tried to address this problem by offering \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve the opportunity to buy \ninsurance to protect against income loss upon mobilization in the mid-\n1990s. The program sold coverage for income losses of up to $5,000 per \nmonth. Unfortunately, the program was poorly planned and executed, and \nCongress had to appropriate substantial money to bail out the program \nbefore it was terminated. Since then, the private sector has shown \nlittle interest in reviving the mobilization income insurance program \neven though the Reserve Forces Policy Board has sighted income \nprotection as one of its top recommendations.\n  It is critical that we find another way to deal with the issue. \nTherefore, Senator Dorgan and I have proposed the Military Reserve \nMobilization Income Security Act. This legislation would provide a \ncompletely refundable income tax credit of up to $20,000 annually to a \nmilitary reservist called to active duty. The amount of the tax credit \nwould be based upon the difference between wages paid by the \nreservist's civilian job and the military wages paid upon mobilization. \nThe tax credit would be available to members of the National Guard or \nReady Reserve who are serving for more than 90 days and would vary \naccording to their length of service.\n  Now is the time to recognize the service and sacrifice of the men and \nwomen who are in the Reserves. At a time when the Nation is once again \ncalling them to active duty to execute the war in Iraq, fight the War \non Terrorism, and to defend our homeland it is imperative that Congress \nrecognize the vital role these soldiers play within our military and \nacknowledge that the success of our military depends on these troops.\n  I believe that what Senator Dorgan and I are doing with this bill is \nthe least we can do for these men and women and their families. It is \nnot too much to ask of our Nation and more importantly, it is the right \nthing to do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 418. A bill to protect members of the Armed Forces from \nunscrupulous practices regarding sales of insurance, financial, and \ninvestment products; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New York \nto introduce the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act \nof 2005. This bill is needed to protect our military personnel and \ntheir families from unscrupulous financial products. Over the past \nyear, it has become increasingly clear to many that the lack of \noversight in this area has allowed certain individuals to push high \ncost financial products on unknowing military personnel. This practice \nmust be stopped. Our soldiers and their families deserve much better, \nespecially during a time when so many of them are serving at home and \noverseas to protect our freedom.\n  The bill that we introduce today will halt completely the sale of a \nmutual fund-like product that charges a 50 percent sales commission \nagainst the first year of contributions by a military family. \nCurrently, there are hundreds of mutual fund products available on the \nmarket that charge less than six percent. The excessive sales charges \nof these contractually based financial products make them susceptible \nto abusive and misleading sales practices.\n  In addition, certain life insurance products are being offered to our \nservice members disguised and marketed as investment products. These \nproducts provide very low death benefits while charging very high \npremiums, especially in the first few years. Many of these products are \nunsuitable for the insurance and investment needs of military families.\n  One of the major problems with the sale of insurance products on \nmilitary bases is the confusion of whether state insurance regulators \nor military base commanders are responsible for the oversight of sales \nagents. Typically, military base commanders will bar certain sales \nagents from a military base only to have the sales agents show up at \nother military facilities. Since there is no record of the bar, State \ninsurance regulators have been unable to have adequate oversight of the \nindividuals. The bill that we introduce today will solve that problem. \nIt will state clearly that State insurance regulators have jurisdiction \nof the sale of insurance products on military bases.\n\n  The bill will also urge State insurance regulators to work with the \nDepartment of Defense to develop life insurance product standards and \ndisclosures. The Department of Defense will keep a list of individuals \nwho are barred or banned from military bases due to abuse or \nunscrupulous sales tactics and to share that list with Federal and \nState insurance, securities and other relevant regulators.\n  Finally, the bill that we are introducing today will protect our \nmilitary families by preventing investment companies from issuing \nperiodic payment plan certificates, the mutual fund-like investment \nproduct with extremely high first year costs. This type of financial \ninstrument has been criticized by securities regulators since the late \n1960s.\n  It should be noted that there are many upstanding financial and \ninsurance companies that sell very worthwhile investment and insurance \nproducts to military families. They should be applauded for the fine \njob that they do in helping our military members and their families. \nThis bill is targeted at the few who abuse the system and prey upon our \nmilitary.\n  Congress is fully aware of the dangers faced by our military \npersonnel in keeping our country safe from harm. Likewise, we must do \nall that we can to arm our soldiers when they face the dangers of \nplanning for their financial futures.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up this bill immediately so that we can \nhelp our men and women in the military and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 419. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe treatment of qualified restaurant property as 15-year property for \npurposes of the depreciation deduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to make \nthe 15-year depreciation recovery period for improvements to \nrestaurants permanent, and to extend this treatment to cover new \nrestaurant construction as well. Last year, in the American Jobs \nCreation Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-357), Congress set the \ndepreciation recovery period for renovations and improvements made to \nexisting restaurant buildings at 15 years, but this treatment only \napplies to property placed in service before the end of 2005.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will permanently set the \ndepreciation recovery period for new restaurant construction and for \nimprovements to existing restaurants at 15 years. It simply makes no \nsense that the current law providing a 15-year life for improvements to \nrestaurant properties expires at the end of 2005. Restaurants are \nbusinesses, and they need the certainty to plan investments several \nyears in advance. Further, Congress should expand the treatment to \napply to new construction, as well as to improvements.\n  Restaurants are high-volume businesses. Every day, more than half of \nall Americans eat out. Restaurants get more customer traffic and \nmaintain longer hours than the average commercial business--many \nstaying open 7 days a week. This tremendous amount of activity causes \nrapid deterioration in a restaurant building's systems, from its \nentrances and lobbies to its flooring, restrooms, and interior walls.\n  Restaurants improve and renovate constantly to accommodate the wear \nand tear of heavy customer traffic and to keep pace with changing \nconsumer preferences. Clearly, a 39-year depreciation recovery period--\nwhich is what the recovery period will revert to after 2005--does not \nmatch the economic life for new restaurant buildings or for \nimprovements to existing structures.\n  Moreover, permanently setting the depreciation recovery period at 15 \nyears will encourage significant economic activity. According to the \nNational Restaurant Association, a 15-year depreciation recovery period \nfor\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\nnew restaurant construction and improvements to existing properties \nwould generate an additional $3.7 billion in cash flow for the \nrestaurant industry over the next 10 years. If restaurants use just 25 \npercent of this influx of cash to expand and undertake additional \nrenovations, the Restaurant Association study predicts that the 10-year \neconomic impact would be $853 million.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in this effort to bring \ncertainty and a rational depreciation recovery period to the restaurant \nindustry so that restaurant owners can continue to expand their \nbusinesses and provide good jobs to American workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Allen, Mr. Burns, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Talent, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 420. A bill to make the repeal of the estate tax permanent; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Death Tax \nRepeal Permanency Act of 2005 along with Senator Bill Nelson. This \nbipartisan legislation will make the death tax a thing of the past.\n  As we all know, Congress, working with President Bush, enacted \nbipartisan legislation in 2001 to phase out and eventually repeal the \ndeath tax in 2010. Unfortunately, because we did not have the 60 votes \nwe needed to avoid a filibuster by opponents of the cuts, we could not \nmake the repeal permanent. Rather, under Senate rules, the cuts could \nonly be extended for the term of the budget: 10 years. As a \nconsequence, the death tax springs back to life in 2011, at its old \nrate of up to 60 percent and at its old exemption level of only $1 \nmillion. Senator Nelson and I understand that this tax structure is \nsimply unworkable for families and family businesses. We agree that the \nbest solution is to simply get rid of the death tax once and for all. \nThat's why we are introducing legislation today to make death tax \nrepeal permanent.\n  Senator Nelson and I are joined in this effort by Senators Allard, \nAllen, Burns, Inhofe, Talent, and Thune, and we have the full support \nof President Bush, who once again included permanent repeal of the \ndeath tax in his Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal.\n  The death tax is an unfair, inefficient, economically unsound and, \nfrankly, an immoral tax that should be removed from the tax code. A \nrecent survey found that 58 percent of Americans believe the death tax \nis ``completely unfair.'' In contrast, only 10 percent of those \nsurveyed said the same about sales taxes. Moreover, this view is shared \nby Americans across income levels and political parties: 61 percent of \nAmericans making less than $30,000 a year believe the death tax is \n``completely unfair''; 89 percent of respondents who supported \nPresident Bush in the last election and 71 percent of respondents who \nsupported his opponent in the last election label the death tax \nsomewhat or very ``unfair.''\n  And the death tax is unfair, first of all, to the decedent and to his \nor her heirs. We are talking about people who work hard throughout \ntheir lives, perhaps start businesses, or perhaps buy homes in fast-\ngrowing metropolitan areas where real estate values are skyrocketing. \nOr it could be such a person owns a farm or just works hard in a \ncompany owned by others, but that person saves and invests and \neventually accumulates a small but respectable nest egg. As you can \nsee, the tax reaches far more than the ``ultra-rich,'' its intended \ntargets when it was first imposed. The American dream is to be able to \nleave these assets to one's children so that they might enjoy a better \nlife than their parents. It is simply unfair and immoral for the \ngovernment to take more than half of these assets at death.\n  Americans understand that the death tax is unfair because it falls on \nfamilies when they have the least ability to make significant economic \ndecisions: at the time they lose a loved one. Further, it is unfair \nbecause expensive tax planning can significantly ease the effect of the \ndeath tax. If you have the money to hire the right lawyer, buy the \nlarge insurance policies that are needed, and do the proper planning, \nyour family can be spared much of the financial pain caused by the \ndeath tax. If, on the other hand, you die without warning or if you \nhave an unexpectedly large estate due to increased property values and \nprudent investments, you are caught paying a larger tax. Taxes required \nas a result of intentional, planned economic decisions are one thing; \ntaxes on an untimely death are quite another.\n  Not only is the death tax unfair; it hurts economic growth. The death \ntax creates a disincentive to build a family farm, ranch, or other \nbusiness with the goal of passing it on to one's children. In some \ncases, it makes more sense for a family business to be sold when the \nowner retires, since the taxes, primarily capital gains taxes, are \ngoing to be much lower if the assets are sold while the owner is still \nalive. Further, planning for the death tax makes it harder to expand a \nfamily business because needed resources are spent on attorneys and \nlife insurance instead of growing the business. As much is spent each \nyear on such ``avoidance planning'' as is collected in death taxes by \nthe government.\n  The death tax also hurts economic growth by discouraging savings and \ninvestment. Whether it falls on a family business built through hard \nwork or on a family with a home and a lifetime of investments in 401(k) \nand IRAs thanks to prudent living, it claims nearly half of an estate \nover the unified credit amount ($1.5 million in 2005) for the federal \ngovernment. Such confiscatory tax rates give people little incentive to \nsave and invest. What's more, the American people understand that the \ndeath tax represents multiple levels of taxation. Fully 80 percent of \nthose in a recent survey said that the tax represents an ``extreme'' \nform of ``triple taxation.''\n  The death tax has a broader economic reach than to just those \nimmediately hit with the tax. Suppose a small business employs 25, \nmaybe 30 people, all of whom rely on the business for their livelihood, \nhealth insurance, and retirement savings. The entrepreneur's heirs may \nnot have enough cash to pay the applicable death tax, so they may be \nforced to liquidate the business. Depending on who buys the assets and \nwhat is done with them, the employees may now have to find other jobs. \nMoreover, all of the companies that sold items to or bought items from \nthis business might need to find other suppliers or customers, leaving \na hole in the economy. According to the IRS ``Statistics of Income,'' \nestate and gift taxes only brought in about $22.8 billion in fiscal \nyear 2003 barely more than one percent of all gross tax collections by \nthe Treasury Department. For such a small amount of revenue, the death \ntax inflicts a disproportionately large amount of damage on the \neconomy.\n  One of the most interesting statements about the death tax was made \nby Edward J. McCaffrey, a law professor from the University of Southern \nCalifornia and self-described liberal, in testimony before Congress \nseveral years back. He said, ``Polls and practices show that we like \nsin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes. . . . The estate tax is \nan anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without \nconsumption, on thrift, on long term savings.''\n  I urge Congress to act this year to end this tax on virtue, work, \nsavings, job creation and the American dream, and to end it \npermanently.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator Kyl, to introduce a bill that will eliminate the \ndeath tax once and for all. I want to thank my friend for his tireless \nleadership in fighting to completely and permanently repeal this unfair \nand unwise tax. I am proud to join him in this bipartisan effort.\n  First, though, I think a little historical context is important. \nRemembering back to 2001, this body passed a tax cut bill that set us \non the path toward full repeal of the death tax. Under this plan, \nbetween 2001 and 2009, the tax gradually is phased out, reducing the \nmarginal rates and increasing the amount that would be exempt from \ntaxes.\n  Then, in 2010, the death tax will be eliminated. But it springs back \nto life in 2011 at the level it was in 2001.\n  Today, the legislation we are introducing tends to Congress' \nunfinished business. Our bill eliminates the so-called ``sunset'' date \nand, simply put: keeps the death tax dead.\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\n  This is an important point. It is a matter of intellectual honesty \nand provides much needed stability in estate planning. No one ever \ntruly expected the death tax would revert to pre-2001 levels. This was \na quirk of the budget process, and something I always believed would be \nremedied.\n  Without action to create permanence in the Tax Code, this on-again, \noff-again, then on again approach makes estate planning complicated and \nuncertain. As it stands now--financially speaking--2010 will be a good \nyear to die, but dying in 2011 will be very expensive for your heirs. \nThis was never Congress' intent.\n  Furthermore, I believe the cost of planning is a tremendous burden on \nour economy. Rather than reinvesting resources in their businesses, \nAmericans are paying lawyers, accountants and insurers to help insulate \ntheir families from the cost of the death tax. Typical business owners \nare more concerned about avoiding the tax than investing in their \nbusinesses and making money, which creates jobs and stimulates the \neconomy.\n  I echo the feelings of an editor at the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, \nwho in 2001 called this tax ``an un-American drag on the American \nDream--and economy.''\n  Since my election in 2000 it has been a priority of mine to do away \nwith this tax, helping business owners and family farmers to improve \ntheir children's standard of living, and to reinvest in the nation's \neconomy. This is the wrong tax levied at the wrong time; we should not \nbe taxing individuals at death, forcing family members to make a choice \nbetween selling assets or keeping the family business.\n  In particular, farmers in Florida are affected more than their fair \nshare by this tax. With the high price of land, farms can easily \noutgrow the exemptions in current law. When a parent dies, children are \nforced to sell the land in order to cover the death tax. A family \nlegacy is lost, and so are jobs.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill today, and I look forward to \nworking with Senator Kyl as we try to lend some stability and \nsensibility to how taxes are levied at death.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 421. A bill to reauthorize programs relating to sport fishing and \nrecreational boating safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Lott in \nintroducing legislation which is of great importance to millions of \npeople throughout the country. The sport fishing and boating \ncommunities play a vital role in our Nation's economy, and I am pleased \nto be working with Senator Lott on legislation that will directly \nimpact boaters and anglers everywhere.\n  In Wisconsin, anglers and boaters are integral to the State's \neconomy. Our access to the Great Lakes is only a portion of what makes \nmy State an excellent boating and fishing destination. From the \nMississippi River to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin encompasses thousands of \nacres of lakes and rivers; my State is home to more than 1.4 million \nanglers, and a destination for thousands of boating and fishing related \ntourists each year. In 2001, approximately $1 billion was spent in the \nState on fishing related activities, according to a study conducted by \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service. Recreational boating is an equal partner \nto the sport fishing industry, with more than $526 million being spent \nin 2003 on powerboats and accessories. As a recreation for residents \nand draw for tourists, the contribution of water sports to Wisconsin is \nimmeasurable.\n  Today, Senator Lott and I are introducing legislation aimed at giving \nback to the fishing and boating communities. This legislation, however, \nwould not exist if it were not for the leadership of Senator Breaux, \nwho worked tirelessly on boating and fishing issues during his tenure \nin Congress. In 1984, as a member of the House of Representatives, he \nworked with then Senator Malcolm Wallop, to create the Aquatic \nResources Trust Fund. The trust fund, commonly known as the Wallop-\nBreaux Trust Fund, serves as a collection point for most of the excise \ntaxes attributable to motorboat and small engine fuels, as well as the \ntaxes on fishing equipment. The Wallop-Breaux fund is one of the most \nsuccessful examples of a ``user pays, user benefits'' program; the \nexcise taxes that are collected into the fund are then used on programs \nthat directly benefit boaters and anglers. The funding is then \ndistributed to States for activities ranging from boating safety \neducation to maintaining our nation's wetlands.\n  I am dedicated to continuing the legacy of Wallop-Breaux. That is why \nSenator Lott and I are introducing legislation that will reauthorize \nthe Aquatic Resources Trust Fund and expand the size of the Fund. The \nlegislation we are introducing today mirrors the Sport Fishing and \nRecreational Boating Safety bill in the 108th Congress, which was later \nincorporated in the Senate-passed version of the highway \nreauthorization bill. Unfortunately, the legislation was not enacted \nbefore the end of the last session.\n  In addition to reauthorizing this important program, Senator Lott and \nI are introducing legislation that would recover approximately $110 \nmillion per year of excise taxes currently being paid by anglers and \nboaters. Under current law, only 13.5 cents is sent to the Aquatic \nResources Trust Fund, which is only a portion of the 18.3 cents that is \ncollected on motorboat and small engine fuels. Restoring the remaining \nexcise taxes will significantly boost funding for the important \nprograms under the Sport Fish Restoration Act. In Wisconsin, this could \namount to an additional $3 million annually for fishing and boating \nactivities.\n  I am very proud to be working with Senator Lott on this issue. \nPassing this legislation will be a top priority for me in the 109th \nCongress. It is an issue that I know is important to the people of \nWisconsin: to boaters on the Great Lakes; to the Department of Natural \nResources; to anglers on rivers and lakes throughout the state. I can \nassure every Senator that it is equally important to people in his or \nher State, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure \nthis legislation's adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Talent, Mr. Johnson, \n        and Mr. Isakson):\n  S. 424. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \narthritis research and public health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues, \nSenators Bond, Talent, Johnson, and Isakson, in introducing the \n``Arthritis Prevention, Control, and Cure Act of 2005'', and I commend \nthem for their commitment to this important issue. The bill is the \nproduct of extensive cooperation and input from the arthritis \ncommunity, including health providers, patients, and their families. \nThrough this legislation we hope to lessen the burden of arthritis and \nother rheumatic diseases on citizens across the Nation.\n  Seventy million adults--one of every three in the nation--suffer from \narthritis or related conditions, and all ages are affected. Nearly two-\nthirds of its victims are under the age of 65, and 300,000 are \nchildren. Arthritis accounts for 4 million days of hospital care each \nyear, and results in 44 million outpatient visits. It costs $51 million \nin annual medical care, and $86 million more in lost productivity. For \n8 million Americans, it is an overwhelming hardship involving serious \ndisability.\n  In recent years, research into the prevention and treatment of \narthritis has led to measures to improve the quality of life for large \nnumbers of persons suffering from the disease. We know that early \ndiagnosis, treatment, and appropriate management are key to success. A \nNational Arthritis Action Plan has been developed that could provide \ntimely information and more effective medical care nationwide, but less \nthan one percent of persons with arthritis are benefiting from the \nknowledge. With a real commitment, we can bring the highest quality of \ncare to everyone with arthritis.\n  Our legislation will implement strategies to carry out the National \nArthritis Action Plan. That means supporting prevention and treatment \nprograms and developing education and outreach activities. It means \ncoordinating and increasing research for prevention and treatment, and \napplying the results to every age group affected by the disease.\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\n  We include planning grants to support innovative research on juvenile \narthritis in order to develop better care and treatment for children, \nand collect data on its likely causes. We support training for health \nproviders specializing in pediatric rheumatology, so that all children \nwill have greater access to these uniquely qualified physicians.\n  The legislation will improve the quality of life for large numbers of \nadults and children. It will save lives, reduce disability, and avoid \nmillions of dollars in medical costs. Citizens everywhere will have \ngreater access to the latest research and medical care to prevent and \ntreat this debilitating disease. I urge our colleagues to support this \nmuch needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Ms. Cantwell, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 426. A bill to enhance national security by improving the \nreliability of the United States electricity transmission grid, to \nensure efficient, reliable and affordable energy to American consumers, \nand for other purposes, to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing comprehensive \nlegislation to ensure the reliable delivery of electric power in the \nUnited States.\n  Last Congress, in August of 2003, nearly 50 million people in the \nNortheast and Midwest were affected by a massive power outage. This \nevent emphasized the vulnerability of the U.S. electricity grid to \nhuman error, mechanical failure, and weather-related outages. We must \nact to protect the grid from devastating interruptions in the future. \nThat is why I am introducing this bill today to ensure greater \nreliability in our electricity delivery system.\n  My bill, the Electric Reliability Security Act of 2005, will help \nachieve reliability and security of the electricity grid in an \nefficient, cost-effective, and environmentally sound manner. It does so \nby creating mandatory, nationwide electric reliability standards.\n  The bill also mandates regional coordination in the siting of \ntransmission facilities, and provides $10 billion dollars in loan \nguarantees to finance ``smart grid'' technologies that improve the way \nthe grid transmits power.\n  While a $10 billion dollar investment may seem to be a large \ninvestment, it is significantly less than the transmission cost \nestimates that have circulated following the Northeast blackout. \nIndustry experts estimated that it would cost consumers as much as $100 \nbillion dollars to upgrade transmission systems and site new lines to \nmeet future reliability needs.\n  However, even this hefty price tag does not factor in the costs of \nadditional generation, does not consider the rising cost of natural gas \ndue to increasing electricity consumption, and does not include the \nenvironmental and other social costs of continued expansion of our \npresently centralized power system. Power lines are expensive and are \nrarely welcomed by the nearby public. The loan guarantees in the bill \nwill help balance the need for new transmission lines by providing \nfederal resources to help improve existing ones.\n  In addition to addressing system operation and transmission needs, \nthe bill also promotes sound system management. It establishes a \nFederal system benefits fund as a match for state programs. \nHistorically, regulated electric utility companies have provided a \nnumber of energy-related public services beyond simply supplying \nelectricity that benefit the system as a whole. Such services have \nincluded bill payment assistance and energy conservation measures for \nlow-income households, energy efficiency programs for residential and \nbusiness customers, and pilot programs to promote renewable energy \nresources. More than 20 states, including my home state of Vermont, \nhave public benefits programs. This bill will provide needed federal \nmatching money to States for these programs. Our states can use these \nfunds. They will be able to move more quickly to deploy these low-cost \nstrategies with federal help.\n  The Alliance to Save Energy estimates that a federal program to match \nexisting state public benefits programs would save 1.24 trillion \nkilowatt-hours of electricity over 20 years, and cut consumer energy \nbills by about $100 billion dollars. Mr. President, my bill, which has \nthe potential to save consumers $100 billion dollars is far preferable \nto raising consumer electricity bills by the $100 billion dollars to \nraise money for grid expansion. My Vermont constituents would prefer to \nkeep the lights on, and their money in their own pockets. The bill also \nestablishes energy efficiency performance standards for utilities. The \nUnited States has experienced tremendous growth in electricity \nconsumption over the past decade. Current estimates are that \nelectricity consumption is increasing at roughly 2 percent per year.\n  Between 1993 and 1999, U.S. summer peak electricity use alone \nincreased by 95,000 megawatts. This is the equivalent of adding a new, \nsix-state New England to the nation's electricity demand every fourteen \nmonths. Energy experts estimate that as much as 50 percent of expected \nnew demand over the next 20 years can be met through consumer \nefficiency and load management programs. Over the past two decades, \nutility demand-side efficiency programs have avoided the need for more \nthan 100 300-megawatt power plants. However, with the advent of \nelectricity deregulation, utility spending on these efficiency programs \nhas dropped by almost half. The federal government should seek to \ncorrect this trend, and this bill takes a strong first step in that \ndirection by phasing in a requirement that utilities reduce their peak \ndemand for power and their customers' power use between 2006 and 2015.\n  Finally, the bill enacts standards that enable increased on-site, or \ndistributed, generation to reduce pressure on the grid and lessen the \nimpact of a blackout should one occur. We have an obligation, Mr. \nPresident, to ensure that the electricity grid is secure. We currently \nhave a giant system consisting of almost 200,000 miles of \ninterconnecting lines that constantly shift huge amounts of electricity \nthroughout the country. Such a giant and complex system, traversing \nmiles of city and countryside, is inevitably subject to unforseen \nproblems. Simply making it bigger will never take away all uncertainty, \nnor can it eliminate the vulnerability of the grid to sabotage or \nterrorist attack. We should do all we can to make certain such \nvulnerabilities are reduced.\n  In summary, I am introducing this legislation because I feel that we \nshould be cautious in our assumptions that the answer to our nation's \nreliability woes lies primarily in building a bigger, more expansive \ngrid. Simply building more transmission lines is not the answer. \nInvestments in energy efficiency and on-site generation can \nsignificantly improve the reliability of the nation's electricity grid \nand in most cases will be cheaper, faster to implement and more \nenvironmentally friendly than large-scale grid expansion. We also must \nfill the regulatory gaps in the system, which my bill does. Congress \nshould establish mandatory reliability standards and close other \nregulatory gaps left by state deregulation of the electricity sector. \nIn addition, no national reliability program will be effective or \ncomplete without strong incentives for demand-side management programs \nfor efficiency and for on-site generation.\n  We cannot solve today's energy problems with yesterday's solutions. \nMy bill is an innovative approach to ensuring electric reliability by \nmaximizing energy efficiency, regulatory efficiency, and efficient \ninvestment. Given the high costs of power outages to our country, we \ncannot afford to do otherwise.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in my efforts to advance energy \nsecurity and reliability in the United States. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of \n1978 to provide for a Federal renewable portfolio standard; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Renewable \nEnergy Investment Act of 2005 to accelerate the use of clean, domestic \nrenewable energy sources as an integral part of our Nation's electrical \ngeneration.\n  A recent episode of the television show, West Wing, portrayed \nrenewable energy as science fiction. The truth is closer to Reality TV.\n  Eighteen States, plus the District of Columbia, have already \ninstituted minimum renewable standards. This bill would establish a \nnational renewable portfolio standard requiring that, by the year 2020, \n20 percent of U.S. electricity be derived from clean, domestically \nproduced renewable energy including wind, solar, biomass, geothermal \nand wave energy.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I think obtaining 20 percent of our country's electricity \nfrom renewable energy represents the modest end of what we could \nachieve.\n  Let me offer five reasons why I believe we need a national commitment \nto encourage renewable power.\n  First, renewable power would help consumers by reducing electricity \nprices. According to data provided by the Bush administration's Energy \nDepartment, a 20 percent renewables requirement similar to that set \nforth in the bill I am introducing today would lower consumer energy \ncosts by the year 2020. Why? Because adding additional renewables to \nour energy mix will decrease the pressure on natural gas supplies, \nbringing overall costs down.\n  This point is worth repeating. Despite concerns from those in the \nfossil fuel and nuclear industries, the Department of Energy has \nconsistently found that a mandatory renewable portfolio standard would \nnot raise overall energy costs and would have no significant adverse \nimpact on America's wallets.\n  Estimates are that reaching 10 percent renewable energy production by \nthe year 2020 could reduce the demand for natural gas by as much as 1.4 \ntrillion cubic feet, and could reduce the price of natural gas by 6 \npercent. With the higher renewable portfolio standard in my bill, the \nprice reductions are even greater.\n  I have received letters from the chemical industry expressing deep \nconcern about the high price of natural gas, and imploring me to take \nsteps to help alleviate shortages and reduce costs.\n  Much to my consternation, however, neither the chemical industry, nor \nthis administration have addressed the obvious link between increasing \nrenewable energy production and easing demand on natural gas supplies. \nInstead, their solutions have been to open sensitive lands to more \ndrilling, reduce environmental compliance and advance clean coal \ntechnologies.\n  Whatever merits there may be to some of their suggestions, an obvious \nstep that should be taken is diversifying our energy sector and easing \nthe growing demand on natural gas by promoting other clean energies \nwhich can be readily produced on American soil.\n  The second reason for a national commitment to encourage renewable \npower is the public health and environmental benefits.\n  Electricity generation is the leading source of U.S. carbon \nemissions, accounting for over 40 percent of the total. Carbon dioxide \nemissions are the primary greenhouse gas, contributing to harmful \nclimate change. A 20 percent renewables requirement would, according to \nthe U.S. Department of Energy, reduce carbon emissions from power \nplants by up to 18 percent by the year 2020.\n\n  A 20 percent renewables requirement would also significantly reduce \nemissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. These pollutants contaminate \nour water, cause smog and acid rain, and contribute to respiratory \nillnesses. As a result, a renewable portfolio standard would help \nalleviate asthma, which has become the most common chronic disease for \nchildren.\n  Coal burning electric power plants are also the largest source of \nmercury pollution, releasing an estimated 98,000 pounds of mercury \ndirectly into the air, and generating an additional 80,000 pounds a \nyear in mercury tainted waste. A renewable portfolio standard would \nhelp the estimated five million women and children regularly exposed to \nmercury at levels that EPA considers unsafe.\n  And according to the Department of Energy, these public health \nbenefits would be achieved without raising consumer energy costs.\n  Third, a 20 percent renewable portfolio standard would enhance our \nnational security by diversifying our energy supply. As we increase our \nreliance on natural gas, much of the demand may have to be met by \nliquified natural gas shipped to the U.S. from other countries. It is \nunthinkable that we should sink to greater reliance on foreign fuel \nimports when we have abundant, inexhaustible renewable energy right \nhere.\n  Further, much of the U.S. energy system including power plants, \nrefineries, and pipelines, present significant safety and security \nrisks. Renewable energy facilities are generally smaller, more \ngeographically dispersed and do\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nnot involve disposal or transportation of radioactive or combustible \nmaterials.\n  A 20 percent renewable portfolio standard such as I offer today will \nhelp bring the costs of on-site generation down even further, making \nproviding your own electricity a reality for a growing number of homes \nand facilities. In these times when we worry about the potential \nsecurity of our energy grid, that option becomes increasingly \nattractive.\n  Fourth, a national renewable portfolio standard builds on the \nsuccessful experiments by the States. To date, 18 States, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, have adopted mandatory renewable energy \nstandards. These State programs provide excellent incentives for \nrenewable energy. In September 2004, New York created the second-\nlargest new renewable energy market in the country, behind only \nCalifornia, when the state Public Service Commission adopted a standard \nof 24 percent by 2013. Earlier in 2004, Hawaii, Maryland, and Rhode \nIsland also enacted minimum renewable electricity standards.\n  Texas has one of the most successful state programs. The Texas \nRenewable portfolio standard was signed into law by then Governor \nGeorge W. Bush, and administered by Pat Wood, who now chairs the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. These men know the value of \nrenewable energy. Texas now has enough wind power to run about 300,000 \nhomes a year, with huge benefits to ranchers who can lease acreage for \nwind turbines.\n  However, as good as these State efforts are, they are subject to the \ninherent limitation that they can only address electricity sales and \nproduction within their own State boundaries. Yet as we know, \nelectricity generation and transmission are regional in nature. State \nrenewable requirements alone cannot provide the market and other \nmechanisms necessary to address regional and national electricity \ntransmission.\n  But these State programs demonstrate that renewables requirements can \nwork, and operate to the benefit of consumers.\n  Finally, I call for a national commitment to encourage renewable \npower because a cleaner energy future is in our grasp. The U.S. has the \ntechnical capacity to generate 4.5 times its current electricity needs \nfrom renewable energy resources. European investment continues to \noutstrip U.S. markets, but that is changing. Worldwide, approximately \n6,500 megawatts of new wind energy generating capacity were installed, \namounting to annual sales of about $7 billion. Almost a third of that \ncame from the United States, which installed nearly 1,700 megawatts of \nnew wind energy in 2001, or $1.7 billion worth of new wind energy \ngenerating capacity.\n  Yet, renewable energy still accounts for only a little over 2 percent \nof U.S. electricity generation.\n  It is not that we expect this renewable portfolio standard to make \nconventional energy sources obsolete. Undoubtedly, fossil, nuclear and \nother fuels will be with us for some time. But isn't it time that we \ncharted our future with cleaner energies? The potential is there, but \nwe have to give it the assistance of market incentives, as we have \ntraditionally done for our more established fuel sources.\n  I urge my colleagues to again demonstrate our strong commitment to \nrenewables and support my legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Our Nation's highways, public transportation systems, \n     and rail systems drive our economy, enabling all industries \n     to achieve growth and productivity that makes America strong \n     and prosperous.\n       (2) The establishment, maintenance, and improvement of the \n     national transportation network is a national priority, for \n     economic, environmental, energy, security, and other reasons.\n       (3) The ability to move people and goods is critical to \n     maintaining State, metropolitan, rural, and local economies.\n       (4) The construction of infrastructure requires the skills \n     of numerous occupations, including those in the contracting, \n     engineering, planning and design, materials supply, \n     manufacturing, distribution, and safety industries.\n       (5) Investing in transportation infrastructure creates \n     long-term capital assets for the Nation that will help the \n     United States address its enormous infrastructure needs and \n     improve its economic productivity.\n       (6) Investment in transportation infrastructure creates \n     jobs and spurs economic activity to put people back to work \n     and stimulate the economy.\n       (7) Every billion dollars in transportation investment has \n     the potential to create up to 47,500 jobs.\n       (8) Every dollar invested in the Nation's transportation \n     infrastructure yields at least $5.70 in economic benefits \n     because of reduced delays, improved safety, and reduced \n     vehicle operating costs.\n       (9) The proposed increases to the Transportation Equity Act \n     for the 21st Century (TEA-21) will not be sufficient to \n     compensate for the Nation's transportation infrastructure \n     deficit.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide \n     financing for long-term infrastructure capital investments \n     that are not currently being met by existing transportation \n     and infrastructure investment programs, including mega-\n     projects, projects of national significance, multistate \n     transportation corridors, intermodal transportation \n     facilities, and transportation and security improvements to \n     highways, public transportation systems, and rail systems.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Upper Housatonic Valley National \nHeritage Area in the State of Connecticut and the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that is a \nfirst step in giving the Upper Housatonic Valley, a nationally \nsignificant area, the acknowledgment and resources it deserves. \nDesignation of the upper Housatonic Valley as a national heritage area \nwill enhance and foster public-private partnerships to educate \nresidents and visitors about the region; improve the area's economy \nthrough business investment, job expansion, and tourism; and protect \nthe area's natural and cultural heritage.\n  The Upper Housatonic Valley is a unique cultural and geographical \nregion that encompasses in the Housatonic River watershed, extending 60 \nmiles from Lanesboro, MA to Kent, CT. The valley has made significant \nnational contributions through literary, artistic, musical, and \narchitectural achievements; as the backdrop for important Revolutionary \nWar era events; as the cradle of the iron, paper, and electrical \nindustries; and as home to key figures and events in the abolitionist \nand civil rights movements. It includes five National Historic \nLandmarks and four National Natural Landmarks.\n  The Upper Housatonic Valley National Heritage Area Act would \nofficially designate the region as part of the National Park Service \nsystem.

A bill to arrest methamphetamine abuse in the United States; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nensure that law enforcement has the resources it needs to address and \neventually solve the methamphetamine crisis in this country. My bill is \nentitled the Arrest Methamphetamine Act of 2005. It would create a new \nformula-based grant program for States that have enacted sophisticated \nlaws governing the sale of the precursor products used to make meth. My \nlegislation is designed to help communities cope with the myriad \nproblems being caused by meth, and ultimately to stop the growing meth \nepidemic in its tracks.\n  Never before has creating a separate program to finance the battle \nagainst meth been so critical. I am dismayed to see that the \nPresident's fiscal year 2006 budget request mortally wounds the COPS \nprogram and that his budget finishes off the already slashed and \nreconstituted Byrne grants program. These two mechanisms have provided \nanti-meth funds for years now, and each year, the administration's \nefforts to undermine the COPS program and the Byrne grants program \nfurther jeopardize law enforcement efforts against meth and the many \nother important law enforcement-related initiatives that these two \nprograms have carried out for so many years. While I plan to work hard \nwith my colleagues to restore funding to the COPS and Byrne programs \ngenerally, I do not see that our efforts to save these programs every \nyear from the administration's chopping block is the best way to ensure \nthat necessary financial resources are there for all aspects of the \nmeth fight.\n  While the administration was busy slashing the $499 million COPS \nprogram all the way down to $22 million, the meth problems that the \nCOPS program addresses only got worse. Meth abuse, as an epidemic, \nstarted in the West and the Midwest, but has more recently begun to \nmove east. Meth use and production is exploding in North Carolina. \nGeorgia law enforcement officials recently had one of the largest meth \nbusts on record, and Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota have been inundated \nby severe meth problems. In 2003, methamphetamine was identified as the \ngreatest drug threat by 90.9 percent of local law enforcement agencies \nin the Pacific region. By comparison, only 5.3 percent of agencies \nreporting identified cocaine as their biggest threat, followed by \nmarijuana at 2.1 percent and heroin at less than 1 percent.\n  This epidemic of meth has permeated the most urban and most rural \ncommunities. Meth labs range in sophistication from being run by multi-\nnational organized crime rings to back alley cook shops, and they exist \nin crudely converted farm houses and in illicit high-financed \nfacilities run by Mexican drug rings. Meth victims are of all ages, and \nthere is heart-wrenching data and anecdotes on meth addiction of \nmothers, and the impact of adult meth addiction on their very young \nchildren.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arrest Methamphetamine Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Methamphetamine (meth) is an extremely dangerous and \n     highly addictive drug.\n       (2) Methamphetamine use contributes to the perpetration of \n     violent crimes, particularly burglary, child abuse, and \n     crimes of substantial cost and personal pain to the victims, \n     including identity theft.\n       (3) Methamphetamine labs produce hazardous conditions \n     because of their use of chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia, \n     ether, sulfuric acid, and other toxins which are volatile, \n     corrosive and poisonous. When these substances are illegally \n     disposed of in rivers, streams, and other dump areas, \n     explosions and serious environmental damage can and does \n     result.\n       (4) Since 2001, Federal funding has been provided through \n     the Department of Justice COPS and Byrne Grant programs to \n     address methamphetamine enforcement and clean up. Since 2002, \n     although the methamphetamine problem has been growing and \n     spreading across the United States, COPS funding has been cut \n     each successive year, from $70,500,000 in 2002, to under \n     $52,000,000 in 2005.\n       (5) As methamphetamine has impacted more States each year, \n     the dwindling Federal funds have been parsed into smaller \n     amounts. Each State deserves greater Federal support and a \n     permanent funding mechanism to confront the challenging \n     problem of methamphetamine abuse.\n       (6) Permanent Federal funding support for meth enforcement \n     and clean-up is critical to the efforts of State and local \n     law enforcement to reduce the use, manufacture, and sale of \n     methamphetamine, and thus, reduce the crime rate.\n       (7) It is necessary for the Federal Government to establish \n     a long-term commitment to confronting methamphetamine use, \n     sale, and manufacture by creating a permanent funding \n     mechanism to assist States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a program to award grants to improve and \nmaintain sites honoring Presidents of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, \nSenator Durbin, to introduce the Presidential Sites Improvement Act of \n2005. As we look forward to celebrating President's Day this coming \nMonday, I can think of no better way to honor our former Chief \nExecutives than by passing this important piece of legislation.\n  The Presidential Sites Improvement Act would create a new and \ninnovative partnership with public and private entities to preserve and \nmaintain Presidential sites, such as birthplaces, homes, memorials, and \ntombs. It is our duty to preserve these sites so that future \ngenerations of Americans can gain a better understanding of those who \ninfluenced the development of our great Nation.\n  In an era when innovative technology has been incorporated into the \ncurriculum in schools throughout the country, we often forget that one \nof the best learning tools is that which a child can touch and see. \nVisiting the birthplace or home of the same individuals talked about in \nthe classroom or read about online provides a completely different \natmosphere to appreciate history. The opportunity to visit the actual \nbirthplaces, homes, memorials, and tombs provides a real-life glimpse \ninto the lives of our former Presidents.\n  Currently, family foundations, colleges and universities, libraries, \nhistorical societies, historic preservation organizations, and other \nnon-profit organizations own the majority of these sites. These \nentities often have little funding and are unable to meet the demands \nof maintaining such important sites because operating costs must be met \nbefore maintenance needs. As a result, these sites are left to \ndeteriorate slowly.\n  I have visited many of the Presidential historic sites throughout my \nhome State of Ohio, a State that has been the home of eight Presidents. \nI was disturbed during one such visit to the Ulysses S. Grant house. \nThere, I saw the discoloration and falling plaster due to water damage. \nAt the home of President Warren Harding, the front porch was pulling \naway from the house--the very same porch where President Harding \ndelivered his now famous campaign speeches. Fortunately, we were able \nto obtain funding to prevent these two historic treasures from \ndeteriorating further. We need to continue to provide Federal \nassistance for maintenance projects today in order to prevent larger \nmaintenance problems tomorrow.\n  These sites are far too important to let slowly decay. Our \nlegislation would authorize grants, administered by the National Park \nService, for maintenance and improvement projects on Presidential sites \nthat are not federally owned or managed. A portion of the funds would \nbe set aside for sites that are in need of emergency assistance. To \nadminister this new program, this legislation would establish a five-\nmember committee, including the Director of the National Park Service, \na member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and a State \nhistoric preservation officer. This committee would make grant \nrecommendations to the Secretary of the Interior. Each grant would \nrequire that half of the funds come from non-Federal sources. Up to $5 \nmillion would be made available annually.\n  The Presidential Sites Improvement Act would make sure that every \nAmerican has the chance to appreciate a real piece of history--a chance \nat understanding the lives of the great men who have led our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation I have just \nintroduced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 431\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Sites \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are many sites honoring Presidents located \n     throughout the United States, including Presidential \n     birthplaces, homes, museums, burial sites, and tombs;\n       (2) most of the sites are owned, operated, and maintained \n     by non-Federal entities such as State and local agencies, \n     family foundations, colleges and universities, libraries, \n     historical societies, historic preservation organizations, \n     and other nonprofit organizations;\n       (3) Presidential sites are often expensive to maintain;\n       (4) many Presidential sites are in need of capital, \n     technological, and interpretive display improvements for \n     which funding is insufficient or unavailable; and\n       (5) to promote understanding of the history of the United \n     States by recognizing and preserving historic sites linked to \n     Presidents of the United States, the Federal Government \n     should provide grants for the maintenance and improvement of \n     Presidential sites.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a digital and wireless network technology \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today, with my colleagues, Senators Talent, \nGraham, McCain, Lott, Warner, Grassley and Thune, I rise to introduce \nthe Minority Serving Institution Digital & Wireless Technology \nOpportunity Act of 2005.\n  This legislation will provide vital resources to address the \ntechnology gap that exists at many Minority Serving Institutions, MSIs. \nWith this legislation together, as a country, we move one step closer \nto eliminating what I like to call the ``economic opportunity divide'' \nthat exists between Minority Serving Institutions and non-minority \ninstitutions of higher education.\n  This legislation will establish a new grant program that provides up \nto $250 million a year to help Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges \nupgrade their technology and communications infrastructure.\n  Since before I was elected to the Senate, my goal has always been to \nlook for ways to improve education and empower all of our young \npeople--regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion or economic \nbackground--to compete and succeed in life.\n  With over 200 Hispanic Serving Institutions; over 100 Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities and 34 tribal colleges throughout our \ncountry, it is clear that Minority Serving Institutions provide a \nvaluable service to the educational strength and future growth of our \nNation.\n  These institutions must have the technology capabilities and \ninfrastructure available to their students and faculty to successfully \ncompete and succeed in today's workforce.\n  Our goal with this legislation is clear--by increasing access to \ntechnology and addressing the technological disparities that exist at \nMinority Serving Institutions we will provide our young people with \nimportant tools for success, both in the classroom and in the \nworkforce.\n  This nation's economic stability and growth are increasingly \ndependent on a growing portion of the workforce possessing \ntechnological skills.\n  African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans constitute one-\nquarter of the total U.S. workforce. Approximately, one-third of all \nstudents of color in this nation are educated at Minority Serving \nInstitutions. It is estimated that in 10 years minorities will comprise \nnearly 40 percent of all college-age Americans.\n  Yet, members of these minorities represent only 7 percent of the U.S. \ncomputer and information science workforce; 6 percent of the \nengineering workforce; and less than 2 percent of the computer science \nfaculty.\n  At the same time, we know that 60 percent of all jobs require \ninformation technology skills and these jobs pay significantly higher \nsalaries than jobs of a non-technical nature.\n  I am proud to say Virginia is home to five Historically Black \nColleges & Universities--Norfolk State University, St. Paul's College, \nVirginia Union University, Hampton University and Virginia State \nUniversity.\n  Mr. President, we must ensure that the students attending these \nminority institutions are competing on a level playing field when it \ncomes to technology skills and development.\n  We must tap the talent and potential of these students to ensure that \nAmerica's workforce is prepared to lead the world.\n  The legislation allows eligible institutions the opportunity through \ngrants, contracts or cooperative agreements to acquire equipment, \ninstrumentation, networking capability, hardware and software, digital \nnetwork technology and wireless technology/infrastructure--such as \nwireless fidelity or WiFi--to develop and provide educational services.\n  Additionally, the grants can be used for equipment upgrades, \ntechnology training and hardware/software acquisition. A Minority \nServing Institution also can use the funds to offer its students \nuniversal access to campus networks, dramatically increase their \nconnectivity rates, or make necessary infrastructure improvements.\n  The best jobs in the future will go to those who are the best \nprepared. However, I am increasingly concerned that when it comes to \nhigh technology jobs--which pay higher wages--this\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\ncountry runs the risk of economically limiting many college students in \nour society. It is important for all Americans that we close this \nopportunity gap.\n  Providing equal technological opportunities for all Americans will \nhave a positive impact on our education system, our economic \ncompetitiveness and future generations of innovators and leaders.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation. This \nexact legislation passed the Senate last year 97-0.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for joining me today in \ncosponsoring this legislation and I look forward to working with fellow \nSenators to push this important measure across the goal-line so that \nmany more college students are provided access to better technology and \neducation, and most importantly, even greater opportunities in life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN:\n  S. 433. A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ndevelop and implement standards for the operation of non-scheduled, \ncommercial air carrier (air charter) and general aviation operations at \nRonald Reagan Washington National Airport; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould re-open Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to all \naviation. Since the tragic attacks of September 11, 2001, general \naviation flights have not been permitted to operate in and out of \nReagan National Airport. My legislation would direct the executive \nbranch to develop and implement standards for the resumption of general \naviation flights.\n  The closing of Reagan National to general aviation was \nunderstandable, prudent and tolerable in the weeks and months following \nthe tragedy of September 11. The safety and security of the capital \nregion is paramount and will always guide our decisions. But, despite \nCongressional action mandating a detailed plan to re-open the airport \nto general aviation following a massive strengthening of our airports \nand air traffic control system serving the Washington area, the Federal \nGovernment has done little to develop a plan that would allow for the \nuse of Reagan National for private aircraft.\n  Closing Reagan National to general aviation has had a substantial \nnegative effect on jobs and the economy of the capital region. Non-\nscheduled air carrier operations at Reagan National once generated an \nestimated $50 million a year in direct economic activity from charter \nrevenue, aircraft handling and refueling services. The lack of charter \nand general aviation passengers coming into the city, hotels, \nrestaurants and other service businesses near Reagan National have \nsuffered a significant, negative economic impact as well.\n  Since September 11, 2001, air charter operators have participated in \na rigorous security program that makes their operations just as safe, \nif not safer, than those of commercial airlines. Charter operators also \nhave the capability to check the names of their passengers against \ngovernment terrorist watch lists. Given the unique location of the \nairport, stakeholders in the general aviation industry are willing to \ncomply with virtually any rational government policy that would grant \naccess to Reagan National for general aviation aircraft. Such proposals \ninclude using ``gateway'' airports in which all flights into Reagan \nNational must first land for additional screening, and added screening \nof pilots and passengers. There are also new technological advances \nthat could be required for private planes using Reagan National. \nNotwithstanding the willingness of those in general aviation to comply \nwith reasonable security procedures that may be implemented, government \nagencies have remained stolidly silent on the issue.\n  That is why I have decided to introduce legislation directing the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to finalize and implement regulations \nthat would again allow general aviation flights to operate at Reagan \nNational. The measure allows for reasonable requirements to ensure the \nsecurity of operations at Reagan National. The requirements include \nscreening and certification of flight and ground crews; advance \nclearance of passenger manifests; physical screening of passengers and \nluggage; the physical inspection of aircraft; special flight procedures \nand limiting the airports from which flights can originate.\n  The Government was able to find conditions under which commercial \naviation could operate out of Reagan National following the September \n11 terrorist attacks. I see no reason why similar conditions or \nrequirements could not be developed to allow for general aviation to \nalso begin operations again.\n  Congressionally mandated actions on this issue have yet to result in \na plan or set of circumstances that would fully re-open Reagan \nNational. Thus, I believe it is necessary to introduce legislation that \nwould direct the Department of Homeland Security to do so.\n  I agree that security is the most important factor in this debate; \nhowever I also believe reasonable requirements can be put in place to \nensure the safety of general aviation flights and help the local \nbusinesses that depend on this mode of transportation for their \nlivelihood.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 436. A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to assess the \neconomic implications of the dependence of the State of Hawaii on oil \nas the principal source of energy for the State; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in the shadow of crude oil prices that have \nreached nearly $50 per barrel, and with the specter of higher gasoline \nprices forecast by the Department of Energy's Energy Information \nAdministration, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help Hawaii \nand potentially other insular areas grapple with the difficult choices \nahead with respect to energy independence.\n  The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to assess the short- and \nlong-term prospects of oil supply disruptions and price volatility and \ntheir impacts on Hawaii. It also directs the Secretary to assess the \neconomic relationship between oil-fired generation of electricity from \nresidual fuel and refined products consumed for transportation needs of \nHawaii. Hawaii uses crude oil to produce electricity, gasoline, and jet \nfuel. Changing the mix of these products will have significant economic \nimplications for Hawaii. We need to have a clear picture of the impacts \nof going down these roads to a different energy mix. In addition, the \nstudy would address the technical and economic feasibility of \nincreasing the contribution of renewable energy resources and the use \nof liquified natural gas, LNG, for generating electricity and other \nneeds. In Hawaii, the costs of gasoline, electricity, and jet fuel are \nintertwined in an intricate relationship, because they all come from \nthe same feedstock, and changes in the use of one could potentially \ndrive consumer prices up or down. We need to know the implications of \nincreasing the percentage of renewable sources of energy or switching \nto LNG, and whether these choices will leave us enough residual fuel \nfor our transportation system and jets. Finally, the bill calls for an \nanalysis of the feasibility of production and use of hydrogen from \nrenewable resources on an island-by-island basis, an energy source I \nhave championed for a long time.\n  Hawaii is heavily dependent on imported oil. About 90 percent of the \nState's energy needs for residents and visitors is produced by refining \nand burning crude oil. We import 28 percent of our oil from Alaska, but \n72 percent comes from foreign sources including Indonesia, China, Papua \nNew Guinea, and Vietnam. We use 26 percent of the oil for generating \nelectricity. Being an island State, marine transportation between the \nislands is very important. Air transport for residents of Hawaii, as \nwell as for our tourism industry, is critical. For many high school \nathletic and academic teams to compete in intramural activities, it \nmeans getting on planes to go to another island. Many families live on \nmultiple islands. We use 32 percent of the oil for air transportation, \nand 23 percent for ground and marine transportation. My State's \ndependence on oil poses potential risks to Hawaii from sudden price \nincreases or supply disruptions as were experienced several times in \nthe last five years alone.\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\n  Hawaii uses its energy very efficiently. Our per capita energy use is \nwell below the national average. In part, this is due to the fact that \nHawaii is blessed with comfortable climate and short driving distances. \nNonetheless, we have been paying some of the highest prices in the \nNation for our energy. We continue to have the highest gasoline prices \nin the country. For a long time our electricity rates also have been \nthe highest in the country. Consistent high energy prices affect the \neconomic vitality of the State. Before we invest in a different energy \nmix and infrastructure, we need to make transparent all the relations \nbetween fuels and the consequences of the directions we choose.\n  Our State has been proactive in seeking energy solutions. The State \nof Hawaii has income tax credits for the installation of solar, \nphotovoltaic, and wind energy. Hawaii has the largest solar water \nheating program in the Nation. Governor Linda Lingle has called for a \n20 percent renewable energy standard by 2020. Last year we obtained \nabout 7 percent of electricity sales from renewable sources, compared \nwith a national average of about 2 percent. The Hawaiian Electric \nCompany, HECO, Hawaii's largest utility, announced in January 2003 the \nformation of a new subsidiary that will invest in renewable energy \nprojects for Hawaii.\n  The Hawaii Energy Policy Forum, a deliberative body of over 40 \ncommunity leaders and energy stakeholders, met many times over a period \nof a year and developed an energy vision for Hawaii through the year \n2030. Its report, ``Hawaii at the Crossroads; A Long-Term Energy \nStrategy,'' identifies strategic principles for Hawaii's future, \nincluding diversifying the sources of imported energy and beginning the \ntransition to a long-term hydrogen economy.\n  Mr. President, energy security includes supply security, price \nsecurity, and economic security. Supply security means ensuring that \nenergy is available despite market disruptions elsewhere. Price \nsecurity means that energy consumers are protected against price \nfluctuations and chronically high prices. Economic security results \nfrom both of the above. Hawaii is dependent on oil for both \ntransportation and electricity in ways that are without parallel in \ncontinental States. Hawaii also has an abundance of renewable energy \nresources. It is the intent of this bill to assess these challenges and \nopportunities, and to help us develop a suitable roadmap for Hawaii's \nenergy future. This bill will help Hawaii identify the challenges and \ndecision points along the way to energy security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. HAWAII ENERGY ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Assessment.--The Secretary of Energy shall assess the \n     economic implications of the dependence of the State of \n     Hawaii on oil as the principal source of energy for the \n     State, including--\n       (1) the short- and long-term prospects for crude oil supply \n     disruption and price volatility and potential impacts on the \n     economy of Hawaii;\n       (2) the economic relationship between oil-fired generation \n     of electricity from residual fuel and refined petroleum \n     products consumed for ground, marine, and air transportation;\n       (3) the technical and economic feasibility of increasing \n     the contribution of renewable energy resources for generation \n     of electricity, on an island-by-island basis, including--\n       (A) siting and facility configuration;\n       (B) environmental, operational, and safety considerations;\n       (C) the availability of technology;\n       (D) effects on the utility system including reliability;\n       (E) infrastructure and transport requirements;\n       (F) community support; and\n       (G) other factors affecting the economic impact of such an \n     increase and any effect on the economic relationship \n     described in paragraph (2);\n       (4) the technical and economic feasibility of using \n     liquefied natural gas to displace residual fuel oil for \n     electric generation, including neighbor island opportunities, \n     and the effect of the displacement on the economic \n     relationship described in paragraph (2), including--\n       (A) the availability of supply;\n       (B) siting and facility configuration for onshore and \n     offshore liquefied natural gas receiving terminals;\n       (C) the factors described in subparagraphs (B) through (F) \n     of paragraph (3); and\n       (D) other economic factors;\n       (5) the technical and economic feasibility of using \n     renewable energy sources (including hydrogen) for ground, \n     marine, and air transportation energy applications to \n     displace the use of refined petroleum products, on an island-\n     by-island basis, and the economic impact of the displacement \n     on the relationship described in (2); and\n       (6) an island-by-island approach to--\n       (A) the development of hydrogen from renewable resources; \n     and\n       (B) the application of hydrogen to the energy needs of \n     Hawaii\n       (b) Contracting Authority.--The Secretary of Energy may \n     carry out the assessment under subsection (a) directly or, in \n     whole or in part, through 1 or more contracts with qualified \n     public or private entities.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 300 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall prepare, \n     in consultation with agencies of the State of Hawaii and \n     other stakeholders, as appropriate, and submit to Congress, a \n     report detailing the findings, conclusions, and \n     recommendations resulting from the assessment.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 437. A bill to expedite review of the grand River Band of Ottawa \nIndians of Michigan to secure a timely and just determination of \nwhether that group is entitled to recognition as a Federal Indian \ntribe; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nbill to address an inequity to one of Michigan's Native American \ntribes. The Grand River Band of Ottawa Indians, commonly referred to as \nthe Grand River Band, has been in some form indigenous to the State of \nMichigan for over 200 years. The Grand River Band consists of the 19 \nbands of Indians who occupied the territory along the Grand River in \nwhat is now southwest Michigan, including the cities of Grand Rapids \nand Muskegon. The members of the Grand River Band are the descendants \nand political successors to signatories of the 1821 Treaty of Chicago \nand the 1836 Treaty of Washington. They are also one of six tribes who \nis an original signatory of the 1855 Treaty of Detroit. However, the \nGrand River Band is the only one of those tribes which is not \nrecognized by the Federal Government.\n  The bill I am introducing today with my colleague, Senator Stabenow, \nwill direct the Bureau of Indian Affairs at the Department of Interior \nto make a recognition determination in a timely manner. Let me be \nclear--this bill does not federally recognize the tribe nor does it \naddress the issue of gaming. I hope that this legislation will help to \naddress this inequity to the Grand River Band and provide a timely \nremedy so that the tribe can enjoy the full benefits and status of \nFederal recognition.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      BY Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Hatch):\n  S. 438. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the medicare outpatient rehabilitation therapy caps; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the Medicare \nAccess to Rehabilitation Services Act to improve the Medicare program \nfor our senior citizens. The bill, which enjoyed the support of a \nmajority of the Senate in the 108th Congress, would repeal the \nbeneficiary cap on rehabilitation therapy care and ensure quality \nhealthcare for Medicare patients.\n  The beneficiary cap is really two separate therapy caps: one cap for \noccupational therapy and one for both physical therapy and speech-\nlanguage pathology care combined. Congress has already shown its \nopposition to this arbitrary cap by placing a moratorium on enforcement \nof the cap in 1999, 2000, and 2003. The latest moratorium will expire \non January 1, 2006. Without congressional action, the beneficiary cap \non therapy services will be effective again in less than a year. It is \ntime to repeal the cap once and for all.\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\n  Each year, more than 3.7 million Medicare beneficiaries receive \noutpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech-\nlanguage pathology services to regain their optimum level of function \nand independence. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \ncompleted a long-awaited analysis of the therapy cap policy. The \nreport, prepared by AdvanceMed, estimates that for Calendar Year 2002, \nsome 638,195 beneficiaries receiving physical therapy, occupational \ntherapy, and/or speech-language pathology services would have exceeded \nthe cap threshold. This represents 23.7 percent of the outpatient \ntherapy expenditures for that year. Failure to address the issue this \nyear in Congress will have a significant impact on the access \nbeneficiaries will have to necessary rehabilitation services.\n  It is clear from recent reports prepared for CMS that patients with \ndebilitating illnesses and injuries would be severely impacted by \nenforcement of the therapy caps. Based on data from 2002, patients \nsuffering from conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, \ncongenital heart failure, and Dysphasia were certain to be negatively \nimpacted by enforcement of existing statutory limits on rehabilitation \ncoverage.\n  Action is needed to address the therapy caps this year. Last \nCongress, this bill attracted 51 Senators as cosponsors. As a member of \nthe Senate Budget Committee, I realize the budgetary constraints that \nare upon Congress. I understand that we need to prioritize spending. I \nbelieve that a meaningful solution to address the rehabilitation needs \nof senior citizens and individuals with disabilities in the Medicare \nprogram should be a priority.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator Blanche Lincoln, Senator \nChuck Hagel, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Jeff Bingaman, Senator Jon \nCorzine, Senator Tim Johnson, Senator Susan Collins, and Senator Orrin \nHatch for joining me in this effort. I stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues to enact a solution to the therapy caps that ensures access \nto quality restorative services provided by qualified professionals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 439. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide for \nsecondary containment to prevent methyl tertiary butyl ether and \npetroleum contamination; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprotect public health and the environment by preventing chemicals from \nleaking out of underground storage tanks and thereafter contaminating \ndrinking water supplies and nearby communities. My colleague in the \nHouse of Representatives, Mr. Dingell, is introducing companion \nlegislation.\n  Underground storage tanks can hold extremely toxic chemicals that can \nmove rapidly through soil, contaminating the ground, aquifers, streams \nand other bodies of water. Underground storage tanks are located in \nurban and rural areas. When they leak, they present substantial risks \nto groundwater quality, human health, environmental quality, and \neconomic growth.\n  There are approximately 670,000 underground storage tanks in the \nUnited States, and there have been more than 445,000 confirmed releases \nfrom these tanks as of mid-2003. Over 35 States report that leaking \nunderground storage tanks are one of the top threats to their drinking \nwater sources. By and large, MTBE contamination has come from leaking \nunderground storage tanks. MTBE has contaminated water supplies in 43 \nStates and in 29 States has contaminated drinking water. Estimates \nindicate that it will cost at least $29 billion to clean up MTBE \ncontamination nationwide.\n  Currently, the leaking underground storage tanks program and other \nlaws ensure that responsible parties pay to clean up the damage caused \nby these leaking spills. Unfortunately, the pace of cleaning up leaking \nunderground storage tanks is 20 percent below the historic average. Our \nNation faces an estimated 94,000 to 150,000 additional cleanups over \nthe next 10 years--at a cost of $12 billion to $19 billion.\n  The best, most commonsense solution to stop leaking underground \nstorage tanks from threatening public health is to prevent them from \nleaking in the first place with the use of secondary containment, such \nas double walls. There is already widespread support for this \nthroughout the country. Twenty-one States already require secondary \ncontainment, either for all new or replaced tanks--such as in \nCalifornia--or for all new or replaced tanks in sensitive areas. In \naddition, two States are awaiting final passage or approval of such \nrequirements, and one State requires tertiary, such as triple walls, \ncontainment. According to figures from the Petroleum Equipment \nInstitute, 57 percent of all tanks installed from 2000 through 2003 \nwere double walled.\n  But this is not fast enough in the face of the threats to our \ndrinking and groundwater. Approximately 50 percent of the population \nrelies on groundwater for their drinking water, including almost 100 \npercent in rural areas. The time to prevent contamination is now.\n  We must ensure the environmental health and safety of our water. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 440. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \ninclude podiatrists as physicians for purposes of covering physicians \nservices under the medicaid program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce an important \nbill that will ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries in all states have \naccess to the services of top-quality podiatric physicians. I am \npleased that Senator Mikulski from Maryland is joining me in \nintroducing this bill today.\n  Having healthy feet and ankles are critical to keeping individuals \nmobile, productive and in good long-term health. This is particularly \ntrue for individuals with diabetes.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nover 18 million Americans have diabetes, and it is the sixth leading \ncause of death in this country. Each year, over 200,000 Americans die \nfrom this disease.\n  If not managed properly, diabetes can cause several severe health \nproblems, including eye disease or blindness, kidney disease and heart \ndisease. Too often, diabetes can lead to foot complications, including \nfoot ulcers and even amputations. In fact, the CDC estimates that \n82,000 people undergo an amputation of a leg, foot or toe each year \nbecause of complications with diabetes.\n  Proper care of the feet could prevent many of these amputations. The \nCDC says that regular exams and patient education could prevent up to \n85 percent these amputations.\n  The bill we are introducing today recognizes the important role \npodiatrists can play identifying and correcting foot problems among \ndiabetics. The bill amends Medicaid's definition of ``physicians'' to \ninclude podiatric physicians. This will ensure that Medicaid \nbeneficiaries have access to foot care from those most qualified to \nprovide it.\n  Under Medicaid, podiatry is considered an optional benefit. However, \njust because it is optional, doesn't mean that podiatric services are \nnot needed, or that beneficiaries will not seek out other providers to \nperform these services. Instead, Medicaid beneficiaries will have to \nreceive foot care from other providers who may not be as well trained \nas a podiatrist in treating lower extremities.\n  Also, it is important to note that podiatrists are considered \nphysicians under the Medicare program, which allows seniors and \ndisabled individuals to receive appropriate care.\n  I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this important \nbill. It will help many Medicaid beneficiaries across the country have \naccess to podiatrists that they need.\n  Finally, I thank the Senator from Maryland for helping me introduce \nthis legislation today. I hope that by working together we can see this \nimportant change made.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Bunning to \nintroduce this important bill to make sure that Medicaid patients have \naccess to care provided by podiatrists.\n  This bill ensures that Medicaid patients across the country can get \nservices provided by podiatrists. This is a simple, common sense bill. \nThis legislation includes podiatric physicians in\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nMedicaid's definition of physician. This means that the services of \npodiatrists will be covered by Medicaid, just like they are in \nMedicare. Podiatrists are considered physicians under Medicare. They \nshould be under Medicaid. Medicaid covers necessary foot and ankle care \nservices. Medicaid should allow podiatrists who are trained \nspecifically in foot and ankle care to provide these services and be \nreimbursed for them.\n  The services of podiatrists are considered optional under Medicaid. \nCurrently, most state Medicaid programs, including Maryland, recognize \nand reimburse podiatrists for providing foot and ankle care to their \nbeneficiaries. However, during times of tight budgets, states may \nchoose to cut back on these optional services. Recently, Connecticut, \nand Texas discontinued podiatric services. Even though podiatrist \nservices are considered optional, Medicaid patients need foot and ankle \ncare. If podiatrists do not provide the care, patients will see \nproviders who may not be as well trained in the care of the lower \nextremities as podiatrists. I want the over 560,000 Medicaid patients \nin Maryland to have access to the services provided by over 400 \npodiatrists in Maryland.\n  Podiatrists receive special training on the foot, ankle, and lower \nleg. They play an important role in the recognition of systemic \ndiseases like diabetes, and in the recognition and treatment of \nperipheral neuropathy, a frequent cause of diabetic foot wounds that \ncan often lead to preventable lower extremity amputations. Over 18 \nmillion people in this country have diabetes, but an estimated more \nthan 5 million of these people are not aware that they have the \ndisease.\n  The President's budget challenges Congress to make major cuts to \nMedicaid--up to $60 billion. Covering podiatrists may be, in fact, a \ncost cutting measure. Ensuring Medicaid patient access to podiatrists \nwill save Medicaid funds in the long term. According to the American \nPodiatric Medical Association, 75 percent of Americans will experience \nsome type of foot health problem during their lives. Foot disease is \nthe most common complication of diabetes leading to hospitalization. \nAbout 82,000 people have diabetes-related leg, foot, or toe amputations \neach year. Foot care programs with regular examinations and patient \neducation could prevent up to 85 percent of these amputations. \nPodiatrists are important providers of this care.\n  This bill will make sure that Medicaid patients across the country \nhave access to care provided by podiatrists. It has the support of the \nAmerican Podiatric Medical Association. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Allen, Mr. Bunning, Mrs. Dole, and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 441. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the classification of a motorsports entertainment complex; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senator \nNelson of Florida, Senator Kyl of Arizona, Senator Allen of Virginia, \nSenator Bunning of Kentucky, Senator Chambliss of Georgia, and Senator \nDole of North Carolina, legislation that would permanently extend the \ncurrent treatment of investments made to motorsports entertainment \ncomplexes, ensuring that this important economic engine for our economy \ncontinues to roar. The Motorsports Fairness and Permanency Act of 2005 \nwill help ensure that job-creating investments in motorsports \nfacilities continue to be made under the same economic assumptions and \ntax treatment used for the last several decades--decades that have \nwitnessed the most explosive growth in motorsports' long history.\n  Motorsports is the fastest growing sport in the United States, \ndrawing fans to tracks and speedways around the country. In fact, there \nare over 900 motorsports facilities throughout the U.S., with tracks in \nevery State. These facilities contribute to the economy by attracting \nmotorsports enthusiasts and tourists, hiring permanent and temporary \nemployees, and making capital investments. Facilities of every type--\nfrom local tracks that run weekly racing series to ``superspeedways'' \nthat host nationally-televised events--must continually upgrade and \nreinvest in order to remain competitive.\n  Motorsports play a significant role in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, where racing is an integral part of Pennsylvania's \neconomy with 60 racing facilities in every corner of the State. In \nfact, Pennsylvania is tied with California for the second-most \nmotorsports facilities of any State.\n  Our facilities and tracks span across the Commonwealth and include \nthe nationally known Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Lake Erie Speedway, \nand Maple Grove Raceway, located just outside of Reading. These and \nother raceways in Pennsylvania hold NASCAR, National Hot Rod \nAssociation, Import Drag Racing Circuit, and other racing events, \ndrawing hundreds of thousands of fans each year contributing vital \neconomic support to their local communities.\n  It is clear that motorsports racing plays an important role in \nPennsylvania, just as it does across this country. When making these \ncapital investments, owners of motorsports facilities have long relied \non and in good faith applied a 7-year depreciation life for these \nassets, but a few years ago the IRS began to raise some questions about \nthe use of the 7-year classification. Last year, in H.R. 4520, the \nAmerican Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Congress clarified that the \nappropriate depreciation period for motorsports assets was indeed 7 \nyears. Due to revenue constraints in that particular bill, the \nprovision on motorsports asset classification will lapse in 2008, \nmeaning that Congress needs to act to permanently extend the provision. \nThese capital expenditures, such as major improvements to existing \ntracks or building new tracks, require several years of planning \nfollowed by construction. Without a permanent provision that provides \nclarity and certainty, significant capital investments in motorsports \nfacilities--and the jobs and economic gains those investments bring--\ncould be negatively impacted.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate will join me in support \nof permanently extending the current treatment of investments in \nmotorsports entertainment facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 443. A bill to improve the investigation of criminal antitrust \noffenses; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues \nSenators Kohl and Leahy, to introduce the Antitrust Investigative \nImprovements Act of 2005. We do so to strengthen the Department of \nJustice's ability to investigate criminal antitrust conspiracies. This \nbill gives the Department of Justice authority to seek a wiretap order \nfrom a Federal judge, for a limited time period, to monitor \ncommunications between antitrust conspirators.\n  Investigating and prosecuting criminal antitrust conspiracies, such \nas cartels and bid-rigging, is the core mission of the Department of \nJustice's Antitrust Division. Because of the harm this behavior can do \nto the economy and to innocent consumers, Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Antitrust Division, Hewitt Pate, has said that prosecuting \n``cartels remain[s] our top enforcement priority at the Antitrust \nDivision.'' As a result, in the United States, we punish such illegal \nbehavior harshly. Corporations can be fined up to $100 million and \nindividuals can be fined up to $1 million and be incarcerated for 10 \nyears. But, despite the high priority the Antitrust Division places on \nthese cases and the tough penalties under the law, up to now, we have \nnot given the Department of Justice all the tools it needs to \ninvestigate and prosecute criminal antitrust conspiracies.\n  In criminal antitrust investigations, to prosecute a case, it is \ncritical that prosecutors gain access to evidence on the inner workings \nof the conspiracy. To meet their heavy burden of proof, prosecutors \nmust marshal strong evidence showing, for example, the terms of the \nillegal agreement, the participants in the illegal agreement, and \nprecisely when the illegal agreement was reached. This type of evidence \nis extremely difficult to gain without penetrating the inner workings \nof the conspiracy.\n  The Department has principally two techniques for investigating \ncriminal antitrust enterprises. First, it may enlist the cooperation of \na witness. The\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\ncooperating witness may be, for example, a customer being harmed by the \nconspiracy or a co-conspirator to the antitrust crime. Under this \napproach, a cooperating witness may testify about the details of the \nconspiracy or may record conversations with the conspirators, either \nthrough videotape or audiotape. One important restriction is that the \ncooperating witness must be present at the conversation when recording. \nBut, if the Department cannot secure a cooperating witness, which is \noften the case, this technique is not available.\n  Second, the Antitrust Division also has a corporate leniency program, \nwhich has been very successful in investigating and prosecuting \ncriminal antitrust conspiracies. In exchange for fully cooperating with \nan antitrust investigation, an otherwise guilty corporation may receive \nlenient treatment. But, this method, too, depends on the cooperation of \none who was on the inside of the criminal conspiracy.\n  Our bill adds a third technique by amending Title III of the Omnibus \nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act (18 U.S.C. Section 2510 et seq.) to \nmake a criminal violation of the Sherman Act a ``predicate offense'' \nfor an order authorizing the interception of wire or oral \ncommunications, hereinafter ``wiretap order''. Amending this law to \nmake criminal antitrust offenses a predicate offense would give the \nDepartment of Justice a much needed tool to investigate the inner \nworkings of criminal antitrust conspiracies. Unlike using a cooperating \nwitness or the corporate leniency program, a wiretap order does not \nrequire the cooperation of someone who has inside knowledge of the \nconspiracy or who is actually participating in the conspiracy. Upon a \nshowing of probable cause to a Federal judge, the Department of Justice \ncould obtain a wiretap order, for a limited time period, to monitor \ncommunications between conspirators.\n  There are over 150 predicate offenses from title 18 and dozens of \nother predicate offenses from other parts of the U.S. Criminal Code. \nOffenses, such as wire fraud, mail fraud, and bank fraud are predicate \noffenses, but up to now, criminal antitrust offenses have not been on \nthe list. I think this is a mistake. Criminal antitrust offenses are \nbasically white-collar, fraud offenses, and often do much more harm to \ninnocent consumers than other types of fraud offenses. It is time for \nantitrust to be added as a predicate offense, given the gravity of the \ncrime.\n  This idea is not new. Past Assistant Attorney Generals of the \nAntitrust Division have supported the idea for such legislation. And, \nin 1999, our neighbor to the north, Canada, passed similar legislation. \nIt is an idea whose time has come.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important reform to strengthen \nthe enforcement of our antitrust laws. I ask unanimous consent to print \nthe bill in the Record.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America's antitrust laws play a vital role \nin protecting consumers and ensuring a competitive marketplace for \nbusiness. The vigorous enforcement of these laws also helps promote and \nmaintain the efficiency of our markets by promoting competition, \ninnovation, and technological development. Today, I am pleased to join \nSenator Kohl and Senator DeWine in introducing the Antitrust Criminal \nInvestigative Improvements Act of 2005, legislation that will provide \nthe Department of Justice with long overdue authority in investigating \nand prosecuting criminal antitrust violations.\n  Congress acted in 1890 with passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act to \nprohibit abusive monopolization and anticompetitive practices. Since \nthat time, the Department of Justice's enforcement efforts have \nbenefited consumers in terms of lower prices, greater variety, and \nhigher quality of products and services. Despite the value and impact \nof criminal antitrust cases, however, criminal antitrust investigations \ndo not currently qualify for judicially approved wiretaps. While the \nJustice Department may engage in court-authorized searches of business \nrecords, it may only monitor phone calls of informants or the \nconversations of consenting parties.\n  The Antitrust Criminal Investigative Improvements Act of 2005 will \nadd criminal price fixing and bid rigging to the many crimes that are \nalready ``predicate offenses'' for wiretap purposes. More than 150 \n``predicate offenses'' are currently included in Title III of the \nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, including crimes of lesser \nimpact and significance than criminal antitrust violations. In light of \nthe seriousness of economic harms caused by violations of the Sherman \nAntitrust Act, the inability of the Justice Department to obtain \nwiretaps when investigating criminal antitrust violations makes little \nsense. Moreover, the evidence that can be acquired through wiretaps is \nprecisely the type of evidence that is essential for the successful \nprosecution and prevention of serious antitrust violations. This bill \nequips the Department of Justice investigators and prosecutors to \nenforce zealously the criminal antitrust laws of the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 444. A bill to establish a demonstration project to train \nunemployed workers for employment as health care professionals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the third in a \nseries of bills intended to support American companies and American \nworkers. Earlier this week, I introduced S. Con. Res. 12, which would \nset some minimum standards for future trade agreements into which our \ncountry enters, and S. 395, which would strengthen the Buy American \nAct. Today I am introducing legislation that would help workers who \nhave lost their manufacturing or service sector jobs to be retrained \nfor jobs in high-demand health care fields.\n  According to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, \nWisconsin has lost nearly 80,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000. \nNationally, the country has lost more than 2.5 million manufacturing \njobs since January 2001. In addition to the loss of manufacturing jobs, \nI am deeply troubled by the Bush administration's contention that the \noutsourcing of American service sector and other jobs is good for the \neconomy. I am concerned about the message that this policy sends to \nWisconsinites and all Americans who are currently employed in these \nsectors.\n  There is something of a silver lining to the looming cloud of \nmanufacturing and other jobs loss: the country's workforce development \nsystem.\n  In spite of stretched resources and long waiting lists for services, \nour workforce development boards are making a tremendous effort to \nretrain laid-off workers and other job seekers for new jobs. And this \neffort is clearly evident in Wisconsin, where my State's 11 workforce \ndevelopment boards are leading the way in finding innovative solutions \nto retraining workers for new careers on shoestring budgets.\n  I strongly support the work of these agencies and have urged the \nadministration and Senate appropriators to provide adequate funding for \nthe job training programs authorized by the Workforce Investment Act. I \nregret that the administration's budget request for fiscal year 2006 \ndoes not provide adequate funding for WIA, and I will continue to work \nto ensure that the workforce development boards in my State and across \nour country receive the resources they need to help job seekers get the \ntraining they need to be successful.\n  I am committed to finding resources to retrain those who have been \nlaid off from the manufacturing and service sectors and who wish to \nfind new jobs in high-demand fields such as health care.\n  As most of my colleagues know all too well, we are facing a \nsignificant shortage of health care workers. Congress has made some \nprogress in addressing the nursing shortage, but we need to expand our \nefforts. Shortages of health professionals pose a real threat to the \nhealth of our communities by impacting access to timely, high-quality \nhealth care. Studies have shown that shortages of nurses in our \nhospitals and health facilities increase medical errors, which directly \naffects patient health.\n  As our population ages, and the baby boomers need more health care, \nour need for all types of health professionals is only going to \nincrease. This is particularly true for the field of long-term care. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are going\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nto need an additional 1.2 million nursing aides, home health aides, and \nother health professionals in long-term care before the year 2010.\n  As our demand for health care workers grows, so does the number of \njobs available within this sector. Currently, health services is the \nlargest industry in the country, providing 12.9 million jobs in 2002. \nIt is estimated that 16 percent of all new jobs created between 2002 \nand 2012 will be in health services. This accounts for 3.5 million new \njobs--more than any other industry.\n  According to the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, the \nsurging job growth within health care will translate into a real need \nfor workers) and real opportunity. In Wisconsin alone, there will be an \nadditional 67,430 health care positions by 2012. This represents a 30 \npercent increase in jobs in health care, over twice the rate of growth \nfor Wisconsin jobs overall.\n  Mr. President, workforce development agencies in my home State of \nWisconsin are already working to support displaced workers in their \ncommunities by training them for health care jobs, since there is a \nreal need for workers in these fields. These agencies are helping \ncommunities get and maintain access to high-quality health care by \nensuring that there are enough health care workers to care for their \ncommunities.\n  As the executive director of one of the workforce development boards \nin my State put it, ``[t]here are simply not many good quality jobs to \nreplace manufacturing jobs lost to rural communities. The medical \nprofessions, by offering a `living wage' and good benefits, provide an \nexcellent alternative to manufacturing for sustaining a higher, family \noriented standard of living.''\n  I believe we need to support our communities in these efforts by \nproviding them with the resources they need to establish, sustain, or \nexpand these important programs. For that reason, today I am \nintroducing the Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act. This bill \nwould amend the Workforce Investment Act to authorize a demonstration \nproject to provide grants to community-based coalitions, led by local \nworkforce development boards, to create programs to retrain unemployed \nworkers who wish to obtain new jobs in the health care professions. My \nbill would authorize a total of $25 million for grants between $100,000 \nand $500,000, and, in the interest of fiscal responsibility, it ensures \nthat the cost of these grants would be offset.\n  This bill will help provide communities with the resources they need \nto run retraining programs for the health professions. The funds could \nbe used for a variety of purposes--from increasing the capacity of our \nschools and training facilities, to providing financial and social \nsupport for workers who are in retraining programs. This bill allows \nfor flexibility in the use of grant funds because I believe that \ncommunities know best about the resources they need to run an efficient \nprogram.\n  This bill represents a nexus in my efforts to support workers whose \njobs have been shipped overseas and to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to the high-quality health care that they deserve. By providing \ntargeted assistance to train laid-off workers who wish to obtain new \njobs in the health care sector, we can both help unemployed Americans \nand improve the availability and quality of health care that is \navailable in our communities.\n  I am pleased that this bill is supported by a variety of \norganizations that are committed to providing high-quality job training \nand health care services, inc1uding the National Association of \nWorkforce Boards, the Wisconsin Association of Job Training Executives, \nthe Wisconsin Hospital Association, the Northwest Wisconsin \nConcentrated Employment Program, the Northwest Wisconsin Workforce \nInvestment Board, the Southwestern Wisconsin Workforce Development \nBoard, the West Central Wisconsin Workforce Development Board, and the \nWorkforce Development Board of South Central Wisconsin.\n  Mr. President, in order to ensure that our workers are able to \ncompete in the new economy, we must ensure that they have the tools \nthey need to be trained or retrained for high-demand jobs such as those \nin the health care field. My bill is a small step toward providing the \nresources necessary to achieve this goal. I will continue to work to \nstrengthen the American manufacturing sector and to support those \nworkers who have been displaced due to bad trade agreements and other \npolicies that have led to the loss of American jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 445. A resolution to amend part D of title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act, as added by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, \nand Modernization Act of 2003, to provide for negotiation of fair \nprices for Medicare prescription drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Price Reduction Act of 2005, and am pleased to be \njoined by my colleagues, Senators Carper, Kennedy, Schumer, Bingaman, \nand Johnson.\n  This legislation is very simple and very straightforward: it would \nallow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly \nwith pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of our seniors and the \ndisabled to get the lowest possible prices.\n  Last week we learned that the Medicare prescription drug benefit will \ncost more than 1 trillion dollars--$1.2 trillion to be exact--just for \nthe years 2006 through 2015.\n  Some of our colleagues are responding to the news of the $1.2 \ntrillion price tag with plans to reduce the benefit. But the benefit as \ncurrently structured is far from comprehensive. Seniors are responsible \nfor $420 in premiums, and a $250 deductible before they get one penny's \nworth of help towards the cost of their prescription drugs. Once the \nbenefit kicks in, they will face a hefty copayment, and many will fall \ninto the infamous ``hole'' in the benefit and--at the same time they \ncontinue to pay premiums--not get any assistance at all.\n  Even with a $1.2 trillion pricetag, our seniors will have to shoulder \ntwo-thirds of the cost of their prescription drugs. Neither the seniors \nand disabled, nor the taxpayers, should be paying so much for so \nlittle.\n  Last week's news of the cost of the benefit makes it clear that we \nmust give Medicare the ability to use the market power of 41 million \npeople to secure the lowest prices possible for seniors, the disabled, \nand the American taxpayer.\n  Our response to the new cost estimate shouldn't be to reduce the \nalready meager benefit but to use our dollars more efficiently. The \nchange that my colleagues and I are seeking would allow us to improve \nthe drug benefit--by lowering the cost of the drugs, we could fill in \nthe gaps in coverage and provide a more meaningful benefit.\n  Former HHS Secretary Thompson said at his December 3rd resignation \npress conference that he would have liked to have had the opportunity \nto negotiate lower drug prices.\n  I expect Secretary Thompson knows what every smart buyer knows: the \nmore you are buying of anything, the better deal you get. We all know \nthat Sam's Club gets the best prices on breakfast cereal, batteries, \nand paper towels because they represent a huge market.\n  And now that Secretary Leavitt is tasked with running the program, we \nshould give him as many tools as possible to run this program at the \nlowest possible cost.\n  Today the only entity in this country that cannot bargain for lower \ngroup prices is Medicare. The States, Fortune 500 companies, large \npharmacy chains, and the Veterans' Administration use their bargaining \nclout to obtain lower drug prices for the patients they represent.\n  Medicare should have that same ability. It doesn't make any sense to \nprohibit the Secretary from using the clout of our 41 million seniors \nto help get them the best possible prices on prescription drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this commonsense approach \nto providing real savings for our seniors and the disabled, and \nensuring the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 445\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Prescription Drug \n     Price Reduction Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NEGOTIATING FAIR PRICES FOR MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION \n                   DRUGS.\n\n       Section 1860D-11 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395w-111) is amended by striking subsection (i) (relating to \n     noninterference) and by inserting the following:\n       ``(i) Authority To Negotiate Prices With Manufacturers.--In \n     order to ensure that each part D eligible individual who is \n     enrolled under a prescription drug plan or an MA-PD plan pays \n     the lowest possible price for covered part D drugs, the \n     Secretary shall have authority similar to that of other \n     Federal entities that purchase prescription drugs in bulk to \n     negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered part D \n     drugs, consistent with the requirements of this part and in \n     furtherance of the goals of providing quality care and \n     containing costs under this part.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 446. A bill to direct the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency to designate New Jersey Task Force 1 as part of the \nNational Urban Search and Rescue Response System; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that \nwould designate New Jersey's elite urban search and rescue team, New \nJersey Task Force One, as part of the National Urban Search and Rescue \nResponse System.\n  I am proud to be joined by my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nFrank Lautenberg, in introducing this legislation today. And I am also \npleased that my colleague, Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, has \nintroduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  New Jersey Task Force One is a team comprised of career and volunteer \nfire, police, and EMS personnel from all 21 counties in New Jersey. The \nprimary mission of the NJTFO is to provide advanced technical search \nand rescue capabilities to victims who are trapped or entombed in \ncollapsed buildings. The NJTFO is a world-class operation whose \nresponse system mirrors the Federal Emergency Management Agencies \nguidelines on urban search and rescue and the appropriate National Fire \nProtection Association Standards.\n  The training, commitment, and expertise of the NJTFO has saved lives. \nIn fact, New Jersey Task Force One was one of the first units to arrive \non the scene at the World Trade Center on September 11, and they \nbravely conducted search, rescue, medical, and planning and logistics \noperations on site.\n  In this era of terrorism and heightened homeland security we should \nbe doing all we can to show our commitment to our first responders. \nThis designation would do just that for New Jersey Task Force One. More \nimportantly, by making NJTFO a part of the National Urban Search and \nRescue Team they would be eligible for Federal funding that is vital to \nhelping them fulfill their mission. The honor of joining the other 28 \nmembers of the National Urban Search and Rescue Response System is a \nrecognition that the NJTFO is more than deserving of.\n  I urge the Senate to enact this legislation and ask for a copy of \nthis bill to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITION OF TASK FORCE TO NATIONAL URBAN SEARCH \n                   AND RESCUE RESPONSE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     demonstrated the importance of enhancing national domestic \n     terrorism preparedness;\n       (2) 26 of the 28 urban search and rescue task forces \n     included in the National Urban Search and Rescue Response \n     System of the Federal Emergency Management Agency were called \n     into action in the wake of the events of September 11;\n       (3) highly qualified, urban search and rescue teams not \n     included in the National Urban Search and Rescue Response \n     System were the first teams in New York City on September 11;\n       (4) the continuing threat of a possible domestic terrorist \n     attack remains an important mission for which the United \n     States must prepare to respond; and\n       (5) part of that response should be to increase the number \n     of urban search and rescue task forces included in the \n     National Urban Search and Rescue Response System.\n       (b) Addition of New Jersey Task Force 1.--The Director of \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall designate New \n     Jersey Task Force 1 as part of the National Urban Search and \n     Rescue Response System.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 447. A bill to authorize the conveyance of certain Federal land in \nthe State of New Mexico; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce an \nuncontroversial piece of legislation that I hope will receive prompt \ncommittee action and will make its way quickly to the President's desk \nfor his signature.\n  I would first like to familiarize the Senate with the important \nmission and related work of the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park in Las \nCruces, NM. The Chihuahuan Desert is the largest desert in North \nAmerica and contains a great diversity of unique plant and animal \nspecies. The ecosystem makes up an indispensable part of Southwest's \ntreasured ecological diversity. As such, it is important that we teach \nour young ones an appreciation for New Mexico's biological diversity \nand impart upon them the value of this ecological treasure.\n  The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park is a nonprofit institution that has \nspent the past 6 years providing hands-on science education to K-12th \ngraders. To achieve this mission, the Nature Park provides classroom \npresentation, field trips, schoolyard ecology projects, and teacher \nwork shops. The Nature Park serves more than 11,000 students and 600 \nteachers annually. This instruction will enable our future leaders to \nmake informed decisions about how best to manage these valuable \nresources. I commend those at the Nature Park for taking the initiative \nto create and administer a wonderfully successful program that has been \nso beneficial to the surrounding community.\n  The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park was granted a 1,000 acre easement \nin 1998 at the southern boundary of USDA-Agriculture Research Service, \nUSDA-ARS, property just north of Las Cruces, NM. This easement will \nexpire soon. It is important that we provide them a permanent location \nso that they are able to continue their valuable mission.\n  The bill I introduce today would transfer an insignificant amount of \nland: 1,000 of 193,000 USDA acres to the Desert Nature Park so that \nthey may continue their important work. The USDA-ARS has approved the \nland transfer, noting the critically important mission of the Desert \nPark. I have no doubt that Senators on both sides of the aisle will \nrecognize the importance of this land transfer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of Congress to Elizabeth Wanamaker Peratrovich and \nRoy Peratrovich in recognition of their outstanding and enduring \ncontributions to the civil rights and dignity of the Native peoples of \nAlaska and the Nation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this week the people of my State of \nAlaska pause to recognize two giant figures in the fight for equal \nrights and justice under the law, the late Elizabeth and Roy \nPeratrovich. On February 16, 2005, the State of Alaska once again \nobserved Elizabeth Peratrovich Day. Activities to celebrate the legacy \nof Elizabeth and Roy Peratrovich are taking place in schools and \ncultural centers throughout Alaska this week. This coming Saturday, the \nAlaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage will conduct a day-long \ncelebration of the Peratrovich legacy.\n  Roy and Elizabeth are to the Native peoples of Alaska what Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks are to African Americans. Everybody \nknows about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, but hardly \nanyone outside the State of Alaska knows about Roy and Elizabeth \nPeratrovich. Today, I rise to once again share the Peratrovich legacy \nwith the Senate.\n  Elizabeth was born in 1911, about 17 years before Dr. King. She was \nborn in Petersburg, AK. After college she married Roy Peratrovich, a \nTlingit from Klawock, AK, and the couple had three children. Roy and \nElizabeth moved to Juneau. They were excited about buying a new home. \nBut they could not buy the house that they wanted because they were \nNative. They could not enter the stores or restaurants they wanted. \nOutside some of these stores and restaurants there were signs that read \n``No Natives Allowed.'' History has also recorded a sign that read ``No \nDogs or Indians Allowed.''\n  On December 30, 1941, following the invasion of Pearl Harbor, \nElizabeth and Roy wrote to Alaska's Territorial Governor:\n\n       In the present emergency our Native boys are being called \n     upon to defend our beloved country. There are no distinctions \n     being made there. Yet when we patronized good business \n     establishments we are told in most cases that Natives are not \n     allowed.\n       The proprietor of one business, an inn, does not seem to \n     realize that our Native boys are just as willing to lay down \n     their lives to protect the freedom he enjoys. Instead he \n     shows his appreciation by having a `No Natives Allowed' sign \n     on his door.\n\n  In that letter Elizabeth and Roy noted:\n\n       We were shocked when the Jews were discriminated against in \n     Germany. Stories were told of public places having signs, \n     ``No Jews Allowed.'' All freedom loving people were horrified \n     at what was being practiced in Germany, yet it is being \n     practiced in our own country.\n\n  In 1943, the Alaska Legislature, at the behest of Roy and Elizabeth \nconsidered an antidiscrimination law. It was defeated. But Roy and \nElizabeth were not defeated. Two years later, in 1945, the \nantidiscrimination measure was back before the Alaska Terrritorial \nLegislature. It passed the lower house, but met with stiff opposition \nin the Territorial Senate.\n  One by one Senators took to the floor to debate the closely contested \nlegislation. One Senator argued that ``the races should be kept further \napart.'' This Senator went on to rhetorically question, ``Who are these \npeople, barely out of savagery, who want to associate with us whites \nwith 5,000 years of recorded civilization behind us?''\n\n  Elizabeth Peratrovich was observing the debate from the gallery. As a \ncitizen, she asked to be heard and in accordance with the custom of the \nday was recognized to express her views.\n  In a quiet, dignified and steady voice this ``fighter with velvet \ngloves'' responded, ``I would not have expected that I, who am barely \nout of savagery, would have to remind gentlemen with 5,000 years of \nrecorded history behind them of our Bill of Rights.''\n  She was asked by a Senator if she thought the proposed bill would \neliminate discrimination, Elizabeth Peratrovich queried in rebuttal, \n``Do your laws against larceny and even murder prevent these crimes? No \nlaw will eliminate crimes but at least you as legislators can assert to \nthe world that you recognize the evil of the present situation and \nspeak your intent to help us overcome discrimination.''\n  When she finished, there was a wild burst of applause from the \ngallery and the Senate floor alike. The territorial Senate passed the \nbill by a vote of 11 to 5. On February 16, 1945, Alaska had an \nantidiscrimination law that provided that all citizens of the territory \nof Alaska are entitled to full and equal enjoyment of public \naccommodations. Following passage of the anti-discrimination law, Roy \nand Elizabeth could be seen dancing at the Baranof Hotel, one of \nJuneau's finest. They danced among people they didn't know. They danced \nin a place where the day before they were not welcome.\n  There is an important lesson to be learned from the battles of \nElizabeth and Roy Peratrovich. Even in defeat, they knew that change \nwould come from their participation in our political system. They were \nnot discouraged by their defeat in 1943. They came back fighting and \nenjoyed the fruits of their victory 2 years later.\n  Twenty-four years before Alaska's statehood and 18 years before Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. spoke of his dream for racial equity under the \nlaw, Alaska had a law protecting civil rights. Elizabeth would not live \nto see the United States adopt the same law she brought to Alaska in \n1945. She passed away in 1958 at the age of 47, 6 years before civil \nrights legislation would pass nationally.\n  In addition to the annual observance of Elizabeth Peratrovich Day, \nthe State of Alaska has acknowledged Elizabeth Peratrovich's \ncontribution to history by designating one of the public galleries in \nthe Alaska House of Representatives as the Elizabeth Peratrovich \nGallery.\n  But what about Roy? Why has his role not been recognized? Roy \nPeratrovich passed away in 1989 at age 81. He died 9 days before the \nfirst Elizabeth Peratrovich Day was observed in the State of Alaska. \nPerhaps it was because Roy was still alive at the time this honor was \nbestowed, it is Elizabeth who has gotten all the credit for passage of \nthe antidiscrimination\n  Members of the Peratrovich family tell me that this is not entirely \nunjustified because without Elizabeth's stirring speech the \nantidiscrimination law would not have passed. But they also point out, \nas does the historical record, that Elizabeth and Roy were a focused \nand effective team. History should recognize that the \nantidiscrimination law was enacted due to the joint efforts of Roy and \nElizabeth Peratrovich. I rise today to do my part toward that end.\n  Joined by my colleagues, the distinguished senior Senator from \nAlaska, Mr. Stevens, and my distinguished colleague from the State of \nWashington, Ms. Cantwell, I am pleased to once again offer legislation \nto recognize the contributions of Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich with a \nCongressional Gold Medal. I invite all of my colleagues to join with me \nin cosponsoring this important legislation. Congressional Gold\n\n[[Page S1661]]\n\nMedals have been awarded to a number of African Americans who have made \ncontributions to the cause of civil rights, among them, Rosa Parks, Roy \nWilkins, Dorothy Height, the nine brave individuals who desegregated \nthe schools of Little Rock, Arkansas, and others involved in the effort \nto desegregate public education.\n  With the opening of the very popular National Museum of the American \nIndian last year our Nation is focusing on the many contributions of \nour first people and the challenges they have faced throughout our \nNation's history. It is time that we also acknowledge the work of \nAmerican Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians in the struggle \nfor civil rights and social justice. Honoring Elizabeth and Roy \nPeratrovich's substantial contribution with a Congressional Gold Medal \nis a fine start.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Elizabeth Wanamaker, a Tlingit Indian, was born on July \n     4, 1911, in Petersburg, Alaska.\n       (2) Elizabeth married Roy Peratrovich, a Tlingit Indian \n     from Klawock, Alaska, on December 15, 1931.\n       (3) In 1941, the couple moved to Juneau, Alaska.\n       (4) Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich discovered that they \n     could not purchase a home in the section of Juneau in which \n     they desired to live due to discrimination against Alaska \n     Natives.\n       (5) In the early 1940s, there were reports that some \n     businesses in Southeast Alaska posted signs reading ``No \n     Natives Allowed''.\n       (6) Roy, as Grand President of the Alaska Native \n     Brotherhood, and Elizabeth, as Grand President of the Alaska \n     Native Sisterhood, petitioned the Territorial Governor and \n     the Territorial Legislature to enact a law prohibiting \n     discrimination against Alaska Natives in public \n     accommodations.\n       (7) Rebuffed by the Territorial Legislature in 1943, they \n     again sought passage of an anti-discrimination law in 1945.\n       (8) On February 8, 1945, as the Alaska Territorial Senate \n     debated the anti-discrimination law, Elizabeth, who was \n     sitting in the visitor's gallery of the Senate, was \n     recognized to present her views on the measure.\n       (9) The eloquent and dignified testimony given by Elizabeth \n     that day is widely credited for passage of the anti-\n     discrimination law.\n       (10) On February 16, 1945, Territorial Governor Ernest \n     Gruening signed into law an act prohibiting discrimination \n     against all citizens within the jurisdiction of the Territory \n     of Alaska in access to public accommodations and imposing a \n     penalty on any person who shall display any printed or \n     written sign indicating discrimination on racial grounds of \n     such full and equal enjoyment.\n       (11) 19 years before Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964, and 18 years before the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther \n     King, Jr. delivered his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, one of \n     America's first antidiscrimination laws was enacted in the \n     Territory of Alaska, thanks to the efforts of Elizabeth and \n     Roy Peratrovich.\n       (12) Since 1989, the State of Alaska has observed Elizabeth \n     Peratrovich Day on February 16 of each year, and a visitor's \n     gallery of the Alaska House of Representatives in the Alaska \n     State Capitol has been named for Elizabeth Peratrovich.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to facilitate shareholder consideration of proposals \nto make Settlement Common Stock under the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act available to missed enrollees, eligible elders, and \neligible persons born after December 18, 1971, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, more than 30 years have passed since \nCongress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which settled \nthe aboriginal land claims of the first inhabitants of Alaska by making \neach eligible Alaska Native a shareholder in 1 of 13 regional \ncorporations and many of these people shareholders in a village \ncorporation as well. Each of the corporations was capitalized with land \nand money.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was a bold experiment, and \nits implementation was not without controversy. As originally enacted, \nthe law provided that a shareholder of an Alaska Native Corporation \ncould sell his or her stock on or after December 18, 1991, without any \nintervening action by the corporation.\n  This provision could have resulted in massive sales of stock by \nNative shareholders in the ensuing years and caused the wholesale \ntransfer of Native assets to non-Native interests. Thanks to the \nleadership of the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, this catastrophe \nwas averted through a series of amendments to the Act, signed into law \nin 1987, which forbade the sale of corporate stock without the consent \nof the corporation's shareholders.\n  This landmark legislation brought an end to the speculation about \nwhether the Native corporations would survive long enough to fulfill \nthe goal that Congress set for them, which was to be the springboard \nfor the economic, social and political empowerment of Alaska's Native \npeople, or alternatively execute the temporary transfer of land and \ncapital which would ultimately end up in non-Native hands. I am proud, \nthat none of the Native corporations have opened their stock to \npurchase by outsiders. In fact, I see nothing on the horizon to suggest \nthat any of the corporations will take up this question in the \nforeseeable future.\n  If history is any guide, the Alaska Native Corporations are destined \nto remain in Native hands for a long time to come. This is good news \nfor the Native people of Alaska and it is good news for my State as a \nwhole.\n  I rise today to offer legislation, requested by the Alaska Federation \nof Natives and the Association of ANCSA Presidents and CEOs, which is \nintended to address a piece of unfinished business left by the 1987 \namendments to the act.\n  Under the act, as originally passed, stock in an Alaska Native \ncorporation was generally only available to an Alaska Native born on or \nbefore December 18, 1971 and those who might inherit stock from a \ndeceased shareholder. The original legislation gave little thought to \noffering those born after December 18, 1971 a role in the corporation. \nIn effect, the original legislation disenfranchised an entire \ngeneration born after the cutoff date from having a stake in the Native \ncorporations. It disenfranchised an entire generation of young people \nfrom playing a role in the governance of the Native corporations and \nfrom having an ownership interest in their Native lands.\n  The 1987 amendments allowed the shareholders of a Native corporation \nto remedy this unintended consequence by allowing new stock to be \nissued to the descendants of a corporation's original shareholders \nprovided that a majority of the outstanding shares agreed. Under the \n1987 amendments, such stock could only be issued to those descendants \nwho had one quarter or more Alaska Native blood. A subsequent technical \namendment allowed the stock to be issued to descendants without regard \nto their blood quantum, at the option of each corporation's \nshareholders.\n  Time has demonstrated that the remedy for incorporating the \ngeneration\n\n[[Page S1662]]\n\nborn after December 18, 1971 is an imperfect one. This is sad because \none of the most important responsibilities faced by the Board of \nDirectors of any corporation is to plan for its own succession and the \nsuccession of the corporation's leadership.\n\n  Since 1987, less than a handful of the 13 regional Native \ncorporations have put the question of enrolling the next generation to \ntheir shareholders. However, all of the corporations that have \nconsidered the question have voted in the affirmative.\n  Why then have more corporations not taken the question to a vote? The \nanswer seems to lie in the voting requirements imposed by the 1987 \namendments, which essentially requires an affirmative vote of a \nsupermajority of the shares represented in person or by proxy at a \nshareholder meeting. In order for a corporation to obtain an \naffirmative vote of a majority of its outstanding shares, something of \nthe order of 80 percent of the corporation's stockholders must be \nrepresented at the meeting in person or by proxy. Under present law, \nany shareholder who does not attend the meeting or submit a proxy is \ndeemed to have voted in the negative.\n  When Doyon, Limited, the regional Native corporation for Interior \nAlaska, took the question of enrolling the generation of descendants \nborn between 1971 and 1992 to its shareholders at its 1992 annual \nmeeting, some 79.2 percent of the shareholders expressed an opinion in \nperson or proxy. Still, the decision to approve the enrollment passed \nby the narrowest of margins. This was a record quorum for the \ncorporation, which had 9,061 original shareholders, and the record has \nyet to be broken.\n  Sealaska Corporation, the regional Native corporation for Southeast \nAlaska, had more original shareholders than any other regional Native \ncorporation. Sealaska had 15,700 original shareholders, each owning 100 \nshares of stock. Sealaska has never enjoyed a quorum of 79.2 percent \nand is pessimistic that such a quorum could ever be mustered. \nAccordingly, Sealaska, which has been pondering the question of \nenrolling the next generation for many years, has been deterred from \nputting the question to a stockholder vote by the supermajority voting \nrequirement in the 1987 amendment.\n  Whether Sealaska enrolls the generation born after 1971 is not up to \nme. It is up to the shareholders of Sealaska. But I think the Congress \nowes it to the next generation of Alaska Natives to offer a level \nplaying field when it comes to participation in their Native \ncorporations.\n  In addressing the Alaska Native community, I often make reference to \na marvelous book by Alexandra J. McClanahan entitled ``Growing Up \nNative in Alaska.'' In this book, A.J. profiled 27 Alaska Natives born \nbetween 1957 and 1976 and allowed them in their own words to speak \nabout what it means to be an Alaska Native. Some of the people profiled \nin the book received stock under the 1971 act while others missed the \ndeadline. I will quote from this book for the Record.\n  One of these 27 Alaska Natives is Jaeleen Kookesh-Araujo, a Tlingit \nIndian, who grew up in the village of Angoon, AK. Jaeleen is a bright \nyoung attorney who works at one of Washington's most respected law \nfirms. She is precisely the type of person who is well positioned to \nlead her regional corporation, Sealaska, into the future. And she is \none of many Alaska Natives who was born after December 18, 1971. \nJaeleen has an opportunity to participate in Sealaska's governance \nbecause her parents gave her some of their stock as a gift, but she \nremains concerned that others of her generation have been left out.\n  This is what Jaeleen said about why it is important to make stock \navailable to the descendants.\n\n       I am a shareholder thanks to my parents gifting me shares, \n     but there are a lot of young people who are never going to be \n     shareholders. If you have one parent with several children, \n     they can try to allocate shares to all of them, but some may \n     be left out. Or, maybe you have a Native child who has been \n     adopted who doesn't have parents with shares--whatever. There \n     are going to be a lot of young Native people left out of this \n     corporate structure, and it's really sad. Eventually, there \n     may be a problem because you're going to have a lot of \n     young, talented Alaska Native people going out to get \n     educated. They're going to have a lot of expertise and \n     education in ways that might benefit the corporation, and \n     yet you have to wonder if they're really going to want to \n     be involved in these Native corporations that they don't \n     even belong to. I do want to be involved in the Native \n     corporations because this is my ancestors' land that \n     they're managing and developing and protecting . . .\n\n  I am not going to tell you that each of the 27 young people that A.J. \nprofiled feels the same way. Another young Native profiled in A.J.'s \nbook supported the status quo in spite of the fact that he was born 2 \ndays after the cutoff.\n\n       I really don't think it's necessary to adjust for the \n     future generations. The idea of gifting and willing stock is \n     a really efficient method, and I think we ought to stick with \n     that, rather than having to expand and degrade the stock, \n     allowing the children to be shareholders. It's unfair that we \n     as children born after December 18th are not shareholders, \n     but in order to keep the integrity of the stock, I think it's \n     essential that we continue on with the method of granting, \n     gifting and willing stock.\n\n  The final quote is from a Doyon shareholder who was involved in that \ncompany's decision to make new stock available to those born between \n1971 and 1992.\n\n       When I first started I thought, ``I don't want my dividend \n     to get smaller.'' I was an intern in Doyon's Shareholder \n     Relations, so I was involved in the committee that was \n     studying the issue to enroll children born after 1971. When \n     it was time to vote, I thought: ``Darned if I'm letting my \n     nieces and nephews not be involved.'' I was a total \n     turnaround. There was no way I was going to leave them out. \n     There was no difference between me and them. They were just \n     born later.\n\n  As you can see, there may not be unanimity on the question of whether \nnew stock should be made available to the descendants. But I think we \nall can agree that the debate is a healthy one and the debate will not \ntake place in earnest unless Congress relaxes the supermajority \nstandard imposed by the 1987 amendments.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would allow the shareholders \nof a Native corporation to authorize new stock for those born after \nDecember 18, 1971 by a majority vote of the shares present and voting \nat a duly constituted meeting of the shareholders. Shareholders who \nwant to make the stock available will have the opportunity to vote yes. \nThose who do not will have the opportunity to vote no. Those who choose \nnot to participate, place the fate of the question in the hands of \nthose who choose to participate. The majority prevails.\n  The 1987 amendments authorized Native corporations to make additional \nshares available to Native elders and to enroll those who were eligible \nto receive stock as original shareholders but who failed to enroll. The \nnumber of missed enrollees is expected to be small.

VOTING RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED OF CRIMINAL \n                   OFFENSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the Civic \n     Participation Act of 2005.\n       (b) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n     citizenship and regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n     offenders into free society. The right to vote may not be \n     abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on \n     account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of \n     servitude. Basic constitutional principles of fairness and \n     equal protection require an equal opportunity for United \n     States citizens to vote in Federal elections.\n       (B) Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal \n     elections, an authority that has repeatedly been upheld by \n     the Supreme Court.\n       (C) Although State laws determine the qualifications for \n     voting in Federal elections, Congress must ensure that those \n     laws are in accordance with the Constitution. Currently, \n     those laws vary throughout the Nation, resulting in \n     discrepancies regarding which citizens may vote in Federal \n     elections.\n       (D) An estimated 4,700,000 individuals in the United \n     States, or 1 in 44 adults, currently cannot vote as a result \n     of a felony conviction. Women represent about 676,000 of \n     those 4,700,000.\n       (E) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     ethnic minorities.\n       (F) Fourteen States disenfranchise some or all ex-offenders \n     who have fully served their sentences, regardless of the \n     nature or seriousness of the offense.\n       (G) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders who \n     have fully served their sentences, the right to vote can be \n     regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often \n     illusory.\n       (H) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders, an \n     ex-offender's right to vote can only be restored through a \n     gubernatorial pardon or order, or a certificate granted by a \n     parole board. Some States require waiting periods as long as \n     10 years after completion of the sentence before an ex-\n     offender can initiate the application for restoration of the \n     right to vote.\n       (I) Offenders convicted of a Federal offense often have \n     additional barriers to regaining voting rights. Many States \n     do not offer a restoration procedure for Federal offenders \n     who have completed supervision. The only method available to \n     such persons is a Presidential pardon.\n       (J) Few persons who seek to have their right to vote \n     restored have the financial and political resources needed to \n     succeed.\n       (K) Thirteen percent of the African-American adult male \n     population, or 1,400,000 African-American men, are \n     disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, 3 in \n     10 African-American men in the next generation will be \n     disenfranchised at some point during their lifetimes. \n     Hispanic citizens are also disproportionately \n     disenfranchised, since those citizens are disproportionately \n     represented in the criminal justice system.\n       (L) The discrepancies described in this paragraph should be \n     addressed by Congress, in the name of fundamental fairness \n     and equal protection.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to restore \n     fairness in the Federal election process by ensuring that ex-\n     offenders who have fully served their sentences are not \n     denied the right to vote.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this title:\n       (1) Correctional institution or facility.--The term \n     ``correctional institution or facility'' means any prison, \n     penitentiary, jail, or other institution or facility for the \n     confinement of individuals convicted of criminal offenses, \n     whether publicly or privately operated, except that such term \n     does not include any residential community treatment center \n     (or similar public or private facility).\n       (2) Election.--The term ``election'' means--\n       (A) a general, special, primary, or runoff election;\n       (B) a convention or caucus of a political party held to \n     nominate a candidate;\n       (C) a primary election held for the selection of delegates \n     to a national nominating convention of a political party; or\n       (D) a primary election held for the expression of a \n     preference for the nomination of persons for election to the \n     office of President.\n       (3) Federal office.--The term ``Federal office'' means the \n     office of President or Vice President, or of Senator or \n     Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, \n     Congress.\n       (4) Parole.--The term ``parole'' means parole (including \n     mandatory parole), or conditional or supervised release \n     (including mandatory supervised release), imposed by a \n     Federal, State, or local court.\n       (5) Probation.--The term ``probation'' means probation, \n     imposed by a Federal, State, or local court, with or without \n     a condition on the individual involved concerning--\n       (A) the individual's freedom of movement;\n       (B) the payment of damages by the individual;\n       (C) periodic reporting by the individual to an officer of \n     the court;

Mr. President, today I join Senator Clinton in \nintroducing the Count Every Vote Act of 2005.\n  The 2000 election exposed a number of serious problems with the \naccuracy and fairness of election procedures in this country, as well \nas the reliability of certain types of voting technology. As a result \nof those irregularities, many eligible voters were effectively \ndisenfrachised and thus deprived of one of our most fundamental rights.\n  In the 2004 election, we again saw serious irregularities when voters \nacross this country went to the polls to cast their votes. From \nuntrustworthy electronic voting machines, to partisan secretaries of \nstate, to outrageously long lines at the polls, the election system was \nfar from what voters are entitled to have.\n  At Kenyon College in Ohio, for example, voters were made to wait in \nline until nearly 4 a.m. to vote because there were only two machines \nfor 1,300 voters. In the Columbus area alone, an estimated 5,000 to \n10,000 voters left\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\npolling places, out of frustration, without having voted. In Cleveland, \nthousands of provisional ballots were disqualified after poll workers \ngave faulty instructions to voters.\n  Because of these irregularities--as well as voting irregularities in \nmany other places--I joined Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio \nin objecting to the certification of the Ohio electoral votes on \nJanuary 7, 2005. I did this to cast the light of truth on a flawed \nsystem that must be fixed now. Americans deserve a system where every \nvote is counted and can be verified. And, Congress must do more to give \nconfidence to all of our people that their votes matter.\n  In 2002, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which took \nimportant steps toward electoral reform. Since the enactment of HAVA, \nhowever, concerns have been raised about the security of voting \nmachines and the inability of the majority of voters who may use these \nmachines to be able to adequately verify their vote and to ensure that \nthe vote they intended was both cast and counted. In addition, many \nother problems in our Federal election system--including long wait \ntimes in which to vote, the erroneous purging of voters, voter \nsuppression and intimidation, and unequal access to the voting \nprocess--remain.\n  Last year, I sponsored legislation to address some of these issues. I \nalso joined Senator Clinton and former Senator Bob Graham in \nintroducing an election reform bill. I am pleased to again join Senator \nClinton today to introduce the Count Every Vote Act of 2005--the CEVA \nVoting Act. It requires voting machines to have a voter-verified paper \ntrail for use by all individuals, including language minority voters, \nilliterate voters, and voters with disabilities; and it mandates \nnational standards in the registration of voters and the counting of \nprovisional ballots. All provisions of this legislation are to be in \neffect no later than the November 2006 Federal election.\n  Mr. President, in a democracy, the vote of every citizen counts. We \nmust make sure that every citizen's vote is counted--and counted \naccurately and fairly so that the American people have confidence in \nthe results. HAVA was a good first step. The CEVA Voting Act is the \nnext step, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 451. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Pet Safety \nand Protection Act of 2005. My legislation amends the Animal Welfare \nAct to ensure that all companion animals such as dogs and cats used by \nresearch facilities are obtained legally.\n  Over 30 years ago, Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act, AWA, \nauthorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to set and enforce standards \nprotecting animals used in biomedical research, bred for commercial \nsale, exhibited to the public, or commercially transported from \ninhumane treatment. Despite the well-meaning intentions of the AWA and \nthe enforcement efforts of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nthe act fails to provide reliable protection against the actions of \nsome unethical animal dealers.\n  Under the AWA, class B animal dealers are defined as individuals \nwhose business includes the purchase, sale, or transport of animals in \ncommerce, including dogs and cats intended for use at research \nfacilities. To the dismay of animal welfare advocates and pet owners, \nsome class B, or ``random source,'' dealers have resorted to theft and \ndeception to collect animals for resale. In many instances these \nanimals were found living under inhumane conditions.\n  As recently as August of 2003, USDA agents executed a warrant to \ninvestigate a class B dealer from Arkansas suspected of violations of \nthe AWA for the second time in several years. Many claims have been \nlevied against this dealer, and approximately 125 dogs were seized by \nfederal agents during this week-long search. The complaint investigated \nby the USDA against the dealer alleged that the respondents' \nveterinarian provided for them falsified official health certificates \nfor cats and dogs, and also provided them with blank, undated, and \nsigned health certificates. It also alleged that the dealer failed to \nprovide the barest standards of care, husbandry, and housing for the \nanimals on the premises. In addition, it alleged that its proprietors \nwere aware that some of the companion animals brought to the facility \nwere stolen, and that the business maintained a list of over 50 \n``bunchers,'' individuals who obtain animals and sell them to ``random \nsource'' animal dealers. Bunchers have a variety of methods of \nobtaining companion animals, including responding to newspaper ads \noffering free animals, trespassing on private property to abduct the \nanimals from yards, and house burglaries.\n  I am pleased to report that the civil trial against this class B \ndealer was settled on January 28, 2005. Under the agreement, the dealer \nand others associated with the business had their licenses permanently \nrevoked. In addition, fines up to $262,700 were imposed by the USDA, \nwhich included a personal civil penalty of $12,700. The dealer also is \nprohibited from engaging in any activities under which the licenses \nwere revoked for 5 years.\n  While this case resulted in a landmark settlement, I would like to \nremind my colleagues that if it were not for an outside organization \nthat filed a complaint with the USDA, this class B dealer could still \nbe in operation today. We, in Congress, need to ensure that dealers \nsuch as the one in Arkansas are unable to acquire, house, and sell \npets.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act of 2005 strengthens the AWA by \nprohibiting the use of class B dealers as suppliers of dogs and cats to \nresearch laboratories. Contrary to what others might say, my \nlegislation will not be a burden on research facilities because only 2 \npercent of the approximately 2,051 class B dealers in the United States \ncurrently sell cats and dogs to research facilities.\n  I am not here to argue whether animals should or should not be used \nin research. Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle \nagainst disease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the \nfight against cancer, Alzheimer's, tuberculosis, AIDS, and a host of \nother life-threatening diseases. Animal research has been, and \ncontinues to be, fundamental to advancements in medicine. However, I am \nconcerned with the sale of stolen pets and stray animals to research \nfacilities and the poor treatment of these animals by some class B \ndealers.\n  My legislation preserves the integrity of animal research by \nencouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate \nsources that comply with the AWA. Legitimate sources for animals \ninclude USDA-licensed class A dealers, breeders, and research \nfacilities, municipal pounds and shelters, and legitimate pet owners \nwho want to donate their animals to research. These sources are capable \nof meeting the demand for research animals. The National Institutes of \nHealth, in an effort to curb abuse and deception, have already adopted \npolicies against the acquisition of dogs and cats from class B dealers.\n  The Pet Safety and Protection Act of 2005 also reduces the USDA's \nregulatory burden by allowing the Department to use its resources more \nefficiently and effectively. Each year, thousands of dollars are spent \non regulating dealers. To discourage any future violations of the AWA, \nmy bill increases the penalties to a minimum of $1,000 per violation.\n  I reiterate that this bill in no way impairs or impedes research but \nwill end the fraudulent practices of some class B dealers, as well as \nthe unnecessary suffering of these animals in their care. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 452. A bill to provide for the establishment of national and \nglobal tsunami warning systems and to provide assistance for the relief \nand rehabilitation of victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami and for the \nreconstruction of tsunami-affected countries; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Tsunami Early Warning and Relief Act, to significantly decrease \nlosses in the event of a future tsunami anywhere in the world. This \nbill would direct the\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to establish and \nadminister a Global Tsunami Disaster Reduction Program, based on the \nsuccessful program which NOAA operates in the Pacific Ocean.\n  I traveled to South and Southeast Asia in the wake of last year's \nIndian Ocean tsunami that led to the death of more than 160,000 people \nand a widespread humanitarian crisis. What I witnessed in Indonesia, \nThailand and Sri Lanka was the most incredible destruction I have ever \nseen. I can only imagine that the devastation from the tsunami rivals \nHiroshima and Nagasaki in the level of sheer destruction, damage, \ndisplacement and loss of life.\n  Around the world, and right here in the United States, highly \npopulated coastal areas are vulnerable to potential devastation on the \nscale of the Indian Ocean tsunami. As we continue to assist our South \nAsian friends in their reconstruction effort, we must also do \neverything in our ability to reduce human, ecological and economic \ndamage in the event of another tsunami. We cannot allow such a natural \ndisaster to separate families, orphan children and destroy livelihoods \nonce again.\n  There is no magic solution. Coastal areas, by nature, will face \nsignificant damage if a tsunami strikes. However, an advance warning \nwould go a long way to reduce the loss of life in particular. Had \ngovernments in South Asia been able to inform their citizens of the \napproaching tsunami, tourists would not have been tanning on the beach \nand coastal markets would not have been obliviously going about their \neveryday business. While they would not have been perfect, rudimentary \ncoastal evacuations could have taken place--and as a result we would \nnot see the awful human cost that I witnessed this January.\n  We currently operate an effective warning system in the Pacific \nOcean, which warns our citizens and coastal governments about potential \ntsunami threats faced in Hawaii, Alaska and West Coast states. This \nsystem utilizes a sophisticated network of buoys in the Pacific Ocean \nthat monitor rising and falling water levels. Using this data, and \nseismic observation of the ocean floor, NOAA is able to adequately \nassess the threat posed to coastal residents by natural activity in the \nPacific and inform emergency service agencies in regions that face \nimminent threats.\n  The Tsunami Early Warning and Relief Act would expand NOAA's \nsuccessful Pacific tsunami monitoring and communications program to the \nAtlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, Indian Ocean, and other areas around the \nworld that are vulnerable to tsunamis. Furthermore, this legislation \nexpands NOAA's Tsunami Ready Program, which disseminates tsunami \ncommunications to coastal communities and coordinates evacuation \nstrategies for these regions.\n  In conclusion, expansion of tsunami warning and readiness programs \nare critical to the lives and livelihoods of coastal residents in the \nUnited States and around the world. For all of us, the devastating \naftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami is a call to action that we must \nimprove our reflexes when it comes to tsunamis. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this legislation, and other tsunami warning systems proposed \nby my colleagues, and to move forward as quickly as possible so that we \nnever again have to see the devastation, death, broken families and \norphaned children that we see right now in South Asia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Tsunami Early Warning \nand Relief Act be a printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Early Warning and \n     Relief Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A tremendous undersea earthquake near Sumatra, \n     Indonesia, created a tsunami whose devastation spread \n     throughout South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Africa, \n     leading to the death of more than 160,000 people on December \n     26, 2004. As of February 4, 2005, more than 140,000 people \n     are still missing. The tsunami-affected countries include \n     Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Maldives, Seychelles, \n     Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia, Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania.\n       (2) The tsunami resulted in massive destruction affecting \n     millions of people who now require a great amount of short-\n     term survival assistance and long-term rehabilitation and \n     reconstruction assistance.\n       (3) Compared to past disasters, the Indian Ocean earthquake \n     and tsunami led to historic destruction of the social service \n     infrastructure, businesses, and livelihoods. The devastation \n     caused by the tsunami has resulted in many separated families \n     and countless unaccompanied and orphaned children.\n       (4) An effective global tsunami warning system is critical \n     for preventing future humanitarian disasters and for \n     protecting national security, since tsunamis occurring \n     anywhere around the globe could impact the United States at \n     home and United States national interests abroad.\n       (5) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has \n     already built a system of tsunami buoys in the Pacific Ocean \n     which has been proven to provide critical information and \n     enhance the Nation's response to tsunamis.

A bill to amend section 402 of the Personal Responsibility \nand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide for an \nextension of eligibility for supplemental security income through \nfiscal year 2008 for refugees, asylees, and certain other humanitarian \nimmigrants; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleagues, Senators Kohl, Lugar, Lieberman, Brownback, Clinton, \nLautenberg, and Feingold, to introduce this important piece of \nlegislation. Legislation that will ensure the United States government \ndoes not turn its back on political asylees or refugees who are the \nmost vulnerable citizens seeking safety in this great country of ours.\n  As many of you may know, Congress as part of Personal Responsibility \nand Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, PRWORA, modified the SSI \nprogram to include a seven-year time limit on the receipt of benefits \nfor refugees and asylees. This policy was intended to balance the \ndesire to have people who emigrant to the United States to become \ncitizens, with an understanding that the naturalization process also \ntakes time to complete. To allow adequate time for asylees and refugees \nto become naturalized citizens Congress provided the 7-year time limit \nbefore the expiration of SSI benefits.\n  Unfortunately, the naturalization process often takes longer than 7 \nyears because applicants are requited to live in the United States for \na minimum of 5 years prior to applying for citizenship and the INS \noften takes 3 or more years to process the application. Because of this \ntime delay, many individuals are trapped in the system faced with the \nloss of their SSI benefits.\n  If Congress does not act to change the law, reports show that over \nthe next 4 years nearly 30,000 elderly and disabled refugees and \nasylees will lose their Supplemental Security Income, SSI, benefits \nbecause their 7-year time limit will expire before they become \ncitizens. Many of these individuals are elderly who fled persecution or \ntorture in their home countries. They include Jews fleeing religious \npersecution in the former Soviet Union, Iraqi Kurds fleeing the Saddam \nHussein regime, Cubans and Hmong people from the highlands of Laos who \nserved on the side of the United States military during the Vietnam \nWar. They are elderly and unable to work, and have become reliant on \ntheir SSI benefits as their primary income. To penalize them because of \ndelays encountered through the bureaucratic process seems unjust and \ninappropriate.\n  The administration in its fiscal year 2006 budget acknowledged the \nnecessity to correct this problem by dedicating funding to extend \nrefugee eligibility for SSI beyond the 7-year limit. While I am pleased \nthat they have taken the first step in correcting this problem, I am \nconcerned the policy does not go far enough. Data shows that most \npeople will need at least an additional 2 years to navigate and \ncomplete the naturalization process. Therefore, my colleagues and I \nhave introduced this bill, which will provide a 2-year extension. We \nbelieve this will provide the time necessary to complete the process. .\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill, and I look \nforward to working with Chairman Grassley and other members of the \nFinance Committee to secure these changes during consideration of TANF \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. KOHL. I rise today to join Senator Smith and a bipartisan group \nof Senators in introducing the SSI Extension for Elderly and Disabled \nRefugees Act. This bill builds both on a proposal in the President's \nbudget, and on legislation we introduced last year, to serve the \nneediest individuals in our society.\n  Wisconsin is the home for hundreds of thousands of Hmong family \nmembers who were resettled there in the years after the Vietnam War, \nsome as recently as the 1990s. Many of these Hmong fought with the CIA \nin Laos during the Vietnam War, providing critical assistance to U.S. \nforces. After the fall of Saigon, thousands of Hmong fled Laos and its \ncommunist Pathet Lao government. The United States remains indebted to \nthese courageous individuals and their families.\n  In addition to the Hmong, America has served as a shelter for Jews \nand Baptists fleeing religious persecution in the former Soviet Union; \nand for Iraqis and Cubans escaping tyrannical dictatorships. Our policy \ntoward refugees and asylees embodies the best of our country--\ncompassion, opportunity, and freedom. I am proud of the example our \npolicies set with respect to the treatment of those seeking refuge.\n  But I am disappointed in our decision to allow these people to enter \nthe country and then deny them the means to live. Thousands of people \nwho fled religious and political persecution to seek freedom in the \nU.S. are being punished by a short-sighted policy. A provision in the \n1996 welfare reform bill restricted the amount of time that elderly and \ndisabled refugees and asylees could be eligible for Supplemental \nSecurity Income, SSI, benefits. These benefits serve as a basic monthly \nincome for individuals who are 65 or older, disabled or blind. Over the \nnext 4 years, it is estimated that 40,000 refugees and political \nasylees could lose these important benefits on which they often rely.\n  The 7-year time limit on SSI benefits for legal humanitarian \nimmigrants has already impacted individuals and families across the \ncountry, and will impact thousands more without Congressional action. \nThe provision specifically mandated that to avoid losing this important \nsupport, refugees and asylees must become citizens within the 7 year \nlimit. Unfortunately, this has proved impossible for far too many. The \nprocess of becoming a citizen only truly begins after a refugee has \nresided in the U.S. for 5 years as a lawful permanent resident. And \nbeyond that, there are many other barriers, such as language skills and \nprocessing and bureaucratic delays within the various agencies, which \nan immigrant must overcome before they become naturalized. Beginning in \n2003, immigrants trapped in this process--too often the most vulnerable \nelderly and families--began to lose their SSI benefits with no hope of \nrecourse.\n  This inherent flaw in the system has to be changed. That is why we \nare re-introducing the SSI Extension for Disabled and Elderly Refugees \nAct. This legislation extends the amount of time that refugees and \nasylees have to become citizens to 9 years. In addition, the bill \ncontains a ``reach back'' provision: it retroactively restores benefits \nto those individuals who have already lost them for an additional 2 \nyears. This provision helps the individuals who need it most; \nhumanitarian immigrants who are trapped in the system and have lost \nthis important income source.\n  Across the country, states are recognizing the peril that faces \nindividuals who lose these benefits. Most recently, in January, the \nState of Illinois passed legislation that allows individuals to obtain \nmonthly grants through a State program, if their Federal SSI benefits \nare suspended. This action highlights the need for Congress to act. We \ncannot continue to pass the buck to cash-strapped States. I believe we \nmust act now to protect these individuals.\n  I cannot stress how important this legislation is to many in the \nState of Wisconsin. Last year there were several stories across the \nstate regarding the plight of Hmong families and individuals whose \ncitizenship has been delayed and were faced with losing their benefits. \nThat was a year ago, and Congress failed to pass the legislation that \nSenators Smith, Lugar, Feingold and I had worked so hard on. We cannot \nlet another year go by without helping these individuals.\n  In addition to the Hmong population in Wisconsin, almost every State \nin the\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\ncountry is home to immigrants who will be affected by the limit. Our \ncountry has long been a symbol of freedom, equality and opportunity. \nOur laws should reflect that. Every day that goes by could result in \nthe loss of a refugee's support system--I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation and restore the principles we were put here to \nprotect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 455. A bill to amend the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange \nAct of 1961 to facilitate United States openness to international \nstudents, scholars, scientists, and exchange visitors, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreverse the decline in the number of international students studying at \nAmerican colleges, universities, and high schools. I am very pleased to \nbe joined by my friend and colleague, Senator Bingaman, who cares \ndeeply about these issues as I do.\n  Policies implemented to keep our country safe in the wake of \nSeptember 11 have had the unintended consequence of dramatically \nreducing the number of international students studying in the United \nStates. Total international applications to U.S. graduate schools fell \n28 percent from fall 2003 to fall 2004, and 54 percent of all English \nas a Second Language (ESL) programs have reported declines in overall \napplications at a time where countries such as the U.K., Canada, and \nAustralia are experiencing increases.\n  Why is this a concern for our country?\n  From a foreign policy perspective, America needs all the Ambassadors \nof goodwill we can get. In a world that too often hates Americans \nbecause they do not know us, international education represents an \nopportunity to break down barriers. It is in our local and national \ninterest for the best and brightest foreign students to study in \nAmerica because these are people who will lead their nations one day. \nThe experience they gain with our democratic system and our values \ngives them a better understanding of what America is and who Americans \nare.\n  My caseworkers in Minnesota have dealt with literally hundreds of \nstudent visas cases. One case in particular stands out--that of \nHumphrey Tusimiirwe, a brilliant student from Uganda who was having \ndifficulty getting his student visa for study at St. Thomas. \nFortunately, after several calls to the U.S. Ambassador, Humphrey's \nstory ultimately had a happy ending, and he is going to be part of our \npanel at the University of Minnesota. But too many other students are \nbarred from coming to study in America, and far too many are choosing \nto not study in the U.S. and instead go elsewhere.\n  I have heard from Minnesota's colleges and universities. The presence \nof international students on campuses gives American students an \nirreplaceable opportunity to learn about other cultures and points of \nview. That's why this legislation has the endorsement of the University \nof Minnesota, the MnSCU student association, the Minneapolis Star \nTribune and Rochester Post Bulletin, and others. International \neducation is a $13 billion industry, and foreign students who pay full \ntuition help keep costs down for American students. In Minnesota alone, \ninternational students contribute some $175 million to our economy.\n  Finally, I think this is an economic competitiveness issue too. \nAttracting the world's top scientific scholars helps to keep our \neconomy competitive. Too many of the world's best scientists are opting \nagainst studying in the U.S. because of the barriers we have imposed. \nWe need the world's best and brightest to continue to do their research \nhere, and to continue to use their talents to improve American \ninnovation and ultimately create American jobs. Many of America's most \ninnovative business leaders and top CEOs came to the U.S. as \ninternational students.\n  At the same time, laws are in place to make sure companies hire \nAmerican workers first, and my legislation would not change that. \nThat's why I will introduce legislation, the COMPETE Act, that will \nmake sure American students have the math, science, and engineering \nskills needed to stay competitive.\n  While the State Department has made some very important strides, such \nas extending the validity of Visas Mantis security clearances and \nspeeding up their processing time, there are still too many qualified \nstudents unable to get visas to study in America, and too many who \ntoday are deterred from even applying.\n  That's why I am pleased once again to join with my friend the Senator \nfrom New Mexico in introducing the American Competitiveness Through \nInternational Openness Now (ACTION) Act. Our bill calls for a number of \nsteps that would help America regain our place as the top destination \nfor international students, scholars, scientists and exchange visitors.\n  First, our bill calls for a strategic marketing plan similar to \nstrategies implemented by the U.K., E.U., Canada and Australia to help \nAmerica regain lost ground in attracting the world's best and \nbrightest. There is a perception around the world that America is no \nlonger a welcoming place, so we need to be deliberate and smart in our \nefforts to change that view.\n  The bill calls for more realistic standards for visa evaluations by \nupdating a 50-year old criterion for visa approval and admittance to \nthe United States. Under the so-called 214(b) rule, young people \ncurrently need to prove that they have ``essential ties'' to their home \ncountries and no intention of emigrating to the U.S. But in this age of \nglobalization, it is increasingly difficult for a 20-year old to do \nthis. Many have lived and studied in other countries, and some have \nlost their parents to AIDS. They don't own a house or a business, they \ndon't have spouses or children. Consular officers treat every student \nas an intending immigrant, and it is exceedingly difficult for a \nstudent to prove otherwise.\n  Our legislation calls for common-sense changes to management of the \nSEVIS system, which tracks international students and visitors. Under \nthis legislation, the database would be run more effectively, and fees \nwould be collected in a more fair manner.\n  The bill also sets standards for more timeliness and certainty in the \nstudent visa process, upgrading communication between government \nagencies dealing with student visas and enabling them to identify \nsecurity risks and clear those who are not a threat more quickly.\n  I spent time in Minnesota last Friday listening to my constituents' \nviews about this bill and the positive effect it would have on \nMinnesota colleges and universities. The response was overwhelming. \nThese summits prompted me to add a section to the bill dealing \nspecifically with students who have to return home for family \nemergencies, and a section to help intensive English programs compete \nwith their counterparts in the U.K. and Australia.\n  We have often seen that prejudice is bred by isolation. Those who \nonly look at this country through a keyhole can draw all kinds of \noutrageous conclusions. But exposure and interaction bring people \ntogether. Especially in a time when we are burdened with the question, \n``Why do they hate us?'' we need to enhance those opportunities for \npeople to see us as we really are. International exchanges present \nprecisely this opportunity.\n  International education brings too much to our campuses, our \ncommunities, our economy and our national security to become another \nvictim of the age of terrorism. If we can take ACTION to reverse the \ndecline now, all Americans will reap the benefits for decades to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 455\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Competitiveness \n     Through International Openness Now Act of 2005'' or as the \n     ``ACTION Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has a strategic interest in \n     encouraging international students, scholars, scientists, and \n     exchange visitors to visit the United States to study, \n     collaborate in research, and to develop personal \n     relationships.\n       (2) Openness to international students, scholars, \n     scientists, and exchange visitors serves vital and \n     longstanding national foreign policy, educational, and \n     economic interests and the erosion of such openness \n     undermines the national security interests of the United \n     States.\n       (3) Educating successive generations of future world \n     leaders has long been a foundation of the United States \n     international influence and leadership.\n       (4) Open scientific exchange enables the United States to \n     benefit from the knowledge of the world's top students and \n     scientists and has been a critical factor in maintaining the\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\n     United States leadership in science and technology.\n       (5) International students studying in the United States \n     and their families contribute nearly $13,000,000,000 to the \n     United States economy each year, making higher education a \n     major service sector export.\n       (6) The total number of applications submitted by foreign \n     applicants to graduate schools in the United States for \n     enrollment during the fall of 2004 declined 28 percent from \n     the number of such applications submitted for enrollment \n     during the fall of 2003.\n       (7) The total number of foreign students enrolled in \n     graduate schools in the United States during the fall of 2004 \n     declined 6 percent from the number of such enrollments during \n     the fall of 2003.\n       (8) The number of foreign students enrolled in schools in \n     the United States during the 2003-2004 academic year \n     decreased by 2.4 percent from the number of such students the \n     2002-2003 academic year, marking the first absolute decline \n     in foreign enrollments since the 1971-1972 academic year.\n       (9) The policies implemented by the United States since \n     September 11, 2001, and the public perceptions they have \n     engendered, have discouraged many foreign students from \n     studying in the United States and have frustrated the efforts \n     of many foreign scholars and exchange visitors from visiting \n     the United States.\n       (10) The United States must improve its student, scholar, \n     scientist, and exchange visitor screening process to protect \n     against terrorists seeking to harm the United States.\n       (11) The United States has seen a dramatic increase in \n     requests for Visa Mantis checks, checks designed to protect \n     against illegal transfers of sensitive technology, from \n     approximately 1,000 in fiscal year 2000 to approximately \n     18,500 in fiscal year 2004.\n       (12) Concerns related to the international student \n     monitoring system known as ``SEVIS'' have also contributed to \n     the decline in the number of foreign applicants to \n     educational institutions in the United States.\n       (13) Other countries have instituted aggressive strategies \n     for attracting foreign students, scholars, and scientists, \n     and have adjusted their policies to encourage and accommodate \n     access to universities and scientific exchange. One such \n     country, Australia, has increased enrollment by foreign \n     students in educational institutions in Australia by more \n     than 53 percent since 2001.\n       (14) The European Union has set forth a comprehensive \n     strategy to be the ``most competitive and dynamic knowledge-\n     based economy in the world'' by 2010. Part of this strategy \n     is aimed at enhancing economic competitiveness by making the \n     European Union the most favorable destination for students, \n     scholars, and researchers from other regions of the world.\n       (15) In order to maintain United States competitiveness in \n     the world economy, build vital relationships with future \n     world leaders, and improve popular perceptions of the United \n     States overseas, the United States requires a comprehensive \n     strategy for recruiting foreign students, scholars, \n     scientists, and exchange visitors.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator \nColeman, to introduce the American Competitiveness Through \nInternational Openness Now (``ACTION'') Act of 2005.\n  A few days ago, I came to the Senate floor to discuss the importance \nof the United States taking steps to ensure that we remain the world \nleader in terms of scientific research and innovation. There is a \nglobal competition underway for dominance in science and technology, \nand I remain concerned that the federal resources we are allocating for \nresearch and development are completely insufficient. At a time when \nother countries are investing more in R & D, we are cutting back \nFederal support of key science programs. Our Nation's economic \ncompetitiveness depends on reversing this trend.\n  We must also do all we can to continue to develop a highly skilled \ndomestic workforce. It is paramount that we improve math and science \neducation in our school systems, and spend more on graduate education \nin science and engineering. Maintaining the world's best education \nsystem is essential for ensuring Americans well-paying jobs and \ncritical for our economic and national security.\n  Another area that we must also address in order to ensure U.S. \ncompetitiveness in the world economy is visa processing for scientists, \nengineers, and students wishing to come to the United States. Red tape \nand delays, although improving, still plague our overseas embassies and \nthreaten our long-term economic security.\n  The ACTION Act of 2005 would address this important issue.\n  A country's immigration system helps determines its relationship to \nthe global marketplace. The system can either be conducive to the free \nflow of ideas, scientists, and international business ventures, or it \ncan provide disincentives to the flow of international talent and \nscientific collaboration.\n  Since September 11, the United States has adopted a number of visa \npolicies aimed at making the United States and the traveling public \nmore secure. Unfortunately, those policies have also had a significant \nimpact on scientific collaboration with other countries and have made \nit problematic for exchange students to come to the United States with \nthe ease they once enjoyed. While the United States has an obligation \nto thoroughly vet visa applicants, we need to find ways to do so that \nkeep us engaged with the rest of the world and keep our efforts\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nfocused on those that seek to do us harm.\n  Our international economic competitors are taking proactive steps to \nencourage highly talented students and graduates to come to their \ncountries and study in their universities. In contrast, the attitude \nthat the United States seems to be projecting to highly talented \nforeign scientists and students is one of complacency. This not only \ndamages our image abroad, but also hampers research in the nation's \nlaboratories and universities.\n  Recent studies from the National Science Foundation and the Council \nof Graduate Schools, as well as State Department statistics, have \ndocumented a sharp decline in the foreign students seeking advanced \nscientific and technical degrees in graduate schools across the United \nStates. The National Science Foundation has found that the combination \nof an overly restrictive U.S. policy towards issuing visas, the growing \nperception that the United States is hostile to foreigners, and the \nincrease in opportunities overseas has significantly challenged our \nability to attract the best and brightest from around the world to come \nto the U.S. to study and engage in open scientific exchange.\n  The 2003-2004 academic year marked the first absolute decline in \nforeign student enrollments since the early 1970's. And in the fall of \n2004, international student applications to graduate schools dropped 28 \npercent from the same time in 2003.\n  In contrast, other countries have instituted aggressive strategies \nfor attracting students, scholars, and scientists and have sought to \nencourage access to universities and promote scientific collaboration. \nOne such example is Australia, which has increased international \nstudent enrollment 53 percent since 2001. The European Union has also \nset forth a comprehensive strategy to be the ``most competitive and \ndynamic knowledge-based economy in the world'' by 2010. A key part of \nthis strategy is aimed at making the E.U. the most favorable \ndestination for students, scholars, and researchers from around the \nworld.\n  Our university system is the envy of the world, and where we have a \nlong-standing record of producing the best trained and most innovative \nscientists and engineers, and we must not concede our leadership in \nthis area.\n  It is also important to note that international students play an \nimportant economic role--the Institute of International Education \nrecently determined that through tuition and living expenses, foreign \nstudents contribute roughly $13 billion to the U.S. economy.\n  In particular, the ACTION Act of 2005 would help keep international \nstudents and scientist coming to the United States to participate in \nessential research and exchange programs by: improving visa processing \nin a manner consistent with national security; requiring the President \nto develop a strategic plan to enhance the recruitment and access of \nstudents, scholars, and scientist coming to the United States; \nreforming the SEVIS system, which tracks students, to allow approved \nschools to make corrections to a student's record to correct database \nerrors; and by facilitating that the FBI and the State Department \ndevelop interoperable data systems.\n  Openness to international students and scientist is an important \naspect of maintaining American competitiveness in the world economy, \nand I ask my fellow colleagues to join me in supporting this essential \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 456. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto permit a State to receive credit towards the work requirements under \nthe temporary assistance for needy families program for recipients who \nare determined by appropriate agencies working in coordination to have \na disability and to be in need of specialized activities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pathways to \nIndependence Act of 2005, along with Senators Jeffords, Chafee, \nRockefeller, and Collins. This bill includes two important provisions \nthat we will work to include in TANF reauthorization. These provisions \nwill help States work with TANF recipients who have disabilities to \ntransition them into work.\n  In July 2002, the General Accounting Office reported that as many as \n44 percent of TANF families have a parent or child with a physical or \nmental impairment. This is almost three times as high as among the non-\nTANF population in the United States. In eight percent of TANF \nfamilies, there is both a parent and a child with a disability; among \nnon-TANF families, this figure is one percent. The GAO's work confirmed \nthe findings of earlier studies, including work by the Urban Institute \nand the HHS Inspector General.\n  These figures mean that we need to make sure that TANF \nreauthorization legislation gives States the ability and incentives to \nhelp families meet their current needs, while also helping them to move \nfrom welfare to work. This is the lesson that Oregon and many other \nStates have already learned as they developed and refined their TANF \nprograms.\n  The first provision of my bill provides a pragmatic approach to \nhelping parents with disabilities and substance abuse problems receive \nthe treatment and other rehabilitative services they will need to \nsucceed in a work setting. It is designed so that, over time, States \ncan gradually increase the work activity requirements, while continuing \nto provide clients with rehabilitative services. Under this proposal, \nmuch like in other proposals under consideration, a person \nparticipating in rehabilitation can be counted as engaged in work \nactivity for three months. After the first three months, if a person \ncontinues to need rehabilitative services, the State can continue to \ncount participation in those activities for another three months, so \nlong as that person is engaged in some number of work hours, to be \ndetermined by the State.\n  The next step of my proposal builds on the concept of partial credit \nthat is being considered in the Senate Finance Committee. If, after six \nmonths, a State determines that a person has a continuing need for \nrehabilitative services, the State may create a package that combines \nwork activity with these services. The State will receive credit for \nthe individual's efforts so long as at least one-half of the hours in \nwhich the individual participates are in core work activities. For \nexample, if a State receives full credit for a person who works 30 \nhours per week, and the State has determined that an individual needs \nrehabilitative services beyond six months, that individual would need \nto be engaged in core work activities for at least 15 hours per week to \nget full credit, with the remaining 15 hours spent in rehabilitative \nservices. Similarly, if partial credit is available for a person who \nworks 24 hours per week, then a State could receive that same \npartial credit if the person was engaged in core work activities for at \nleast 12 hours per week, with the remaining 12 hours spent in \nrehabilitative services.\n\n  This approach is appealing for many reasons. First, it allows states \nto design a system in which a person can move progressively over time \nfrom rehabilitation toward work. Second, it gives states credit for the \ntime and effort they will need to invest to help people move \nsuccessfully from welfare to work by allowing States to use a range of \nstrategies to help these families. Third, it creates a more realistic \nstructure for individuals with disabilities and addictions who may \notherwise fall out of the system either through sanction or \ndiscouragement, despite their need for financial support. Finally, this \napproach is appealing because it is designed to work within the \nstructure of the final TANF reauthorization bill.\n  I look forward to working with my co-sponsors, Senators Jeffords, \nChafee, Rockefeller, and Collins, and with the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee on these important provisions in the upcoming months, and I \nurge my colleagues to join us in support of this legislation.\n  I also wish to thank all of the organizations that have expressed \nsupport for this bill. I have received support letters from those \norganizations, and I ask unanimous consent that those letters be \nprinted in the Record\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           Consortium for Citizens\n\n\n                                            With Disabilities,\n\n                                                February 17, 2005.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Senate.\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith, Jeffords, Collins, Chafee, and \n     Rockefeller: We are writing to thank you for introducing \n     legislation that addresses a key problem facing TANF families \n     with a parent with a disability. We believe that this \n     provision, if included in the larger TANF reauthorization \n     bill, will significantly improve the ability of states to \n     help families successfully move from welfare toward work \n     while also ensuring that the needs of family members with \n     disabilities are met. We enthusiastically support this \n     legislation.\n       Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is a \n     coalition of national consumer, advocacy, provider and \n     professional organizations headquartered in Washington, DC. \n     We work together to advocate for national public policy that \n     ensures the self determination, independence, empowerment, \n     integration and inclusion of children and adults with \n     disabilities in all aspects of society. The CCD TANF Task \n     Force seeks to ensure that families that include persons with \n     disabilities are afforded equal opportunities and appropriate \n     accommodations under the Temporary Assistance for Needy \n     Families (TANF) block grant.\n       The research is clear that many TANF families include a \n     parent or a child with a disability, and in some families, \n     there is both a child and a parent with a disability. The \n     numbers are high--GAO has found that as many as 44 percent of \n     TANF families have a child or a parent with a disability--and \n     need to be addressed in the policy choices that Congress \n     makes in TANF reauthorization. We believe that, by designing \n     policies that take into account the needs of families with \n     a member with a disability, Congress can help the states \n     move greater numbers of these families off of welfare and \n     toward greater independence. Without reasonable supports, \n     however, and through no fault of their own, these families \n     sometimes fail at work activity and are often subject to \n     inappropriate sanctioning and the crises that flow from \n     abrupt--and often prolonged--loss of income.\n       Your bill would provide low-income families with members \n     with disabilities real opportunities to achieve self-\n     sufficiency. Under current law, states have the flexibility--\n     either through a waiver such as Oregon has or as a result of \n     the caseload reduction credit--to ensure that a parent with a \n     disability, including a substance abuse problem, receives the \n     rehabilitative services she needs in order to move towards \n     work. In recent years, increasing numbers of states have used \n     this flexibility as they realized that some parents would \n     need more specialized help if they were going to successfully \n     leave TANF. Some of the current reauthorization proposals, \n     however, limit states to counting three or six months of \n     rehabilitative services as work activity. Such short limits \n     on rehabilitative services would be inadequate to help many \n     families with members with disabilities find and sustain \n     employment, and, in light of proposed increases in state \n     participation rates, would discourage states from designing \n     programs and requirements that work for people with the most \n     severe barriers.\n       Your bill will allow states to count rehabilitative \n     services as work activity beyond six months as long as the \n     state TANF agency works collaboratively with other public or \n     private agencies in determining disability and the services \n     that will be provided and the rehabilitative services are \n     mixed with significant work activity. We believe this mix of \n     work activities and supports will help an individual with \n     severe barriers move toward greater independence. The \n     provision would allow states to count individuals \n     participating in rehabilitative services after six months as \n     long as at least one-half of the hours in which the \n     individual participates are in core work activities. This \n     will allow states to create a progression of work activity \n     hours combined with rehabilitative services over time that \n     will assist in moving the family from welfare to work at a \n     pace that is designed to lead to success for that family.\n       CCD is not asking Congress to exempt individuals with \n     disabilities from participation in the TANF program. On the \n     contrary, we are looking for the essential assistance and \n     supports that will help families move off of welfare toward \n     greater independence. Your bill does not create any \n     exemptions from participation requirements, and in fact, \n     provides the necessary assistance and supports that can come \n     with participation in the TANF program. Under the bill, \n     states would have to engage the same number of recipients in \n     welfare-to-work activities as under the standard set in a new \n     reauthorization law. The provision simply allows states to \n     utilize a broader range of activities to help recipients with \n     barriers move to work. In short, this is a way to make the \n     TANF program work for parents with disabilities and substance \n     abuse problems. The provision would give states credit when \n     recipients with barriers are engaged in activities and, thus, \n     will encourage states to assist families with barriers to \n     progress toward work in a manner and at a pace that is more \n     tailored to their needs and disabilities.\n       Thank you again for introducing this legislation and your \n     leadership on this very important issue.

Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith, Jeffords, Rockefeller, Collins, and \n     Chafee: Thank you for introducing the ``Pathways to \n     Independence Act of 2005.'' The provision included in this \n     bill, if included in the TANF reauthorization legislation, \n     will improve the ability of states to help TANF recipients \n     with disabilities, including substance abuse problems, to \n     move towards work and greater independence.\n       Your bill improves on provisions in the Personal \n     Responsibility and Individual Development for Everyone \n     (PRIDE) Act, which passed the Senate Finance Committee in the \n     last Congress and has now been introduced as part of S. 6. \n     The current Senate version of the PRIDE Act allows states to \n     count rehabilitative services towards the work participation \n     rate for up to six months, as long as some core work activity \n     is combined with the rehabilitative services in the second \n     three-month period. The Smith-Jeffords bill builds on this \n     and would allow states to count participation in \n     rehabilitative activities beyond six months, so long as the \n     individual participates in at least one-half the required \n     core work activity hours. The bill also would encourage \n     states to work collaboratively with other agencies that have \n     expertise in identifying disabilities and developing \n     appropriate service plans to address those disabilities.\n       The encouragement of collaboration is a critical component \n     of the bill. It is our experience that many states have used \n     the flexibility of current law to begin developing such \n     collaborative approaches to working with families who face \n     multiple barriers to employment and independence. However, we \n     are concerned that the increased participation rate \n     requirement contemplated in TANF reauthorization proposals \n     will discourage states from continuing such collaborative \n     approaches to helping families progress on the pathway to \n     independence. Unless states are provided more flexibility in \n     determining what activities count towards the participation \n     rate, we fear states that are already providing critical \n     services will no longer be able to provide them.\n       For example, last year, the Vermont Vocational \n     Rehabilitation Agency, working in conjunction with the \n     state's TANF agency, reported that it had recently assisted \n     109 recipients with disabilities in achieving successful \n     employment (defined as stable employment for 90 days). Only \n     14 of the 109 TANF recipients with disabilities (or 12.8 \n     percent) achieved stable employment in six months or less. \n     Without flexibility to go beyond six months in providing \n     rehabilitative services to people with disabilities, as \n     provided by the Smith-Jeffords bill, Vermont would have \n     risked penalties by offering rehabilitative services beyond \n     six months and 95\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\n     of the 109 TANF recipients with disabilities would have been \n     unlikely to receive the services they needed to become \n     successfully employed.\n       Similarly, drug and alcohol treatment programs that serve \n     women with children, including women receiving TANF \n     assistance, generally require more than six months of \n     services. Indeed, 54 percent of these family-based treatment \n     programs extend beyond six months and demonstrate successful \n     outcomes of upwards of 60 percent of parents achieving \n     lasting sobriety and family stabilization. Family-based \n     treatment programs combine job training, parenting classes, \n     education, and life skills training in their substance abuse \n     treatment plans. These programs also include employment as an \n     essential aspect of the treatment plan, when a particular \n     individual is ready to engage in work. Allowing individuals \n     time to complete treatment is critical. An Oregon study \n     showed that those who completed drug treatment received wages \n     65 percent higher than those who did not. Nationally, SAMHSA \n     research demonstrates that the longer parents stay in \n     substance abuse treatment programs the more likely they are \n     to succeed: of parents who stayed in treatment for more than \n     six months, 71 percent achieved sustained recovery after \n     completing treatment as well as six months post-discharge.\n       The goal should be to help parents with disabilities, \n     including substance abuse problems, obtain whatever help they \n     need--for however long they need, as determined by the state \n     and local agencies working together--to help them \n     successfully move from welfare to work. Allowing states to \n     receive credit for only a limited number of months of \n     rehabilitative services will mean that some parents do not \n     get the intensive help they need to succeed.\n       We are also quite concerned that many of the families who \n     are unable to obtain the services they need will end up in \n     the child welfare system. It is the most disadvantaged \n     families, those with barriers such as mental or physical \n     disabilities or problems with substance abuse, who are at \n     greatest risk of making the transition into the child welfare \n     system.\n       Thus, neither families nor states can afford an inflexible \n     and ineffective approach to addressing barriers in the TANF \n     program. States must be permitted to count participation in \n     activities that help parents with disabilities successfully \n     participate in the workplace and care for their children, for \n     as long as those activities are needed to help the family \n     progress towards greater independence. We believe that your \n     bill provides this needed flexibility and will encourage \n     state agencies to work collaboratively in assisting these \n     families.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to introduce \ntoday, along with my colleagues Senators Smith, Collins, Chafee, and \nRockefeller, the ``Pathways to Independence Act of 2005.'' This \nlegislation is the product of a bipartisan effort to ensure that those \nindividuals in our welfare system who face the toughest barriers to \nwork, such as individuals with disabilities or substance abuse \nproblems, are provided the best opportunity for future success and \nproductivity. This legislation gives states the tools and incentives \nnecessary to assist them in moving individuals from welfare to work.\n  The current welfare system has been widely regarded as a success in \nmoving individuals off the welfare rolls, and states have been given \nincentives to do so. While this approach has been regarded as \nsuccessful, it has one major flaw. Although the states are provided \nincentives for removing people from the welfare rolls, no incentives \nexist for placing individuals into sustainable employment. States \nreceive the same credit for moving a welfare recipient into a high \npaying job as they do for sanctioning that person outright. This \nperverse incentive has been particularly difficult for the many welfare \nrecipients who have disabilities or struggle with substance abuse \nproblems. In many states it is easier to write these people off than to \ngive them the support necessary to become truly independent.\n  In Vermont, approximately 15 percent of the welfare caseload has been \ndiagnosed with a disability and receive services through the Vermont \nDepartment of Vocational Rehabilitation. Vermont's effort to provide \nthese services enables welfare recipients to, move from welfare to \nwork. However, these services are not included in the core work \nactivities allowed under the current welfare law. Vermont receives no \ncredit or incentive for moving these individuals to independence. This \npolicy is wrong. If we truly want welfare to be an initiative that \nhelps people to become independent and self-sufficient, then our \npolicies must reflect our intentions. That is where ``The Pathways to \nIndependence Act of 2005'' comes into play.\n  The ``Pathways to Independence Act of 2005'' would allow states to \ncount certain rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities \nand treatment for substance abuse toward work activities. Here's how it \nworks: the legislation would give states the ability to count a welfare \nrecipient who is engaged in work, or work preparation activities, to \nparticipate in a drug treatment program for three months. At the end of \nthis 3-month period, the state would be given the opportunity to re-\nevaluate the status of the individual and decide whether to continue \ntreatment for an additional 3 months. This is the same process that is \nenvisioned in the ``Personal Responsibility and Individual Development \nfor Everyone (PRIDE) Act'' that the Finance Committee is planning to \nconsider this spring. The PRIDE approach would then require an \nindividual with a severe barrier to meet the same standard as a non-\ndisabled individual. However, the ``Pathways to Independence Act'' \nwould allow the state to continue treatment for the individual, \nprovided that the individual is meeting at least half of the regular \nwork requirements and following their treatment program for the \nremaining hours.\n  This is a common sense proposal. It is consistent with the research \non providing effective support programs for people with disabilities \nand effective treatment programs for people struggling with substance \nabuse leading to sustainable employment. By allowing states to count \nthese individuals in the ``working'' category, we provide the states \nwith the necessary incentives to engage those most difficult to serve \nin meaningful ways that will help them to work. It will allow the \nstates to place people with disabilities and substance abuse problems \non a pathway to independence.\n  The ``Pathways to Independence Act of 2005'' would supply the states \nwith the tools and incentives necessary to provide welfare recipients \nwith the greatest chance for independence and self-sufficiency. If we \ntruly want to take the necessary steps towards achieving this goal and \nimproving upon our current welfare system, this legislation must be \npart of any welfare reform reauthorization that is enacted.\n  I would like to thank the members of the Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities for their help in developing this legislation and their \nstrong letter in support of this initiative. I especially want to thank \nmy colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, for his commitment to this \nlegislation and all of our cosponsors in this endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1679-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1679-S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 58--COMMENDING THE HONORABLE HOWARD HENRY BAKER, JR., \n   FORMERLY A SENATOR OF TENNESSEE, FOR A LIFETIME OF DISTINGUISHED \n                                SERVICE\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Reid, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \nLugar) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 59\n\n       Whereas, on June 4, 1989, the Communist Government of the \n     People's Republic of China ordered the People's Liberation \n     Army to carry out an unprovoked, brutal assault on thousands \n     of peaceful and unarmed demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, \n     resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries;\n       Whereas, on June 5, 1989, President George H. W. Bush \n     condemned these actions of the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, and the United States took several \n     concrete steps to respond to the military assault, including \n     suspending all exports of items on the United States \n     Munitions List to the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas, on June 27, 1989, the European Union (then called \n     the European Community) imposed an arms embargo on the \n     People's Republic of China in response to the Government of \n     China's brutal repression of protestors calling for \n     democratic and political reform;\n       Whereas the European Council, in adopting that embargo, \n     ``strongly condemn[ed] the brutal repression taking place in \n     China'' and ``solemnly request[ed] the Chinese authorities. . \n     . to put an end to the repressive actions against those who \n     legitimately claim their democratic rights'';\n       Whereas the poor human rights conditions that precipitated \n     the decisions of the United States and the European Union to \n     impose and maintain their respective embargoes have not \n     improved;\n       Whereas the Department of State 2003 Country Reports on \n     Human Rights Practices states that, during 2003, ``The \n     [Chinese] Government's human rights record remained poor, and \n     the Government continued to commit numerous and serious \n     abuses,'' and, furthermore, that ``there was backsliding on \n     key human rights issues during the year'';\n       Whereas, according to the same Department of State report, \n     credible sources estimated that as many as 2,000 persons \n     remained in prison in the People's Republic of China at the \n     end of 2003 for their activities during the June 1989 \n     Tiananmen demonstrations;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to maintain that its crackdown on democracy \n     activists in Tiananmen Square was warranted and remains \n     unapologetic for its brutal actions, as demonstrated by that \n     Government's handling of the recent death of former Premier \n     and Communist Party General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang, who had \n     been under house arrest for 15 years because of his objection \n     to the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown;\n       Whereas, since December 2003, the European Parliament, the \n     legislative arm of the European Union, has rejected in four \n     separate resolutions the lifting of the European Union arms \n     embargo on the People's Republic of China because of \n     continuing human rights concerns in China;\n       Whereas the January 13, 2005, resolution of the European \n     Parliament called on the European Union to maintain its arms \n     embargo on the People's Republic of China until the European \n     Union ``has adopted a legally binding Code of Conduct on Arms \n     Exports and the People's Republic of China has taken concrete \n     steps towards improving the human rights situation in that \n     country. . . [including] by fully respecting the rights of \n     minorities'';\n       Whereas a number of European Union member states have \n     individually expressed concern about lifting the European \n     Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China, and \n     several have passed resolutions of opposition in their \n     national parliaments;\n       Whereas the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, \n     as a non-binding set of principles, is insufficient to \n     control European arms exports to the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas public statements by some major defense firms in \n     Europe and other indicators suggest that such firms intend to \n     increase military sales to the People's Republic of China if \n     the European Union lifts its arms embargo on that country;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense fiscal year 2004 Annual \n     Report on the Military Power of the People's Republic of \n     China found that ``[e]fforts underway to lift the European \n     Union (EU) embargo on China will provide additional \n     opportunities to acquire specific technologies from Western \n     suppliers'';\n       Whereas the same Department of Defense report noted that \n     the military modernization and build-up of the People's \n     Republic of China is aimed at increasing the options of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China to intimidate or \n     attack democratic Taiwan, as well as preventing or disrupting \n     third-party intervention, namely by the United States, in a \n     cross-strait military crisis;\n       Whereas the June 2004, report to Congress of the \n     congressionally-mandated, bipartisan United States-China \n     Economic and Security Review Commission concluded that \n     ``there has been a dramatic change in the military balance \n     between China and Taiwan,'' and that ``[i]n the past few \n     years, China has increasingly developed a quantitative and \n     qualitative advantage over Taiwan'';\n       Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), \n     which codified in 1979 the basis for continued relations \n     between the United States and Taiwan, affirmed that the \n     decision of the United States to establish diplomatic \n     relations with the People's Republic of China was based on \n     the expectation that the future of Taiwan would be determined \n     by peaceful means;\n       Whereas the balance of power in the Taiwan Straits and, \n     specifically, the military capabilities of the People's \n     Republic of China, directly affect peace and security in the \n     East Asia and Pacific region;\n       Whereas the Foreign Minister of Japan, Nobutaka Machimura, \n     recently stated that Japan is opposed to the European Union \n     lifting its embargo against the People's Republic of China \n     and that ``[i]t is extremely worrying as this issue concerns \n     peace and security environments not only in Japan but also in \n     East Asia as a whole'';\n       Whereas the United States has numerous security interests \n     in the East Asia and Pacific region, including the security \n     of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and other key areas, and the \n     United States Armed Forces, which are deployed throughout the \n     region, would be adversely affected by any Chinese military \n     aggression;\n       Whereas the lifting of the European Union arms embargo on \n     the People's Republic of China would increase the risk that \n     United States troops could face military equipment and \n     technology of Western, even United States, origin in a cross-\n     strait military conflict;\n       Whereas this risk would necessitate a reevaluation by the \n     United States Government of procedures for licensing arms and \n     dual-use exports to member states of the European Union in \n     order to attempt to prevent the retransfer of United States \n     exports from such countries to the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       Whereas the report of the United States-China Economic and \n     Security Review Commission on the Symposia on Transatlantic \n     Perspectives on Economic and Security Relations with China, \n     held in Brussels, Belgium and Prague, Czech Republic from \n     November 29, 2004, through December 3, 2004, recommended that \n     the United States Government continue to press the European \n     Union to maintain the arms embargo on the People's Republic \n     of China and strengthen its arms export control system, as \n     well as place limitations on United States public and private \n     sector defense cooperation with foreign firms that sell \n     sensitive military technology to China;\n       Whereas the lax export control practices of the People's \n     Republic of China and the continuing proliferation of \n     technology related to weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles by state-sponsored entities in China \n     remain a serious concern of the United States Government;\n       Whereas the most recent Central Intelligence Agency \n     Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of \n     Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and \n     Advanced Conventional Munitions, 1 July Through 31 December \n     2003, found that ``Chinese entities continued to work with \n     Pakistan and Iran on ballistic missile-related projects \n     during the second half of 2003,'' and that ``[d]uring 2003, \n     China remained a primary supplier of advanced conventional \n     weapons to Pakistan, Sudan, and Iran'';\n       Whereas, as recently as December 20, 2004, the United \n     States Government determined that seven entities of the \n     People's Republic of China, including several state-owned \n     companies involved in China's military-industrial complex, \n     should be subject to sanctions under the Iran \n     Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-178; 50 U.S.C. \n     1701 note) for sales to Iran of prohibited equipment or \n     technology; and\n       Whereas the assistance provided by these entities to Iran \n     works directly counter to the efforts of the United States \n     and several European countries to curb illicit weapons \n     activities in Iran: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) strongly supports the United States embargo on the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       (2) strongly urges the European Union to continue its ban \n     on all arms exports to the People's Republic of China;\n       (3) requests that the President raise United States \n     objections to the potential lifting of the European Union \n     arms embargo against the People's Republic of China in \n     upcoming meetings with European officials;\n       (4) encourages the United States Government to make clear \n     in discussions with Governments in Europe that a lifting of \n     the European Union embargo on arms sales to the People's \n     Republic of China would potentially adversely affect \n     transatlantic defense cooperation, including future transfers \n     of United States military technology, services, and equipment \n     to European Union countries;\n       (5) urges the European Union--\n       (A) to close any loopholes in its arms embargo on the \n     People's Republic of China and in its Code of Conduct on Arms \n     Exports;\n       (B) to make its Code of Conduct on Arms Exports legally \n     binding and enforceable;\n       (C) to more carefully regulate and monitor the end-use of \n     exports of sensitive dual-use technology; and\n       (D) to increase transparency in its arms and dual-use \n     export control regimes;\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\n       (6) deplores the ongoing human rights abuses in the \n     People's Republic of China; and\n       (7) urges the United States Government and the European \n     Union to cooperatively develop a common strategy to seek--\n       (A) improvement in the human rights conditions in the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       (B) an end to the military build-up of the People's \n     Republic of China aimed at Taiwan;\n       (C) improvement in the export control practices of the \n     People's Republic of China; and\n       (D) an end to the ongoing proliferation by state-sponsored \n     entities in China of technology related to weapons of mass \n     destruction and ballistic missiles.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution on the \nEuropean Union's expressed intent to lift its arms embargo against \nChina.\n  During the EU-China summit meeting last December, the European Union \nindicated that it is likely to lift the arms embargo it imposed against \nChina after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Evidently, the \n``strategic partnership'' the EU seeks with China and base economic \ninterests trump the human rights considerations that were the reason \nfor instituting the embargo in the first place. How the EU proceeds on \nthis issue will reveal a great deal about the role it seeks to play in \nthe world.\n  In helping the Chinese develop their military capabilities, the \nEuropeans see two principal benefits. China's enhanced military prowess \nwould serve as a more effective counterweight to American power, \ntheoretically strengthening the EU's hand in international political \nand strategic decisions. Additionally, European defense industries \nstand to gain billions of euros in Chinese contracts which, for EU \nleaders, seems too good to resist.\n  Sadly, the EU seems to be giving in to Chinese blackmail. Because \nChina views the continued arms embargo as an international black eye \nand an embarrassing reminder of the Tiananmen crackdown, it has \naggressively lobbied the Europeans to lift it, even saying that their \ntrade relationship will be jeopardized if the embargo remains in place.\n  It is important to remember the reason for imposing the embargo: \nChina's brutal reaction to the democratic movement in 1989 that \nresulted in the death of hundreds of Chinese and the imprisonment of \nthousands more. So, when we consider the future of the embargo it seems \nself-evident to evaluate the current state of human rights in China \ntoday.\n  Though the government's methods may be more refined than we saw in \nJune 1989, the situation remains bleak. Chinese citizens who attempt to \nexercise basic rights are dealt with harshly. People are jailed for \nwriting essays. Priests are beaten and abused. Churches are closed, \ntheir leaders detained. Birth planning policies are cruelly \nimplemented. The Chinese people are still unable to speak freely, to \nmeet without interference, or to worship in peace.\n  Although respect for basic human rights is one of the values that \ndefine the Euro-Atlantic tradition, the EU seems ready to discard it at \nwill. It is foolish for them to call on China to improve its human \nrights record and then talk of rewarding them by lifting the embargo. I \ncringe to think of the message that sends to the brave Chinese \ndissidents fighting for democracy.\n  The EU claims that lifting the embargo will not change the status \nquo. Its argument is based on the EU's 'Code of Conduct' that lays out \nminimal standards (including respect for human rights and preservation \nof regional peace) for EU nations to consider before approving arms \nsales. There would be no explosion of military sales to China if the \nembargo is lifted, EU leaders say. But not only is the Code of Conduct \nineffective, it is purely voluntary. And if its terms are violated, it \nis not legally enforceable.\n  Even if the EU were to strengthen the code of conduct and improve its \ntransparency, I am confident that EU members would ignore its \nprovisions if they deem it economically advantageous. Otherwise, I \ndoubt their defense industries would be as enthusiastic about access to \nthe Chinese marketplace.\n  There are serious consequences if the EU proceeds down this road. By \ngiving China access to advanced military systems, including \nsurveillance and communication equipment, the EU would be directly \nresponsible for modernizing the Chinese military. On a regional basis, \nthe delicate strategic balance in the Taiwan straits will be altered, \nand as one Pentagon official states, China will be able to kill \nAmericans more effectively. China's recent threatening moves against \nJapan will be seen as more dangerous. And whether the EU admits it or \nnot, China will have a greater capability to suppress internal dissent.\n  This may not matter to Europe. But they should carefully consider the \nimpact this move would have on the transatlantic relationship that they \nclaim to value. I can guarantee that if the EU lifts its arms embargo \nagainst China, the Congress will reassess the close defense and \nintelligence cooperation that the United States has with Europe and \nwork to reverse the liberalization of technology transfers to our \nEuropean partners. To do otherwise would be irresponsible. If we share \nadvanced technology with the EU which then allows China even limited \naccess to it, our forces in the Pacific are more vulnerable to Chinese \nmisadventure.\n  Last November, British Foreign Minister Jack Straw told me that the \nUnited Kingdom did not want to jeopardize its close defense \nrelationship with the U.S. over the arms embargo issue. Yet, apparently \nthe British believe that this is an instance where it can play the role \nof a good European, rather than an American partner. I take heart that \nthere are some EU members that still believe in the importance of \ntaking a stand on human rights grounds. Unfortunately, I am not certain \ntheir views can prevail in Brussels.\n  I am pleased that my distinguished colleague, Senator Biden, has \njoined me in submitting this resolution today, along with Senators \nBrownback, Kyl, Chambliss, and Ensign.\n  President Bush will be traveling to Europe next week, where he will \nmeet with senior European and EU leaders. This resolution states our \nstrong support of the United States arms embargo on China and urges the \nEuropean Union to maintain its embargo as well. It also urges the \nPresident to raise our objections to the EU lifting its embargo and to \nengage the Europeans during his meetings next week in a discussion on \nhow doing so could adversely affect the transatlantic relationship. It \nencourages the EU to examine its current arms control policies, close \nany loopholes, and examine their trade with China in light of serious \nhuman rights concerns.\n  I believe, and it is expressed in the resolution, that this situation \npresents us with an opportunity to work with the EU to strengthen the \ntransatlantic relationship. By working together actively on a common \nstrategy to improve human rights in China, end the Chinese military \nbuild-up against Taiwan, improve Chinese export control practices, and \nbring an end to the ongoing proliferation by state-sponsored entities \nin China of technology related to weapons of mass destruction and \nballistic missiles, we are more likely to achieve our common goal.\n  But I am concerned that the strident competitiveness of some senior \nEuropean leaders and their obsession with hampering America's ability \nto operate in the world is impacting U.S. national security interests, \nrather than purely economic or commercial ones.

Res. 64\n\n       Whereas mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic \n     heavy metal;\n       Whereas mercury is found naturally in the environment but \n     is also emitted into the air, land, and water in various \n     forms in the United States and around the world during fossil \n     fuel combustion, waste incineration, chlor-alkali production, \n     mining, and other industrial processes, as well as during the \n     production, use, and disposal of various products;\n       Whereas mercury air pollution has the ability to both \n     deposit locally and travel thousands of miles in a global \n     atmospheric pool of emissions before eventual deposition, \n     crossing national boundaries and becoming a shared global \n     burden;\n       Whereas the United Nations Environment Programme reported \n     that, on average, anthropogenic emissions of mercury since \n     pre-industrial times have resulted in 50- to 300-percent \n     increases in deposition rates around the world;\n       Whereas the United Nations Environment Programme reported \n     that global consumption of mercury equaled 3,337 tons in \n     1996, and that all mercury releases to the global environment \n     total approximately 5,000 tons each year;\n       Whereas mercury air pollution can deposit into lakes, \n     streams, and the oceans where it is transformed into toxic \n     methylmercury and bioaccumulates in fish and fish-eating \n     wildlife;\n       Whereas the National Academy of Sciences confirmed that \n     consumption of mercury-contaminated fish and seafood by \n     pregnant women can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm in \n     the fetus, including such detrimental effects as intelligence \n     quotient deficits, abnormal muscle tone, decreases in motor \n     function, attention, or visuospatial performance, mental \n     retardation, seizure disorders, cerebral palsy, blindness, \n     and deafness;\n       Whereas the 1997 Mercury Study Report submitted by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     Congress found that every region of the United States is \n     adversely affected by mercury deposition;\n       Whereas the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and 44 States currently have advisories \n     warning the public to limit consumption of certain fish that \n     are high in mercury content;\n       Whereas, of the 4,000,000 children born every year in the \n     United States, a scientist at the Environmental Protection \n     Agency estimates that approximately 630,000 are exposed to \n     mercury levels in the womb above the safe health threshold, \n     caused primarily by maternal consumption of mercury-tainted \n     fish;\n       Whereas these health and environmental effects of mercury \n     contamination can impose significant social and economic \n     costs in the form of increased medical care, special \n     educational and occupational needs, reduced economic \n     performance, and disruptions in recreational and commercial \n     fishing and hunting, and can create disproportionate health, \n     social, and economic impacts among subpopulations dependent \n     on subsistence fishing;\n       Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated \n     that the United States is a net emitter of mercury in that \n     the United States contributes 3 times as much mercury to the \n     global atmospheric pool of air emissions as it receives \n     through deposition;\n       Whereas the United States Geological Survey has not \n     reported mercury consumption figures for key sectors in the \n     United States economy since 1996, thereby creating important \n     information gaps relating to domestic mercury use and trade;\n       Whereas the quantity of domestic fugitive chlor-alkali \n     sector emissions has been labeled an enigma by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       Whereas, in accordance with Public Law 101-549 (commonly \n     known as the ``Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. \n     7401 et seq.), the Environmental Protection Agency determined \n     in December 2000 that a maximum achievable control technology \n     standard for mercury and other air toxic emissions for \n     electric utility steam generating units in the United States \n     is appropriate and necessary, and listed coal- and oil-fired \n     electric utility steam generating units for regulation, \n     thereby triggering a statutory requirement that maximum \n     achievable controls be implemented at every existing coal- \n     and oil-fired electric utility steam generating unit by not \n     later than December 2005;\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\n       Whereas other major stationary sources have already \n     implemented maximum achievable control technology standards \n     for mercury and other air toxics, as required by the Clean \n     Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);\n       Whereas effective mercury and other heavy metal removal \n     techniques have been demonstrated and are available on an \n     industrial scale in the major stationary source categories;\n       Whereas the lack of effective emission control standards in \n     other countries can give foreign industries a competitive \n     advantage over United States businesses;\n       Whereas alternatives and substitutes have been demonstrated \n     and are available to reduce or eliminate mercury use in most \n     products and processes;\n       Whereas the European Commission reports that mercury \n     mining, the closing of mercury cell chlor-alkali facilities, \n     and the phasing out of other outmoded industrial processes in \n     the United States and Europe are contributing significantly \n     to imports of mercury in the developing world;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense announced in April 2004 \n     that it will consolidate and store its stockpile of \n     approximately 5,000 tons of mercury rather than allow the \n     surplus to enter the global marketplace;\n       Whereas from 1996 through 2004, the Environmental Council \n     of the States adopted or renewed 9 resolutions highlighting \n     the importance of substantially reducing mercury use and \n     releases in the United States and around the world, and of \n     managing excess supplies of mercury so that they do not enter \n     the global marketplace;\n       Whereas many States, including California, Connecticut, \n     Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \n     Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, \n     Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, \n     Washington, and Wisconsin, are already implementing their own \n     laws, regulations, and other strategies for tracking or \n     reducing various forms of mercury use and pollution, and the \n     Governors of States in New England have set a goal of \n     virtually eliminating mercury emissions in that region;\n       Whereas the European Commission is developing a mercury \n     strategy that is aimed at comprehensively addressing all \n     aspects of the mercury cycle, including the use, trade, and \n     release of mercury;\n       Whereas the United States is a party to the Protocol on \n     Heavy Metals of the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary \n     Air Pollution, done at Aarhus, Denmark on June 24, 1998, \n     which entered into force in December 2003 and commits the \n     United States to a basic obligation to limit air emissions of \n     mercury and other heavy metals from new and existing sources, \n     within 2 and 8 years respectively, using the best available \n     techniques;\n       Whereas the current parties to the Convention and the \n     Protocol represent only a portion of anthropogenic emissions \n     of heavy metals annually that are subject to transboundary \n     atmospheric transport and are likely to have significant \n     adverse effects on human health or the environment;\n       Whereas the 22nd session of the United Nations Environment \n     Programme Governing Council concluded that there is \n     sufficient evidence in the Programme's Global Mercury \n     Assessment of significant global adverse impacts to warrant \n     international action to reduce the risks to human health and \n     the environment from releases of mercury;\n       Whereas the United Nations Environment Programme invited \n     submission of governmental views on medium- and long-term \n     actions on mercury and other heavy metals, which will be \n     synthesized into a report for presentation at the 23rd \n     session of the Governing Council occurring February 21 to 25, \n     2005, with a view to developing a legally binding instrument, \n     a non-legally binding instrument, or other measures or \n     actions; and\n       Whereas the United States has taken no position on any such \n     instrument: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States should engage constructively and \n     proactively in international dialogue regarding mercury \n     pollution, use, mining, and trade; and\n       (2) the President should prepare a comprehensive strategy--\n       (A) to advance and enter into international negotiations on \n     a binding agreement that would--\n       (i) reduce global use, trade, and releases of mercury to \n     levels sufficient to protect public health and the \n     environment, including steps to--\n\n       (I) establish specific and stringent targets and schedules \n     for reductions in mercury use in the United States, and \n     emissions below levels for calendar year 2000, beyond current \n     domestic and global efforts;\n       (II) end primary mercury mining in the near future and \n     establish a system to ensure excess mercury supplies do not \n     enter the global marketplace; and\n       (III) require countries to develop regional and national \n     action plans to address mercury sources and uses;\n\n       (ii) include all countries that use, trade, or release \n     significant quantities of mercury into the environment from \n     anthropogenic sources;\n       (iii) require the application of the best available control \n     technologies and strategies to control releases from \n     industrial sectors in the very near future, including \n     minimizing releases from coal-fired power plants and \n     replacing obsolete mercury products and processes, including \n     the mercury cell chlor-alkali process;\n       (iv) contain mechanisms for promoting and funding the \n     transfer and adoption of less emitting technologies and \n     mercury-free processes, and for facilitating the safe cleanup \n     of mercury contamination;\n       (v) establish a standardized system to document and track \n     the use, production, and trade of mercury and mercury-\n     containing products, including a licensing requirement for \n     mercury traders; and\n       (vi) incorporate explicit mechanisms for adding toxic air \n     pollutants with similar characteristics in the future;\n       (B) to delineate the preferred structure, format, \n     participants, mechanisms, and resources necessary for \n     achieving and implementing the agreement described in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (C) to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements to \n     align global mercury production with reduced global demand \n     and minimize global mercury releases, while negotiating the \n     agreement described in subparagraph (A);\n       (D) to initiate and support a parallel international \n     research effort that does not delay current or planned \n     mercury pollution or use reduction efforts--\n       (i) to collect global data to support the development of a \n     comprehensive inventory of mercury use, mining, trade, and \n     releases; and\n       (ii) to develop less emitting technologies and technologies \n     to reduce the need for, and use of, mercury in commerce;\n       (E) to review monitoring capabilities and data collection \n     efforts of the United States for domestic mercury use, trade, \n     and releases to ensure there is sufficient information \n     available for any implementing legislation that may be \n     necessary for compliance with existing protocols and future \n     global mercury agreements;\n       (F) to work through existing international organizations, \n     such as the United Nations, the International Standards \n     Organization, and the World Trade Organization, to encourage \n     the development of programs, standards, and trade agreements \n     that will result in reduced use and trade of mercury, the \n     elimination of primary mercury mining, and reductions in \n     releases of mercury and other long-range transboundary air \n     pollutants; and\n       (G) to present at the 23rd session of the United Nations \n     Environment Programme Governing Council a plan for carrying \n     out immediate and long-term actions to reduce global mercury \n     pollution and global exposure to mercury in order to advance \n     the goal of achieving a binding international agreement on \n     mercury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url":

Res. 66\n\n       Whereas on August 31, 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic declared \n     independence from the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas the Kyrgyz Republic has been ruled by a single \n     President since gaining independence in 1991 after the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas President Askar Akaev's initial years of power were \n     marked by numerous democratic reforms, including the \n     establishment of independent media and opposition party \n     representation in a bi-cameral parliament;\n       Whereas in recent years, these democratic reforms have been \n     scaled back or eliminated;\n       Whereas today in the Kyrgyz Republic, virtually all major \n     television outlets are controlled or influenced by the \n     President's family or the state;\n       Whereas the political system of the Kyrgyz Republic has \n     been characterized by the Department of State as marred by \n     ``serious irregularities'' and its human rights record has \n     been described by the Department of State as ``poor'';\n       Whereas in 2002, Government forces shot 4 opposition \n     demonstrators in the southern Aksy region;\n       Whereas in 2003, President Akaev called for a referendum, \n     with little notice, on a group of Constitutional amendments, \n     leaving both voters and the opposition unprepared to \n     effectively participate in the vote;\n       Whereas the 2003 referendum vote on the Constitutional \n     amendments was not transparent and contained numerous \n     instances of fraud;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair democratic election \n     requires a period of political campaigning in an environment \n     in which administrative action, violence, intimidation, and \n     detention do not hinder the parties, political associations, \n     or the candidates from presenting their views and \n     qualifications to the citizenry;\n       Whereas unimpeded access to television, radio, print, and \n     Internet media on a non-discriminatory basis is fundamental \n     to a genuinely free and fair democratic election;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     all eligible citizens be guaranteed the right and effective \n     opportunity to exercise their civil and political rights, \n     including the right to vote, and the right to seek and \n     acquire information upon which to make an informed vote, free \n     from intimidation, undue influence, attempts at vote buying, \n     threats of political retribution, or other forms of coercion;\n       Whereas the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, as a \n     participating state in the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), has accepted numerous specific \n     commitments governing the conduct of elections, including the \n     provisions of the Copenhagen Document;\n       Whereas reports indicate that authorities within the Kyrgyz \n     government have stepped up repressive activities ahead of the \n     parliamentary elections scheduled for February 27, 2005, \n     including unfairly excluding opposition candidates from \n     running for office, launching new restrictions on freedom of \n     assembly, harassing opposition supporters and civil society \n     activists, publicly warning against a ``Ukraine scenario'', \n     and attempting to equate political opposition with \n     subversion; and\n       Whereas the parliamentary elections scheduled for February \n     27, 2005, will provide an unambiguous test of the extent of \n     the commitment of the Kyrgyz authorities to implementing \n     democratic reforms and building a society based on free \n     elections and the rule of law:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and the Kyrgyz Republic \n     since the restoration of independence in 1991;\n       (2) expresses its strong and continuing support for the \n     efforts of the Kyrgyz people to establish a full democracy, \n     the rule of law, and respect for human rights in the Kyrgyz \n     Republic;\n       (3) urges the Kyrgyz Republic to meet its Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe commitments on democratic \n     elections; and\n       (4) urges the Kyrgyz authorities to ensure--\n       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before, \n     during, and after the 2005 parliamentary elections;\n       (B) the right to vote for all eligible citizens of the \n     Kyrgyz Republic;\n       (C) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to \n     print, radio, television, and Internet media on a non-\n     discriminatory basis;

which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas the countries that comprise the Group of 7 nations \n     are pluralistic societies with democratic political \n     institutions and practices, committed to the observance of \n     universally recognized standards of human rights, respect for \n     individual liberties, and democratic principles;\n       Whereas in 1991 and subsequent years, the leaders of the \n     Group of 7 nations, heads of the governments of the major \n     free market economies of the world who meet annually in a \n     summit meeting, invited then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin \n     to a post-summit dialogue;\n       Whereas in 1998, the leaders of the Group of 7 nations \n     formally invited President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to \n     participate in an annual gathering that subsequently was \n     known as the Group of 8 nations, although the Group of 7 \n     nations have continued to hold informal summit meetings and \n     ministerial meetings that do not include the Russian \n     Federation;\n       Whereas the invitation to President Yeltsin to participate \n     in the annual summits was in recognition of his commitment to \n     democratization and economic liberalization, despite the fact \n     that the Russian economy remained weak and the commitment of \n     the Russian Government to democratic principles was \n     uncertain;\n       Whereas under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, \n     the Russian Government has attempted to control the \n     activities of independent media enterprises, nongovernmental \n     organizations, religious organizations, and other pluralistic \n     elements of Russian society in an attempt to mute criticism \n     of the government;\n       Whereas under the leadership of President Putin, the \n     Russian Government has suppressed the activities of \n     independent journalists, international observers, and human \n     rights monitoring organizations, and has blocked the renewal \n     of the mandate of the Organization for Security and Co-\n     operation in Europe (OSCE) to operate inside Chechnya in an \n     attempt to block public scrutiny of the war in Chechnya;\n       Whereas the suppression by the Russian Government of \n     independent media enterprises has resulted in widespread \n     government control and influence over the media in Russia, \n     stifling freedom of expression and individual liberties that \n     are essential to any functioning democracy;\n       Whereas the arrest and prosecution of prominent Russian \n     business leaders who had supported the political opposition \n     to President Putin are examples of selective application of \n     the rule of law for political purposes;\n       Whereas the courts of the United States, the United \n     Kingdom, Spain, and Greece have consistently ruled against \n     extradition warrants issued by the Russian Government after \n     finding that the cases presented by the Prosecutor General of \n     the Russian Federation have been inherently political in \n     nature;\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\n       Whereas Russian military forces continue to commit brutal \n     atrocities against the civilian population in Chechnya and \n     have been implicated in abductions of Chechen civilians who \n     filed cases before the European Court of Human Rights;\n       Whereas leaders of the Group of 7 nations have repeatedly \n     expressed that a military solution in Chechnya is not \n     possible;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the tragic siege of School No. \n     1 in Beslan, Russia that occurred during September 2004, \n     which was an act of terrorism abhorrent to all civilized \n     people, President Putin cited violence in the North Caucasus \n     as a pretext for consolidating centralized power and proposed \n     to abolish the popular election of regional governors in \n     favor of presidential appointment of such officials;\n       Whereas the catastrophic consequences of the siege of \n     School No. 1 in Beslan and of the continued violence in \n     Chechnya demonstrate the need to search for political \n     solutions and to commence negotiations between the Government \n     of Russia and moderate Chechen separatists, giving moderates \n     credence over extremist elements;\n       Whereas the Government of Russia initially supported the \n     undemocratic results of the November 21, 2004, runoff in the \n     Ukrainian presidential election, in spite of widespread \n     election fraud and mass demonstrations in support of a new, \n     legitimate election, which raised concerns among the Group of \n     7 nations that the commitment of the Government of Russia to \n     democratic standards is waning;\n       Whereas a wide range of observers at think tanks and \n     nongovernmental organizations have expressed deep concern \n     that the Russian Federation is moving away from the political \n     and legal underpinnings of a market economy and have \n     identified the continuing war in Chechnya as a major threat \n     to stability and democracy in Russia; and\n       Whereas the continued participation of the Russian \n     Federation in the Group of 8 nations, including the \n     opportunity for the Russian Government to host the Group of 8 \n     nations in 2006 as planned, is a privilege that is premised \n     on the Government of Russia voluntarily accepting and \n     adhering to the norms and standards of democracy, including \n     governmental accountability, transparency, and the rule of \n     law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the selective prosecution of political opponents and \n     the suppression of free media by the Russian Federation, and \n     the continued commission of widespread atrocities in the \n     conduct of the brutal war in Chechnya, do not reflect the \n     minimum standards of democratic governance and rule of law \n     that characterize every other member state in the Group of 8 \n     nations;\n       (2) the continued participation of the Russian Federation \n     in the Group of 8 nations, including the opportunity for the \n     Russian Government to host the Group of 8 nations summit in \n     2006 as planned, should be conditioned on the Russian \n     Government accepting and adhering to the norms and standards \n     of free, democratic societies as generally practiced by every \n     other member nation of the Group of 8 nations, including--\n       (A) the rule of law, including protection from selective \n     prosecution and protection from arbitrary state-directed \n     violence;\n       (B) a court system free of political influence and \n     manipulation;\n       (C) a free and independent media;\n       (D) a political system open to participation by all \n     citizens and which protects freedom of expression and \n     association; and\n       (E) the protection of universally recognized human rights; \n     and\n       (3) the President and the Secretary of State should work \n     with the other members of the Group of 7 nations to take all \n     necessary steps to suspend the participation of the Russian \n     Federation in the Group of 8 nations until the President, \n     after consultation with the other members of the Group of 7 \n     nations, determines and reports to Congress that the Russian \n     Government is committed to respecting and upholding the \n     democratic principles described in paragraph (2).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url":

Res. 60\n\n       Whereas, on August 27, 1991, Moldova declared independence \n     from the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas parliaments were elected in Moldova in free and \n     fair multiparty elections during 1990, 1994, and 1998;\n       Whereas international observers stated that the May 2003 \n     local elections for mayors and regional councilors, despite \n     scattered reports of irregularities, were generally \n     consistent with international election standards;\n       Whereas Freedom House, a non-profit, nonpartisan \n     organization working to advance the expansion of political \n     and economic freedom, has designated Moldova's political \n     environment as ``partly free'' and, using a scale of 1 to 7 \n     (with 1 being the most free), assigned a rating of 3 for \n     political rights in Moldova and 4 for civil liberties in \n     Moldova;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires a \n     period of political campaigning conducted in an environment \n     in which administrative action, violence, intimidation, or \n     detention do not hinder the parties, political associations, \n     and candidates from presenting their views and qualifications \n     to potential voters;\n       Whereas, in a genuinely democratic election, parties and \n     candidates are free to organize supporters and conduct public \n     meetings and events;\n       Whereas ensuring that parties and candidates enjoy \n     unimpeded access to television, radio, print, and Internet \n     media on a nondiscriminatory basis is fundamental to a free, \n     fair, and democratic election;\n       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that \n     citizens be guaranteed the right and effective opportunity to \n     exercise their civil and political rights, including the \n     right to vote and to seek and acquire information upon which \n     to make an informed vote in a manner that is free from \n     intimidation, undue influence, attempts at vote buying, \n     threats of political retribution, or other forms of coercion \n     by national or local authorities or others;\n       Whereas Moldova is scheduled to conduct parliamentary \n     elections on March 6, 2005;\n       Whereas reports indicate that national and local officials \n     in Moldova are increasing their control and manipulation of \n     the media as the election date approaches;\n       Whereas there have been widespread reports of harassment of \n     opposition candidates and workers by the police in Moldova;\n       Whereas other reports indicate that intimidation of \n     independent civil society monitoring groups by authorities in \n     Moldova is occurring on an increasingly frequent basis;\n       Whereas such actions are inconsistent with Moldova's \n     history of the holding of free and fair elections and raise \n     grave concerns regarding the commitment of the authorities in \n     Moldova to conducting free and fair elections;\n       Whereas the parliamentary elections scheduled for March 6, \n     2005 will provide a test of the extent to which the \n     Government of Moldova is committed to democracy, free \n     elections, and the rule of law; and\n       Whereas the holding of truly free and fair elections in \n     Moldova, including a free and democratic campaign preceding \n     an election, are vital to improving the relationship between \n     Moldova and the United States and to the United States \n     providing support for resolution of the Transnistria conflict \n     and for the provision of assistance to Moldova through the \n     Millennium Challenge Account: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges and welcomes the strong relationship \n     formed between the United States and Moldova since Moldova \n     declared independence from the Soviet Union on August 27, \n     1991;\n       (2) recognizes that a precondition for the full integration \n     of Moldova into the Western community of nations is the \n     establishment of a genuinely democratic political system in \n     Moldova;\n       (3) supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial \n     integrity of Moldova;\n       (4) encourages all political parties in Moldova to offer \n     genuine solutions to the serious problems that face Moldova, \n     including human trafficking, corruption, unemployment, and \n     territorial issues;\n       (5) expresses its strong and continuing support for the \n     efforts of the people of Moldova to establish full democracy, \n     including the rule of law and respect for human rights;\n       (6) urges the Government of Moldova to meet its commitments \n     to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe \n     (OSCE) for the holding of democratic elections;\n       (7) urges the Government of Moldova to ensure--\n       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before, \n     during, and after the parliamentary elections scheduled to be \n     held on March 6, 2005;\n       (B) the right to vote for all citizens of Moldova;\n       (C) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to \n     print, radio, television, and Internet media on a \n     nondiscriminatory basis; and\n       (D) the right of opposition candidates and workers to \n     engage in campaigning free of harassment, discrimination, and \n     intimidation; and\n       (8) pledges its enduring support and assistance to the \n     people of Moldova for the establishment of a fully free and \n     open democratic system that is free from coercion, the \n     creation of a prosperous free market economy, the \n     establishment of a secure independence, and Moldova's \n     assumption of its rightful place as a full and equal member \n     of the Western community of democracies.\n\n                               S. Res. 61\n\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association was \n     founded and incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \n     on the 26th day of December, 1930;\n       Whereas the founders of the National Ready Mixed Concrete \n     Association possessed the leadership and vision to establish \n     a single voice for the ready mixed concrete industry;\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association \n     represents and acts on behalf of the industry before all \n     divisions of government and those public and private \n     organizations whose work affects the ready mixed concrete \n     business;\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association has \n     been a pioneer in the field of concrete technology through \n     groundbreaking research and advanced scientific methods in \n     the practical use and applications of ready mixed concrete;\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association has \n     gained national distinction by developing innovative \n     breakthroughs in engineering, aggressive market promotion, \n     and its contribution toward the creation of the first \n     undergraduate degree in concrete industry management in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association leads \n     the concrete industry through its education and certification \n     programs;\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association today \n     represents 1,300 producer member companies, both national and \n     multinational, that employ thousands of workers and operate \n     in every congressional district in the United States;\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association \n     continues today to assist producers in the ready mixed \n     concrete community through the introduction of innovative \n     safety procedures, modern health initiatives, and progressive \n     environmental control programs in an effort to enhance the \n     performance level of the industry; and\n       Whereas the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association will \n     continue to look toward the future by forging alliances \n     within the ready mixed community, and by becoming more \n     educated in business operations and more knowledgeable about \n     the product and the role of ready mixed concrete in the \n     construction and building of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the National Ready Mixed Concrete \n     Association for its 75 year history and its contributions to \n     the construction of the infrastructure of the United States, \n     including homes, buildings, bridges, and highways;\n       (2) recognizes that the National Ready Mixed Concrete \n     Association has been and will continue to be an invaluable \n     asset in developing the history and character of the United \n     States; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the National Ready Mixed Concrete \n     Association as an expression of appreciation and for public \n     display at the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association's \n     2005 national convention.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my honor to submit today a \nresolution congratulating the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association \non reaching a historic milestone--its 75th anniversary. The NRMCA \nentered this world in 1930 when the Nation was facing some trying \ntimes. The country was suffering from a deep economic depression and \nmidwestern farmers were struggling through a drought. Still, many \npeople were flocking to the movies to see ``All Quiet on the Western \nFront'' and ``Cimarron,'' which went on to win the Academy Award for \nbest picture. Golfer Bobby Jones won both the British Open and the U.S. \nOpen and in Pennsylvania, a group of men met to officially form the \nNational Ready Mixed Concrete Association.\n  The founders of the NRMCA wanted to establish a single voice for the \nready mixed concrete industry to represent the industry before all \nlevels of government. They wanted the NRMCA to set product quality \nstandards for the entire ready mixed concrete industry, without \ngovernmental intervention or mandates.\n  If you were to ask the founders today about the progress of their \nNational Ready Mixed Concrete Association, I am certain the founders \nwould be proud of the association's accomplishments and the quality of \nthe ongoing work.\n  While the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association continues to \nrepresent the ready mixed industry, it has also become the leader in \nthe practical use and applications of ready mixed concrete, a pioneer \nin the development and implementation of its education and \ncertification programs, and a strong hand reaching out to ready mixed \nconcrete State associations, ready mixed producers, and other members \nacross the country.\n  In my State, the Oklahoma Ready Mixed Concrete Association has a \nclose working relationship with the NRMCA. These benefits can be felt \nacross the State as the use of ready mixed concrete continues to \nincrease. In the latest data, Oklahoma ready mixed production hit \n5,440,000 cubic yards by the end of 2003. That is an increase of more \nthan 1 million cubic yards from just 7 years earlier when ready mixed \nconcrete production was at 4,206,000 cubic yards.\n  The growing use of ready mixed concrete has spurred a host of new \nready mixed concrete companies and businesses in the State and made the \nones already in existence even stronger. People in Oklahoma know some \nof the names of the ready mixed companies just by the names on the side \nof the concrete trucks traveling on the roads and highways.

Res. 62\n\n       Whereas Rotary International, founded on February 23, 1905, \n     in Chicago, Illinois, is the world's first service club and 1 \n     of the largest nonprofit service organizations;\n       Whereas there are more than 1.2 million Rotary \n     International club members comprised of professional and \n     business leaders in more than 31,000 clubs in more than 165 \n     countries;\n       Whereas the Rotary International motto, ``Service Above \n     Self'', inspires members to provide humanitarian service, \n     meet high ethical standards, and promote international good \n     will;\n       Whereas Rotary International funds club projects and \n     sponsors volunteers with community expertise to provide \n     medical supplies, health care, clean water, food production, \n     job training, and education to millions in need, particularly \n     in developing countries;\n       Whereas in 1985, Rotary International launched Polio Plus \n     and spearheaded efforts with the World Health Organization, \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and UNICEF to \n     immunize the children of the world against polio;\n       Whereas polio cases have dropped by 99 percent since 1988, \n     and the world now stands on the threshold of eradicating the \n     disease;\n       Whereas Rotary International is the largest privately-\n     funded source of international scholarships in the world and \n     promotes international understanding through scholarships, \n     exchange programs, and humanitarian grants;\n       Whereas since 1947, more than 35,000 students from 110 \n     countries have studied abroad as Rotary Ambassadorial \n     Scholars;\n       Whereas Rotary International's Group Study Exchange program \n     has helped more than 46,000 young professionals explore \n     career fields in other countries;\n       Whereas 8,000 secondary school students each year \n     experience life in another country through Rotary \n     International's Youth Exchange Program;\n       Whereas over the past 5 years, members of Rotary \n     International in all 50 States have hosted participants in \n     Open World, a program sponsored by the Library of Congress, \n     and therefore have earned the honor of serving as Open \n     World's most outstanding host;\n       Whereas there are approximately 400,000 Rotary \n     International club members in more than 7,700 clubs \n     throughout the United States sponsoring service projects to \n     address critical issues such as poverty, health, hunger, \n     illiteracy, and the environment in their local communities \n     and abroad; and\n       Whereas February 23, 2005, would be an appropriate date on \n     which to observe Rotary International Day: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of a ``Rotary \n     International Day'' to celebrate the centennial anniversary \n     of Rotary International; and\n       (2) recognizes Rotary International for 100 years of \n     service to improving the human condition in communities \n     throughout the world.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I offer this resolution, S. Res. 62, \ncelebrating and honoring Rotary International on the occasion of its \ncentennial anniversary. I am pleased to have Senator Stevens and \nSenator Obama join me in submitting this resolution.\n  From a small gathering of friends in Chicago on February 23, 1905, \nRotary International has grown to become one of the largest non-profit \nservice organizations in the world. There are approximately 400,000 \nRotarians in the United States, and 1.2 million members worldwide.\n  Rotarians have undertaken countless projects, large and small, to \nimprove the well-being of communities around the world. They have \npromoted international exchange and learning as a means of building \ngoodwill and understanding between nations.\n  In 1985, Rotary International began working with the U.S. Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and \nUNICEF toward a bold goal: to eliminate polio from the earth.\n  Since then, Rotarians have contributed over half a billion dollars \ntoward the global effort to eradicate polio, and their dedication and \ncommitment is paying off. Since 1988, the number of polio cases in the \nworld has dropped by 99 percent. The world now stands on the threshold \nof eradicating the disease.\n  Winston Churchill reminded us, ``We make a living by what we get, we \nmake a life by what we give.'' With this resolution, we honor the \ncentury of service that the men and women of Rotary International have \ngiven. I look forward to continuing to work with them in the years \nahead.\n\n                               S. Res. 63\n\n       Whereas on February 14, 2005, Rafiq Hariri, the former \n     Prime Minister of Lebanon, was assassinated in a despicable \n     terrorist attack;\n       Whereas the car bomb used in the assassination killed 16 \n     others and injured more than 100 people;\n       Whereas the intent of the terrorists who carried out the \n     assassination was to intimidate the Lebanese people and push \n     Lebanon backward toward chaos;\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\n       Whereas Rafiq Hariri served as Prime Minister of Lebanon \n     for a total of 10 years since the end of the Lebanese war in \n     1991;\n       Whereas Rafiq Hariri helped revitalize the economy of \n     Lebanon and rebuild its shattered infrastructure and \n     pioneered and directed the rebirth of Beirut's historic \n     downtown district;\n       Whereas Rafiq Hariri stepped down as Prime Minister on \n     October 20, 2004;\n       Whereas Syria maintains at least 14,000 troops and a large \n     number of intelligence personnel in Lebanon;\n       Whereas there is widespread opposition in Lebanon to the \n     continuing Syrian presence in Lebanon;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council issued a \n     Presidential Statement (February 15, 2005) condemning the \n     terrorist bombing that killed Rafiq Hariri and calling on \n     ``the Lebanese Government to bring to justice the \n     perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of this heinous \n     terrorist act'';\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 \n     (September 2, 2004) calls for the political independence and \n     sovereignty of Lebanon, the withdrawal of foreign forces from \n     Lebanon, and the disarmament of all militias in Lebanon;\n       Whereas Syria is the main supporter of the terrorist group \n     Hezbollah, the only significant remaining armed militia in \n     Lebanon;\n       Whereas Hezbollah supports Palestinian terrorist groups and \n     poses a threat to the prospects for peace in the Middle East;\n       Whereas the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty \n     Restoration Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note) was enacted \n     into law on December 12, 2003; and\n       Whereas the President has recalled the United States \n     Ambassador to Syria for urgent consultations: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the cowardly and despicable assassination of \n     Rafiq Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon;\n       (2) extends condolences to Prime Minister Hariri's family \n     and the people of Lebanon;\n       (3) supports United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1559 (September 2, 2004), which calls for the withdrawal of \n     all foreign forces from Lebanon;\n       (4) urges the President to seek a United Nations Security \n     Council resolution that establishes an independent \n     investigation into the assassination;\n       (5) urges the President to consider imposing sanctions \n     under the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty \n     Restoration Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note); and\n       (6) supports the call of the Lebanese people for an end to \n     Syria's presence in Lebanon, and for free and fair elections \n     monitored by international observers.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my resolution, S. Res. 63, calls for an \ninternational investigation into Monday's assassination of Prime \nMinister Rafiq Hariri of Lebanon. The resolution also urges the \nPresident to take steps to pressure Syria to leave Lebanon.\n  I am pleased that Senators Lugar, Reid, Levin, Dodd, Corzine, Allen, \nand Chafee have joined in co-sponsoring this resolution.\n  The despicable murder of Rafiq Hariri has deprived Lebanon of a \ndedicated and effective leader.\n  It also is an attempt at intimidating the Lebanese people and pushing \nthe country backward toward chaos. It must not succeed.\n  In Lebanon and beyond, many suspect that Syria is responsible. That's \nunderstandable--Syria has an extensive intelligence and military \npresence in Lebanon, its opposition to Hariri is well known, and it \ncontinues to play a destabilizing role in Lebanese affairs.\n  Syria must get out of Lebanon--now.\n  Prime Minister Hariri's emergence as an opponent to Syrian meddling \nin Lebanon was seen as a serious threat in Damascus. The fact that he \nwas a Muslim holding such opinions was even more problematic, as this \nreflects the spread of anti-Syrian sentiment in recent years beyond the \nMaronite Christian community.\n  Cooperation across confessional lines in Lebanon complicates the \nability of Syria to maintain its grip over Lebanese affairs.\n  That is why Syria forced Prime Minister Hariri to resign last \nOctober. And that is why Syria, through its Lebanese allies, had been \ntrying to dilute Hariri's influence by redrawing electoral districts \nahead of parliamentary elections due later this Spring.\n  The resolution I have introduced condemns the assassination, extends \ncondolences to Mr. Hariri's family and the Lebanese people; it demands \nthat Syria immediately withdraw its troops and intelligence personnel \nfrom Lebanon; it urges the President ask the United Nations Security \nCouncil to go beyond Tuesday's statement condemning the assassination \nby passing a resolution establishing an independent investigation.\n  I would add parenthetically that many in Lebanon are skeptical of an \ninvestigation that would be carried out by a government they perceive \nas taking its orders from Syria.\n  The resolution urges the President to consider imposing additional \nsanctions under the Syria Accountability Act.\n  Finally, it supports the call of the Lebanese people for an end to \nSyria's presence in Lebanon, and for free and fair elections for \nparliament this Spring monitored by international observers.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to add a word about what this resolution does \nnot do. It does not in any way, shape, or form even hint at supporting \nthe use of force against Syria.\n  I think it is important to state that clearly, given the mistrust of \nmany in Congress over the administration's intentions after the \nmishandling of Iraq.\n  The intent of this resolution is to encourage the President to work \nwith the international community to investigate the assassination and \nto use diplomatic pressure for Syria to leave Lebanon.\n  In fact, this tragic incident offers an opportunity to work closely \nwith France. It was French-U.S. cooperation which resulted in the \npassage of a United Nations Security Council resolution last September \ncalling for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. And just \nyesterday President Chirac made a personal visit to Lebanon to console \nHariri's family. I commend him for this important gesture.\n  I urge President Bush to use his meeting with President Chirac on \nMonday to coordinate the next diplomatic steps.\n  If France were to recall its Ambassador to Syria, the rest of Europe \nwould follow France's lead. If France and the United States together \ncalled for a United Nations Security Council resolution to establish an \nindependent investigation, I believe such a resolution would pass. Such \ncooperation would send a signal more powerful to the Syrians than any \nunilateral U.S. moves.\n  Given the lingering mistrust between Europe and the U.S. over Iraq, \nFrance may at first be hesitant. That is why I believe President Bush \nshould engage personally with President Chirac to develop a joint \ndiplomatic strategy and to dispel any apprehensions about our \nintentions.\n  Mr. President, Rafiq Hariri's assassination was about more than the \nmurder of one leader. It was an attempt to kill the hopes and \naspirations for freedom in Lebanon.\n  There are those who argue that we have no national interest in the \nindependence of Lebanon. Given our bitter experiences in Lebanon, I can \nunderstand their apprehensions. But I disagree that we have no interest \nin Lebanese independence.\n  The Syrian presence in Lebanon enables the terrorist group Hezbollah \nto continue to operate as the only significant armed militia 14 years \nafter the end of the Lebanese civil war. Hezbollah enables Syrian and \nIranian hardliners to try and derail renewed hopes for Israeli-\nPalestinian peace. Based on my recent meetings with Israeli and \nPalestinian leaders, it is clear that Hezbollah, through its support \nfor Palestinian terrorist groups, is seen as a significant threat to a \nfragile peace process.\n  That is why I believe we do have an important interest in diminishing \nSyria's involvement in Lebanon.\n  At this moment, it is essential that the forces of terror hear a \nunified voice from the civilized world. They must not be seen as \nsucceeding, lest they are emboldened to take even more aggressive \naction in other arenas. Instead, Monday's attack must be seen as a \ndecisive setback for Syria and its allies.\n  I urge the President and the Secretary of State to act quickly on the \nrecommendations offered in this resolution.\n  Rafiq Hariri's death must not be in vain, and the Lebanese people \nwhom he served deserve answers--and action.\n  Let us hope that this barbarous murder marks the beginning of the end \nof Syria's presence and interference in Lebanon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1692-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1692-S1693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DESIGNATING THE YEAR 2005 ``THE YEAR OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY''\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 28\n\n       Whereas according to the 2000 decennial census of the \n     population, 9.3 percent of Americans speak both their native \n     language and another language fluently;\n       Whereas according to the European Commission Directorate \n     General for Education and Culture, 52.7 percent of Europeans \n     speak both their native language and another language \n     fluently;\n       Whereas the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     names foreign language study as part of a core curriculum \n     that includes English, mathematics, science, civics, \n     economics, arts, history, and geography;\n       Whereas according to the Joint Center for International \n     Language, foreign language study increases a student's \n     cognitive and critical thinking abilities;\n       Whereas according to the American Council on the Teaching \n     of Foreign Languages, foreign language study increases a \n     student's ability to compare and contrast cultural concepts;\n       Whereas according to a 1992 report by the College Entrance \n     Examination Board, students with 4 or more years in foreign \n     language study scored higher on the verbal section of the \n     Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) than students who did not;\n       Whereas the Higher Education Act of 1965 labels foreign \n     language study as vital to secure the future economic welfare \n     of the United States in a growing international economy;\n       Whereas the Higher Education Act of 1965 recommends \n     encouraging businesses and foreign language study programs to \n     work in a mutually productive relationship which benefits the \n     Nation's future economic interest;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for International Business \n     Education and Research program, foreign language study \n     provides the ability both to gain a comprehensive \n     understanding of and to interact with the cultures of United \n     States trading partners, and thus establishes a solid \n     foundation for successful economic relationships;\n       Whereas Report 107-592 of the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives concludes that \n     American multinational corporations and nongovernmental \n     organizations do not have the people with the foreign \n     language abilities and cultural exposure that are needed;\n       Whereas the 2001 Hart-Rudman Report on National Security in \n     the 21st Century names foreign language study and requisite \n     knowledge in languages as vital for the Federal Government to \n     meet 21st century security challenges properly and \n     effectively;\n       Whereas the American intelligence community stresses that \n     individuals with proper foreign language expertise are \n     greatly needed to work on important national security and \n     foreign policy issues, especially in light of the terrorist \n     attacks on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas a 1998 study conducted by the National Foreign \n     Language Center concludes that inadequate resources existed \n     for the development, publication, distribution, and teaching \n     of critical foreign languages (such as Arabic, Vietnamese, \n     and Thai) because of low student enrollment in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas a shortfall of experts in foreign languages has \n     seriously hampered information gathering and analysis within \n     the American intelligence community as demonstrated by the \n     2000 Cox Commission noting shortfalls in Chinese proficiency, \n     and the National Intelligence Council citing deficiencies in \n     Central Eurasian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern languages: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that foreign language \n     study makes important contributions to a student's cognitive \n     development, our national economy, and our national security;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) designates the year 2005 as the ``Year of Foreign \n     Language Study'', during which foreign language study is \n     promoted and expanded in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, institutions of higher learning, businesses, and \n     government programs; and\n       (B) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to--\n       (i) encourage and support initiatives to promote and expand \n     the study of foreign languages; and\n       (ii) observe the ``Year of Foreign Language Study'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/17/senate-section/article/S1693-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DESIGNATING THE ROBERT T.
