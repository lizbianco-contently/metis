Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session for consideration of Calendar No. 71, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla Richman Owen, \nof Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the last 3 days, for 26 hours, the \nSenate has debated a very simple, straightforward principle. Qualified \njudicial nominees, with the support of the majority of Senators, \ndeserve a fair up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. A thorough debate \nis an important step in the judicial nominations process.\n  Debate should culminate with a decision, and a decision should be \nexpressed through that up-or-down vote, confirm or reject, yes or no. \nThe Constitution grants the Senate the power to confirm or reject the \nPresident's judicial nominees. In exercising this duty, the Senate \ntraditionally has followed a careful and deliberative process with \nthree key\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\ncomponents: first, we investigate; second, we debate; and third, we \ndecide. We investigate by examining nominees in committee hearings and \nstudying their backgrounds and qualifications. We debate by publicly \ndiscussing the nominees in committee and on the floor, and we decide \nthrough an up-or-down vote. Investigate, debate, decide--that is how \nthe Senate and the judicial nominations process operated for 214 years.\n  But in 2003, the Senate stopped short of a decision. A minority of \nSenators began routinely blocking final votes on judicial nominations. \nAs a result, the nominees have been left in limbo. Courthouses sit \nempty. Justice is delayed. Political rhetoric has escalated, and \npolitical civility has suffered. It is time once again to decide.\n  The moment draws closer when all 100 Senators must decide a basic \nquestion of principle--whether to restore the precedent of a fair up-\nor-down vote for judicial nominees on this floor or to enshrine a new \ntyranny of the minority into the Senate rules forever. I favor \nfairness and an up-or-down vote.\n\n  The individual nominee now before this body is Priscilla Owen. \nJustice Owen is a qualified, mainstream judicial nominee. She is a \nsitting member of the Texas Supreme Court who has received the highest \npossible rating by the American Bar Association. She has been reelected \nby 84 percent of the people in her home State. More than 4 years ago, \nthe President nominated her to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit. Since then the Senate has thoroughly and \nexhaustively investigated and debated her nomination. A brief look at \nthe record tells the story.\n  The Judiciary Committee has held two hearings on her nomination \nlasting more than 9 hours. During the hearings, Justice Owen answered \nmore than 400 questions from Senators on the committee. After the \nhearings, Justice Owen submitted 90 pages of responses to an additional \n118 written questions. The Judiciary Committee has debated her an \nadditional 5 hours before committee votes. Today marks the 20th day of \nSenate floor debate on Justice Owen's nomination. We have spent more \nfloor time on Priscilla Owen than on all the sitting Supreme Court \nJustices combined.\n  Yes, Justice Owen has not received one single up-or-down vote on the \nSenate floor--not one. Four years of waiting, 9 hours of committee \nhearings, more than 500 questions answered, another 5 hours of \ncommittee debate, and 20 days of floor debate, but not 1 up-or-down \nvote to confirm or reject--not 1.\n  As majority leader, I have tried for 2 years to find a mutually \nagreeable solution that will resolve this issue without sacrificing the \ncore principle of an up-or-down vote. I have offered to guarantee up to \n100 hours of debate for every judicial nominee, far more than has ever \nbeen necessary for any nominee in the past. I have offered to guarantee \nthat no nominee ever becomes unjustly stalled in the Judiciary \nCommittee, as some colleagues have alleged has occurred in previous \nCongresses. Thus far these efforts have not been successful. I remain \nhopeful that the Senate will restore the tradition of fair up-or-down \nvotes without the need for procedural or parliamentary tactics.\n  Tomorrow, Senators will have another opportunity to diffuse this \ncontroversy. A cloture motion is pending before the Senate. If cloture \nis invoked, it will bring debate to an orderly close. With cloture \npending, 60 votes cast in the affirmative tomorrow would yield a fair \nup-or-down vote on Justice Owen. I look forward to the debate ahead. I \nlook forward to hearing from my colleagues. And I look forward to a \ndecision by all 100 Senators on the nomination of Justice Owen, a \ndecision expressed through a vote, a vote to confirm or reject, a vote \nup or down.\n  The American people expect us to act and not just debate. They expect \nresults and not just rhetoric. We may not--in fact, we will not--agree \non every judicial nominee, but we can agree on the principle that \nqualified judicial nominees deserve an up-or-down vote. Tomorrow, we \nwill vote, and all 100 Senators will decide--judicial obstruction or \nfair up-or-down votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to respond briefly to the \ndistinguished Republican leader's comments. Priscilla Owen has had \nnumerous votes. She has had three that I am aware of on the Senate \nfloor. Those votes dealt with whether we should stop debating her. The \nvotes three times have said no.\n  The Senate reception area is a beautiful part of the Capitol. I can \nremember coming here in 1974 and Hubert Humphrey coming off the Senate \nfloor. He had to sit down. He couldn't stand to talk to me. I remember \nthe first time I had a conversation in that beautiful hall. I worked \nhere 10 years before that as a policeman. Of course, I recognized the \nbeauty of the building and of that beautiful room.\n  We have put out there what we refer to as a Hall of Fame of Senators. \nIt is a place where you have photographs of Senators who were extra \nspecial Senators, people who the rest of the Senate, after that Senator \nleft the Senate, determined was somebody who deserved to be in the Hall \nof Fame. One such man is Arthur Vandenberg. I wish I could have known \nhim. He was a wonderful Senator, a very progressive, thoughtful man.\n  My distinguished colleague, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, \nread into the Record last week, May 20:\n\n       What the present Senate rules mean: and for the sake of law \n     and order, shall they be protected in the meaning until \n     changed by the Senate itself in the fashion required by the \n     rules?\n\n  He summarized this issue that is before the Senate today and did it \nabout 60 years ago on an occasion similar to this. How prescient are \nhis comments to the situation in which we find ourselves today.\n  Senator Vandenberg:\n\n     . . . [T]he rules of the Senate as they exist at any given \n     time and as they are clinched by precedents should not be \n     changed substantively by the interpretive action of the \n     Senate's Presiding Officer, even with the transient sanction \n     of an equally transient Senate majority. The rules can be \n     safely changed only by the direct and conscious action of the \n     Senate itself, acting in the fashion prescribed by the rules. \n     Otherwise, no rule in the Senate is worth the paper it is \n     written on, and this so-called ``greatest deliberative \n     body in the world'' is at the mercy of every change in \n     parliamentary authority, which means the Republicans are \n     in power today and the Democrats may be tomorrow, and a \n     simple majority can change anything.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the way it should be. You should not be able \nto come in here and change willy-nilly a rule of the Senate. A rule of \nthe Senate, you change by the rules. This so-called nuclear option has \nnow been stood on its head, and they are now using what I refer to as \nthe Orwellian language, saying that it is the ``constitutional \noption,'' and that, by all legal scholars, is foolishness.\n  I served in the Senate with Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Jim McClure \nof Idaho, westerners who are extremely conservative politically. But \nhere is what they said, and they wrote this in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n     . . . [I]t is naive to think that what is done to the \n     judicial filibuster will not later be done to its legislative \n     counterpart. . . . [E]ven if a Senator were that naive, he or \n     she should take a broader look at Senate procedure. The very \n     reasons being given for allowing a 51-vote majority to shut \n     off debate on judges apply equally well--in fact, they apply \n     more aptly--to the rest of the Executive Calendar, of which \n     judicial nominations are only one part. That includes all \n     executive branch nominations, even military promotions. \n     Treaties, too, go on the Executive Calendar, and the \n     arguments in favor of a 51-vote cloture on judicial \n     nominations apply to those diplomatic agreements as well. It \n     is little comfort that treaty ratification requires a two-\n     thirds vote. Without the possibility of a filibuster, a \n     future majority leader could bring up objectionable \n     international committments with only an hour or two for \n     debate, hardly enough time for opponents to inform the public \n     and rally the citizenry against ratification.\n\n  What they are attempting to do in this instance is really too bad. It \nwill change this body forever. We will be an extension of the House of \nRepresentatives, where a simple majority there can determine \neverything. Those of us who went to law school--and the Presiding \nOfficer is a Harvard graduate. I went to George Washington. We know the \nprecedent in the law is important. A precedent of the Senate is even \nmore important. There will be a precedent set that will be here forever \nif the vote we take tomorrow prevails.\n  I feel there are Republicans of good will who are willing to be \nprofiles in courage and step to this well tomorrow afternoon or evening \nand say we cannot do that. We believe that conservative Senators such \nas Malcolm Wallop\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\nand Jim McClure are right. They believe--Malcolm Wallop and Jim \nMcClure--that especially small Western States need protection. The \nreason we had the Great Compromise of 1787 was to allow the State of \nRhode Island to have equal power in the Senate with New York. What is \nbeing attempted will take that away, change the Senate forever.\n  So I am convinced and hopeful and confident that there will be six \ncourageous Republican Senators who will step down here and go against \ntheir leader, go against their President, as was done by Thomas \nJefferson's Senate when he had a significant majority and tried to play \nwith the courts; and when Franklin Roosevelt, with a tremendous \nmajority--and no President has ever been more popular than he was when \nelected in 1936--tried to pack the courts. His Democratic Senators said \nno. Even the Vice President who served under President Roosevelt, James \nGarner, said no deal. The President called the Democratic leadership to \nthe White House and said this is what we are going to do. He never \nconferred with them. And they, wanting to go along with what was the \nmost popular President, probably, in many years--when they walked out, \nthey said no, we are not going to do that. Democratic Senators made the \ndifference. We need Republican Senators here to make the difference, \nstand and be counted when we vote. We only need six courageous people \nto stop the Senate from becoming an extension of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, before I speak to the important principles \nat stake in this debate, I want to take this opportunity to thank the \nMajority Leader for doing everything in his power to avoid the impasse \nwe face today.\n  We have arrived at this moment in the Senate's history not because of \na failure of effort, but because of a failure of cooperation.\n  Over the past two years, Senator Frist and other members of the \nRepublican leadership have made compromise an important objective.\n  We have repeatedly offered to extend the period of debate on the \nPresident's judicial nominees. Fifty hours, 100 hours, have been \noffered--even 200 hours of debate on some of these nominees--all in an \neffort to ensure that our Democrat colleagues have sufficient time to \nraise and explain their concerns. Without exception, these offers to \nprovide more time have been rejected out-of-hand.\n  In May of 2003, Senator Frist and then-Senator Miller of Georgia \nintroduced compromise legislation that would allow the filing of \nsuccessive cloture motions on judicial nominees, with each motion \nrequiring fewer votes for passage, and ultimately a simple majority. \nWhen it came time to consider this sensible legislation in the Rules \nCommittee, my Democrat colleagues boycotted the mark-up.\n  In April of 2004, the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Specter, introduced legislation to help remove \npolitics from the judicial confirmation process and ensure that \nnominees would be given a hearing, that they would be reported out of \ncommittee, and would receive a vote on the Senate floor. The Democrats \nreacted to this proposal with silence.\n  Senator Frist has been in regular communication with Senator Reid, \nand on March 17 of this year, he formally wrote to Senator Reid \nexpressing his hope that a compromise could be fashioned, and \nindicating that the constitutional option would only be exercised if \nthere were no reasonable alternatives.\n  And, on April 28, Majority Leader formally reached out again to \nSenator Reid, proposing to grant 100 hours of floor debate on each of \nthe filibustered nominees--that's more than twice the time spent by the \nSenate debating any of the nominations of the current Supreme Court \nJustices. Senator Frist also proposed to develop a process to ensure \nthat nominees are not bottled up in the Judiciary Committee, a \ncomplaint often made by my Democrat colleagues. Once again, this \nsincere effort at compromise was immediately rebuffed.\n  So let the record be clear: The Majority Leader has pursued \ncompromise with vigor, and he should be commended for doing so.\n  But, of course, when compromise fails, action must take its place. We \nare here today because there are important principles at stake . . . \nprinciples that are worth defending.\n  Does the President have the right to expect that his nominees to the \nFederal bench will be fully considered by the United States Senate? \nDoes the Senate have a constitutional obligation to offer ``advice and \nconsent'' on these nominations? And are judicial nominees entitled to \nan up-or-down vote on the Senate floor?\n  The answer, of course, to each of these questions is a resounding \n``yes.''\n  For more than 214 years, judicial nominees with clear majority \nsupport have received an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, with a \nmajority vote leading to confirmation. Until just two years ago, a 60-\nvote supermajority was never the standard for confirmation to the \nFederal bench. Those are the facts.\n  By blocking not one, but ten, of President Bush's judicial nominees \nthrough the inappropriate use of the filibuster, my Democrat colleagues \nare doing nothing less than setting Senate tradition on its head. They \nare rewriting the rules of the game while abandoning the custom of \nself-restraint that has enabled the Senate to function so effectively \nin the past. And three of these nominees have now withdrawn their names \nfrom consideration.\n  To justify their actions, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would have us believe that filibustering judicial nominees is \njust business as usual. They specifically cite the nominations of Abe \nFortas, Marsha Berzon, and Richard Paez as examples of Republican-led \nobstruction efforts.\n  Justice Fortas, of course, lacked majority support when, in 1968, \nPresident Johnson withdrew his nomination to be Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court. Today's filibuster victims, on the other hand, all have \nbipartisan, majority support . . . and are being permanently blocked \ndespite this fact. Fortas' nomination was opposed not just by members \nof one party, as is the case today, but by Democrats and Republicans \nalike. And let's not forget: Justice Fortas' nomination was debated for \njust several days before President Johnson took action. Many of \nPresident Bush's nominees have been pending before the Senate not for \ndays, but for years.\n  I am not sure what citing the Berzon and Paez nominations proves, \nsince both individuals were given the courtesy of an up-or-down vote, \nand both were ultimately confirmed. They are now sitting judges. In \nfact, the Majority Leader at the time--Trent Lott--worked to end debate \non both nominations, believing then, as we do now, that judicial \nnominees deserve a vote on the Senate floor.\n  So, what we are witnessing today is something wholly different: it is \na highly organized obstruction campaign that is partisan in origin, \nunfair in its application, harmful to this institution, and \nunprecedented in our Nation's history.\n  Now, let's take a moment to examine the record of the individual \nwhose nomination is before the Senate today. Justice Priscilla Owen has \nbeen called everything from an ``extremist'' to a ``far-right \npartisan'' to someone who is ``out of the mainstream.''\n  But the simple fact is that Justice Owen's record is that of a \ndistinguished jurist who enjoys broad support and who understands that \nher role is to apply the law fairly and impartially.\n  Twice elected to the Texas Supreme Court after a long career as a \nlitigator in a prominent Texas law firm, Justice Owen earned the \nhighest score on the December 1977 Texas bar exam and ranked near the \ntop of her class at the Baylor University School of Law. She has been \nendorsed by a bipartisan group of 15 past presidents of the Texas State \nbar. An advocate for providing pro bono legal services to the poor, \nOwen also received a unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, the highest rating given by that \norganization--I add, the ``gold standard'' for our Democrat friends. \nAnd in her last election to the\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\nTexas supreme court, Justice Owen earned a stunning 84% of the vote and \nwas endorsed by every major newspaper in the Lone Star State.\n  Justice Owen received her vote in Texas and she deserves her vote on \nthe floor of the United States Senate.\n  Mr. President, there is another important issue that must be raised \nbeyond that of the rules and procedures of the Senate: It is the impact \nthis episode in the Senate's history will have on the willingness of \nmen and women of talent to serve their country by serving on the \nFederal bench.\n  Millions of Americans have watched as the good reputation of Justice \nOwen has been unfairly tarnished. As have the reputations of Justice \nJanice Rogers Brown, and Judge Terrence Boyle, Miguel Estrada, and the \nother nominees. Their lives and careers have been reduced to partisan--\nand wholly inaccurate--television sound bites with words like right-\nwing, radical, extremist.\n  For those of either party contemplating future service on the Federal \nbench, this spectacle of unfairness must be chilling--chilling--a \nglowing ``proceed with caution'' signal, suggesting that other career \noptions should be pursued instead.\n  For the sake of the Federal courts in our country, we must do better. \nWe can start by restoring the traditional standard for the confirmation \nof judicial nominees. Guaranteeing every nominee the opportunity of an \nup-or-down vote on the Senate floor will dramatically reduce the role \nof outside interest groups who see the filibuster as a way to exert \npressure and score political points. It will force us to debate these \nnominees on the merits, with real arguments, not with politically \nconvenient slogans and labels. And hopefully, it will help make an \nappointment to the Federal bench an attractive option for those young \npeople out there who may be thinking about a career in service to the \npublic.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous agreement, the time is \nnow divided 1 hour on each side with the first hour under the control \nof the majority leader or his designee.\n  Does the Senator from Kentucky seek recognition?\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I do.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, what is the current business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The nomination of Priscilla Owen.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is important for Senators to understand what we are \ntalking about here. We are talking about the nomination of Texas \nSupreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to be a Federal circuit judge. We \nare talking about her qualifications and about fulfilling our \nconstitutional responsibilities to give advice and consent. We are \ntalking about whether each Senator will vote yes or no in an up-or-down \nvote on the nomination of Justice Owen. And soon we will be talking \nabout the long-blocked nominations of California Supreme Court Justice \nJanice Rogers Brown, former Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor, and \nothers passed by the Judiciary Committee.\n  As the Presiding Officer said, the Senate's pending business is the \nnomination of Justice Priscilla Owen. Justice Owen has had a \ndistinguished record as a judge who respects the rule of law. She \nunderstands that elected legislators write the law, not judges. As a \njudge, she has applied the law as it is written, not as she wished it \nwere written.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Justice Owen ``well \nqualified.'' Everyone here knows that the ABA is not exactly a \nconservative organization, so that rating speaks volumes. She has \nserved on the Supreme Court of Texas for more than 10 years, where she \nhas earned the respect and endorsements of Democratic justices and \nattorneys, and more impressively than that, in her most recent \nelection, she received 84 percent of the vote. I cannot imagine getting \n84 percent.\n  Just last week, I met with Justice Owen. I was impressed with her \nintelligence and honesty. I was impressed with her energy and \ndetermination to see this through. But most of all, I am satisfied that \nJustice Owen will interpret the law rather than try to write it, and I \nam convinced that she will stand up to any other judges on the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals who try to rewrite the law from the bench.\n  Why has Justice Owen been denied an up-or-down vote? As best I can \ntell, it is because they crossed the radical left when she voted not to \ntake away a mother's right to know that her teenage daughter wanted to \nhave an abortion. Justice Owen did not write the Texas law requiring \nnotification. The legislature did. She merely agreed with the two lower \ncourts that the requirement of the exceptions in the law had not been \nmet.\n  In the time when a teenage girl cannot get her ears pierced at the \nmall or take an aspirin at school without parental consent, it is not \nout of the mainstream to enforce a law requiring notice to a parent \nbefore that same teenager can get an abortion.\n  Another nominee we are discussing this week, California Supreme Court \nJustice Janice Rogers Brown, is also a nominee who will stand up to the \nactivist judges on the Ninth Circuit Court. Justice Brown has been on \nthe California Supreme Court for 9 years, and she received 76 percent \nof the vote in her last election, the most of any justice on that \nyear's ballot.\n  Justice Brown has earned a reputation as a judge who respects the law \nand the California Legislature's decisions. She has consistently \ndeferred to the legislature's judgment and not substituted her own \npolitical views. In other words, she knows the role of a judge is not \nto write the law but to apply the law.\n  Justice Brown has also earned the respect of her California \ncolleagues. In recent years, she has been chosen by the court to write \nthe majority opinions more times than any of her fellow justices. She \nhas the endorsement of both the Republicans and Democratic judges, \nlawyers, and law professors in California.\n  Critics point to the statements that Justice Brown made about her \npolicy views outside--outside, I say--of the courtroom. While some may \nnot agree with her personal opinions on issues, outside the courtroom \nis the place where she should feel free to make her policy views known.\n  Some of her political views may conflict with the laws of the State \nof California, but Justice Brown has had no problem applying those laws \nto the cases before her. That is exactly what a judge is supposed to \ndo--apply the law to the facts of the case regardless of whether the \njudge would have voted for that law if she or he had been in the \nlegislature.\n  Mr. President, 5 years ago, a discussion like this about nominees \nwould have been overlooked by most Members of this body. A few Senators \nwould give a statement on the Senate floor in support of a nominee to a \ncircuit court. A few more Senators would insert a statement into the \nRecord. And then the Senate would confirm the nominee by a rollcall \nvote or even a voice vote. That was the ordinary course of business in \nthis body for 214 years. But that is not the case anymore.\n\n  Ever since President Bush was elected, his nominees to the circuit \ncourt have been denied an up-or-down vote. During the 107th Congress, \nmany of his nominees did not advance when the Senate was under \nDemocratic control. During the 108th Congress, Democrats instituted the \nfirst partisan filibuster of judicial nominees, all of whom have \nmajority support in this body.\n  We hear a lot from the other side about minority rights. No one on \nthis side of the aisle wants to restrict the opposition's ability to \nspeak their objections and vote against these nominees. I invite \nSenators who oppose these nominees to come to this floor and speak \ntheir objections. I encourage them to try to convince me why I should \nvote against these nominees.\n  Instead, this is about a minority of Senators trying to take for \nthemselves a power that the Constitution gives only to the President of \nthe United States. This is about a minority of Senators thwarting 214 \nyears of Senate tradition. This is about the obligation and fairness of \ngiving a nominee a vote. This is all about whether elections in this \ncountry mean anything.\n  We are currently engaged in a war against terrorism. We have helped \nthe Iraqi people conduct peaceful democratic elections; also the people \nof Afghanistan. We have seen the power of the democratic process in the \nUkraine,\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\nand we have seen the strength of the voice of the people longing for \nfreedom in Lebanon. Even Kuwait is taking steps to allow women to vote \nfor the first time. How can we as a nation speak of the power of the \npeople, the validity of the democratic process and the strength of the \nvote, if we let a minority in this body thwart the will of the \ndemocratically elected President and majority of this body?\n  Last fall, the American people spoke clearly. In the highest numbers \nin history, the American people went to the polls and voiced their \nopinion with their votes. The American people chose George W. Bush as \ntheir President, and the American people created a 55-vote majority for \nthe Republicans in this Senate by electing 7 new Republican Senators. \nThe message the American people sent is clear. They support President \nBush and Republican policies and values more than what the other side \nof the aisle had to offer.\n  The Constitution gives the President, and only the President, the \npower to make nominations. It is up to him to pick a nominee. We in the \nSenate are only empowered to speak for or against and to vote for or \nagainst a nominee.\n  The nominees' records have been examined. Senators have come forth \nwith their objections, and there is still time for objections to be \nspoken. We have offered to debate the nominations for as much time as \nthe minority wants, to be followed by an up-or-down vote. But the time \nhas come for us to set that vote. The President deserves to have that \nvote, the majority of the Senate deserves to have that vote, but \nparticularly the nominees deserve to have that vote, and the American \npeople deserve to have that vote. The American people deserve to see \nhow their elected representatives vote on these nominations and to see \nwhat kind of judges their Senators support.\n  We have a crisis in the Federal judiciary. We have too many judges \nwho act like they are in Congress, not on the bench. Those judges are \nimposing their values on the American people through their decisions. \nThat is why we must confirm nominees like the ones before the Senate, \nto stand up to activist judges and uphold the law and the Constitution \nand not write new laws from the bench. Liberal special interests have \ntaken over the Democratic Party and are fighting to stop these \nnominees, and therefore a minority of Senators is thwarting more than \n200 years of Senate tradition to block votes on these nominees.\n  The other side has no other way to advance its ultraliberal agenda. \nThey cannot pass their laws through this Congress or through State \nlegislatures. They cannot even get elected by running on these issues. \nSo they must turn to the courts, the last holdout of active liberal \npower to impose their agenda.\n  What is that agenda? It is unlimited abortion on demand, without even \nnotice to the parents of a minor child or the father of that child. It \nis about allowing partial-birth abortions. That liberal agenda is about \nrewriting the definition of marriage. It is about stripping down the \npledge of allegiance because it recognizes God. That agenda is about \nbanishing the Ten Commandments from public buildings. That agenda is \nallowing pornographic photos and other things into our libraries and \nacross the Internet.\n  That ultraliberal agenda does not sell in the heartland around the \ndinner table. It does not even sell here in the Congress. So the last \ngreat hope for the liberals is the judicial bench, and that is why they \nfight these judicial nominees who do not give in to their liberal, \nactivist agenda. The only thing that can stop the rewriting of our \nConstitution and laws is judges who will stand up to that activism and \nfight for the rule of law. President Bush has nominated such \nindividuals. Now the Senate must allow an up-or-down vote on those \nnominees.\n  There are other consequences to this debate as well. The confirmation \nprocess has become quite a burden on the nominees and their families. \nIn the last Congress, one of the most qualified judicial nominees ever, \nMiguel Estrada, asked for his nomination to be withdrawn because of the \nstrains on his personal life and family. Several more nominees asked \nnot to be renominated in the 109th Congress because of those same \nburdens. There are also practical consequences for the American people \nwho rely on a functioning court system.\n  Because of the vacant seats, our appeals courts are experiencing huge \ndelays that are unfair to the parties and put added strain on sitting \njudges. Nowhere is that more pronounced than in the Sixth Circuit, \nwhich encompasses my State. One-quarter of the seats of that court sit \nempty because the nominees from one State, Michigan, are being denied \nan up-or-down vote. Those vacancies have a real effect on the lives of \n30 million people who live in the Sixth Circuit. The people of \nKentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan, the people of the Sixth \nCircuit, are being denied justice in a timely manner.\n  This issue is far too important to leave unresolved any longer. We \nmust move to a vote. The record is clear. The nominees before the \nSenate are qualified to serve on the Federal bench and deserve to be \nconfirmed by the Senate. They have the proper understanding of the role \nof each branch of Government under our Constitution. They will stand up \nto those who wish to use the court as an unelected legislature. They \ndeserve an up-or-down vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to speak on the judge issue \nthat is before the Senate. I was wondering what the time constraints \nare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 1 o'clock is controlled by the \nmajority.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That means I can speak until 1 o'clock; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for several days now, the Senate has \nbeen debating two nominees for the Federal bench, Priscilla Owen and \nJanice Rogers Brown. I come to the floor to express my support for \nthese two highly qualified women, and I also do it to urge my \ncolleagues to support an up-or-down vote so that these folks know \nwhether a majority of the Senate is consenting to their nomination by \nthe President of the United States, in other words, confirm these two \nhighly qualified judges.\n  One of the most important roles that we Senators have is the \nresponsibility of advising and consenting to individuals that the \nPresident has nominated to fill positions on the three levels of the \nFederal judiciary. But this responsibility has been threatened by \nactions of Democratic leadership. Of course, that has brought us to \nthis extended debate, over several days now, about the role of the \nSenate as expressed in the Constitution about the handling of Federal \njudges nominated by the President.\n  It seems to me the Constitution is very clear on the role of the \nSenate in this judicial confirmation process. Judicial nominees are \nchosen by the President with the advice and consent of this body. Until \nPresident Bush was elected, no one ever interpreted this requirement to \nmean anything but a simple majority vote of those present and voting in \nthe Senate. For over 200 years, no judicial nomination, with a clear \nmajority support in the Senate, had ever been denied an up-or-down vote \non the Senate floor. This was the case regardless of whether a \nRepublican or Democratic President was in office. This was the case, \nregardless of whether the Senate was controlled by Democrats or \nRepublicans.\n  Recently, in the last Congress, the Democratic leadership decided it \nwas going to change the ground rules. The Senate Democrats rejected a \n200-year-old Senate tradition of giving judicial nominees an up-or-down \nvote. By doing this, the Democratic leadership has rejected the \nConstitution, rejected the traditions of the Senate, and it seems to me \nas a result of the last election, when approving judges was very much \nan issue to the American electorate, they are now rejecting the will of \nthe American people.\n  The Democratic leadership targeted 16 of President Bush's 52 court of \nappeal nominees. They actually filibustered 10 and threatened to \nfilibuster 6\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\nmore, a full 31 percent of President Bush's appellate court nominees \nbeing stymied. Because of this, President Bush has had the lowest \npercentage of his court nominees confirmed by any President in recent \nmemory.\n  What is this debate all about? It is basically a debate about what \nthe Constitution requires of the Senate. It is a debate about fairness \nto the individuals who do not have an opportunity to see whether a \nmajority of the Senate supports them and approves their appointment.\n  And in the case of fairness to the individual nominees, they have \nbeen waiting for years to be confirmed. They have majority support in \nthe Senate, but a minority of Senators is opposed to President Bush's \nappellate court nominees and, as a consequence, will not allow the \nSenate to give these individuals an up-or-down vote. The Democratic \nleadership will not allow the Senate to exercise its constitutional \nduty of advice and consent.\n  The Democratic leadership will not allow even this one Senator to \nexercise my constitutional responsibilities. In a sense, this Senator \nfrom Iowa and 99 others are being denied an opportunity to carry out \ntheir constitutional responsibility. That is simply not right. The \nConstitution demands an up-or-down vote. Fairness demands an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Some have claimed a rule change on this matter is a violation of \nSenators' free speech and minority rights. Let me make it very clear, \nwe are not talking about changing rules in this process, we are talking \nabout abiding by the practice of the Senate, until 2 years ago, over \nthe 214-year history of the Senate. So no rule change, just doing what \nthe Senate has always been doing, and no one has raised the issue \nbefore about a Senator's free speech and minority rights being \nviolated. There is not anything out of the ordinary then about a \nmajority wanting to exercise its right to keep Senate procedures the \nsame as they have always been.\n  For example, we were faced with problems in 1977, 1979, 1980, and \n1987, problems that were visualized by the Senate majority leader at \nthat time as stopping the Senate from doing what is constitutionally \nnecessary for the Senate to do. In those years, Senator Byrd led a \nDemocratic Senate majority in setting precedents to restrict minority \nrights. The Republicans, who were the minority party, did not respond \nby threatening the shutdown of the Senate or the stalling of \nlegislation.\n  On the other hand, the actions of the Senate Democrats now are an \nunprecedented obstruction, plain and simple. The Democratic leadership \nis not interested in additional debate on the nominees. This is not \nabout minorities wanting to exercise speech and debate on the \nnomination as long as they might want. The Republican majority leader \nhas offered the Democrats time and again as much time as they want for \ndebate. Yet the Democratic leader indicated in so many words that the \nDemocrats would not agree to any time agreement.\n  The Democratic leadership has taken the position that it will not \neven allow an up-or-down vote on these nominees. The minority leader \nhas indicated there is no time long enough for Democrats to debate \nthese nominations.\n  I clearly understand the importance of filibusters and would not want \nto see them done away with completely. However, it is also important to \nmake a distinction between filibustering legislation and filibustering \njudicial nominations. The interests of the minority party are protected \nin the Senate. It is the only segment of our Government where minority \npoints of view are protected. It has served a very good purpose over \n200 years bringing about compromise. Filibusters are meant to allow \ninsurance that the minority has a voice in crafting legislation.\n  When working on a bill, it is possible to make changes in compromises \nto legislative language until you get the 60 votes needed under Senate \nrules to bring debate to a close.\n  In the tradition of the filibuster on legislation, unlimited debate \nensures that compromise can take place, protecting some of the desires \nof the minority. That minority might not be a partisan minority; that \nminority could be a bipartisan minority that wants to make sure certain \nchanges are made in legislation.\n  Judicial nominees, however, are very different than legislation. An \nindividual such as Judge Brown or Judge Owen cannot be compromised some \nway so the filibuster, the way it is used in legislation, can be used \nto bring about compromise of an individual because you cannot redraft a \nperson like you can redraft legislation to get over a filibuster, to \nget to finality so a majority can rule. In a sense, the minority is \nsaying it is possible to use the filibuster to cut off the left arm of \none of these nominees and put on a new arm so they are compromised to \nget to finality. That is ridiculous. It just does not work.\n\n  But it also illustrates the rationale behind a filibuster applicable \nto legislation, not applicable to an individual.\n  For judicial nominations, it is the Senate's responsibility to \ndetermine whether nominees are qualified for a position they are \nnominated to, and to say so through an up-or-down vote. Let a majority \nof the Senate decide if they are qualified.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, it has only taken a majority of \nSenators to determine a nominee's qualification for the judge position \nthey are appointed to. It seems to me after a 214-year history, that is \nhistory worth continuing.\n  The reality about the Democratic leadership's filibuster is that the \nminority wants to block filling appellate court judgeships by requiring \n60 votes to proceed to the nomination. But no other President has been \nrequired to get 60 votes for his judicial nominees. No other judicial \nnominee needed to pass the 60-vote hurdle of a supermajority.\n  Many Federal judges on the bench today would have never made it, not \nwith that sort of requirement. In fact, all Senators here got elected \nby a simple majority, 50 percent of the vote. If we had requirements \nfor supermajority rule for Senators to be elected, a lot of Senators \nwho are my colleagues might not be here today. Why are Senators now \nwanting to approve judges only if they get a 60-percent vote? The \nreality is no other Senate majority has been excluded from judicial \nconfirmation process in 214 years. We need to restore tradition and the \nlaw of judicial process. We need to give these nominees the up-or-down \nvote the Constitution requires. We need to stop a systematic denial of \nour advice and consent responsibilities which have been shuttered by \nthe use of the filibuster.\n  I have been a Member of the Senate since 1981. Before I got to the \nSenate I served in the other body since 1974. I love the Senate. I have \nworked hard to be a very productive Senator. I want to do what is best \nfor the Senate, for my constituents, and for my country. That is not \ndifferent than the other 99 Senators most of the time. That is what we \nwere all elected to do. The Republican majority leader is also trying \nto do what he thinks is the best thing for this country by moving to \nreestablish the over 200-year Senate tradition by giving judicial \nnominees the up-or-down vote.\n  This is not going to destroy the Senate. It is in the tradition of \nthe Senate and it is within the tradition of the Constitution. The 214-\nyear history of this Senate speaks louder than just the last 2 years, \nbut the last 2 years will trump the first 214 years if we do not take \naction to keep the advice and consent confirmation process within the \ntradition of the Senate.\n  It is just plain hogwash to say that moving to make sure the rule is \nto give judicial nominees an up-or-down vote will hurt our ability to \nreestablish fairness in the judicial nominating process. It is not \ngoing to hurt minority rights. It establishes what we call regular \norder as it has been for 214 years. It will be fair both to Republicans \nand Democrats alike. All the majority leader wants to do is to have a \nchance to vote these nominees up or down. If these individuals do not \nhave 51 votes, they will be rejected and should be rejected. But if \nthese individuals do have 51 votes, then they should be confirmed. That \nis according to the Constitution.\n  If a Senator disapproves of any one of these individuals, vote \nagainst the nomination. I have done that in the past. But do not \ndeprive the people the right to support a nominee through their elected \nSenator.\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\n  Some claim many judicial nominees were filibustered by Republicans, \nparticularly when President Clinton was in office. That isn't accurate \nand that is a nice way for me to say it. Very few people either inside \nor outside this Chamber have been as involved in the issue of judicial \nnominations and the use of the filibuster as I have. As a long-time \nchairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Federal Courts, I have a \nunique perspective on the debate and the use of filibusters.\n  First, when the Democrats were in a majority in the Senate under \nPresident Reagan--and this goes back to my starting in the Senate in \n1981--they blocked 30 of President Reagan's nominees and 58 of \nPresident Bush Senior's nominees. They did that in the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Now, that is not equivalent to a filibuster. I do not want to mislead \nanybody. Then, in the last few years of President Clinton's \nadministration, many Republicans became disillusioned with the number \nof nominees the administration had sent to the Senate, and we felt our \nown Republican leadership was allowing out-of-the-mainstream nominees \nto be confirmed. This all came to a head with the nominations of Ninth \nCircuit Judges Paez and Berzon. Now, understand these people are \nserving as judges now. They were nominated to that position by \nPresident Clinton.\n  Going back to this time of Judges Paez and Berzon, at that time we \nhad a Democratic President and a Republican-controlled Senate. There \nwas serious talk of filibustering these nominees. I have heard some \nDemocrats and ill-informed pundits try to make the case that Paez and \nBerzon were filibustered. Well, they were not.\n  The reality is, the Republican leadership, including the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee at the time, argued that there had never been a \nfilibuster of an appellate court nominee. The Republican leadership \nargued Republicans should not cross that Rubicon and set the precedent \nbecause then it would be used against Republicans in the future when we \nhad a Republican administration. So it was decided at that time there \nwould not be a filibuster and we would not set that precedent. There \nwould be a cloture vote, yes, but everyone knew that cloture vote would \nprevail and the nominee would be confirmed by a majority vote.\n  So the Members who wanted to filibuster decided to go along with the \nleadership's wise counsel even though these Members never trusted that \nthe Democratic leadership would follow our example. I voted for \ncloture. I voted to get over 60 votes so we could move on with what we \nknew should have been done by the Senate. But I want you to know that I \nvoted against these two nominees, Judges Paez and Berzon. And I was not \nalone. Other Republican Senators did the same thing. But in the end, \nunfortunately, those Members were right not to trust Democratic \nleadership because Democratic leadership has now crossed the filibuster \nRubicon.\n  We are not only being denied the ability to perform our \nconstitutional duty in the judicial selection process, the move to \nfilibuster is upsetting the checks and balances and the separation of \npowers principle our Nation is founded upon. The Democrats are the ones \nwho are upsetting the checks and balances. They want to grind the \njudicial process to a halt for appellate court nominees so they can \nfill the bench with individuals who have been rubberstamped by leftwing \nextreme groups.\n  Let me say something about the nominees, then, because these are the \nfolks whom we are debating, these are the folks whose professional \nfuture, personal future is at stake by what we do here of allowing 51 \nvotes when they will be approved or 60 votes when they will not be \napproved.\n  Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown are both highly qualified \nindividuals, with exceptional legal abilities. They are talented women, \nrespected women, true pioneers. But they have been drawn into the web \nof the far leftwing special interest groups. These women have been \ncalled outside the mainstream by their opponents. They have been called \nunworthy for the Federal bench.\n  They have been labeled, among other things, as ``activist,'' \n``anticivil rights,'' and ``anticonsumer.'' These claims are not true. \nAnd the claims charged against other of President Bush's judicial \nnominees are just as false. All these outrageous claims have \nconsequences.\n  The travesty is Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown have been \nwaiting for years to be confirmed. The travesty is other worthy \nnominees such as Miguel Estrada got tired of putting up with the antics \nof the Senate, a Senate untraditional of its first 214-year history, \nand just said: I am not going to fight it anymore. So Miguel Estrada \nwithdrew his nomination. The travesty is that a nominee like Judge \nPickering is trashed. The travesty is that the good name of a nominee \nlike William Pryor is dragged through the mud.\n  Ripping to shreds the reputation of these individuals with unfounded \nallegations is unacceptable. This tactic sends a clear message to good \npeople who want to serve their country that they will have to endure \noutlandish and baseless attacks on their record and character if they \never want to be a Federal judge. The Democrats are doing this because \nthey are using a far left litmus test to satisfy their leftwing--their \nleftwing that is out of the mainstream--special groups. So when the \nDemocratic leadership says these nominees are outside the mainstream, \nthey are basically saying these individuals have not been approved by \ntheir allies, the far left special interest groups.\n  But judicial nominees should not be subject to a litmus test. They \nshould not be subject to an ideology litmus test. A nominee should not \nbe opposed, as Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown are being opposed \nright now, because they will strictly follow the law, be \nconstitutionalists, rather than legislating from the bench some \nleftwing agenda.\n  Moreover, history has proven the wisdom of having the President place \njudges with the support of the majority, not a supermajority, in the \nSenate. That process ensures balance on the courts between judges \nplaced on the bench by Republican Presidents and those placed on the \nbench by Democratic Presidents.\n  The current obstruction led by Senate Democratic leaders threatens \nthat balance. Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown deserve an up-or-\ndown vote. It is high time to make sure all judges receive fair up-or-\ndown votes on the Senate floor, up-or-down votes for judicial nominees \nof both Republican and Democratic Presidents alike in the tradition of \nthe Senate for 214 years, until 2 years ago.\n  In my town meetings across Iowa, I hear from people all the time, Why \naren't the judges being confirmed? If we do not take care of this issue \nthis week, I am going to hear it in my 22 town meetings across \nnorthwest Iowa next week when we are not in session. I think most \npeople understand the process is being politicized to the point that \ngood men and women are being demonized and their records distorted at \nan unprecedented level.\n  I hear from Iowans all the time that they want to see these nominees \ntreated in a fair manner, and they want to see an up-or-down vote. The \nDemocratic leadership likes to say the Republicans are the ones who are \nchanging the rules. But that is not true. The Democrats are the ones \nwho have engaged in extreme behavior and tactics, pulling out all the \nstops to defeat well-qualified nominees who would have majority support \nin the Senate if they were given an up-or-down vote. They are the ones \nwho have distorted the rules to the point that the Senate is being \ndenied its ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibility. And if \nSenator Frist has to do it, what he is doing is leaving the rules \npracticed exactly the way they were for 214 years.\n  Filibustering judicial nominees may be touted as standing firm on \nprinciple. On the contrary, what it boils down to is an obstruction of \njustice. Let's do the American people a favor. Let's stop the theatrics \nand get back to the people's business. All the rallies and political \nspin doctoring are not clearing any court dockets, and they are not \nimpressing the American public either.\n  Let's debate the nominees and give our advice and consent. It is a \nsimple ``yea'' or ``nay,'' when called to the altar to vote. \nFilibustering a nominee into oblivion is misguided warfare and the \nwrong way for a minority party to leverage influence in the Senate. \nThreatening to grind legislative activity to a standstill if they do \nnot get\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\ntheir way is like being a bully on the school yard playground. Let's do \nour jobs.\n  Nothing is nuclear about asking the full Senate to take an up-or-down \nvote on judicial nominees. It is the way the Senate has operated for \n214 years. The reality here is the Democrats are the ones who are \nturning Senate tradition on its head by installing a filibuster against \nthe President's judicial nominees.\n  The Senate has a choice. We can live up to our constitutional duties \nto advise and consent to President Bush's judicial nominees or we can \nsurrender our constitutional duty to the leftwing special interest \ngroups who apparently control the Democratic Party. This Senator \nchooses to follow the Constitution.\n  We need to return to a respectable and fair process. We need to \nreturn to the law and the Constitution. We need to return to the \nSenate's longstanding tradition. We need an up-or-down vote for these \njudicial nominees.\n  In case there are some people sincerely led to believe that somehow \nappointing certain people with a strict constitutionalism to the courts \nis something to worry about, I would simply ask them to look at how \nhistory works in bringing balance to our judiciary throughout the \nhistory of our country. Think in terms of 8 years of a Republican \nPresident appointing maybe people who are strict constitutionalists to \nthe judgeships--and not all of them are; but just say that they might \nall be--then you have 8 years of a Democratic president with people of \nan opposite point of view being appointed to the judgeships. That \nbrings balance.\n  But also think in terms of how it is difficult to predict down the \nroad 25 years how judges are going to rule. Think of two of the \nforemost liberal people on the Supreme Court, Justice Souter and \nJustice Stevens. Who do you think appointed these most liberal members \nto the Supreme Court? Republican Presidents did. And then balance that \nwith the two other most liberal members on the Supreme Court, Breyer \nand Ginsburg. Who appointed them? A Democratic President. You could \nmake an argument that Republican Presidents have brought more balance \nto the Supreme Court than Democratic Presidents have.\n  Then the other thing is, look at somewhere you thought they were \ngoing to be predictable where they would end up, and you have Justice \nKennedy and you have Justice O'Connor, who were supposed to be very \nstrict constructionists when they were appointed to the Supreme Court, \nbut they go back and forth between the conservative wing of the Court \nand the liberal wing of the Court.\n  So whatever worries the Democratic Senators of today, I wish they \nwould take a look at history. Time answers a lot of these problems. \nElections answer a lot of these problems. And we have a great \nconstitutional system that has worked for so long over such a long \nperiod of time that in the final analysis everything is going to work \nout OK.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a plea to \nmy colleagues and my friends on both sides of the aisle. I have spoken \non this issue twice. But within 24 hours, the time will come when the \nSenate may well be changed. Right now is the time to let political \npressures cool, to step back from the brink and to reflect on the long-\nterm consequences rather than the short-term gain. The time has come to \nwalk away from a decision that will turn our governmental system on its \nhead.\n  The reason this is called the nuclear option is not necessarily what \nit would do to the body but what it does to our ability to control the \nrules of the body. Because for the first time in history, a rule will \nbe changed or, as we on this side of the aisle say, broken, by a \nmajority vote, 51 votes, a majority of the Senate, when in fact rule \nchanges require a two-thirds majority vote. There is virtually no rule \nthat I know of in this body that can be changed with 51 votes.\n  I understand that it is going to be done without consultation of the \nParliamentarian. My understanding is that he would say it is not within \nthe Senate rules or precedent to change this rule with only 51 votes. \nNonetheless, it is going to be done.\n  When taken to its logical conclusion, a majority vote in favor of the \nnuclear option will fundamentally alter our democracy, not only by \nbreaking the rules as I just described but by altering the fundamental \nbalance between this body and the other House and, most particularly, \nthe role that Senators have had representing their constituents for \nover 200 years.\n  I recognize we may not agree on the qualifications of the nominees \nbefore us. I recognize many of my friends on the other side of the \naisle feel very strongly about confirming these candidates to the \ncourt. But in the end, regardless of who is right and who is wrong, \nchanging the Senate's rules, throwing out precedent, will profoundly \nharm this body, the comity we enjoy, the moderation that has defined \nthe Senate, the bipartisanship that is essential, and the balance of \npower that is needed to maintain any form of a democratic government, \nparticularly this one.\n  This nuclear option changes the deliberative nature of this body \nbecause it, in effect, ipso facto changes the Senate into the House of \nRepresentatives so that the Senate will work its will by majority. That \nhas never necessarily been the case before. We all know the Senate is \nlike a huge bicycle wheel. When one of the 100 spokes is out of line, \nit stops the wheel. So everybody respects that and pulls back from the \nbrink because of it because we know if we are the one that puts on the \nhold or stops the wheel from turning, that we also can feel that happen \nto us with our legislation and our bills.\n  Former Republican Senator Warren Rudman, whom I greatly respect--he \nrepresented New Hampshire from 1980 to 1993--was quoted in the press \nthis weekend. Let me share with you what he said:\n\n       I will lament this vote if it succeeds. People tend to look \n     at the history of the Senate and how it functions, and my \n     bottom line is that the Founding Fathers wanted a true \n     balance of power and this would shift the balance of power to \n     the White House. My sense is, thinking back on it, that I \n     don't think you could have gotten 51 votes on this sort of \n     thing in the past. . . I would have clearly voted against it.\n\n  That was Warren Rudman this past weekend.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to stand up \nagainst the political tidal wave pushing this agenda and let the \npassions of the moment cool. The debate last week was overwhelmed with \nfiery rhetoric and political posturing. One Republican compared \nDemocrats to Adolf Hitler. Another Senator insinuated that Democratic \nopposition is based on a nominee's religious faith. Others twisted the \nhistory of judicial nominations beyond recognition. And to be fair, \nsome Senators on our side of the aisle also employed fiery language.\n  Just listening to this debate, we can see what will happen if the \nmajority goes forward on this path. The Senate will most certainly face \na loss of civility, a loss of respect for differences. Political \nmessage will overwhelm substantive policy, and political potshots will \ndrive our debates rather than the best interests of the American \npeople. Playing to the base rather than playing out the real-life \nconsequences of our acts will rule the day. Regardless of each of our \nopinions on whether each nominee before the Senate should be appointed \nto the appellate courts, the aftermath of the nuclear option will not \nserve the American people well.\n  On two prior occasions, I have come to the floor to talk about the \nimportance of checks and balances, the intentions of our Founding \nFathers, the structure of the Constitution, and the inherent benefits \nof conflict and compromise. Our forefathers knew, as do our modern \ncounterparts, that essential to a true democracy is the need for a \nbalance of power because who is in the minority has, and will, \nconstantly change. Democrats held the House majority for over 50 years, \nand now Republicans have been in the majority for over a decade. \nDemocrats held the White House for 8 years. Now Republicans will have \noccupied the White House for 8 years. The swing back and forth between \nthe majority and the minority applies not just to political parties but \nto populations and ideas as well. Populations change and the political \npendulum swings, but what moderates those swings and the tidal wave\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nof power is the role and influence of the minority.\n  While it is true many of us on this side of the aisle were frustrated \nwhen Republicans used their rights and the Senate rules to block \nClinton's judges and our legislative agenda, we aired our frustration. \nAt that time, I urged my colleagues to allow a vote. However, I did not \nadvocate breaking the rules with 51 votes and employing the nuclear \noption as a way to force Republicans to their knees. The role of \nmoderation has worked and has been an important balance in our country.\n\n  As my colleague, Senator Lieberman, said last week:\n\n       In a Senate that is increasingly partisan and polarized \n     and, therefore, unproductive, the institutional requirement \n     for 60 votes is one of the last best hopes for bipartisanship \n     and moderation.\n\n  For example, President Clinton understood the strong feelings of our \nRepublican colleagues on judges, and he went to extensive efforts to \nconsult Republicans on judges that would be nominated. In describing \nthese efforts, Senator Hatch wrote in his book that he ``had several \nopportunities to talk privately with President Clinton about a variety \nof issues, especially judicial nominations.''\n  Senator Hatch described how when the first Supreme Court vacancy \narose in 1993, ``it was not a surprise when the President called to \ntalk about the appointment and what he was thinking of doing.'' He went \non to describe that the President was thinking of nominating someone \nwho would require a ``tough political battle.'' Senator Hatch recalled \nthat he advised President Clinton to consider other candidates and \nsuggested then-DC Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as well as then-\nFirst Circuit Judge Stephen Breyer.\n  So there was a defined, informal consultation that showed the power \nand authority of the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nwho actually submitted to the President--at that time Bill Clinton--the \nnames of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer for appointment to the \nSupreme Court. However, today there is not really active consultation \nby this administration in most cases. Instead, there appears to be a \nkind of disregard for the opinions of all Democratic Senators, even \nhome State Senators. I know my colleagues from Michigan have been \nextremely frustrated in their efforts to find a solution to the \nstalemate over the Sixth Circuit.\n  I am also concerned that if the nuclear option moves forward, there \nwill no longer really be a need for the Judiciary Committee. I ask my \ncolleagues to think about this. If the President is to be given \nunlimited power to appoint whomever he chooses, there will be no need \nfor hearings, there will be no need for an examination of a nominee's \nrecord. Any dissent or concerns will fall on deaf ears, so long as \nthere are at least 50 Senators willing to confirm the President's \nchoices for the Federal bench.\n  Checks and balances are not new. Our country's 200-year tradition of \nworking through our differences is not new. The need for consultation \nis not new. The important role of the Judiciary Committee--and I have \nserved as a member for 12 years now--in examining a nominee's \nqualifications, is not new. What is new is the majority party's \ndecision that if you win an election, you should have absolute power.\n  Earlier this week, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, \nstated:\n\n       I guess elections do not matter. I guess who people vote \n     for for President is of no concern to the minority in the \n     Senate. . . If someone happens to be reported out and a \n     majority defeats, fine, majority rules.\n\n  It is this very sentiment that concerns me and many others because \nthis logic ignores that the Democratic Senators won their elections, \ntoo, and that while President Bush did win the election, those who did \nnot vote for him still maintain their rights to have their voices \nrepresented in Government. Our country is not an autocracy. It is a \ndemocracy, where the minority enjoys an active role, particularly in \nthe Senate.\n  Protecting the minority and ensuring it is not overrun by a strong \nmajority is central to the need for an independent judiciary. In fact, \nthis is a basic lesson taught in elementary civics in schools across \nthe country. One teacher's notes found on the Internet as a model for \ncivic teachers states:\n  Purpose/Rationale/Goals of the day's lesson:\n\n       Students should understand that majority rule does not take \n     precedence over minority rights. The lesson should promote \n     thought, understanding, and acceptance that unpopular ideas \n     are protected under the United States Constitution. Students \n     should also understand that it is the independent judiciary \n     that protects these rights.\n\n  So it is a basic lesson we all learn in school from a very early age. \nFederal judges are meant to be independent. That is one of the reasons \nwhy the nuclear option is so dangerous--because it completely quells \nthe arguments, the views, and the votes of the minority and, therefore, \neases the way for absolute power to prevail with absolutely partisan \nappointments. There is nothing the minority can do to stop that.\n  I have quoted John Adams before on the specific need for an \nindependent judiciary.\n  He stated in a pamphlet called ``Thoughts on Government,'' which was \ndistributed in 1776, the following:\n\n       The judicial power ought to be distinct from both the \n     legislative and the executive, and independent upon both, so \n     that it may be a check upon both, as both should be checked \n     upon.\n\n  Today, I also want to quote from Alexander Hamilton, who, in the \nFederalist Papers, No. 78, published in 1788, wrote:\n\n       As liberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary \n     alone, it has everything to fear from its union with either \n     the [executive or legislative] departments.\n\n  These statements by Adams and Hamilton clearly set forth the intent \nof our forefathers that the judiciary should be and must be \nindependent. The Senate was meant to play an active role in the \nselection process, and the judiciary was not solely to be determined by \nthe executive branch.\n  As a matter of fact, I pointed out earlier on that in the early days \nof the Constitutional Convention, it was proposed that the Senate \nsolely determine who would sit on the federal bench, and then that was \nchanged to give the President a role in the nomination of judges \nconfirmed by the President.\n  I have also spoken about the history of judicial nominations under \nthe Clinton administration. As I have explained in great detail, during \nthe previous administration, Republicans used the practice of blue \nslips, or an anonymous hold, to allow a single Senator, not 41, to \nprevent a nomination from receiving a hearing, a markup, a cloture \nvote, or an up-or-down vote. This demonstrates that Senate rules have \nbeen used throughout our history by both parties to implement a strong \nSenate role and minority rights, even the right of one Senator to block \na nominee. As has been illustrated by my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, both parties have bemoaned the impact of procedural \ndelays on confirming judges.\n  However, President Clinton's nominees were pocket filibustered by as \nlittle as one Senator in secret and, therefore, provided no information \nabout why their nomination was being blocked, let alone an opportunity \nto address any concerns or criticisms about their record--no up-or-down \nvote, no cloture vote, no vote in the Judiciary Committee, nothing. \nThere were 23 circuit court nominees handled this way--filibustered by \nas few as 1 person, 1 Senator--and 38 district court nominees were \nfilibustered by as little as 1 Senator.\n  In addition, unlike what some have argued, this practice was \nimplemented throughout the Clinton administration when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate, not just in the last years or months.\n  The question I have posed to this body twice now--and I do it a third \ntime--is whether the public interest is better served by 41 Senators \ntaking an openly declared position, publicly debating an individual's \npast speeches, temperament, opinions, or a filibuster of 1 or 2 \nSenators in secret when one does not know why or who? I think the \nanswer is pretty clear.\n  This weekend, I read the press coverage on the nuclear option with \ngreat interest. I was heartened to realize that Democrats are not the \nonly ones who are concerned with the idea of drowning out minority \nviews and turning the Senate into the House.\n  The New York Times editorialized:\n\n       The Republican attack is deeply misguided. There is a \n     centuries-old Senate tradition that a minority can use a \n     filibuster to block legislation or nominees. The \n     Congressional Research Service has declared that\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\n     the nuclear option would require that ``one or more of the \n     Senate's precedents be overturned or interpreted otherwise \n     than in the past.'' The American people strongly oppose the \n     nuclear option, according to recent polls, because they see \n     it for what it is: rewriting the rules to trample the \n     minority.\n\n  That is the New York Times.\n  The Associated Press reported on a new poll that asked about judges \nand the Senate's role. The results found that 78 percent of those \npolled stated that the Senate should ``take an assertive role in \nexamining each nominee.'' And a Time poll said 59 percent of Americans \nbelieve Republicans should not be able to eliminate the filibuster. \nWhereas, in sharp contrast, a poll released last Thursday by NBC News/\nWall Street Journal found that only 33 percent of those surveyed \napprove of the job being done by the Congress. This is a monumental \nnumber. I submit that as partisanship and the polarization of this body \nincreases, the poll numbers will continue to decrease because that is \nnot what the American people want us to do.\n  In addition, there were more reports of former Republican Senators \nwho are also concerned about the impact of a nuclear option. Former \nSenator Clifford Hansen, a Wyoming Republican who served from 1967 to \n1978, was quoted as stating:\n\n       Being a Republican, we were the minority party, and I \n     suspect there are some similarities between our situation \n     then and those that the Democrats find themselves in today. I \n     am sure that it would have concerned me if there were limits \n     on the filibuster. When I was in the Senate, the Democrats \n     were in control, and we made a lot of friends with the \n     Democratic Party, and I realized then that if I were going to \n     get anything done, I had to reach out and establish some real \n     friendships with members on the other side.\n\n  That is what this Democrat has tried to do over the past few years as \nwell.\n  The Los Angeles Times wrote:\n\n       If a showdown over President Bush's nominees goes forward \n     as planned next week, it would mark one more significant step \n     in the Senate's transformation from a clubby bastion of \n     bipartisanship into a free-wheeling political arena as \n     raucous as the House of Representatives.\n\n  And The Economist wrote:\n\n       Amid all this uncertainty, the filibuster debate has almost \n     certainly harmed one institution: the Senate. It was \n     deliberately designed by the Founding Fathers to be the \n     deliberative branch of the American Government. Senators who \n     sit for 6 years rather than the 2 years of the populist \n     House, have long prided themselves on their independence. The \n     politics of partisanship has now arrived in the upper Chamber \n     with a vengeance. The Senate has long stood as a barrier to \n     government activism on either side.\n\n  As all these accounts acknowledge, the nuclear option will turn the \nSenate into a body that could have its rules broken at any time--and \nthis is significant--not by 60 votes but by a majority of Senators \nunhappy with any position taken by the minority. It begins with \njudicial nominations. Next will be executive appointments, and then it \nwill be legislation. If this is allowed to happen, if the Republican \nleadership insists on forcing the nuclear option, the Senate becomes \nthe House of Representatives, where the majority rules supreme and the \nparty in power can dominate and control the agenda with absolute power.\n  This country is based on a balance between majority rule and minority \nrights. I believe it is important to reflect on what our country is \nfacing while this debate is moving forward.\n  We had another sharply divided election, where the President was \nelected by a slight margin. The differences in American beliefs have \nbeen highlighted through heated debate over the budget, Social \nSecurity, the war in Iraq, increased tax cuts, funding for education, \nhealth care, and law enforcement. At times, the level of disagreement \ncan seem overwhelming. Yet, with all this tension, the majority party \nis attempting to implement a strategy to completely silence the \nminority. It is no longer acceptable to have differences. The defining \ntheme now seems to be ``my way or the highway.''\n  Last week, I said, when 1 party rules all 3 branches, that party \nrules supreme, but tomorrow, if the nuclear option proceeds, the \nRepublican party will be saying that supreme rule is not enough; total \ndomination is what is required. The nuclear option is the majority's \nstrategy to completely eliminate the ability of the minority to have \nany voice, any influence, any input. When might makes right, someone is \nalways trampled. Instead, I believe we should be ruled by the \nphilosophy that right makes might.\n  Thomas Jefferson consistently advocated for our country based on the \nfree flow of ideas and open debate. And maybe up to this point we have \ntaken for granted that a government of the people must be based on \nreason, on choice, and on open debate. But before our Nation was \nfounded, modern governments were based on authoritarian domination. The \npeople, in general, were considered little more than cattle to be \ngoverned and controlled by those possessing wealth, property, \neducation, and power. The Founding Fathers introduced the revolutionary \nidea that government could rest on the reasoned choice of the people \nthemselves.\n  In a free society, with a government based on reason, it is \ninevitable that there will be strong disagreements about important \nissues. But a government of the people requires difference of opinion \nin order to discover truth.\n  As I said at the beginning of this statement, I am deeply troubled \nthat legitimate disagreements over a nominee's qualifications to be \nelevated to a lifetime appointment have been turned into a strategy to \nunravel our constitutional checks and balances.\n  Unfortunately, while the Department of Defense authorization bill sat \non the calendar for the past week, we have wasted time on a clear \nstalemate. There are many urgent problems the Senate needs to be \nfocused on and Americans want us to focus on: the war in Iraq, \nprotecting our homeland, addressing the high cost of prescription \ndrugs, alleviating rising gas prices, ensuring our Social Security \nsystem is stable and working, and reducing the Federal deficit. I am \nfairly certain we will not all agree on the best means to address these \nissues.\n  I very much regret what we are in today. To give you just a small \nexample--and I think the Presiding Officer knows this--I sit on three \ncommittees. These three committees, for markups of critical bills, are \nmeeting simultaneously. They are Intelligence, marking up the Patriot \nAct; Judiciary, marking up the asbestos bill; and the Energy Committee, \nmarking up the Energy bill at the same time. This is not the way to do \nthe people's business--constrained by time limits artificially imposed \nbecause of this present situation.\n  I very much agree with the sentiment expressed by my colleague, \nSenator Specter, when he said:\n\n       If [during the cold war] the United States and the Soviet \n     Union could avoid nuclear confrontation . . . so should the \n     United States Senate.\n\n  I hope Republicans will choose to honor the tradition of our \ndemocracy and walk away from this confrontation. I know if the shoe \nwere on the other foot, I would not advocate breaking Senate rules and \nprecedent.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. After being rejected by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in 2002, and after being renominated and \nsuccessfully filibustered by the full Senate in the 108th Congress, \nJustice Owen has been nominated yet again to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit.\n  In my opinion, Justice Owen has not demonstrated an appropriate \njudicial temperament for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. \nMore importantly, her own colleagues on the conservative Texas State \nSupreme Court have described her dissents as ``nothing more than \ninflammatory rhetoric.'' In another case, the majority stated that \nJustice Owen's dissenting opinion, ``. . . not only disregards the \nprocedural limitations in the statute but takes a position even more \nextreme.'' However, I will not dwell too long on Justice Owen's record. \nIt speaks for itself, and as I mentioned earlier, we have given much \ntime and thought to this nomination. Much has already been said in \nopposition to her nomination. Instead, I will spend some time on the \nmajority's plan in this Chamber to subvert the minority's right to \nextended debate.\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\n  I have spent the past few weeks listening to the debate over seven \nnominees who were not confirmed in the 108th Congress and have been \nrenominated to the Federal bench by President Bush. We are nearing the \nend of a debate that may forever change the very nature of how this \ngreat institution operates: by a delicate balance of the majority's \nability to set the agenda and the protection of the minority's rights. \nOne thing is clear to me, this discussion about the minority's right to \nextended debate is not getting us any closer to enacting much-needed \nlegislation to assist our constituents.\n  Outside of Washington, DC, on a day-to-day basis our constituents \nface many challenges: escalating health care costs, record high gas \nprices, and mounting debt that will be handed down to our children and \ngrandchildren. Despite these day-to-day challenges, the majority party \ncontinues to put seven judicial nominations at the top of its agenda.\n  Let it be clear to those following this debate. This discussion is \nover the fact that the Senate has passed only 95 percent of President \nBush's nominees, not 100 percent. I take my responsibilities as a \nSenator very seriously. I am to provide the President with my advice \nand consent regarding the individuals he nominates for a lifetime \nposition to the Federal judiciary. Let me say that again: a lifetime \nposition on the Federal judiciary. Many have asked why the Democrats \nare so vigorously defending the rights of the minority in this case? \nWhy do we need to preserve the tradition of extended debate with regard \nto judicial nominations?\n  The reason why we are taking a stand against these nominees is \nbecause once they gain the Senate's advice and consent, nominees are \nfree to decide thousands of key cases that affect millions of Americans \non a day-to-day basis. If there are any objections we may have to \na judicial nominee's lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary, \nthis is the time for each Senator to voice that opposition. Unlike \nlegislation, which may be amended and refined over time, judges on the \nFederal bench sit for a lifetime appointment with little recourse for \ncorrection or change. The only chance we as Senators have to voice our \npositions on their appointments is now.\n\n  From civil rights to personal privacy, from environmental protections \nto a corporation's financial matters; these nominees will affect public \npolicy for decades to come. In fact, I dare say that we would be remiss \nin our Constitutional duties if we did not object to those nominees \nwith whom we find unfit for a lifetime appointment to the Federal \nbench. It troubles me that the Senate has focused so much in the past \nfew weeks discussing the fact that we have not acted on 7 of 218 of the \nPresident's nominees to the Federal judiciary.\n  We are talking about seven individuals, seven individuals who have \njobs, while 1.2 million people are without jobs since President Bush \ntook office, seven individuals who most likely have health insurance, \nwhile 45 million Americans do not have health insurance. We should be \ntalking about jobs and access to health care. We should be focusing on \nthe need to increase funding to ensure that veterans, especially those \nreturning from the global war on terror, have access to quality health \ncare and benefits. We should be looking at energy legislation that will \naddress the vital energy needs of our Nation. In short, we should be \ndoing what the American people sent us to Washington to do; to govern, \nnot engage in an effort to ensure that this President has a 100 percent \nsuccess rate for his judicial nominations.\n  If we want to start talking about legislation that is important to us \nas individual Senators, we could be talking about Federal recognition \nfor Hawaii's indigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians, an issue of extreme \nimportance to my constituents in Hawaii. We could be talking about \nending mutual fund abuses for investors or promoting financial and \neconomic literacy for our youth and adults alike. We could be talking \nabout how to fund the promises we extended when we passed the No Child \nLeft Behind Act which has been severely underfunded since its \nenactment.\n  Instead, over these past few weeks out of 218 judicial nominations \napproved we focus on the seven that Democrats have opposed. Despite \nconfirming 208 nominations for a lifetime appointment on the Federal \nbench, there are those in this body who seek to subvert the rights of \nthe minority for the sole purpose of ensuring that instead of a 95-\npercent success rate, the President has a 100-percent success rate with \nrespect to his judicial nominations. This action will serve to deny me \nmy ability to truly provide my advice and consent on individuals \nnominated to serve in the judiciary that our predecessors have \npreserved. It is sad that we have come to this point. During my tenure \nin the Senate, we have been able to work in a bipartisan manner to \nachieve our goals.\n  Some of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle argue that \nthis is the first time a filibuster has been used for a judicial \nnominee. Republicans have openly filibustered a number of nominees on \nthe floor of the Senate, five of whom were circuit court nominees. As \nwe have heard multiple times during this debate, during President \nClinton's two terms, close to 60 of his nominees were held in the \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary and never brought to the Senate \nfloor, never given the same up-or-down vote Republicans today say every \nRepublican nominated judge deserves.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they have never \nengaged in efforts to block a judicial nomination. I want to share with \nmy colleagues a situation I encountered during the 104th and 105th \nCongresses. An individual from Hawaii was nominated to serve on the \nU.S. District Court, District of Hawaii. This was a nominee strongly \nsupported by both Senators from Hawaii. This nominee had a hearing \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee and was reported favorably. \nHowever, this is where the process stopped for a period of 2\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  A colleague from another State placed a hold on this nominee for over \n30 months before allowing us to confirm this nomination. In effect, a \nSenator from a State thousands of miles from Hawaii blocked a district \ncourt nominee that the senior Senator from Hawaii and I supported. This \ncolleague is a former Attorney General of the United States and happens \nto be a good friend of mine. I found this situation to be so unusual, \nthat a colleague from another State would place a hold on a district \ncourt nominee from my State when both Hawaii Senators strongly \nsupported the nomination. I raise this issue to dispute the notion that \nthis is the first time a nomination has been blocked, after the Senate \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported the nomination to the Senate for \nconsideration.\n  I could also speak about the nomination of Justice James Duffy to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A fine nominee, described \nby his peers as the ``best of the best,'' he had strong support from \nSenator Inouye and me to fill Hawaii's slot on the Ninth Circuit. Yet, \nJustice Duffy never received a hearing in the Senate, which had a \nRepublican majority at the time. He went 791 days without a hearing, \nMr. President. I should mention that Hawaii now benefits from James \nDuffy's service on the Hawaii State Supreme Court, who was appointed \nwith bipartisan support.\n  Justice Duffy is one of the well-qualified and talented men and women \nnominated during the Clinton administration, individuals with \nbipartisan and home-State support, whose nominations were never acted \non by the Senate. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused \nto hold hearings for nominees they did not agree with, effectively \nblocking the Senate's consideration of President Clinton's nominees. \nLet's look at the substance and not the rhetoric.\n  The last person I will mention is Richard Clifton, who is now serving \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Clifton was \nnominated after President Bush withdrew Justice Duffy's nomination. \nRichard Clifton served as the Hawaii State Republican Party Counsel. \nWhile I do not necessarily agree with all of his views, I supported his \nnomination, because I have confidence in his ability to appropriately \napply the law. He was confirmed within a year of his nomination.\n  Since President Bush took office, we have been working in a \nbipartisan manner with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nfill the vacancies on\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\nthe Federal judiciary, creating the lowest vacancy rate in 13 years. \nAccording to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, \nthere are 45 vacancies on the Federal bench. This is a decrease in \ntotal vacancies from 97 when this President first took office. Let's \nreturn to urgent legislation which will truly help our constituents--\njobs, access to health care, education, the minimum wage, and helping \nthe poor.\n\n  In a Senate where the divide between the majority and minority is \nheld by a handful of votes, and that division reflects the viewpoint of \nthe American body politic at-large, it is imperative that we work \ntogether to resolve the many issues that are important to our \nconstituents. When it comes to judicial nominations, the confirmation \nof 208 judges clearly shows that we in the minority are doing what we \ncan to work with the majority in upholding our constitutional \nobligation to provide advice and consent to the President on judicial \nnominations. I can only hope we achieve a success rate of 95 percent in \nenacting legislation addressing funding for education, access to health \ncare, increases to the minimum wage, benefits and services for our \nveterans, business and economic development, and financial literacy to \nenable individuals and families to make sound decisions in their lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my time \nbe provided to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time do I have until the time of \nthe Senator from South Dakota begins?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no time allocated among \nSenators. There is a total time of 17 minutes 3 seconds and counting.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask that I be yielded 2 minutes so that the remaining \n15 minutes be provided to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii for his \nkind remarks and for his graciousness in yielding. I just want to make \na point that we have not heard enough. It is these numbers: 2,703 to 1. \nThis is the number of times Republican Senators have voted for court of \nappeals nominees either by direct vote or cloture versus the number of \ntimes they voted against them--2,703 yes, 1 no. The one ``no'' vote was \nTrent Lott who voted against Mr. Gregory to the Fourth Circuit who \nJesse Helms would never allow to go on the bench. So when we are \ntalking about up-or-down votes, we are really not. We do not have any \ndiversity of opinion on the other side. Nominees who are way off the \ndeep end, every member of the other side votes for them. So there is no \ngreat deliberation here. In fact, what 2,703 to 1 means is a \nrubberstamp.\n  The reason we are standing for what we believe in is very simple. \nThere should be some input. But when it comes to the other side, the \nWhite House says, This is the nominee, and everyone votes for that \nnominee no matter how extreme.\n  If there were 40 or 50 or 60 negative votes compared to, say, 2,600, \nyou might say up-or-down votes might mean something. But they do not \nbecause, unfortunately, for every single nominee on every single \ncloture vote, the Members on the other side just do whatever the \nPresident wants and vote for whoever the President sends us. That is \nnot deliberation. In my judgment, that is not what the cries for an up-\nor-down vote call for. They call for honest deliberation. I will have \nmore to say about that later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for \nhis excellent point.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow we may be casting a historic vote in this \nChamber. It has to do with a fundamental decision that we, as Senators, \nmust make as to the very nature of government in our democracy, as to \nthe fundamental values of this body, the Senate. We must choose between \nwhether we will remain with the 200-year-old parliamentary rules of \nthis body, which assure that at least there will be some modicum of \nbipartisanship on virtually all issues of import, or whether, in \nunprecedented fashion, we will wind up stripping away that fundamental \nrule, that 60-vote rule, the filibuster rule which for over 200 years \nhas brought both parties together whether they liked it or not. We must \nchoose whether we should discard that and, in effect, create an \nenvironment where it is very clear that the Senate, as has happened all \ntoo often to our colleagues in the House, will collapse into a spirit \nof partisan vituperation that will undo efforts at bringing the parties \ntogether, will undo our efforts to build bridges between Republicans \nand Democrats, and will push governance in this body to the far \nextremes, far outside the political centrism that is the genius of the \nAmerican people.\n  In my State of South Dakota, we have a heavy party registration on \nthe side of the Republican Party. I respect that. I am proud of the \nsupport over the years that a great many South Dakotans have cast for \nme. But whether they are Republicans or Democrats, I think the \noverwhelming view across my State is one of common sense. It recognizes \nthat neither one of the political parties has all the answers, that \nboth parties have their share of bad ideas, and that governance from \nthe far left or the far right is equally unacceptable. Wisdom in \nAmerica, more often than not, is found in the political center. That is \nwhat the filibuster rule, that is what the filibuster margin has forced \nupon the Senate and is what makes the Senate unique, different from the \nHouse of Representatives.\n\n  I served 10 years in the House. It was an honor to serve there. But I \nknow the nature of the rules there and what happens. One party can run \nroughshod over the other. All too often, bipartisanship is viewed by \nthe current leadership on the House side with contempt. The thought \nthat there ought to be governance from the center, and bipartisanship, \nis viewed by some in the other party as ``girly-man'' politics, \nunworthy of their radical agenda. It is here in the Senate that the \nFounders, 200 years ago, understood that this body's orientation would \nbe to take the longer view. This body was to be the more deliberative \nbody. This body would not march lockstep to any ideological drummer.\n  More than any other factor in the Senate, what has enforced that \ndifferent character on the Senate, a character which has served the \nAmerican people so well, has been the 60-vote margin rule. Both parties \nknow that in order to make much of anything happen here, they must \nreach across the aisle. Not a lot. It doesn't require a huge number of \nmembers of the opposing political party, but it requires some. That has \nhad a wonderful beneficial consequence for the wisdom of legislation in \nAmerica, and certainly for the selection of judges.\n  There is no judicial crisis. We all know. One doesn't have to be a \ncynic to understand that the judicial crisis, if you will, is a \nfabricated political vehicle. President Bush has had 208 of his judges \napproved by broad, bipartisan margins. Essentially each and every one \nof them was a conservative Republican judge. That is the President's \nprerogative. The Senate has not reacted negatively to that.\n  Put this in contrast with what we saw only a few years ago during the \nClinton administration. President Bush has had all of his nominees \nreceive hearings. All of his nominees, who were so chosen, received a \nvote up or down--a 60-vote margin vote but a vote nonetheless. Every \nSenator has been required to stand up and be counted and reflect back \nto his or her constituencies where they stood on that judge.\n  In the case of President Clinton, however, over 60 of his nominees \nreceived no hearing or no vote. Where was the clamor then? Where was \nthe cry of unfairness then? I think, to Senator Reid's great good \ncredit, as well as Senator Leahy, we have agreed that what was done to \nPresident Clinton should never be done to President Bush. That was \nunfair from either political angle. In fact, all of President Bush's \nnominees should get hearings. If their nomination stands, they should \nbe voted on, publicly, on the record. That is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  But now there are some who suggest that 208 to 10 is unsatisfactory \nand, for that reason, they are going to upend\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\nthese historic rules of the Senate. They are going to discard the \nSenate as the one body of the two that forces bipartisanship and \npolitical centrism.\n  Senator Reid deserves great credit for his efforts to try to reach \nsome compromise with the majority leader. Unfortunately, those effort \nhave--to this point, in any event--been futile. One can only come to \nthe conclusion that the majority leadership has reached such an impasse \nbecause of a certain amount of pandering to the radical right that now \nno compromise of any kind is acceptable. So here we stand with the very \nlikely, very clear possibility that the fundamental checks and balances \nof American government--the requirement that there be moderation, the \nrequirement that we govern from the center and not from the far left or \nfar right--is about to be discarded.\n  Let no one believe that this has to do only with judges. The \npolitical tactic here once used is then available. The precedent is \navailable for all issues, whether they have to do with education, \nenvironment, health care, the budget, war--all of these issues will \nhenceforth be susceptible to a partisan party-line vote from one side \nof the political spectrum or the other. That is a tragic change after \n200-some years of the Senate being the body of deliberation, being the \nbody of political moderation.\n  We ought to be dealing, rather than with this issue, with the core \nissues that my constituents--and I think all Americans--care about. We \nhave great undone business relative to the deficit, relative to job \ncreation, relative to trying to make sure all Americans have access to \naffordable health care. We have changes that are needed in our \neducational system, both under No Child Left Behind as well as \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act. We have a transportation \nbill. We have an energy bill before us. Yet here we are, arguing about \na parliamentary step which--while many people will view as ``inside \nbaseball,'' as something of no great consequence, this issue, this vote \nwe will take soon--is of monumental consequence to the nature of the \ninstitution that will be deciding all these other matters in the years \nto come.\n\n  I wish there were no need for any of us to be rising on this occasion \nfor such an extraordinary, such a potentially tragic step that this \nbody may be taking. The Founders of our country understood, over 200 \nyears ago, that the House of Representatives would be the hot house, \nthe people's House. It would be immediately responsive to whatever wind \nis blowing through Washington. Their rules, which give virtually no \nrights to the minority, and their 2-year terms, assure the nature of \nthat House.\n  But the Founders also understood that Senators representing entire \nStates would be more moderate in their outlook, and the 6-year terms \nwould give them a longer view of what is right or not in legislation \npending before us. Within the rules of the Senate, the filibuster rule, \nthe 60-vote margin rule, has served America well. It has pushed the \npolitical debate to a commonsense point--common sense being a value \nthat my constituents would tell me is all too rare in Washington, DC, \nbut which does occur as often as it does in no small measure because of \nthe filibuster rule and its insistence, grabbing both political parties \nby the collars, pushing them together, and saying, You must work \ntogether or otherwise neither of you will have your way.\n  This is an effort to radicalize the Senate, to radicalize government \nin America in a way that many Americans will never understand. They \nwill never recognize how this could have happened.\n  It is my hope as we come down to these final hours that my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle will pause and take a long view of the role \nof this institution, of the importance of centrism, cooperation, of \nbipartisanship and all that means, if we truly are to reflect the \nvalues and priorities of the American people here in the Senate. If we \nallow this institution to veer off sharply to either ideological end of \nthe spectrum, we will have done a horrible disservice to the American \npeople, to future generations of Americans, and, frankly, to the world. \nThis issue is that fundamental. It goes to the very nature of \ngovernance in America.\n  It is my hope all our colleagues will rise to stand as statesmen at a \ntime when political pressures are great for what is right and will cast \na loud vote to be counted by the American people on behalf of what is \nright rather than what is politically convenient at this particular \ntime in our history. It is my hope that in these intervening hours we \nwill have a significant number of people who will understand what is at \nstake and, in fact, uphold the values and priorities of the American \npeople by retaining the parliamentary rules of this body that have \nprevailed for well over 200 years, will understand there is no judicial \ncrisis, will understand when it comes to giving lifetime appointments \nto the bench it would be very easy for President Bush to have 100 \npercent of his judges approved simply by nominating judges who can be \napproved by 60 Members of this body. That is a modest request. That is \nthe kind of consultative role the Founders envisioned under their \nconstitutional provision of advice and consent.\n  The goal was not to create a lockstep ideological opportunity. The \ngoal was for both parties to work together and in good faith evaluate \nthe qualities of people who will serve our judiciary for lifetime \nappointments. It is my hope we will not abuse that opportunity and that \nwe will cast that vote to preserve that orientation, preserve the very \nvalues of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The majority controls the next 60 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, our former Senate majority leader, Howard \nBaker, reportedly tells the story about his late father-in-law, Senator \nEverett Dirksen, who admonished him to occasionally allow himself the \nluxury of an unexpressed thought. After listening to the current debate \non judicial nominations, there is a temptation to say, after all is \nsaid and done, pretty much all that can be said has been said.\n  I rise today because I do have something to say. What I want to talk \nabout is of very crucial importance not only with regard to the \njudicial nominations but, perhaps more important, how we are meeting \nour obligations in the Senate--or better put, how we are not meeting \nthem.\n  This weekend, an elderly gentleman spotted my Senator's car tag on my \ncar in a parking lot. He wandered up to me and asked: Are you a \nSenator?\n  And I responded: Yes, sir, I am.\n  Well, he has some rather succinct advice for all of us who ask for \nand gain the public trust.\n  He said: You know, you fellows up there ought to get busy and quit \ntalking past one another.\n  I think probably no matter the issue, most would agree he was right.\n  I am concerned, and so are a lot of other people--people who care, \npeople who have given much to this country and whose advice we should \nbe taking. One of those people is Dr. David Abshire who is president of \nthe Center for the Study of the Presidency and whose credentials for \npublic service are well-known and admired. Dr. Abshire recently \nauthored a treatise, ``The Grace and Power of Civility'' and the \nnecessity for renewed commitment and tolerance. He quoted John \nWitherspoon and Samuel Cooper during the days of our Founding Fathers \nand highlighted what they called ``the consonance of faith and \nreason,'' if we are to cross the bridge of united purpose.\n  We are not doing what our Founding Fathers did so well. As a matter \nof fact, we are in pretty sad shape with the shape we are in. Across \nthe bridge? Well, today, the bridge is washed out. We can't swim. And \nthe judges are simply on the other side.\n  I am going to paraphrase from Dr. Abshire. Today, as our Nation and \nthe world confront new and great perils, there are paralyzing forces of \nincivility and intolerance that threaten our country. Divisions in \nCongress also reflect the divisions in the country. The so-called wedge \nissues seem and appear endless. These challenges, if allowed to divide \nthe Nation, might well deny the next generation the prosperity and \ncivic culture that we have inherited.\n  It was Benjamin Franklin who stated that Congress should be a mirror \nimage of the American people. In the sense that there are divisions in \nthe country, the sad fact is, as evidenced by this debate, we seemingly \ncannot transcend\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\nthese divisions. We keep talking past one another, saying the same \nthings, but basically being in disagreement.\n  Dr. Abshire quoted the poet William Yeats, who said this, a dire \nprediction:\n\n     Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;\n     Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\n     The blood--dimmed tide is loosed, and\n     Everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned;\n     The best lack all convictions, while the worst are\n     full of passionate intensity.\n     Surely some revelation is at hand.\n\n  My colleagues, on this issue and so many others, we seem to be locked \ninto an era of partisanship that echoes a mindset of absolutism that \ncan close off dialogue and also mutual respect.\n  In that vein, let me take up the matter of judicial nominations, \nobviously, the issue at hand that currently has us tied up in partisan \nknots.\n  First, I understand the opposition on the part of my colleagues to \nmany of the President's nominations. I understand some of my colleagues \ndo not support certain nominees. Their opposition is well within their \nrights and their belief that they are reflecting the will of their \nconstituents.\n  I have a very simple solution. If you believe that your constituency \ndoes not approve of certain nominees, then simply vote against them. I \nhave done that, but I have never denied any Member of this body the \nright to an up-or-down vote, knowing full well that 214-year tradition \nof the Senate ensures that a majority vote would confirm or deny a \nconfirmation. Contrary to the great majority of statements made by some \nof my friends across the aisle, the practice of filibustering judicial \nnominations is not steeped in Senate history or precedent.\n  This is a brandnew application, quite frankly, of an obstruction tool \nthat the minority has suddenly seized, collapsed to their breast. We \nare seeing the reinterpretation of history and the claiming of \nprecedent when there is none. Again, the minority is asking the \nAmerican people to ignore the obvious tradition of a simple majority \nvote for judicial nominations that has been honored in the Senate for \n214 years.\n\n  Serving in public office for over 25 years in both the House and \nSenate, I am familiar with the broader points of our Constitution. What \nI gather from all the lather from my friends across the aisle is that \nPresident Bush should just stop nominating these ``out of the \nmainstream judges,'' for approval.\n  In fact, the President should consult with the minority party to find \na judicial nominee that is more appropriate and more mainstream or more \nin line with their thinking.\n  By this logic, the minority party--not the elected majority, the \nminority party--would have the determining role in choosing who is \nacceptable and who is not. Yet article II, Section 2 of the \nConstitution states that the President ``shall nominate, and by and \nwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors \nand other Public Ministers and Counsels, Judges of the Supreme Court, \nand all other Officers of the United States whose appointments are not \nherein otherwise provided for and which shall be established by law.''\n  Here's the rub: The power to choose nominations is not vested in the \nSenate's advice and consent role. The Senate's constitutional \nresponsibility is to ratify or to reject.\n  Let's talk about this new higher standard that was put into place \nonly 2 years ago and advocated so eloquently today by my friends across \nthe aisle. Since 2003, two short years ago, 60 votes have been the new \nminority criteria forced upon the Senate in order to confirm judicial \nnominations. The Framers of the Constitution identified seven \ncircumstances in which a supermajority vote is warranted by one or both \nchambers of commerce. Here are some examples: Impeachment--we have done \nthat; overriding a Presidential veto--haven't done that for a while; \namending the Constitution--and there are quite a few bills in the \nhopper that would do that.\n  However, Senate approval of judicial nominations is not among the \nseven instances identified by the Constitution. Here is the heart of \nthe matter. We do not propose to change anything. We propose to return \nto the tradition that governed the Senate for 214 years and an up-or-\ndown majority vote on pending nominations.\n  Then there is the charge that somehow restoring Senate precedent is \nreactionary. I have heard a lot of people compare the Senate to the \nHouse. I served in both bodies. Intuitively then, blocking judicial \nnominations is, therefore, a hallowed and sacred tradition of the \nSenate Chamber. But history does not support that assumption. In fact, \nfor over 200 years, judicial nominations required a simple majority \nvote. And again, a simple fact that I seldom read or hear within the \nnational media, paragraph after paragraph after paragraph about the \nmajority trying to change the rules, we are just trying to go back to \nthe rules that were in evidence prior to the last 2 years.\n  This new 2003 standard through the unprecedented use of the judicial \nfilibuster is the result of the minority not making the case against \nthe nominees as demanded by special issue interest group ideology. Why? \nThey are not able to convince the majority of Senators that these \nnominees are radical and wrong. It has been pointed out that during \nthis debate, for 58 percent of the last 50 Congresses--well over half, \nalmost 60 percent--the same party did control the Senate, the House, \nand the White House. Now, in all that time, the minority, whether it \nwas the Democrat or the Republican Party, never, ever resorted to this \nsystematic filibustering of judicial nominations.\n\n  So if the contention is that returning to a simple majority standard \nfor judicial nominations would abridge minority rights, my question is, \nthen why in the last 100 years has that bridge never been built until \n2003?\n  Our official Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, summed it up when he \nsaid:\n\n       When I was the leader in the Senate, a judicial filibuster \n     was not part of my procedural playbook. Asking a Senator to \n     filibuster a judicial nomination was considered an abrogation \n     of some 200 years of Senate tradition.\n\n  And there is the related issue that has been talked about in the \nSenate. Unfortunately, the disease of obstruction infected other \naspects of our work in the Senate last week. Obviously, the fever will \nnot break until high noon tomorrow. Senate business and the committee \nhearings and the markup of legislation are in early morning slow-\nmotion. In the afternoon, they come to a grinding halt.\n  For those not familiar with the Senate business, for business to be \nconducted off and on the Senate floor, it takes only one Senator, or in \nthis case the minority leadership, to call a halt to the Senate \nconducting business off of the floor.\n  I am chairman of the Intelligence Committee. We get hotspot briefings \nevery week, two or three times a week. We are marking up the PATRIOT \nAct. I asked why this practice was initiated so early; why last week, \nat a time when our Nation is fighting the global war on terror. I found \nthat obstruction rather appalling. The answer was pretty simple: We \nwanted to send you a message. That message, as I interpreted it, was \nwhoa, stop the Senate, let me get off until we get our way--something \nakin to a toddler throwing a temper tantrum in the middle of a grocery \nstore with much of the same rhetoric and name calling.\n  What is the real problem? Let's fully understand where the real \ncontroversy lies. Too many in the Senate and too many pundits have been \nmasking the real issue, in this Senator's opinion. It is not about \npreserving great Senate traditions such as minority rights. It is not \nabout lengthy debate and cooling passions of the day. That is an \noxymoron in regard to the Judiciary Committee. It is not about doing \naway with the filibuster. By the way, it is not about Jimmy Stewart and \n``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' That was a classic movie, but it is \nthe wrong plot unless we are talking about other Jimmy Stewart movies. \nThe movies ``Vertigo'' and the ``Supreme Court'' come to mind. Or \nperhaps the minority is hoping they can have the Glenn Miller Band play \n``Pennsylvania 65000'' within Pennsylvania 1600 in 2008.\n\n  And it is not about unqualified or unacceptable judicial nominees. It \nis about a brandnew 2-year-old procedure that will deny--is denying--a \nmajority of Senators their right and constitutional duty to vote on \njudicial nominees. In my view, we are riding into a box canyon here, \nwhere incivility and partisanship and absolutism and further division \nawait. There is going to\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nbe a lot of milling around. We do not have to go there. Let us restore \nthe 214-year-old precedent of an up-or-down majority vote and see if we \ncannot reach accord and ride to a higher--a higher--common ground.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we turn on the television these days and \nget bombarded with advertisements saying: ``Write your Senator.'' \n``Call your Senator and preserve the filibuster.'' ``Get ahold of your \nSenator and make sure this tool that provides rights and protections of \nthe minority gets preserved.''\n  I have been associated with the Senate now since I was a 19-year-old \nintern sitting in the family gallery in the 1950s, falling in love with \nthe debate that was going on, on the Senate floor. I must say there \nwere usually more Senators here in the 1950s than there are now, but I \nunderstand, with television, the Senators stay in their offices and \nwatch, and I am happy to accept that. But I understand the traditions \nof this body have great roots in history that many times get ignored. \nThat is, these roots get ignored by people writing columns and stories \ntoday.\n  I want to go on record very firmly as being on the same side as those \npeople who are buying the ads saying: ``Preserve the filibuster.'' I \nhave watched the filibuster be used to help shape legislation. I \nwatched the filibuster be used as a tool of compromise. I think the \nfilibuster is a very worthwhile thing to hang on to in order to \npreserve the rights of the minority.\n  Now, that position of saying ``let's save the filibuster'' has not \nalways been popular. If you go back 10 years ago, when a proposal was \nmade on the Senate floor to abolish the filibuster, the New York Times \neditorialized in favor of that position. The New York Times told us\n\n     . . . the filibuster has become the tool of the sore loser.\n\n  The Times was anxious to have the whole thing wiped away. There were \nonly 19 Senators who voted to abolish the filibuster, 9 of whom are \nstill serving today. The rest of us all voted to preserve the \nfilibuster. So I am on record as saying: We must preserve the \nfilibuster. I value it. I believe it has a place in the Senate. \nHowever, I also believe we have the right to shape the filibuster, to \nfocus the filibuster, to reform the filibuster, so it can be used in a \nmore effective way.\n  There are those now who, when they say ``save the filibuster,'' mean \n``save the filibuster the way we like it,'' not ``save the filibuster \nin its historic form, because its historic form has changed over the \nyears.\n  The first point, as far as history is concerned, is this: The \nfilibuster did not come into existence with the Constitution. I had a \nphone call over the weekend from a very dear friend who said: This is a \nconstitutional issue that goes back all the way to the Founding \nFathers. However, the filibuster, Rule XXII, came into the Senate \nhistory in 1917. That is a long time after the Founding Fathers. And it \nhas been changed several times since that time, some times by formal \nSenate rule. It was changed in 1949. It was changed again in 1959. And \nit was changed again in 1975. So for those who run the ads saying \n``save the filibuster,'' maybe the first question is, which filibuster \ndo you have in mind that you want us to save?\n  But there is another aspect of the filibuster. I turn again to the \nNew York Times. It is amazing how much they have changed their minds in \nthe intervening 10 years. After the New York Times said the filibuster \nwas a tool of the sore loser, now in this debate they decide that\n\n     . . . the filibuster [is] a time-honored Senate procedure . . \n     .\n\n  They editorialize: ``Keep it just the way it is.'' Well, I want to \ntalk a little bit about time-honored Senate procedures, and \nparticularly time-honored Senate procedures with respect to the \nfilibuster. It is a time-honored Senate procedure that the filibuster \ncan be changed by majority vote. There are a number of Senators who \nhave served here and are still serving here who, at least at one time \nin their careers, agreed with that.\n  Senator Kennedy had this to say in 1975, when there was a debate on \nwhat kind of filibuster we could have and what the time-honored Senate \nprocedures would say about the filibuster. Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       A majority may adopt the rules in the first place. It is \n     preposterous to assert they may deny future majorities the \n     right to change them.\n\n  Senator Kennedy was enunciating a time-honored Senate procedure that \nsaid a majority had the right to change the rules. This was in 1975.\n  Senator Mondale served in 1975. Senator Mondale had this to say about \nwhat was done in 1975. For those who are talking about time-honored \nSenate procedures, this was the Senate procedure 30 years ago. And for \n30 years it has stood the test of time. Senator Mondale said:\n\n     . . . the President of the Senate . . . and the membership of \n     the Senate . . . have both clearly, unequivocally, and \n     unmistakably accepted and upheld the proposition that the \n     U.S. Senate may . . . establish its rules by majority vote, \n     uninhibited by rules adopted by previous Congresses.\n\n  Somehow this happened. Senator Mondale said it happened ``clearly, \nunequivocally, and unmistakably,'' and the place did not blow up. There \nwere no threats to shut everything down, to object to every unanimous \nconsent request, to cause a ``nuclear bomb'' to go off in this Chamber \nif this policy were to happen. This is a time-honored Senate procedure \nand it happened with both the membership of the Senate and the \nPresident of the Senate in 1975, according to Senator Mondale.\n  I picked Senator Mondale because in 1976 he was elected Vice \nPresident, which meant he became the Presiding Officer of the Senate. \nAnd something happened while he was the Presiding Officer of the Senate \nin this same time-honored Senate procedure.\n  The majority leader at the time was Senator Byrd of West Virginia. \nAnd he has described what happened while Vice President Mondale was \npresiding over this body. Here is what Senator Byrd had to say in 1995, \nas a bit of historic information for the rest of us who may not have \nbeen present back in the time when Mr. Mondale was the Vice President.\n\n  Senator Byrd explained:\n\n       I have seen filibusters. I have helped to break them. There \n     are few Senators in this body who were here when I broke the \n     filibuster on the natural gas bill. . . . I asked Mr. \n     Mondale, the Vice President, to go please sit in the chair; I \n     wanted to make some points of order and create some new \n     precedents that would break these filibusters.\n\n  Interesting choice of words, because that is what we are talking \nabout here under the name ``nuclear option,'' making a point of order \nand setting a new precedent. Senator Byrd, the majority leader, asked \nVice President Mondale to ``please sit in the chair,'' to be there when \nSenator Byrd made ``some points of order'' and created ``some new \nprecedents'' to ``break these filibusters.'' He goes on to describe \nwhat happened:\n\n       And the filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, and arms. \n     It went away in 12 hours.\n       So I know something about filibusters. I helped to set a \n     great many of the precedents that are in the books here.\n\n  A time-honored Senate procedure.\n  Senator Byrd did it again. Going ahead to 1980, Senator Byrd led 54 \nSenators, all but one of whom were Democrats, in overturning the Chair \nand eliminating all debate on motions to proceed to nominations. The \npoint here is an important one. He did not abolish the filibuster. He \ndid not say: Get rid of the filibuster. He did not abide by the advice \nof the New York Times that said it was a tool of sore losers. But he \nhelped shape it. He helped focus it. He said the filibuster should not \nbe quite as broad as it may have been in the past. And using the time-\nhonored Senate procedure of making a point of order, and getting the \nSenate to vote, he helped shape it, and the Senate Democrats set this \nprecedent before the Senate had even begun to debate the motion, so \nthat the filibuster that used to apply to motions to proceed to \nnominations no longer does.\n  And how was the rule changed? It was changed by a time-honored Senate \nprocedure.\n  Now, there is one other time-honored Senate procedure that Senator \nLeahy has spoken of. This goes to a floor statement Senator Leahy made \nin 1997, as he was talking about nominations for the Federal bench. \nSenator Leahy,\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nwho at the time was the ranking minority member of the Judiciary \nCommittee--he went on later to become the chairman--said:\n\n       I cannot recall a judicial nomination being successfully \n     filibustered.\n\n  I find that interesting because many of our Democratic friends are \nnow saying: ``Oh, filibusters of judicial nominations are normal. They \nhave happened before.'' Well, at least in 1997, Senator Leahy said:\n\n       I cannot recall a judicial nomination being successfully \n     filibustered. I do recall earlier this year when the \n     Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I noted \n     how improper it would be to filibuster a judicial nomination.\n\n  I have the same recollection. I remember in our conference when the \nissue of filibustering some of President Clinton's judges came up, it \nwas the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my senior \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, who stood before the conference and said: \n``Do not do it. It would be improper to filibuster a judicial nominee. \nHaving judicial nominees get a vote is a time-honored Senate \nprecedent.'' Senator Lott was the majority leader. He took the floor, \nafter Senator Hatch had spoken, and said: ``Senator Hatch is right.'' \nWe should not cross the line and start to filibuster judicial \nnominations because the Senate tradition has said no.\n  So that is where we are now. The Senate tradition has been changed. \nThe Members of the minority have exercised their right, which has \nalways been on the books, to change the precedent which had held for so \nlong that even Senator Leahy could not recall an exception to it. What \nwe are talking about doing now is using the time-honored Senate \nprocedure of changing the rule by majority vote to see to it that the \nprior precedent remains--or, rather, returns because it was broken in \nthe 108th Congress.\n  So I value the filibuster. I am in favor of the filibuster. But I \nthink the filibuster has been and still can be shaped and changed so it \nis more focused than simply an across-the-board procedure.\n  I want to close by putting something of a human face on this whole \nissue because we are talking about this filibuster of judicial nominees \nalmost as if the judicial nominees were not people, almost as if the \njudicial nominees were spectators in this activity. They are not \nspectators. They are seeing their reputations smeared. They are seeing \ntheir history attacked. It is time we spent a little time thinking \nabout them.\n  I know the nomination on the floor is Priscilla Owen, but over the \nweekend I had called to my attention an article that appeared in the \nSacramento Bee by one Ginger Rutland that I would like to close with. \nIt is entitled: ``Worrying about the right things.'' Ginger Rutland \nidentifies herself as ``a journalist of generally liberal leanings,'' \nand she talks about the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown.\n  Both Ms. Rutland and Ms. Brown live in California. Ms. Rutland says:\n\n       I've been trying to get a fix on Brown since President Bush \n     nominated her for the influential U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\n  It talks about the experience. And then she makes this comment:\n\n       Championed by conservatives, Brown terrifies my liberal \n     friends. They worry she will end up on the U.S. Supreme \n     Court. I don't. I find myself rooting for Brown. I hope she \n     survives the storm and eventually becomes the first black \n     woman on the nation's highest court. I want her there because \n     I believe she worries about the things that most worry me \n     about our justice system: bigotry, unequal treatment and laws \n     and police practices that discriminate against people who are \n     black and brown and weak and poor.\n       She was born and raised poor, a sharecropper's daughter in \n     segregated Alabama. She was a single mother for a time, \n     raising a black child, a male child. I don't think you can \n     raise a black man in this country without being sensitive to \n     the issues of discrimination and police harassment.\n\n  She goes on in the article. I ask unanimous consent that the entire \narticle be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. She concludes with this comment:\n\n       I don't pretend to know how Brown will rule on other \n     important issues likely to reach the Federal courts. I only \n     know that I want judges on those courts who will defend the \n     rights of the poor and the disenfranchised in our country.\n\n  She believes Janice Rogers Brown is one of those jurists.\n  I am not sure whether she is right or wrong. But I do know Janice \nRogers Brown deserves the opportunity to have her nomination voted on. \nAnd if one use of the filibuster has been to prevent Priscilla Owen and \nJanice Rogers Brown and others like them from getting this vote, a \ntime-honored procedure of the Senate can be used with equal \njustification to see to it that the filibuster gets tweaked a little \nbit to make sure we go back to the practice that existed here for \ndecades.\n  For that reason, I will support the motion of the majority leader if \nit becomes necessary to make sure that we have an opportunity to a vote \non Priscilla Owen. I hope as a result of this debate, our friends on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle will step back a little from their \nposition of saying no to a vote on Priscilla Owen and allow us to have \na vote. If they do, they are acting in accordance with the history of \nthe Senate for past decades, the history of the Senate going back so \nfar that even Patrick Leahy cannot remember an exception to it. If they \ndo and we have an up-or-down vote on Priscilla Owen, it may well be \nthat all of this talk about changing the rules will go away.\n  The outcome lies in their hands. If they allow us to vote on \nPriscilla Owen, we will not have the lack of civility, the shutting \ndown of the Senate, the collapse of Government, all of the other things \nthat have been predicted. If, on the other hand, they say no, we will \nnot allow this woman who has been unanimously rated as well qualified \nby the American Bar Association to even get a vote, then we will see \nthe majority leader follow the practice, follow the precedent, follow \nthe example set by Senator Byrd, the example endorsed by Senator \nKennedy, endorsed by Senator Mondale, and use the time-honored Senate \nprocedure to change the rule by majority vote. If the majority leader \nso moves, I will support it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                             [May 8, 2005]\n\n            Ginger Rutland: Worrying About the Right Things\n\n                          (By Ginger Rutland)\n\n       I know Janice Rogers Brown, and she knows me, but we're not \n     friends. The associate justice of the California Supreme \n     Court has never been to my house, and I've never been to \n     hers. Ours is a wary relationship, one that befits a \n     journalist of generally liberal leanings and a public \n     official with a hard-right reputation fiercely targeted by \n     the left.\n       I've been trying to get a fix on Brown since President Bush \n     nominated her for the influential U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia. She won't talk to the \n     press. Friends, associates, even a former teacher, say the \n     same things about her: She's ``brilliant,'' ``hardworking,'' \n     ``stoic'' and ``kind.''\n       Her opponents on the left tell me she's a fundamentalist \n     Christian who will bring her religious values into the \n     courtroom. But I've never been frightened by people of faith. \n     Brown is Church of Christ. So is my mother-in-law, a good, \n     gentle woman and lifelong Democrat who voted for John Kerry \n     for president and opposed the war in Iraq because, as she \n     told me when it started, ``I've never understood how killin' \n     other folks' children ever solved anything.''\n       I'm almost embarrassed to admit it, but desperate for \n     deeper insight, I visited Brown's church last Sunday, the \n     Cordova Church of Christ. The judge wasn't there, but her \n     mother, Doris Holland, was. She was polite but understandably \n     guarded. She told me that as a young girl Brown liked to read \n     and had an imaginary friend; that was about it.\n       The congregation is integrated and friendly. Church members \n     know Brown and her husband, jazz musician Dewey Parker, and \n     like them. The church itself is conservative, allowing no \n     instrumental music in its services, no robes, no bishops or \n     hierarchy of any kind. The religious right may have taken up \n     Brown's cause in Congress, but the sermon at Cordova that day \n     contained no political content.\n       Championed by conservatives, Brown terrifies my liberal \n     friends. They worry she will end up on the U.S. Supreme \n     Court. I don't.\n       I find myself rooting for Brown. I hope she survives the \n     storm and eventually becomes the first black woman on the \n     nation's highest court.\n       I want her there because I believe she worries about the \n     things that most worry me about our justice system: bigotry, \n     unequal treatment and laws and police practices that \n     discriminate against people who are black and brown and weak \n     and poor.\n       She was born and raised poor, a sharecropper's daughter in \n     segregated Alabama. She was a single mother for a time, \n     raising a black child, a male child. I don't think you can \n     raise a black man in this country without being sensitive to \n     the issues of discrimination and police harassment.\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\n       And yes I know. People said that Clarence Thomas would be \n     sensitive to those issues, too, and he's been a \n     disappointment.\n       But in Brown's case, I have something more concrete on \n     which to base my hopes--her passionate dissent in People v. \n     Conrad Richard McKay.\n       The case outlines a single, unremarkable instance of police \n     harassment, the kind of petty tyranny that plays out on the \n     streets of big cities and small towns across America every \n     day.\n       In 1999 a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy stopped Conrad \n     Richard McKay for riding his bicycle in the wrong direction \n     on a residential street, a minor traffic infraction. The \n     deputy asked McKay for a driver's license. McKay had none. \n     Instead, he provided his name, address and date of birth.\n       The officer arrested him for failing to have a driver's \n     license. Then he searched him, finding a baggie of what \n     turned out to be methamphetamine in his left sock. McKay was \n     charged with illegal drug possession, convicted and sentenced \n     to 32 months in prison.\n       He appealed, arguing that the arrest and the search were \n     unreasonable, a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights to \n     be protected from unreasonable searches. The officer searched \n     him, he said, because he didn't have a driver's license, a \n     document he was not required to carry to ride a bicycle.\n       Six members of the California Supreme Court rejected that \n     argument, ruling that McKay's arrest was within the officer's \n     discretion and therefore constitutional.\n       Brown was the lone dissenter. What she wrote should give \n     pause to all my friends who dismiss her as an arch \n     conservative bent on rolling back constitutional rights. In \n     the circumstances surrounding McKay's arrest, the only black \n     judge on the state's high court saw an obvious and grave \n     injustice that her fellow jurists did not.\n       ``Mr. McKay was sentenced to a prison term for the trivial \n     public offense of riding a bicycle the wrong way on a \n     residential street,'' Brown wrote.\n       ``Anecdotal evidence and empirical studies confirm that \n     what most people suspect and what many people of color know \n     from experience is a reality: There is an undeniable \n     correlation between law enforcement stop-and-search practices \n     and the racial characteristics of the driver. . . . The \n     practice is so prevalent, it has a name: `Driving while \n     Black.' ''\n       After a scholarly discussion on the origin of the Fourth \n     Amendment and an exhaustive review of the case law on \n     unlawful searches, Brown used plain words to get to the heart \n     of what really bothered her about what happened to Conrad \n     McKay on that Los Angeles street. It's what bothers me, too.\n       ``I do not know McKay's ethnic background. One thing I \n     would bet on: He was not riding his bike a few doors down \n     from his home in Bel Air, or Brentwood, or Rancho Palos \n     Verdes--places where no resident would be arrested for riding \n     the `wrong way' on a bicycle whether he had his driver's \n     license or not. Well . . . it would not get anyone arrested \n     unless he looked like he did not belong in the neighborhood. \n     That is the problem. And it matters. . . . If we are \n     committed to a rule of law that applies equally to \n     `minorities as well as majorities, to the poor as well as \n     the rich,' we cannot countenance standards that permit and \n     encourage discriminatory enforcement.''\n       In her dissent, Brown even lashed out at the U.S. Supreme \n     Court and--pay close attention, my liberal friends--\n     criticized an opinion written by its most conservative \n     member, Justice Antonin Scalia, for allowing police to use \n     traffic stops to obliterate the expectation of privacy the \n     Fourth Amendment bestows.\n       ``Due to the widespread violation of minor traffic laws, an \n     officer's discretion is still as wide as the driving \n     population is large,'' she wrote. In her view, court \n     decisions have freed police to search beyond reason not just \n     drivers of cars but ``those who walk, bicycle, rollerblade, \n     skateboard or propel a scooter.''\n       She reserved special scorn for judges who permit police to \n     discriminate while advising the targets of discrimination to \n     sue to challenge their oppressors. ``Such a suggestion \n     overlooks the fact that most victims . . . will barely have \n     enough money to pay the traffic citation, much less be able \n     to afford an attorney. . . . To dismiss people who have \n     suffered real constitutional harms with remedies that are \n     illusory or nonexistent allows courts to be complacent about \n     bigotry while claiming compassion for its victims,'' she \n     wrote.\n       ``Judges go along with questionable police conduct, \n     proclaiming that their hands are tied. If our hands really \n     are tied, it behooves us to gnaw through the ropes.''\n       With that last pronouncement, Brown confirms what many of \n     her enemies have said--that she's an ``activist judge.'' \n     Judges who ``gnaw through ropes'' to protect people being \n     hassled by cops represent the kind of judicial activism I can \n     support.\n       Liberals prefer to overlook Brown's strong dissent in \n     McKay. Conservatives mention it only in passing, as if \n     embarrassed that one of their own might have qualms about law \n     enforcement bias or a creeping police state.\n       I don't pretend to know how Brown will rule on other \n     important issues likely to reach the federal courts. I only \n     know that I want judges on those Courts who will defend the \n     rights of the poor and the disenfranchised in our country \n     against the rich and the powerful when the rich and the \n     powerful are wrong. I want someone who will defend people \n     like Conrad McKay.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about Priscilla Owen, a \nwoman who serves on the Texas Supreme Court, a woman of the highest \nmoral character, and a woman whose confirmation has been held up by the \nSenate for over 4 years--Justice Owen was first nominated on May 9, \n2001, by President Bush. Her nomination has actually been voted on four \ntimes by the Senate: May 1, 2003, a cloture vote, she won 52 votes; May \n8, 2003, she won 52 votes; July 29, 2003, she won 53 votes; November \n14, 2003, she won 53 votes.\n  If one looks back on a 200-year Senate tradition, the Constitution's \nrequirement for simple majority votes on judicial nominations--as well \nas the specific instances where the Constitution does, in fact, specify \nsuper-majority votes, one would presume that Priscilla Owen would be \nsitting on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the majority in the \nSenate would not have to be restoring precedent. My goodness, why isn't \nshe sitting on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals bench?\n  Priscilla Owen is not sitting on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, \neven though she received a majority of the votes in the Senate four \ntimes, because a new standard is now being required, a new standard of \n60 votes. Did we have a constitutional amendment that would require 60 \nvotes? No. Did we have a new rule that required 60 votes? No. We just \nhave the use of a filibuster by the minority in the Senate in the last \nsession of Congress--the first time in the history of our country when \na majority of the Senate has been thwarted by the minority on Federal \njudicial appointments.\n  There have, from time to time, been filibusters when the person did \nnot have 51 votes in the Senate; never when a majority of the Senate \nvoted to support that nominee. Yet that is exactly what has happened to \nPriscilla Owen.\n  There has been a change in the balance of power that was envisioned \nin the Constitution without a constitutional amendment. Last Friday on \nthe Senate floor, some Democratic Members of the Senate actually said: \nWe should have a 60-vote requirement for Federal judges to be confirmed \nby the Senate. That is worthy of discussion. It is worthy for us to \nhave that debate. But the debate should be in the context of a \nconstitutional amendment--going through the process our Founding \nFathers said would be required for a constitutional amendment. Let's \nput it to a test. Let's determine if that is the right thing and do it \nthe right way. But that is not what is happening here today.\n  In fact, it is significant that we look at the historical comparison \nof the first term of a Presidency and the confirmation of appeals court \nnominees. President George W. Bush has the lowest percentage of \nconfirmations of any President in the history of the United States. \nPresident Clinton had 77 percent of his appellate court nominees \nconfirmed. President George H.W. Bush had 79 percent. President Reagan \nhad 87 percent. President Carter had 93 percent. President Ford had 73 \npercent. President Nixon had 93 percent. President Johnson had 95 \npercent. President Kennedy had 81 percent. President Eisenhower had 88 \npercent. President Truman had 91 percent. But President Bush today has \n69 percent, the lowest of any President in the history of our country. \nAlmost 30 percent of his circuit court nominees were filibustered and \nlet die by the Senate.\n  The balance of power is delicate--founded in a Constitution that is \nnot easily changed. It is important that those who are sworn to uphold \nthe Constitution, not tread on it without going through the proper \nprocedures of a constitutional amendment. Thwarting the majority by \nrequiring 60 votes on qualified judicial nominees, as the minority did \nlast session, undermines the delicate balance of power.\n  I hope the Senate will come to its senses. There has been a lot \nwritten lately about the Senate, about the process in the Senate being \nbroken. Last week, I talked to a well-known\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\njournalist to discuss his views of what is happening in Washington. I \nasked him a number of questions, but the most difficult was the one \nthat he posed to me: What in the world is the Senate thinking about in \nthe confirmation process? Don't you realize that this is impeding the \nPresident's ability to recruit quality people for Government service?\n\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle are \ncorrect. We are heading for a crisis, but it is not a crisis over \nminority rights. No one on our side of the aisle has even suggested \nthat minority rights should be overrun. The filibuster will remain \nintact. What we are trying to do is get the constitutional process for \nconfirmation of Federal judges back to what has been the tradition in \nthe Senate and what the Constitution envisioned, and that is a 51-vote \nmajority.\n  Never, until the last session of Congress, was the majority will \nthwarted in Federal judge nominees and circuit court most particularly. \nSo the crisis is not over the Senate process; the crisis is how group \ninfluence is turning the Senate into a permanent political \nbattleground. It is unseemly, it is wrong, and it is going to harm the \nquality of our judiciary because we are going to start seeing nominees \nwho are not the best and the brightest, who don't have clear opinions, \nand who are not well-published and renown constitutional experts.\n  I think it was pretty well brought out in an article in the \nWashington Post yesterday, titled ``The Wreck of the U.S. Senate.'' It \nquoted John Breaux, our former Democratic colleague. He said:\n\n       Today, unfortunately, outside groups, public relations \n     firms, and the political consultants who are dedicated to one \n     thing, a perpetual campaign to make one party a winner and \n     the other a loser, has snatched the political process.\n\n  Some years ago, we started on a road downward toward a low common \ndenominator, and I think we are continuing that descent. In the \narticle, I think it mentioned that the point of embarkation for this \ndescent was the nomination process of John Tower, a former Senator who \nhad an incredible record on national defense, who was perhaps the most \nknowledgeable Senator in the Senate on that subject, who was turned \ndown for his Secretary of Defense with innuendo, things that were \ntotally untrue being said about him. Many of my colleagues who are in \nthis body today say it was unconscionable what was done to Senator John \nTower.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry to say I think it has happened again and \nagain. I look at Priscilla Owen, who is one of the best and brightest, \nwho is a judge with judicial temperament, who has shown her brilliance \nfrom the days she graduated from Baylor Law School cum laude, top of \nher class, Baylor Law Review, to making the highest score on the Texas \nbar exam the year she took it. The distortions of this fine judge's \nrecord have been incredible. She has been meticulous in following the \nlaw, in not trying to make law but interpret the law; and I am really \nconcerned that if someone like Priscilla Owen, who is a judge who has \nthe backing of 15 former State bar Presidents--probably most of the \nones who are still alive--Republicans and Democrats, the support of 3 \nDemocrats with whom she served on the Supreme Court, as well as every \nRepublican, the support of the Attorney General of the United States, \nwith whom she served, who actually sought her out for appointment \nbecause he was so impressed with her judicial standards. If someone \nlike that has to take ``brick baths'' for 4 years, how are we going to \nrecruit the very top legal minds in our country, people who have shown \nthemselves time and time again to be excellent at what they do? How are \nwe going to recruit them to submit themselves to this kind of process?\n  The National Abortion Rights Action League was reported by columnist \nBob Novak to have hired an opposition research team not just for \nPriscilla Owen--and they have certainly been active against her--but to \nlook at the records of 30 sitting judges, including Judge Edith Jones \nfrom Houston, and why would they be doing that? Why would the National \nAbortion Rights Action League start looking at sitting judges in our \ncountry today to try to find some way to harm them or distort their \nrecords? Why would they do that? Interestingly, it looks as if the \npeople chosen to be investigated are people who might be potential \nappointees to the United States Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, we are in a downward spiral in this country. Prior to \nholding federally-elected office, I remember watching the Senate debate \nover Clarence Thomas. I thought the Senate did an excellent job of \ndebating Clarence Thomas, bringing out the major points. But the \nhearings on Justice Thomas' nomination were brutal. They were brutal. \nThey were personal. It was something which I am sure was very difficult \nfor him to overcome. I don't think we have to be personal to make \npoints. I don't think we have to distort records. I don't think we \nshould employ innuendo in looking at nominees for our Federal bench.\n  I think the Senate needs to take a very hard look at the processes we \nare using, at the outside influences and the motivations of these \ngroups. When I turn on my television in Washington, I see ads for and \nagainst Priscilla Owen. Priscilla has been silent for four years, \nunwilling to lash out at her opponents and too respectful of Senate \nprocedure to defend herself against empty criticisms. But I am glad she \nhas been defended. I visited with her last week when she was here, and \nthere is a personal toll on the people in this process. She will be a \nfine judge, but was she prepared for the four years of ``brick baths'' \nto which she could not respond? You know, she had several very nice \nopportunities to do something else in these four years, but she is such \na fine person, with such a strong backbone, that she did not want to \nwithdraw her name from consideration so it could be used in the \nPresidential election. She didn't want to leave President Bush \nvulnerable to an attack that her nomination was a mistake and that \nthere was something hidden in her record. She is proud of her record, \nand she knows President Bush is proud of his appointment of her. She \nhas nothing--nothing--upon which she can base any kind of decision to \nleave this nomination process. She is sticking with President Bush \nbecause he made a good decision, and he is sticking with her.\n  But these judges are not people who have put themselves in the arena \nin the same way that partisan politicians do. I don't think she was \nprepared to be attacked on a weekly or monthly basis and have her \nrecord distorted when she submitted herself for this important \nnomination. She was rated unanimously by the American Bar Association \ncommittee that gives its recommendations on judges to the Judiciary \nCommittee as ``well qualified,'' the highest rating that can be given \nby the ABA. It was unanimous. Yet, this fine person has been raked over \nthe coals, has had misrepresentations and distortions made about her. I \nrecently spoke about Priscilla Owen, the person--I shared what kind of \nperson she is. I talked about her service as a Sunday school teacher \nand that she lost her father when she was 10 months old. I talked about \nwhat a lovely person she is.\n  One of my colleagues came to the floor and said, yes, she is a lovely \nperson, but that is not enough; we should not be talking about whether \nshe is lovely or not. Well, I wanted people to see that in addition to \na stellar record, an even-handed disposition, a great legal mind, and \nimpeccable integrity, Priscilla Owen is also a lovely person. An honest \nperson who has even gone against the prevailing view of the Republican \nParty in Texas by suggesting we not elect Supreme Court justices in \nTexas. She has actually written on that subject, saying we should not \ntaint the judiciary with partisan politics. So, I want the record to \nreflect that she is a lovely person--but also a person of principle, of \nstrength, and of profound wisdom. She is as excellent a nominee, with \nas excellent a record as we have ever seen come before the United \nStates Senate.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senate, as a body, should think about how \nwe treat the people who come to submit themselves for public service. \nMany of them do so because they believe this is their calling and they \ndo so with every good intention, including taking large salary cuts. \nPriscilla Owen chose to take a huge salary cut to run for the Supreme \nCourt of Texas instead of continuing as a partner in a major law firm \nin Texas.\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\n  She has shown in every way that she is qualified for this position, \nand I hope we will give her what she deserves after four years of \nwaiting, and that is an up-or-down vote. When we do, she will be \nconfirmed and she will be one of the finest judges sitting on the \nFederal circuit court of appeals today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The next hour \nwill be controlled by the minority.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls the next 60 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak sadly. I have been a \nMember of Congress--now I am in my 53rd year. Two other members have \nserved longer than I. Only 11,752 men and women have served in the \nCongress of the United States since the Republic began in 1789. That is \n217 years. Those two Members were the late Senator Carl Hayden of \nArizona, who was chairman of the Appropriations Committee when I came \nto this body, and Representative Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, who was \na member of the House Appropriations Committee, a man with whom I \nserved. So only two others have served longer in the Congress, meaning \nthe House of Representatives or the Senate or both--only two.\n  I say to Senators and you, Mr. President, can you imagine my feelings \nas I stand now to speak in this Senate, which tomorrow--24 to 36 to 48 \nhours from now--may be changed from what it was when it began, when it \nfirst met in April of 1789 and from what it was when I came here to the \nSenate now going on 47 years ago.\n  I can see Everett Dirksen as he stood at that desk. He was the then-\nminority leader. Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas was the majority leader. \nYes, I can see Norris Cotton. I can see George Aiken. I can see Jack \nJavits. I can see Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, the only woman in the \nSenate at that time, as she sat on the front row of the Republican side \nof the aisle. I can see others, yes.\n  How would they have voted? How would they have voted on this question \nwhich will confront us tomorrow? How would they have voted? I have no \ndoubt as to how they would have voted. I have no doubt as to how they \nwould vote were they here tomorrow. And so my heart is sad that we \nwould even come to a moment such as this. Sad, sad, sad, sad it is.\n  I rise today to make a request of my fellow Senators. In so doing, I \nreach out to all Senators on both sides of the aisle, respectful of the \ninstitution of the Senate and of the opinions of all Senators, \nrespectful of the institution of the Presidency as well. I ask each \nSenator to pause for a moment and reflect seriously on the role of the \nSenate as it has existed now for 217 years, and on the role that it \nwill play in the future if the so-called nuclear option or the so-\ncalled constitutional option--one in the same--is invoked.\n  I implore Senators to step back--step back, step back, step back--\nfrom the precipice. Step back away from the cameras and the \ncommentators and contemplate the circumstances in which we find \nourselves. Things are not right, and the American people know that \nthings are not right. The political discourse in our country has become \nso distorted, so unpleasant, so strident, so unbelievable, it is no \nwonder, then, that people are turning to a place of serenity, a place \nthat they trust to seek the truth. They are turning to their religious \nfaith in a time of ever-quickening contradictory messages transmitted \nby e-mail, by BlackBerrys, by Palm Pilots, answering machines, Tivo, \nvoice mail, satellite TV, cell phones, Fox News, and so many other \nmedia outlets. America is suffering sensory overload.\n  We hear a lot of talk, but we do not know what to make of it. So some \nare turning to a place of quiet, a secure place, a place where they can \nfind peace. They are turning to their faith, their religious faith.\n  Our Nation seems to be at a crossroads. People are seeking answers to \nlegitimate questions about the future of our country, the future of our \njudiciary, and what role religions play in public lives. But it is \ndifficult to find the quiet time to contemplate or to build a consensus \nin response to these profound questions when the venues for serious \ndiscussion of these issues often amount to little more than \n``shoutfests,'' ``hardball,'' and ``Crossfire.''\n  Mr. President, what is next, ``Slash and Burn'' ``Your faith or \nmine?'' Perhaps because so few traditional channels of communication \neven now in the Senate provide a venue for thoughtful discussion, \nAmericans are seeking answers to political and legal questions not in \nCongress or in the courts but through a higher power, through their \nreligious faith.\n  In fact, it is the reaction of some to recent court decisions that \nhas fueled the drive by a sincere minority, perhaps, in this country, \nthe drive, where it might be a majority in this country, the drive \ntoward the pillars of faith.\n  Many American citizens since the early religious people are angered \nand alienated by a belief that their views are not respected in the \npolitical process. They are deeply frustrated, and I am in sympathy \nwith such feelings. I do not agree with many of the decisions that have \ncome from the courts concerning prayer in school or concerning \nprohibitions on the display of religious items in public places.\n  For example, concerning freedom of religion, the establishment clause \nof the first amendment to the Constitution states:\n\n       Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of \n     religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .\n\n  In my humble opinion, too many have not given equal weight to both of \nthese clauses but have focused only on the first clause which prohibits \nthe establishment of religion, with too little attention and at the \nexpense of the second clause, which protects the right of Americans to \nworship as they please. I have always believed that this country was \nfounded by men and women of strong faith whose intent was never to \nsuppress religion but to ensure that our Government favors no single \nreligion over another. This is reflected in Thomas Jefferson's \ninsistence on religious liberty in the founding of our Republic. In his \nVirginia Act for Establishing Religion Freedom, Jefferson wrote that no \nman shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship or \nshall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinion or belief, \nbut all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their \nopinions in matters of religion, and that shall in no wise diminish, \nenlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\n  In 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a case called Engel v. \nVitale. In that case, a group of politically appointed State officials \ndrafted a prayer to be recited every day in the New York public \nschools, but the Supreme Court struck down the law, holding that the \npractice violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. \nWhile I strongly support voluntary prayer in schools, I can understand \nhow the Supreme Court refused to require schoolchildren to recite a \nprayer that was drafted by government bureaucrats to be force-fed to \nevery child. That decision rested on a principle that makes a lot of \nsense to me--namely, that government itself may not seek either to \ndiscourage or to promote religion.\n  In response to a question about the role of religion in society, \nPresident Bush recently stated that he believes religion is a personal \nmatter--and it is a personal matter. It is a personal matter, something \nthat must be revered but not imposed by the Government. The Federal \nGovernment must not prevent us from praying, but it should not tell us \nhow to pray, either. That is a personal matter. That is a personal \ndecision.\n  On May 5, our National Day of Prayer, the President reminded us that \nthis special day was an annual event established in 1952 by an act of \nCongress. Yet, as said, it is part of a broader tradition that reaches \nback to the beginnings of America. So the President reminded us that \nfrom the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock to the launch of the \nAmerican Revolution, the men and women who founded this Nation in \nfreedom relied on prayer to protect and to preserve it. And, of course, \nthe President was right.\n  Thus, we can all understand the outrage of many good people of faith \nwho decry the nature of our popular culture with its overt emphasis on \nsex, violence, profanity, and materialism.\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nThey have every reason to seek some sort of remedy, but these \nfrustrations, great as they are, must not be allowed to destroy crucial \ninstitutional mechanisms in the Senate that have protected minority \nrights for over 200 years and, when necessary, must be available to \ncurtail the power of a power-hungry Executive. Yet this is the outcome \nsought by those who propose to attack the filibuster.\n  At such times as these, the character of the leaders of this country \nis sorely tested. Our best leaders search for ways to avert such \ncrises, not ways to accelerate the plunge toward the brink. Overheated \npartisan rhetoric is always available, of course, but the majority of \nAmericans want a healthy two-party system built on mutual respect, and \nthey want leaders who know how to work together. In fact, Americans \nadmire most leaders who seek to do right, even when doing so does not \nprove politically advantageous in the short term.\n  The so-called nuclear option has been around for a long time. It \ndidn't require a genius to figure that one out. Any cabbagehead who \nfell off of a turnip truck could have done that. That is easy to figure \nout. It has been around since the cloture rule was adopted in 1917--\nyes. I call it the turnip truck option, not the nuclear option, not the \nconstitutional option. I call it the turnip truck option. It could have \nbeen talked about and suggested by someone who fell off a turnip truck \nand got up and dusted himself off and got back on the truck and fell \noff the turnip truck again--so turnip truck No. 2. Let it be that.\n  The nuclear option, as I say, has been around for a long time, but \nprevious leaders of the Senate and previous Presidents, previous White \nHouses, did not seek to foist this turnip truck option upon the Senate \nand upon the right of the American people to have freedom of speech on \nthe part of their representatives in the Senate.\n  So the nuclear option--yes, it has been around for a long time. \nNobody wanted to resort to such a suicidal weapon. But until today, \nwisdom and cooler heads prevailed. In 1841, for example, a Democratic \nminority tried to block a bank bill supported by Henry Clay. Clay \nthreatened to change the Senate's rules to allow the majority--have you \nheard that before?--to allow the majority to stop debate, just like our \ncurrent majority leader. I say this respectfully. But Thomas Hart \nBenton angrily rebuked his colleague, Henry Clay, accusing Clay of \ntrying to stifle the Senate's right to unlimited debate.\n\n  There is no need to tamper with the Senate's right of extended \ndebate. It has been around for a long time. In 1806, the Senate left it \nout of the Senate's rules. In the 1806 version of the Senate's rules, \n``the previous question,'' as it now is still being used in the House, \n``the previous question'' was left out, left behind. It had only been \nused a few times prior to 1806. It was in the 1789 rules of the Senate, \nyes. It was in the rules of the Continental Congress, ``the previous \nquestion.'' It is in the rules of the British Parliament, yes. But the \nSenate, in 1806, decided, on the basis and upon the advisement of the \nVice President of the United States, Aaron Burr, to discard it.\n  The text of the actual cloture rule, rule XXII, was not adopted by \nthe Senate until 1917, the year in which I was born. Today, rule XXII \nallows the Senate to end a debate with 60 votes, what we call invoking \ncloture. I offered that resolution, to provide for a supermajority of \n60 votes to invoke cloture. I believe it was 1975. That was a \nresolution which I introduced. So that is what we have today. But from \n1919 to 1962, the Senate voted on cloture petitions only 27 times and \ninvoked cloture only 5 times.\n  Political invective and efforts to divide America along religious \nlines may distract the electorate for the moment, but if, heaven \nforbid, there should be a true crisis or calamity in our country, the \nAmerican people will stand shoulder to shoulder to support our country. \nWhy can't we, then, their Senators, their leaders, find the courage to \ncome together and solve this problem?\n  Nearly 4 years ago, our Nation was attacked by al-Qaida. In a \nHerculean effort, we came together to help the good people of New York \nand the patriotic citizens who worked at the Pentagon. Why can't we \nfind some of that spirit today in the Senate? The time-honored role of \nthe Senate as protector of minority views is at risk, and those who are \nin the majority today may be in the minority tomorrow. Don't forget \nthat--the worm turns.\n  Our country has serious problems. Baby boomers are facing retirement \nwith sorely diminished savings, savings hard to accrue in the face of \nexploding prices for gasoline, prescription drugs, housing, fuel, \nmedicine and shelter--not frivolous purchases, all essential to \nsurvival. Alarmingly, all are becoming less affordable, even for \naffluent Americans. But beyond them, what is happening to America's \npoor today? Has anybody noticed? Has anybody noticed?\n  The point is that the current uproar over the filibuster serves only \nto underscore the mounting number of real problems--real problems--not \nbeing addressed by this Government of ours. Over 45 million persons in \nour country, some 15 percent of our population, cannot afford health \ninsurance. Is your father included? Is your mother included in that \nnumber? Is your grandfather included? Is your grandmother included in \nthat number?\n  Our veterans lack adequate medical care after they have risked life \nand limb for all of us. Our education system produces 8th graders \nranked 19 out of 38 countries in the world in mathematics and 12th \ngraders ranked 19 out of 21 countries in both math and science. Poverty \nin these United States is rising, with 34 million people or 12.4 \npercent of the population living below the poverty level. Think of it. \nOur infant mortality rate is the second highest of the major \nindustrialized countries of the world.\n  Yet we debate and we seek solutions to none--none--none of these \ncritical problems. Instead, what do we focus on? We focus all energy--\nwe sweat, we perspire, we weaken ourselves, we focus all energy on the \nfrenzy over whether to confirm seven previously considered nominees who \nwere not confirmed by the Senate in the 108th Congress. Doesn't that \nseem kind of odd? Isn't that kind of odd? That seems a bit irrational, \ndoesn't it, I say. Hear me. Maybe it sounds crazy. If I wanted to go \ncrazy, I would do it in Washington because nobody would take notice, at \nleast, so said Irvin S. Cobb. Would anyone apply such thinking to their \nown lives? My colleagues, would you insist on resubmitting the same \nlottery ticket if you knew it was not a winner?\n\n  Unfortunately, many Americans seek as an anecdote to their \nfrustrations with our current system a confrontation--yes, we have to \nhave it--a confrontation over these seven nominees and the preposterous \nsolution of permanently crippling freedom of speech and debate and the \nright of a minority to dissent in the Senate.\n  I ask the Senate, please, I ask the Senate majority leader, please, I \nask the Senator minority leader, please, I ask the White House.\n  I noticed the other day, I believe last Thursday, in the Washington \nPost--I will bring it with me tomorrow--I noticed that the White House \ndid not want to compromise on this matter. The White House did not want \nto compromise. Here we have the executive branch talking to the \nlegislative branch, two of the three branches, two of the three equal \ncoordinate branches of Government, talking through the newspapers that \nit does not want to compromise.\n  I ask the Senate to take a moment today to reflect on the potentially \ndisastrous consequences that could flow from invoking the so-called \nnuclear option. Anger will erupt. It may not be the next day or \nimmediately. One may not see these things come about immediately, but \nin time they will come. They will come, they will come, they will come. \nAnger will erupt in the Chamber and it will be difficult to address \nreal problems.\n  I implore, I beseech, I importune, I beg the Senate to consider how \nposterity will review such a significant occurrence, destroying 217 \nyears of checks and balances established so carefully by the Founding \nFathers 219 years ago. Will the light of posterity shine favorably on \nthe shattering of Senate precedent solely to confirm these seven \nnominees, nominees whose names have been before the Senate for \nconsideration in the previous administration? Won't this maneuver be \nviewed for what it really is, a misguided attempt to strong-arm the \nSenate for a political purpose driven by\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nanger and raw ambition and lust for power? Will that be remembered as a \nprofile in courage?\n  What has happened to the quality of leadership in this country that \nwill allow us even to consider provoking a constitutional crisis of \nsuch magnitude?\n  I tell you, I am deeply, deeply troubled. I am almost sick about it, \nthe frustration that I have had over thinking about this, this awful \nthing that is about to happen, unless we draw back.\n  Have we lost our ability to look toward the larger good? Even a child \nis known by his doings, whether his work be pure and whether it be \nright. That is according to Proverbs, 20th chapter, 11th verse.\n  I ask the Senate to come together and to work toward a compromise. \nYes, the Washington Post last Thursday said the White House doesn't \nwant a compromise. But I beg the Senate, I beg those on the other side \nof the aisle and those on my side of the aisle to reach a compromise, \nwork toward a compromise.\n  What the current majority seeks to employ against the minority today \ncan be turned against the majority tomorrow.\n  John Adams once said:\n\n       Even mankind will, in time, discover that unbridled \n     majorities are as tyrannical and cruel as unlimited despots.\n\n  Does not history prove as much? I ask the Senate to seek a \ncompromise. Where is the gentle art of compromise? Edmund Burke once \nstated:\n\n       All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, \n     every virtue and every prudent act, is founded on compromise \n     and barter.\n\n  Let the Senate step away from this abyss and see the wisdom of coming \ntogether to preserve the checks and balances. May we stop and draw back \nand remember that we are all Americans before we permanently damage \nthis institution, the Senate of the United States, and in doing so, \npermanently damage the Constitution as we permanently damage this \ninstitution, the Senate of the United States, and the country we love.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority controls 23 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my friends and colleagues, I have not been \nhere as long as Senator Byrd, and no one fully understands the Senate \nas well as Senator Byrd, but I have been here for over three decades. \nThis is the single most significant vote any one of us will cast in my \n32 years in the Senate. I suspect the Senator would agree with that.\n  We should make no mistake. This nuclear option is ultimately an \nexample of the arrogance of power. It is a fundamental power grab by \nthe majority party, propelled by its extreme right and designed to \nchange the reading of the Constitution, particularly as it relates to \nindividual rights and property rights. It is nothing more or nothing \nless. Let me take a few moments to explain that.\n  Folks who want to see this change want to eliminate one of the \nprocedural mechanisms designed for the express purpose of guaranteeing \nindividual rights, and they also have a consequence, and would \nundermine the protections of a minority point of view in the heat of \nmajority excess. We have been through these periods before in American \nhistory but never, to the best of my knowledge, has any party been so \nbold as to fundamentally attempt to change the structure of this body.\n\n  Why else would the majority party attempt one of the most fundamental \nchanges in the 216-year history of this Senate on the grounds that they \nare being denied ten of 218 Federal judges, three of whom have stepped \ndown? What shortsightedness, and what a price history will exact on \nthose who support this radical move.\n  It is important we state frankly, if for no other reason than the \nhistorical record, why this is being done. The extreme right of the \nRepublican Party is attempting to hijack the Federal courts by \nemasculating the courts' independence and changing one of the unique \nfoundations of the Senate; that is, the requirement for the protection \nof the right of individual Senators to guarantee the independence of \nthe Federal Judiciary.\n  This is being done in the name of fairness? Quite frankly, it is the \nultimate act of unfairness to alter the unique responsibility of the \nSenate and to do so by breaking the very rules of the Senate.\n  Mark my words, what is at stake here is not the politics of 2005, but \nthe Federal Judiciary in the country in the year 2025. This is the \nsingle most significant vote, as I said earlier, that I will have cast \nin my 32 years in the Senate. The extreme Republican right has made \nFederal appellate Judge Douglas Ginsburg's ``Constitution in Exile'' \nframework their top priority.\n  It is their purpose to reshape the Federal courts so as to guarantee \na reading of the Constitution consistent with Judge Ginsburg's radical \nviews of the fifth amendment's taking clause, the nondelegation \ndoctrine, the 11th amendment, and the 10th amendment. I suspect some \nlistening to me and some of the press will think I am exaggerating. I \nrespectfully suggest they read Judge Ginsburg's ideas about the \n``Constitution in Exile.'' Read it and understand what is at work here.\n  If anyone doubts what I am saying, I suggest you ask yourself the \nrhetorical question, Why, for the first time since 1789, is the \nRepublican-controlled Senate attempting to change the rule of unlimited \ndebate, eliminate it, as it relates to Federal judges for the circuit \ncourt or the Supreme Court?\n  If you doubt what I said, please read what Judge Ginsburg has written \nand listen to what Michael Greve of the American Enterprise Institute \nhas said:\n\n       I think what is really needed here is a fundamental \n     intellectual assault on the entire New Deal edifice. We want \n     to withdraw judicial support for the entire modern welfare \n     state.\n\n  Read: Social Security, workmen's comp. Read: National Labor Relations \nBoard. Read: FDA. Read: What all the byproduct of that shift in \nconstitutional philosophy that took place in the 1930s meant.\n  We are going to hear more about what I characterize as radical view--\nmaybe it is unfair to say radical--a fundamental view and what, at the \nleast, must be characterized as a stark departure from current \nconstitutional jurisprudence. Click on to American Enterprise Institute \nWeb site www.aei.org. Read what they say. Read what the purpose is. It \nis not about seeking a conservative court or placing conservative \nJustices on the bench. The courts are already conservative.\n  Seven of the nine Supreme Court Justices appointed by Republican \nPresidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Bush 1--seven of nine. Ten of 13 \nFederal circuit courts of appeal dominated by Republican appointees, \nappointed by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush 1, and Bush 2; 58 \npercent of the circuit court judges appointed by Presidents Nixon, \nFord, Reagan, Bush 1, or Bush 2. No, my friends and colleagues, this is \nnot about building a conservative court. We already have a conservative \ncourt. This is about guaranteeing a Supreme Court made up of men and \nwomen such as those who sat on the Court in 1910 and 1920. Those who \nbelieve, as Justice Janice Rogers Brown of California does, that the \nConstitution has been in exile since the New Deal.\n  My friends and colleagues, the nuclear option is not an isolated \ninstance. It is part of a broader plan to pack the court with \nfundamentalist judges and to cower existing conservative judges to toe \nthe extreme party line.\n  You all heard what Tom DeLay said after the Federal courts refused to \nbend to the whip of the radical right in the Schiavo case. Mr. DeLay \ndeclared: ``The time will come for men responsible for this to answer \nfor their behavior.''\n  Even current conservative Supreme Court Justices are looking over \ntheir shoulder, with one extremist recalling the despicable slogan of \nJoseph Stalin--and I am not making this up--in reference to a Reagan \nRepublican appointee, Justice Kennedy, when he said: ``No man, no \nproblem''--absent his presence, we have no problem.\n  Let me remind you, as I said, Justice Kennedy was appointed by \nPresident Reagan.\n  Have they never heard of the independence of the judiciary--as \nfundamental a part of our constitutional\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nsystem of checks and balances as there is today; which is literally the \nenvy of the entire world, and the fear of the extremist part of the \nworld? An independent judiciary is their greatest fear.\n  Why are radicals focusing on the court? Well, first of all, it is \ntheir time to be in absolute political control. It is like, why did \nWilly Sutton rob banks? He said: Because that is where the money is. \nWhy try it now--for the first time in history--to eliminate extended \ndebate? Well, because they control every lever of the Federal \nGovernment. That is the very reason why we have the filibuster rule. So \nwhen one party, when one interest controls all levers of Government, \none man or one woman can stand on the floor of the Senate and resist, \nif need be, the passions of the moment.\n  But there is a second reason why they are focusing on the courts. \nThat is because they have been unable to get their agenda passed \nthrough the legislative bodies. Think about it. With all the talk about \nhow they represent the majority of the American people, none of their \nagenda has passed as it relates to the fifth amendment, as it relates \nto zoning laws, as it relates to the ability of Federal agencies, such \nas the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, to do their jobs.\n  Read what they write when they write about the nondelegation \ndoctrine. That simply means, we in the Congress, as they read the \nConstitution, cannot delegate to the Environmental Protection Agency \nthe authority to set limits on how much of a percentage of carcinogens \ncan be admitted into the air or admitted into the water. They insist \nthat we, the Senate, have to vote on every one of those rules, that we, \nthe Senate and the House, with the ability of the President to veto, \nwould have to vote on any and all drugs that are approved or not \napproved.\n  If you think I am exaggerating, look at these Web sites. These are \nnot a bunch of wackos. These are a bunch of very bright, very smart, \nvery well-educated intellectuals who see these Federal restraints as a \nrestraint upon competition, a restraint upon growth, a restraint upon \nthe powerful.\n  The American people see what is going on. They are too smart, and \nthey are too practical. They might not know the meaning of the \nnondelegation doctrine, they might not know the clause of the fifth \namendment relating to property, they may not know the meaning of the \ntenth and eleventh amendments as interpreted by Judge Ginsburg and \nothers, but they know that the strength of our country lies in common \nsense and our common pragmatism, which is antithetical to the poisons \nof the extremes on either side.\n  The American people will soon learn that Justice Janice Rogers \nBrown--one of the nominees who we are not allowing to be confirmed, one \nof the ostensible reasons for this nuclear option being employed--has \ndecried the Supreme Court's ``socialist revolution of 1937.'' Read \nSocial Security. Read what they write and listen to what they say. The \nvery year that a 5-to-4 Court upheld the constitutionality of Social \nSecurity against a strong challenge--1937--Social Security almost \nfailed by one vote.\n  It was challenged in the Supreme Court as being confiscatory. People \nargued then that a Government has no right to demand that everyone pay \ninto the system, no right to demand that every employer pay into the \nsystem. Some of you may agree with that. It is a legitimate argument, \nbut one rejected by the Supreme Court in 1937, that Justice Brown \nrefers to as the ``socialist revolution of 1937.''\n  If it had not been for some of the things they had already done, \nnobody would believe what I am saying here. These guys mean what they \nsay. The American people are going to soon learn that one of the \nleaders of the constitutional exile school, the group that wants to \nreinstate the Constitution as it existed in 1920, said of another \nfilibustered judge, William Pryor that ``Pryor is the key to this \npuzzle. There's nobody like him. I think he's sensational. He gets \nalmost all of it.''\n  That is the reason why I oppose him. He gets all of it. And you are \nabout to get all of it if they prevail. We will not have to debate \nabout Social Security on this floor.\n  So the radical right makes its power play now when they control all \npolitical centers of power, however temporary. The radical push through \nthe nuclear option and then pack the courts with unimpeded judges who, \nby current estimations, will serve an average of 25 years. The right is \nfocused on packing the courts because their agenda is so radical that \nthey are unwilling to come directly to you, the American people, and \ntell you what they intend.\n  Without the filibuster, President Bush will send over more and more \njudges of this nature, with perhaps three or four Supreme Court \nnominations. And there will be nothing--nothing--that any moderate \nRepublican friends and I will be able to do about it.\n\n  Judges who will influence the rights of average Americans: The \nability to sue your HMO that denies you your rights; the ability to \nkeep strip clubs out of your neighborhood--because they make zoning \nlaws unconstitutional--without you paying to keep the person from \nbuilding; the ability to protect the land your kids play on, the water \nthey drink, the air they breathe, and the privacy of your family in \nyour own home.\n  Remember, many of my colleagues say there is no such thing as a right \nto privacy in any iteration under the Constitution of the United States \nof America. Fortunately, we have had a majority of judges who disagreed \nwith that over the past 70 years. But hang on, folks. The fight over \njudges, at bottom, is not about abortion and not about God, it is about \ngiving greater power to the already powerful. The fight is about \nmaintaining our civil rights protections, about workplace safety and \nworker protections, about effective oversight of financial markets, and \nprotecting against insider trading. It is about Social Security. What \nis really at stake in this debate is, point blank, the shape of our \nconstitutional system for the next generation.\n  The nuclear option is a twofer. It excises, friends, our courts and, \nat the same time, emasculates the Senate. Put simply, the nuclear \noption would transform the Senate from the so-called cooling saucer our \nFounding Fathers talked about to cool the passions of the day to a pure \nmajoritarian body like a Parliament. We have heard a lot in recent \nweeks about the rights of the majority and obstructionism. But the \nSenate is not meant to be a place of pure majoritarianism.\n  Is majority rule what you really want? Do my Republican colleagues \nreally want majority rule in this Senate? Let me remind you, 44 of us \nDemocrats represent 161 million people. One hundred sixty-one million \nAmericans voted for these 44 Democrats. Do you know how many Americans \nvoted for the 55 of you? One hundred thirty-one million. If this were \nabout pure majorities, my party represents more people in America than \nthe Republican Party does. But that is not what it is about. Wyoming, \nthe home State of the Vice President, the President of this body, gets \none Senator for every 246,000 citizens; California, gets one Senator \nfor 17 million Americans. More Americans voted for Vice President Gore \nthan they did Governor Bush. By majoritarian logic, Vice President Gore \nwon the election.\n  Republicans control the Senate, and they have decided they are going \nto change the rule. At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a \nnominee or a bill, it is about compromise and moderation. That is why \nthe Founders put unlimited debate in. When you have to--and I have \nnever conducted a filibuster--but if I did, the purpose would be that \nyou have to deal with me as one Senator. It does not mean I get my way. \nIt means you may have to compromise. You may have to see my side of the \nargument. That is what it is about, engendering compromise and \nmoderation.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear option extinguishes the power of \nIndependents and moderates in this Senate. That is it. They are done. \nModerates are important only if you need to get 60 votes to satisfy \ncloture. They are much less important if you need only 50 votes. I \nunderstand the frustration of our Republican colleagues. I have been \nhere 32 years, most of the time in the majority. Whenever you are in \nthe majority, it is frustrating to see the other side block a bill or a \nnominee you support. I have walked in your shoes, and I get it.\n  I get it so much that what brought me to the Senate was the fight for \ncivil\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nrights. My State, to its great shame, was segregated by law, was a \nslave State. I came here to fight it. But even I understood, with all \nthe passion I felt as a 29-year-old kid running for the Senate, the \npurpose--the purpose--of extended debate. Getting rid of the filibuster \nhas long-term consequences. If there is one thing I have learned in my \nyears here, once you change the rules and surrender the Senate's \ninstitutional power, you never get it back. And we are about to break \nthe rules to change the rules.\n  I do not want to hear about ``fair play'' from my friends. Under our \nrules, you are required to get 2/3 of the votes to change the rules. \nWatch what happens when the majority leader stands up and says to the \nVice President--if we go forward with this--he calls the question. One \nof us, I expect our leader, on the Democratic side will stand up and \nsay: Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is this parliamentarily \nappropriate? In every other case since I have been here, for 32 years, \nthe Presiding Officer leans down to the Parliamentarian and says: What \nis the rule, Mr. Parliamentarian? The Parliamentarian turns and tells \nthem.\n  Hold your breath, Parliamentarian. He is not going to look to you \nbecause he knows what you would say. He would say: This is not \nparliamentarily appropriate. You cannot change the Senate rules by a \npure majority vote.\n  So if any of you think I am exaggerating, watch on television, watch \nwhen this happens, and watch the Vice President ignore--he is not \nrequired to look to an unelected officer, but that has been the \npractice for 218 years. He will not look down and say: What is the \nruling? He will make the ruling, which is a lie, a lie about the rule.\n  Isn't what is really going on here that the majority does not want to \nhear what others have to say, even if it is the truth? Senator \nMoynihan, my good friend who I served with for years, said: You are \nentitled to your own opinion but not your own facts.\n  The nuclear option abandons America's sense of fair play. It is the \none thing this country stands for: Not tilting the playing field on the \nside of those who control and own the field.\n  I say to my friends on the Republican side: You may own the field \nright now, but you won't own it forever. I pray God when the Democrats \ntake back control, we don't make the kind of naked power grab you are \ndoing. But I am afraid you will teach my new colleagues the wrong \nlessons.\n  We are the only Senate in the Senate as temporary custodians of the \nSenate. The Senate will go on. Mark my words, history will judge this \nRepublican majority harshly, if it makes this catastrophic move.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nstatement as written be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Fight for Our Future: The Courts, the United States Senate, and the \n                            American People\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Make no mistake, my friends and colleagues, the ``nuclear \n     option'' is the ultimate example of the arrogance of power. \n     It is a fundamental power grab by the Republican Party \n     propelled by its extreme right and designed to change the \n     reading of the Constitution, particularly as it relates to \n     individual rights and property rights\n       Nothing more, nothing less.\n       It is the elimination of one of the procedural mechanisms \n     designed for the express purpose of guaranteeing individual \n     rights and the protections of a minority point of view in the \n     heat of majority excess.\n       Why else would the majority party attempt such a \n     fundamental change in the 216 year history of this Senate on \n     the grounds that they are being denied seven of 218 federal \n     judges?\n       What shortsightedness and what a price history will exact \n     on those who support this radical move.\n       Mr. President, we should state frankly, if for no other \n     reason than an historical record, why this is being done. The \n     extreme right of the Republican Party is attempting to hijack \n     the federal courts by emasculating the courts' independence \n     and changing one of the unique foundations of the United \n     States Senate--the requirement for the protection of the \n     right of individual Senators to guarantee the independence of \n     the federal judiciary.\n       This is being done in the name of fairness. But it is the \n     ultimate act of unfairness to alter the unique responsibility \n     of the United States Senate and to do so by breaking the very \n     rules of the United States Senate.\n       Mark my words. What is at stake here is not the politics of \n     2005, but the federal judiciary and the United States Senate \n     of 2025.\n       This is the single most significant vote that will be cast \n     in my 32-year tenure in the United States Senate.\n\n\n                        the future of our courts\n\n       The extreme Republican Right has made Judge Douglas \n     Ginsberg's ``Constitution in Exile'' framework their top \n     priority. It is their extreme purpose to reshape the federal \n     courts so as to guarantee a reading of the Constitution \n     consistent with Judge Ginsberg's radical views of the 5th \n     Amendment Takings Clause, the non-delegation doctrine, the \n     11th Amendment, and the 10th Amendment.\n       If you doubt what I say then ask yourself the following \n     rhetorical question: Why for the first time since 1789 is the \n     Republican controlled United States Senate attempting to do \n     this?\n       If you doubt what I say, please read what Judge Ginsberg \n     has written. And listen to what Michael Greve, of the \n     American Enterprise Institute has said: ``what is really \n     needed here is a fundamental intellectual assault on the \n     entire New Deal edifice. We want to withdraw judicial support \n     for the entire modern welfare state.''\n       If you want to hear more about what I am characterizing as \n     the radical view and what must certainly be characterized as \n     a stark departure from current constitutional law, click on \n     the American Enterprise Institute's website www.aei.org.\n       This is not about seeking a conservative court and placing \n     conservative judges on the bench.\n       The courts are already conservative: 7 of 9 current Supreme \n     Court Justices, appointed by Republican Presidents Nixon, \n     Ford, Reagan, Bush I; 10 of 13 federal circuit courts \n     dominated by Republican appointees, appointed by Presidents \n     Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush I, and Bush II; and 58 percent of \n     all circuit court judges, appointed by Presidents Nixon, \n     Ford, Reagan, Bush I and Bush II.\n       No, friends and colleagues, this is not about building \n     conservative courts. We already have them. This is about a \n     Supreme Court made up of men and women like those who sat on \n     the Court in 1910, 1920.\n       My friends and colleagues, the nuclear option is not an \n     isolated instance. It's part of a broader plan to pack the \n     courts with fundamentalist judges and to cower existing \n     conservative judges to toe the party line.\n       You all heard what Tom DeLay said after the federal courts \n     refused to bend to the whip of the Radical Right in the \n     Schiavo Case. DeLay declared:\n       The time will come for the men responsible for this to \n     answer for their behavior.\n       Even current conservative Supreme Court Justices are \n     looking over their shoulders. One extremist has referred to \n     Justice Kennedy by recalling a despicable slogan attributed \n     to Joseph Stalin. When Stalin encountered a problem with an \n     individual, he would simply say ``no man, no problem.'' The \n     extreme right is adapting Stalin's adage in their efforts to \n     remove sitting judges: ``no judge, no problem.''\n       And let me remind you, Kennedy was appointed by President \n     Reagan.\n       Have these people never heard of the independence of the \n     judiciary--as fundamental a part our constitutional system of \n     checks and balances as there is; the envy of the world; the \n     system that emerging democracies are clamoring to copy?\n       You must ask yourself why the fundamentalist Republican \n     right is focusing so clearly on the federal courts? I'll tell \n     you why.\n       Because they are unable to seek their agenda through the \n     political branches of our government.\n       That's why they are trying to move their agenda by \n     fundamentally changing the courts.\n       I believe that the American people already intuitively know \n     what's going on; they're too smart; they're too practical. \n     The strength of our country lies in our common sense and our \n     pragmatism, which is antithetical to the ideological purity \n     of the fundamentalist Republican Right.\n       The American people will soon learn that Janice Rogers \n     Brown has decried the Supreme Court's ``socialist revolution \n     of 1937,'' the very year that a 5-4 Court upheld the \n     constitutionality of Social Security against strong \n     challenges.\n       The American people will soon learn that one of the leaders \n     of the ``Constitution in Exile'' school--the group that wants \n     to reinstate the Constitution as it existed in the 1920s--\n     said that another of the filibustered judges--William Pryor--\n     was ``key to this puzzle; there's nobody like him. I think \n     he's sensational. He gets almost all of it.''\n       These are judges who will serve on the federal circuit \n     courts of appeal for a quarter of a century. And no general \n     election of Congress and the President will be able to change \n     it.\n       And you may ask yourself why the focus on the circuit \n     courts? I'll tell you why.\n       Today, it is more than four times as difficult to get an \n     opportunity to argue your appeal before the Supreme Court as \n     it was 20 years ago. Today, the Supreme Court reviews less \n     than two tenths of one percent of the caseload of the appeals \n     courts.\n       Without the filibuster, President Bush will be able to put \n     on the bench judges who would reinstitute the ``Constitution \n     in Exile.'' I suggest that it is these judges who are the \n     ones who should be exiled.\n       And if the actuarial tables comply there is the possibility \n     that President Bush will possibly nominate as many as 3-4 \n     Supreme Court Justices--and there will be little that\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\n     my moderate Republican friends and I will be able to do about \n     it.\n       The consequences for average Americans will be significant. \n     They will include the ability to sue when HMOs deny you your \n     rights; the ability to keep strip clubs out of your family's \n     neighborhood; the ability to protect from environmental \n     degradation the land your kids play on, the purity of the \n     water they drink, the cleanliness of the air they breathe; \n     and the ability to preserve the privacy that you and your \n     family expect the Constitution to provide.\n       The fight over judges, at bottom, is not about abortion and \n     about God; it is about giving greater power to the already \n     powerful.\n\n\n                        The Future of the Senate\n\n       The exercise of the nuclear option also has another \n     fundamental impact on the government--it will transform the \n     Congress from a bifurcated legislature where political \n     parties were never intended to rule supreme into a quasi-\n     parliamentary system where a single party will dominate.\n       There would have been no Constitution were it not for the \n     Connecticut Compromise--that is the compromise that \n     guaranteed states two U.S. Senators regardless of the state's \n     population.\n       The Connecticut Compromise was also done expressly to \n     guarantee the right of the small states, as well as less \n     powerful interests, as well as individuals, to be protected \n     from temporary passion and excesses of the moment--whether \n     borne out of a demagogic appeal or the overwhelming supremacy \n     of a political party.\n       The guarantee of unlimited debate in the United States \n     Senate assured not that the minority would be able to get its \n     way but that the minority would be able to generate a \n     compromise that would keep them from being emasculated. And \n     this included ensuring the independence of the federal \n     judiciary.\n       We have heard a lot in recent weeks about the rights of the \n     majority. But the Senate was not meant to be a place of pure \n     majoritarianism. Is majority rule what this is about? Do my \n     Republican colleagues really want majority rule?\n       We 44 Democrats represent 161 million people in the Senate; \n     the 55 Republicans only 131 million. By majoritarian logic, \n     the Democrats would be in the majority in the Senate.\n       Wyoming, the home state of the President of this Body, gets \n     1 Senator for every 246,891 citizens. By that measure, \n     California is entitled to 137 U.S. Senators.\n       More Americans voted for Vice President Gore in 2000 than \n     for George W. Bush. By majoritarian logic, Gore won that \n     election.\n       But Republicans control the Senate, California only gets 2 \n     Senators, and Vice President Gore lost the 2000 election for \n     the same reason--under our constitutional system, a majority \n     doesn't always get what it wants; that's the system the \n     Founders created.\n       At its core, the filibuster is not about stopping a nominee \n     or a bill, it's about compromise and moderation.\n       The nuclear option extinguishes the power of independents \n     and moderates in the Senate. That's it, they're done. \n     Moderates are important if you need to get to 60 votes to \n     satisfy cloture; they are much less so if you only need 50 \n     votes.\n       Let's set the historical record straight. Never has the \n     Senate provided for a certainty that 51 votes could put \n     someone on the bench or pass legislation.\n       The facts are these. There was no ability to limit debate \n     until 1917. And then the explicit decision was made to limit \n     debate on legislation if 2/3 of the Senators present and \n     accounted for supported cloture. Even then, the Senate \n     rejected a similar limitation on executive nominations, \n     including nominees to the federal bench. It wasn't until 1949 \n     that the new cloture rule also applied to nominations.\n       The question at present is, will the Senate actually aid \n     and abet in the erosion of its Article I power by conceding \n     to another branch greater influence over who ends up on our \n     courts? As Senator Stennis once said to me in the face of a \n     particularly audacious claim by President Nixon: ``Are we the \n     President's men or the Senate's?''\n       My friends on the other side of the aisle like to focus on \n     the text of the Constitution. Tell me: Where does it state \n     that it is necessary for each bill or each nominee that comes \n     before us to receive a simple majority vote? Where does it \n     state that the President should always get his first choice \n     to fill a vacancy?\n\n\n               Fundamental Fairness--Playing by the Rules\n\n       The nuclear option makes a mockery of the Senate rules. \n     You'll notice that when the nuclear option is triggered, the \n     Presiding Officer will refuse to seek the advice of the \n     Parliamentarian, his own expert. He won't ask because he \n     doesn't want to hear the answer.\n       Isn't that what's really going on here? The majority \n     doesn't want to hear what others have to say, even if it's \n     the truth. Well, as Senator Moynihan used to say, ``You're \n     entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.''\n       The nuclear option abandons our American sense of fair \n     play. If there is one thing this country stands for it's fair \n     play--not tilting the playing field in favor of one side or \n     the other, not changing the rules unilaterally.\n       We play by the rules, and win or lose by the rules. That is \n     a quintessentially American trait, and it is eviscerated by \n     the ``nuclear option.''\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The Senate stands at the precipice of a truly historic \n     mistake. We are about to act on a matter that will influence \n     our country's history for the foreseeable future.\n       We are only the Senate's temporary custodians--our careers \n     in the Senate will one day end--but the Senate will go on. \n     Over the course of the next hours and days, we must be \n     Senators first, and Republicans and Democrats second.\n       We must think of the rights and liberties of the American \n     people, not just for today but for the rest of our lives.\n       Again, ask yourself why is this extreme change being put \n     forward over 7 out of 218 federal judges?\n       As I said earlier, history will judge this Republican \n     Majority harshly if it succeeds in changing the way the \n     Founders intended the Senate to behave, emasculating it into \n     a parliament governed by a single party's ideology and unable \n     to be thrown out be a vote of no-confidence.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the last several days we have debated \nsome of the most important issues that most of the Members will ever \nface. Should the same powerful tool, such as the filibuster, that we \nhave long used in the legislative process be part of the confirmation \nprocess to defeat a President's judicial nominees? That is a big \nquestion. Can the Senate's role of advice and consent regarding \njudicial nominations be exercised equally by either the majority or \nminority of Senators? The answer to each of these questions is no.\n  America's Founders designed the Senate without the ability to \nfilibuster anything at all. The filibuster became available later but \nwas restricted to the legislative process which we control. It was not \npart of the appointment process which the President controls. Allowing \na minority of Senators to capture this body's role of advice and \nconsent will allow that minority to hijack the President's power to \nappoint judges. I admit that we have control of the Executive Calendar, \nbut the President has rights in that calendar, too. We cannot hijack \nthe President's power to appoint judges. Doing so distorts the balance \nthe Constitution establishes and mandates. That situation should not \nstand.\n  I urge my friends, Senators from the minority, to abandon their \ndestructive course and return to the tradition we followed for more \nthan two centuries. The Senate, acting through a majority, checks the \nPresident's power to appoint by voting on whether to consent to those \nappointments. You will notice it is the Senate--not the minority--who \ndoes that check. Any Senator may vote against any nominee for any \nreason, but we must vote. We followed that tradition for more than 200 \nyears, and we should recommit ourselves to it now.\n  If the minority insists on distorting the Constitution's balance and \nrejecting Senate tradition, then I believe the Senate must firmly \nreestablish that tradition by exercising our constitutional authority \nto determine our own rules and procedures. If the minority will not \nexercise the same self-restraint this body exercised for the last two \ncenturies, then I believe the Senate must vote to return formally to \nour tradition. It is surely not a sign of our political culture that we \nhave to enforce by majority vote what we once offered by principle and \nself-restraint. But the Constitution's balance is too important to \nallow a minority to erode our principles and past practices.\n  The problem and the solution each have their own frame of reference \ndrawn from the Constitution. The frame of reference for evaluating \nthese judicial filibusters is the separation of powers into three \nbranches. The frame of reference for the solution to this judicial \nfilibuster crisis is the Constitution's grant of authority for us, the \nSenate, to determine how we want to conduct Senate business.\n  Let me first address the judicial filibuster crisis through the lens, \nthe frame of reference, of the separation of powers. In Federalist No. \n47, James Madison wrote of the separation of powers that ``no political \ntruth is certainly of greater intrinsic value or\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nstamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty.'' \nTwo points are particularly important here. First, the separation of \npowers is exclusive. The powers assigned to one branch are denied to \nthe others.\n  Like our Federal charter, each State constitution also divides the \nlegislative, executive, and judicial branches into separate branches. \nMore than two-thirds of them, however, go even further and make the \nexclusive nature of separation explicit. They affirmatively prohibit \neach branch from exercising the powers assigned to the others. The \nseparation of powers is that important.\n\n  While each branch may not exercise the powers given to the others, we \ncan check the powers given to the others. A check on another branch's \npower is a safeguard. It is not a separate coequal power. It is neither \nseparate from nor as significant as the power being checked. Nomination \nand appointment of judges is described in article II which outlines the \nPresident's power. Not a word is found in article I which describes our \npowers.\n  The second point about the separation of powers is equally important. \nJust as the powers belong to the branches, checks and balances are \nexercised by the branches. The President, to whom the Constitution \ngives executive power, can check Congress's legislative power through \nthe veto that he has a right to exercise. He cannot delegate it to \nsomeone else in the executive branch. Similarly, the Constitution \nassigns the role of advice and consent to the Senate, not just to the \nminority, to the Senate.\n  The question raised by the current filibuster campaign, however, is \nthis: What is the Senate, the minority or the majority? I do not want \nto get too technical, but these are basic civics principles that apply \nto legislative bodies everywhere that you can find in most high school \ntextbooks. We must have what we call a quorum, a minimum number of \nSenators present to be open for business. Senate rule VI defines a \nquorum as a ``majority of Senators duly chosen and sworn.'' Today that \nmeans 51 Senators. Unless the Constitution that created this body says \notherwise, when a majority of those Senators acts, it is the Senate \nitself that acts.\n  This is no different from the Supreme Court. When a majority of its \nmembers votes the same way, we say it is the Court that has decided the \ncase.\n  Only the Senate itself can exercise its constitutional role of advice \nand consent on the President's judicial nominations. That is, only a \nmajority of Senators can exercise that role. I make this point so \nstrongly because the minority is claiming the right to exercise this \nbody's role of advice and consent strictly by the minority.\n  Last Thursday, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, on the \nSenate floor, charged that ``the Republican leadership is determined to \ndeny the minority the right to hold the executive responsible for \nlifetime appointments to the judiciary.''\n  He was not the first to make this argument. We have heard for a long \ntime now from many Senators who support these filibusters that the \nSenate rejects a nomination not when the majority has voted it down but \nwhen the minority has prevented a final confirmation vote, even though \nthere is a bipartisan majority for the nominee. I should say in this \ncase nominees.\n  The minority does not check the President's power. The Senate itself \ndoes. And that means a majority of Senators checks the President's \npower. When the minority has prevented a confirmation vote, the \nminority has prevented the Senate from exercising its role of advice \nand consent altogether. I do not speak primarily of the majority or \nminority party. I speak of the numerical majority that is required in \norder for the Senate to act at all. The vast majority of judicial \nnominations are confirmed either by unanimous consent or by \noverwhelming margins on rollcall votes. The number of truly \ncontroversial, hotly contested judicial nominations is small. Still at \nleast 18 Members of this body have voted against a judicial nomination \nof their own party.\n  If the case against some of these nominees is so strong--and we have \nheard a great hue and cry about how some of them are out of some sort \nof mainstream--then Senators may do so again. But the prospect of being \non the losing side of a small number of confirmation votes does not \njustify turning these fundamental principles of separation of powers \ninside out. It does not justify the minority hijacking the Senate's \nrole of advice and consent so it can hijack the President's power to \nappoint judges.\n  Yet that is indeed what these filibusters are attempting to do. \nDefeating a vote to end debate can serve a laudable, temporary purpose \nof ensuring full and vigorous debate. That full and vigorous debate can \nhelp the Senate make a more informed confirmation decision. But these \nrecent unprecedented, leader-led filibusters defeat all votes to end \ndebate for the purpose of preventing confirmation of these nominations \naltogether. Doing so turns the separation of powers on its head.\n  Mr. President, the frame of reference, the organizing principle for \nevaluating these judicial filibusters, is the separation of powers. I \nthink the case is compelling that the judicial filibuster campaign \nunderway today, by which the minority tries to commandeer the Senate's \nrole of advice and consent so they can wrongly attempt to trump the \nPresident's constitutional authority to appoint judges, violates that \nprinciple and cannot be allowed to continue.\n  If the minority will not relent and return to the tradition by which \nthe Senate, through a majority, exercises its role of advice and \nconsent, then I believe the majority must act to restore that \ntradition. The frame of reference for solving this judicial filibuster \ncrisis is the Senate's constitutional authority to determine our own \nrules and procedures.\n  Just as the Constitution establishes a system of self-government for \nthe Nation, it establishes a system of self-government for the Senate. \nSubject always to the Constitution itself, we choose for ourselves how \nwe want to do business. It may not always be nice, neat, and orderly, \nbut it is up to us to decide. One of the cliches that the judicial \nfilibuster proponents dreamed up is the cry that any solution to this \ncrisis would require ``breaking the rules to change the rules.'' \nPresumably, that catchy little phrase refers to the fact that invoking \ncloture on an amendment to the text of our written rules requires not \njust 60 votes but two-thirds of the Senators present and voting. This \nargument is, I suppose, intended to make people think our written rules \nare the only guide for how the Senate operates.\n  Most of our citizens may not know one way or the other. Nobody can \nfault them for not being schooled in the peculiar art of Senate \nprocedure. But my fellow Senators certainly know the answer.\n  Every Senator in this body knows that the Standing Rules of the \nSenate are only one of several things that guide how we do business. \nThe solution to the judicial filibuster crisis which the majority \nleader, Dr. Frist, will pursue will neither break the rules nor change \nthe rules. The Standing Rules of the Senate will read the same next \nweek as they did last week. Instead, the solution we will utilize is a \nparliamentary ruling by the Presiding Officer, something that is at \nleast as important as our written rules for the way we conduct our day-\nto-day business.\n  When a Senator asks the question of procedure or raises a point of \norder, the Presiding Officer's answer to that question, or his ruling \non that point of order, becomes a precedent for the Senate. These \nparliamentary precedents guide what we do as much as our written rules. \nLet me stress something very important at this point. The Constitution \ngives the role of advice and consent to a majority, not to a minority.\n  Similarly, the Constitution gives the authority to decide how the \nSenate does business to the Senate, not to the Presiding Officer.\n  There are no monarchs or dictators in America, or in the United \nStates Senate. Should the Presiding Officer rule that the Senate may \nproceed to vote on judicial nominations after sufficient debate, that \nwill become a parliamentary precedent guiding this body only after a \nmajority of Senators votes to make it so.\n  As I have discussed before in the Senate, this mechanism might better \nbe called the Byrd option because, when he was majority leader, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, repeatedly used it \nto change how the Senate does business.\n  The Senator from West Virginia knows that I have the greatest respect \nfor him. I heard him on the Senate floor again this afternoon. But as I \nwill\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\ndescribe in the next few minutes, I believe my friend from West \nVirginia doth protest too much.\n  In 1977, for example, then-Majority Leader Byrd used this mechanism \nto eliminate what was called the postcloture filibuster. If the Senate \nvoted to invoke cloture on a bill, rule XXII imposed a 1-hour debate \nlimit on each Senator. Senators could get around that limit, however, \nby introducing and debating amendments. Rule XXII allowed this \npractice, but the majority leader opposed it--Byrd. He made a point of \norder against it, the Presiding Officer ruled in his favor, and a \nsimple majority of Senators voted to back up the ruling.\n  Nearly two decades later, the Senator from West Virginia reflected on \nhow he used the Byrd option in 1977. Let me refer to the chart. He \ndescribed it this way:\n       I have seen filibusters. I have helped to break them. There \n     are few Senators in this body who were here in 1977 when I \n     broke the filibuster on the natural gas bill.\n\n  I was here, by the way. To continue:\n\n       I asked Mr. Mondale, the Vice President, to go please sit \n     in the chair; I wanted to make some points of order and \n     create some new precedents that would break these filibusters \n     And the filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, and arms. . \n     . . So I know something about filibusters. I helped to set a \n     great many of the precedents that are in the books here.\n\n  So don't say we are trying to change the rules. We are following the \nByrd rule that was set four times as he was majority leader. He changed \nSenate procedures without changing Senate rules.\n  The Senator from West Virginia did it again in 1979. Rule XVI \nexplicitly states that the Senate itself must decide whether amendments \nto appropriations bills are germane. Then-Majority Leader Byrd made a \npoint of order that the Presiding Officer may decide that question \ninstead. The Presiding Officer ruled in his favor and a majority of \nSenators voted to affirm the ruling. Once again, a parliamentary ruling \nchanged Senate procedures without changing Senate rules.\n  It happened again in 1980. As we have discussed, rule XXII requires \n60 votes to invoke cloture, or end debate, on any matter pending before \nthe Senate. This includes bills or nominations, but it also includes \nmotions to proceed to those bills or nominations.\n  Then-Majority Leader Byrd wanted the Senate to confirm an individual \nnomination. He made a single motion to go into executive session to \nconsider a nomination, a step that is not debatable under our rules, \nand to proceed to an individual nomination, a step that was debatable.\n  This time, the point of order came from a Republican Senator, arguing \nthat this procedural two-step was improper. The Presiding Officer \nagreed, ruling against what Majority Leader Byrd was trying to do. He \nstill prevailed when a majority of Senators voted to overturn the \nPresiding Officer's ruling. Doing so eliminated the filibuster on a \nmotion to proceed to a specific nomination.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows that seven Democratic Senators \nserving in this body today voted to eliminate those nomination-related \nfilibusters. They proved not only that the Byrd option is legitimate, \nbut also that it can be used to limit debate. I leave it to these \nSenators to explain how they could vote to eliminate nomination-related \nfilibusters in 1980 but support nomination filibusters today.\n  This 1980 example is particularly relevant because it utilized a \nparliamentary ruling to eliminate a nomination-related filibuster--not \na filibuster of the nomination itself but a filibuster on the motion to \nproceed to the nomination. That is, of course, a distinction without a \ndifference. Either one keeps a nomination from final approval.\n  Mr. President, still other examples exist, but I will not go into \nmore detail. Suffice it to say that using parliamentary rulings to \nchange Senate procedures without changing Senate rules is a well-\nestablished method for the Senate to govern itself. Should the majority \nleader, Senator Frist, utilize it, he will be on solid ground. He will \nsimply be relying upon the precedent that his predecessor, Senator \nByrd, helped put on the books.\n  If the majority leader does utilize the Byrd option, nobody will be \nable to suggest, let alone charge, he is doing so precipitously. He has \nbeen patient, methodical, and even cautious when it comes to this \nimportant matter. Far from the image of trigger-happy warriors being \nused in some interest ads out there, the majority leader will utilize \nthe Byrd option only after trying every conceivable alternative first, \nand he has done so.\n  The minority has had every opportunity to do what it says it wants to \ndo; namely, debate these nominations. The nominees being filibustered, \nfor example, include Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, \nnominated 1,474 days ago to a judicial position that has been vacant \nfor more than 8 years--more than 8 years and considered a judicial \nemergency.\n  Justice Owen received a unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, the highest rating they give, which our \nDemocratic colleagues once called the gold standard for evaluating \nnominees. Let me repeat that. She was rated unanimously as ``well-\nqualified'' by the American Bar Association, which is not a \nconservative organization, and some are calling her ``out of the \nmainstream.'' Give me a break.\n  Justice Owen was at the top of her law school class. She had the \nhighest score on the Texas bar exam in 1977. She is supported by 15 \npast presidents of the Texas Bar Association, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, and was endorsed for reelection by virtually every major \nnewspaper in the State of Texas. Out of the mainstream? My gosh, \nshe defines the mainstream.\n\n  I mention Justice Owen as an example, though her opponents use the \nsame tactics against nominee after nominee. They claim that Justice \nOwen is what they call an extremist, or outside of the mainstream, most \noften by tallying up winners and losers in her judicial decisions. They \nsay she rules too often on this side in criminal cases, too often on \nthat side in civil cases, not enough for this or that political \ninterest.\n  Whether Justice Owen is controversial, whether anybody considers her \ninside or outside of some kind of mainstream, these may be reasons to \nvote against her confirmation, not to refuse to vote at all. By the \nway, we have Senators on the Judiciary Committee--Democratic Senators--\nwho believe that any business ought to be automatically found against, \neven if they are right under the law, that anybody who may be an \nunfortunate person ought to be found for even though they are wrong in \nthe law.\n  That is not the way the law works. They criticize Justice Owen \nbecause, even though she has upheld the weak and the oppressed in many \ndecisions in the Texas Supreme Court, she has upheld the law sometimes \nto the lament of those who think the weak and oppressed should win no \nmatter what the law says. That is all you can ask of a judge.\n  The Judiciary Committee has more than once approved her nomination, \nand she deserves a vote in the Senate. But rather than give her a fair \nvote, those fearing they will lose are blocking it with a filibuster.\n  On April 8, 2003, Senator Bennett, my colleague from Utah, asked the \nthen-assistant minority leader, Senator Reid, how much time the \nDemocrats would require to debate the nomination fully. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       There is not a number of hours in the universe that would \n     be sufficient [to debate this nominee].\n\n  They did not want to debate Justice Owen, they wanted to defeat her. \nDebate was not a means to the end of exercising advice and consent. It \nwas an end in itself to prevent exercising advice and consent. The \nmajority leader has made offer after offer after offer of more and more \ntime, hoping that the tradition of full debate with an up-or-down vote \nwould prevail. That hope is fading, as Democrats have rejected every \nsingle offer.\n  Finally, last month, the minority leader admitted that ``this has \nnever been about the length of the debate.'' That is what the minority \nleader said. It has never been about the length of the debate. That was \nsaid April 28, 2005.\n  Unanimous consent is the most common way we structure how we consider \nbills and nominations. Because the Democrats rejected that course, \nMajority Leader Frist was forced to turn in March 2003 from seeking \nunanimous consent to the more formal procedure of motions to invoke \ncloture. During the 108th Congress, we took 20 cloture votes on 10 \ndifferent appeals court\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nnominations. More than 50, but fewer than 60, Senators supported every \none of these motions.\n  In other words, there was bipartisan support for a vote up or down \nfor each of those nominees. That was enough to confirm but not enough \nto end debate under the filibuster rules, misapplied here. The circle \nwas complete, and the minority's strategy of using the filibuster to \nprevent confirmation of majority-supported judicial nominations was in \nfull swing. Still the majority leader held off, resisting the growing \ncalls to implement a deliberate solution to this unprecedented, unfair, \nand, frankly, outrageous filibuster blockade.\n  The election returns provided more evidence that the American people \noppose using the filibuster to prevent fair up-or-down votes on \njudicial nominations. But hope that the voice of those we serve would \nchange how we serve them was soon shattered. The minority made it clear \nthat they would continue their filibuster campaign.\n  The minority can say this is a narrow effort focused on a few appeals \ncourt nominees. It is not. This is about the entire judicial \nconfirmation process. It is about rigging that process so the minority \ncan do what only the majority may legitimately do in our system of \nGovernment: determine how the Senate exercises its role of advice and \nconsent.\n  It is the Constitution, not the party line or interest group \npressure, not focus groups or interest group ad campaigns, that should \nguide us here. I have been told, for example, and I hope it is not \ntrue, that my friend from Nevada, the minority leader, may appear in a \ntelevision ad created and paid for by the Alliance for Justice, one of \nthe rabid leftwing groups involved in this obstruction campaign. I hope \nhe will not do that. I think that would be regrettable. They are part \nof the problem here. They have virtually been against anybody for the \ncircuit courts of appeal and many of the former nominees for the \nSupreme Court of the United States of America.\n  The Constitution assigns the nomination and appointment of judges to \nthe President, not to the Senate. The Senate checks that power by \ndeciding whether to consent to appointment of the President's nominees. \nWe exercise this role by voting on confirmation. As such, filibusters \ndesigned to prevent confirmation of majority-supported judicial \nnominations undermine the separation of powers.\n  The Constitution helps us both evaluate the problem and highlight the \nsolution. The Constitution gives the Senate authority to determine how \nwe will do our business. That includes not only our written rules but \nalso parliamentary precedents that change procedures without changing \nthose rules.\n  Our Democratic colleagues have had literally dozens of opportunities \nto return to our confirmation tradition of up-or-down votes for \njudicial nominations reaching the Senate floor. They have chosen the \npath of confrontation rather than that of cooperation. They exercised \nthe true nuclear option by blowing up two centuries of tradition. If \nthe majority leader utilizes the Byrd option, it will truly be as a \nlast resort, and it will be a constitutional means of solving an \nunconstitutional problem.\n  I go back in time because I was here when Senator Byrd was the \nminority leader. He had a tremendous majority of Democrats on the \nfloor. When Ronald Reagan was President, he never once used the \nfilibuster to stop Ronald Reagan's nominees, even though some of those \nnominations gave him and other Democrats tremendous angst. He utilized \nthe power to vote against them. Whether he is right or wrong is almost \nirrelevant here. The fact is that he did what 214 years of Senate \ntradition required: he allowed those nominees to go ahead and have a \nvote. And, after all, that is what we need to do here.\n  What is wrong with giving these circuit courts of appeal nominees who \nhave bipartisan support and the support of the American Bar Association \nsimple up-or-down votes? If you do not agree with them, you have the \nright and power to vote against them, and that is the proper way to \nhandle it. Let's not throw 214 years of tradition down the drain and, \nof course, let's not blow up the Senate if we do not get our way.\n  Mr. President, I notice the distinguished Senator from Montana is \nhere. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Utah. He laid \nout in pretty logical form what is at stake.\n  I have come to the Senate floor today to talk on an issue about which \nI seldom speak on this floor. I come to lend my voice maybe to break \nthis impasse in which we find ourselves.\n  The Senate has dwelt and droned for endless hours with at times very \ninflammatory language of which some of us and folks in America, the \nviewing public, have no doubt become very weary.\n  I just got off an airplane from Montana. When I walked off that \nplane, I said it is time to act so we can move on to the business of \naddressing the issues that are pressing the times. We have run out of \ntime and options, and now we must decide, and the hour is now.\n  I cannot remember a time when I read more history of the Senate than \non this occasion or in this situation. Some have made statements that \nthis has never happened before in our history. That is wrong because \nthere have been some contentious times facing each and every Congress \nsince our beginning, and Draconian actions were taken to deal with the \nissues of the dangerous times, times of great peril. We survived them, \nand we will survive this one also. That is the greatness of this \ncountry and the Senate because I think at times we underestimate our \nown abilities.\n  It just seems to me that in the Senate, we cannot allow a small \nminority to radically alter longstanding traditions just because it \ndoes not like a President or maybe his or her judicial nominees.\n  During the 108th Congress, the other side used the filibuster to \nblock up-or-down votes on 10 nominations to the Federal appeals courts. \nAll of these judicial nominees had bipartisan majority support. The \nSenate would have confirmed them had they been permitted a vote. And \nnever in the history of this country has a judicial nominee with clear \nmajority support been denied confirmation due to a filibuster.\n  Further, nearly one-third of President Bush's nominations to the \ncourts of appeal were denied up-or-down votes. The Democrats used or \nthreatened to use the filibuster. In that respect, President Bush now \nhas the lowest appeals court confirmation rate for the first 4 years of \nany modern Presidency.\n  Has each judicial nomination been blocked due to improper \nqualifications? Everybody on this floor has talked about that, and the \nanswer is no. Rather, each nomination has been blocked by a partisan \nfew who are willing to change Senate tradition and custom of advice and \nconsent imposing a 60-vote requirement on each nomination.\n  Every one of the judicial nominees being blocked by filibuster is of \nthe highest academic and intellectual quality, and each represents a \nbroad cross-section of American society.\n  More importantly, all these nominees have demonstrated that they \nrespect the rule of law. They are committed to interpreting and \napplying the law as it relates to the Constitution of the United States \nof America. Those folks who want to say this is a constitutional \namendment, go to article II, section 2, and read what it says.\n  The American people should know that for more than 200 years, the \nrule for confirming judges has been fair on an up-or-down vote. In the \nheart of every American I know, there is a common sense of fairness. \nThese good people being nominated by President Bush are, at the very \nleast, entitled to receive a vote. Whether you disagree or agree with \nthe particular person being nominated for a judgeship, it is incumbent \non this legislative body to provide full and fair open debate on the \nnomination and to then allow proper democratic procedures to take \nplace.\n  We have heard words such as ``rubberstamp.'' I do not think you could \nsay that. Were minority leaders such as Howard Baker and Everett \nDirksen and majority leaders such as Robert C. Byrd and Bob Dole \nrubberstamp Senators? I do not think so. I have heard the talk of the \nradical right. I wonder if there is a radical left also that grabs the \nears of some folks.\n  Let there be no doubt about this issue--it is as clear as a Montana\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\nmorning. It is obstructionism that has caused this crisis that looms \nover us today.\n  During the 108th Congress, 10 judicial nominations were either \nfilibustered or threatened the use of filibuster, and 6 other \nnominations along with it. All of these nominations were supported by \nSenators of both parties and opposed only by a partisan minority. In \nfact, Judge Owen has received four votes in the Senate, and she carried \nthe vote each time. Yet she is not on the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  Look at William Myers. The President nominated the former Solicitor \nof the Interior Department for the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Myers, a \ndistinguished attorney, is a nationally recognized expert in the area \nof natural resources and land use law. However, despite his \nlong service as National Park Service volunteer and a lifetime of \nrespect and enjoyment of the outdoors, the other side held his previous \nclients' positions against him and accused him of being hostile to the \nenvironment, therefore blocking his nomination and taking away the \nSenate's responsibility to give him a vote.\n\n  We have all heard about Priscilla Owen of Texas. She has already been \nvoted on four times in this body and carried the vote every time. \nJanice Rogers Brown, a California Supreme Court justice, was nominated \nto the DC Circuit. The first African American to serve on the \nCalifornia high court, Justice Brown received public support of 76 \npercent of California voters.\n  I think I heard my good friend from Delaware say they have 2 Senators \nfrom California, and they each represent over 17 million people. She \nrepresented the whole State and got 76 percent. Yet she was denied a \nvote on this floor.\n  William Pryor, Judge Pryor, has been serving with distinction on the \nEleventh Circuit since the President gave him a recess appointment in \nFebruary of 2004. Previously, he served 6 years as an Alabama attorney \ngeneral. Although he repeatedly demonstrated his ability to follow the \nlaw, he has been blocked by the Democrats' filibuster because he has \n``deeply held'' beliefs, taking away the Senate's responsibility to \nvote for him.\n  One of the country's rising stars in the judicial world, Miguel \nEstrada, could be described as the finest, the best, and the brightest \namong his peers. This Honduran immigrant who went to Harvard Law School \nand clerked for the Supreme Court was debated on this Senate floor for \nmore hours than any other judicial nomination in Senate history. After \ncloture votes repeatedly failed, he asked the President to withdraw his \nname from consideration, thereby allowing the other side to prevent the \nDC Circuit from having a very talented jurist to interpret and apply \nthe law, again taking away our responsibility to vote for him.\n  What are we doing here? Are we dumbing down the judiciary when the \nbest and the brightest have offered themselves to serve after they were \nnominated by this President?\n  Now we are faced with finding a solution to this so-called crisis. \nThey have already admitted that the filibuster is not about the \nqualification of the judges. They just do not want these judges. They \njust do not want judges appointed to the court by President Bush. So if \nwe allow this to continue, it will be acquiescing to the partisan \nminority's unilateral change in the Senate practices for the last 200 \nyears, a 60-vote requirement to confirm judges when only a simple \nmajority up-or-down vote has been the standard of practice in this \nSenate for a long time, and is also alluded to in the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  I would say the Constitution trumps any rule that we may make, that \nwe put in place here for our rules of procedures and conduct. I think \nthe Constitution trumps them. Now we find ourselves in this crisis. No \nmore time. Now is the time to vote.\n  The Senate has demonstrated in the past that it need not stand by and \nallow a minority to redefine the traditions, rules, practices and \nprocedures of the Senate.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate the power to set its own rules, \nprocedures, and practices, and the Supreme Court has affirmed the \ncontinuous power of a majority of members to do so.\n  The exercise of a Senate majority's constitutional power to define \nSenate practices and procedures has come to be known as the \n``constitutional option.''\n  The constitutional option can be exercised in several different ways, \nsuch as by creating precedents to effectuate the amendment of Senate \nStanding Rules or by creating precedents that address abuses of Senate \ncustoms by a minority of Senators. Regardless of the variant, the \npurpose of the constitutional option is the same--to reform Senate \npractices in the face of unforeseen abuses.\n  An exercise of the constitutional option under the current \ncircumstances would return the Senate to the historic and \nconstitutional confirmation standard of a simple majority for all \njudicial nominations.\n  Employing the constitutional option here would have no effect on the \nlegislative filibuster because virtually every Senator would oppose \nsuch an elimination. Instead, the constitutional option's sole purpose \nwould be the restoration of longstanding constitutional standards for \nadvice and consent.\n  For more than 200 years, the rule for confirming judges has been a \nfair, up-or-down vote.\n  For over 200 years, the Senate has honored both the minority's right \nto debate and the full Senate's right to vote on judicial nominees. No \nother minority leader in American history has claimed that the right to \ndebate equals the right to prevent the full Senate from exercising its \nconstitutional duty to advise and consent.\n  For over 200 years, Senators did not filibuster judicial nominees. \nWas the Senate just a rubber stamp for its first 200 years? Did every \nSenate before the 108th Congress fail to carry out its constitutional \nduty to advise and consent? The answer is a resounding ``no.''\n  Further, for 70 percent of the twentieth century, the same party \ncontrolled both the White House and the Senate, yet Minority Leaders on \nboth sides of the aisle did not filibuster the President's judicial \nnominees.\n  The choice is not between being a rubber stamp or filibustering a \njudicial nominee. For over 200 years, Senators agreed that the proper \nway to oppose a judicial nominee is to vote ``no.'' They went to the \nfloor and explained why they opposed the nominee. They tried to \npersuade their colleagues. They tried to persuade the American people. \nThen, they voted no. They did not filibuster or threaten to shut down \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n  Until now, every judicial nominee with support from a majority of \nSenators was confirmed. The majority-vote standard was used \nconsistently throughout the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries--for every \nadministration until President George W. Bush's judicial nominations \nwere subjected to a 60-vote standard.\n  These good people, being nominated by President Bush, are at the very \nleast entitled to receive a vote.\n  Whether you agree or disagree with the particular person being \nnominated for a judgeship, it is incumbent on this great legislative \nbody to provide full, fair and open debate on the nomination and to \nthen allow the proper democratic procedures to take place.\n  The Senate has demonstrated in the past that it need not stand by and \nallow a minority to redefine the traditions, rules, practices and \nprocedures of the Senate.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate the power to set its own rules, \nprocedures, and practices, and the Supreme Court has affirmed the \ncontinuous power of a majority of members to do so.\n  Because of this partisan minority, because of this obstructionism and \nbecause of the partisan minority's continued actions to take away the \nSenate's duty and responsibility to vote on the nominations before this \ngreat body, we face a crisis that has only 2 remedies:\n  Either the partisan minority allow the Senate to fulfill its duty and \nresponsibility to vote on President Bush's judicial nominations by not \ncontinuously invoking the filibuster.\n  Or, the Senate must invoke the necessary and requisite constitutional \noption to prevent the tyranny of the minority and the radically \naltering of longstanding traditions of the United States Senate.\n  Accordingly, I rise today to strongly urge my colleagues to stop the \nobstructionism and to allow President Bush's\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\njudicial nominations receive a fair, up-or-down vote and, therefore, to \nallow this great legislative body to carry out its constitutional duty \nof advice and consent--a responsibility that we, as Senators, have been \nduly elected to uphold by the American people.\n  There is a little housekeeping we might do before my good friend, the \nSenator from Wisconsin, chooses to speak. I thank the Senator for that.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 152) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follow:\n\n                              S. Res. 152\n\n       Whereas Afghanistan has suffered the ravages of war, \n     foreign occupation, and oppression;\n       Whereas following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001, the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom, \n     which helped to establish an environment in which the people \n     of Afghanistan are building the foundations for a democratic \n     government;\n       Whereas, on January 4, 2004, the Constitutional Loya Jirga \n     of Afghanistan adopted a constitution that provides for equal \n     rights for full participation of women, mandates full \n     compliance with international norms for human and civil \n     rights, establishes procedures for free and fair elections, \n     creates a system of checks and balances between the \n     executive, legislative, and judicial branches, encourages a \n     free market economy and private enterprise, and obligates the \n     state to prevent terrorist activity and the production and \n     trafficking of narcotics;\n       Whereas, on October 9, 2004, approximately 8,400,000 \n     Afghans, including nearly 3,500,000 women, voted in \n     Afghanistan's first direct Presidential election at the \n     national level, demonstrating commitment to democracy, \n     courage in the face of threats of violence, and a deep sense \n     of civic responsibility;\n       Whereas, on December 7, 2004, Hamid Karzai took the oath of \n     office as the first democratically elected President in the \n     history of Afghanistan;\n       Whereas nationwide parliamentary elections are planned in \n     Afghanistan for September 2005, further demonstrating the \n     Afghan people's will to live in a democratic state, and the \n     commitment of the Government of Afghanistan to democratic \n     norms;\n       Whereas the Government of Afghanistan is committed to \n     halting the cultivation and trafficking of narcotics and has \n     pursued, in cooperation with the United States and its \n     allies, a wide range of counter-narcotics initiatives;\n       Whereas the United States and the international community \n     are working to assist Afghanistan's counter-narcotics \n     campaign by supporting programs to provide alternative \n     livelihoods for farmers, sustainable economic development, \n     and capable Afghan security forces; and\n       Whereas, on March 17, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza \n     Rice said of Afghanistan ``this country was once a source of \n     terrorism; it is now a steadfast fighter against terrorism. \n     There could be no better story than the story of Afghanistan \n     in the last several years and there can be no better story \n     than the story of American and Afghan friendship. It is a \n     story of cooperation and friendship that will continue. We \n     have a long-term commitment to this country'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes, as an honored guest and valued friend of the \n     United States, President Hamid Karzai on the occasion of his \n     visit to the United States as the first democratically \n     elected President of Afghanistan scheduled for May 21 through \n     25, 2005;\n       (2) supports a democratic, stable, and prosperous \n     Afghanistan as essential to the security of the United \n     States; and\n       (3) supports a strong and enduring strategic partnership \n     between the United States and Afghanistan as a primary \n     objective of both countries to advance their shared vision of \n     peace, freedom, security and broad-based economic development \n     in Afghanistan, the broader South Asia region, and throughout \n     the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5743-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATE CRIMINAL ALIEN ASSISTANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 56, S. 188.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as passions rise higher and higher here in \nthe Senate, I come to the floor today to urge that cooler heads \nprevail; to urge that the majority not take the fateful step they are \ncontemplating; to urge that we step back from the cliff we are \napproaching, before it is too late.\n  We have all heard the arguments for and against a rule change that \nhas been dubbed ``the nuclear option.'' I will not reiterate those \narguments here. But as someone who came to the Senate to get things \ndone for real people, I have some experience trying to reach compromise \non difficult issues. The heart of compromise is well known: one side \ncannot have all that they want. Yet the essence of the so called \n``nuclear option'' is just that--one side wins, one party wins, one \nmajority wins full power over who will sit on the Federal bench. The \nother side--the other party, the minority--is left powerless, silenced \nby a new rule that strips the minority of all power over judges. We all \nknow that such an outcome is the opposite of moderation, the opposite \nof compromise, the opposite of bipartisanship. In short, the opposite \nof how to get things done in a way that encourages participation on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  There is no need to go down this troubled partisan path on judicial \nnominations and my own State of Wisconsin has shown us a smoother road \nfor more than a quarter century. In all those years, Wisconsin has used \na bipartisan nominating commission to force all sides to act in \nbipartisan cooperation when selecting judges. During the \nadministrations of Democrats and Republicans, and during the tenure of \nRepublican as well as Democratic Senators, we have used the Commission \nand succeeded in selecting well-qualified nominees who have been easily \nconfirmed by the Senate in every case. Using this process, both \npolitical parties have been represented--the minority does not get to \nchoose the nominee, but they can affect the choice and have their views \ncount.\n  If we move forward with the proposed rule change--a change designed \nto bring about one-party rule whenever the Senate considers judges--we \nwill silence a minority of the Senate and a majority of Americans. You \nsee, the Democratic Senators in this body were elected by a majority of \nAmericans. How will a majority of Americans speak up about judges who \nwill sit in their districts, on the Seventh Circuit, on the Supreme \nCourt, making decisions about their lives for generations to come if \nthis rule change is made?\n  People all across our country--whether in the majority or the \nminority--deserve better. They deserve to have some say over who will \nsit in judgment over them. And they deserve more than that, they \ndeserve a Senate that is working to solve the challenges they face \nevery day, challenges like the skyrocketing cost of health care which \nleaves too many without coverage and even more struggling to pay for \nthe coverage they have, challenges like factories closing and jobs that \npay too little to support a family, challenges like the need to save \nfor retirement in an age of disappearing pensions and job insecurity. \nThese are among the problems we should be dealing with today.\n  So for the sake of those who need healthcare, for the sake of those \nworking for too little, for the sake of those nearing retirement with \nfear and worry, I urge my colleagues to stop. Stop and listen. I hope \nyou will hear what I hear, Americans asking for what they have always \nasked of the Senate--that it be a place where debate continues, \npassions cool, and compromise prevails for the good of all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will note the business at hand is \nthe Priscilla Owen nomination, and the minority controls the time until \n5:30.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. I will take \nsome of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is on a path toward a divisive \nand actually unnecessary showdown. I have been here long enough to know \nthat if the vote on the Republican leader's nuclear option were by a \nsecret ballot it would fail overwhelmingly. There are too many Senators \nwho will tell you privately that on a secret ballot they would never \nvote for it. We know this because, as these Senators know, it is \nharmful to this institution and it is wrong for this country--wrong in \nterms of protecting the rights of the American people, wrong in terms \nof undercutting our fundamental system of checks and balances, wrong in \nterms of defending the independence of and public support for an \nindependent Federal judiciary. But especially it is wrong in \nunilaterally destroying minority protections in the Senate in order to \npromote one-party rule, something this Senate has never known and has \nnever wanted.\n  I have served in the Senate for almost 31 years. During that time, \nseveral times the Democrats were in charge of the Senate--in the \nmajority. Several times the Republicans were. The hallmark of every \nleader, Republican or Democratic, was that the special minority \nprotections of the Senate would remain. No matter who was in the \nmajority, they believed they had as their obligation protecting the \nrights of the minority because that is what the Senate is all about. \nEvery Senate majority leader took as his trust to make sure that when \nhe left, the Senate had at least the strengths it had when he took \nover.\n  Today, Democratic Senators alone will not be able to rescue the \nSenate and our system of checks and balances from the breaking of the \nSenate rules the Republican leadership seem so insistent on demanding. \nIt will take at least six Republicans standing up for fairness and for \nchecks and balances. I know a number of Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle know in their hearts that this nuclear option is the wrong \nway to go.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle have called for the vote on the \nnuclear option to be one of principle rather than one of party loyalty, \nand for this to be a vote of conscience. I agree. To ensure that it is, \nI urge both the Republican leader from Tennessee and the Democratic \nleader from Nevada--both of whom are my friends--to announce publicly, \ntoday, in advance of the momentous vote that awaits us at the end of \nthis debate, that every Senator should search his or her heart, his or \nher conscience, and vote accordingly.\n  I call on both the Democratic and Republican leaders to announce that \nthere will be no retribution or punishment visited upon any Senator for \nhis or her vote.\n  I remember in the aftermath of another vote, one I called at that \ntime a profile in courage, when our friend, the senior Senator from \nOregon, Mark Hatfield, cast the deciding vote against a proposed \nconstitutional amendment. Ten years ago some of the newer Republican \nSenators at the time reportedly wanted to strip him of the chairmanship \nof the Appropriations Committee. The press at the time provided counsel \nto those newer Senators, some having recently arrived from the other \nChamber, and who were accustomed to the way the Republican Party in \nthat body operates, where everything is all or nothing.\n  At the time, some of those Members urged that Senator Hatfield be \npenalized for his vote of conscience, a vote they did not like. They \nthought conscience should be set aside, he should have toed the party \nline. I remember the unfair pressures brought to bear on Senator \nHatfield. I do not want to see that befall other Senators, Republican \nor Democrat, whichever way they choose to vote on the nuclear option.\n\n  The Senate has its own carefully calibrated role in our system of \nGovernment. The Senate was not intended to function like the House. The \nGreat Compromise of the Constitutional Convention more than 200 years \nago was to create in the Senate a different legislative body from the \nHouse of Representatives. Those fundamental differences\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\ninclude equal representation for each State in accordance with article \nI, section 3. Thus, Vermont has equal numbers of Senators to New York \nor Idaho or California. The Founders intended this as a vital check. \nRepresentation in the Senate is not a function of population or based \non the size of a State or its wealth.\n  Another key difference is the right to debate in the Senate. The \nfilibuster is quintessentially a Senate practice. James Madison wrote \nin Federalist No. 63 that the Senate was intended to provide \n``interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens'' \nagainst ``illicit advantage'' and the ``artful misrepresentations of \ninterested men.'' It was designed and intended as a check, a balancing \ndevice, as a mechanism to promote consensus and to forge compromise.\n  The House of Representatives has a different and equally crucial \nfunction in our system. I respect the House and its traditions just as \nI respect and honor the Senate tradition. It is the Senate and only the \nSenate that has a special role in our legislative system to protect the \nrights of a minority from the divisive or intemperate acts of a \nheadstrong majority.\n  As the Republican leader agreed in debate with Senator Byrd last \nweek, there is no language in the Constitution that creates a right to \na vote or a nomination or a bill. If there were such a right, if there \nwere a right in the Constitution to require a vote, then Republicans \nviolated that more than 60 times by 60 times refusing to have a vote on \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees, by 60 pocket filibusters of \nClinton judicial nominations and about 200 other executive nominations.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, more than 500 \njudicial nominations for circuit and district court did not receive \nfinal Senate votes between 1945 and 2004. That is more than 500. It \namounts to 18 percent of all overall nominations. By contrast, this \nPresident has seen more than 95 percent of his judicial nominations \nconfirmed, 208 to date.\n  What the Republican leadership is seeking to do is to change the \nSenate rules in accordance with them but by breaking them. It is wrong \nthat the Senators who refused to have votes on more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees, and hundreds of his executive \nbranch nominees, have only one Republican agenda now--to contend the \nvotes and nominations are constitutionally required.\n  The Constitution hasn't changed from the time of the Clinton \nPresidency to Bush's Presidency, nor have the Senate rules been \nchanged. That is why I like to keep the Senate autonomous and secure in \na ``nuclear free'' zone.\n  The partisan power play now underway by Republicans will undermine \nthe checks and balances established by the Founders of the \nConstitution. It is a giant leap toward one-party rule with an \nunfettered executive controlling all three branches of the Federal \nGovernment. It not only would demean the Senate and destroy the comity \non which it depends, but it would undermine the strong, independent \nFederal judiciary protecting rights of liberties of all Americans \nagainst the overreaching of political branches.\n  It is saying, no matter whether you are Republican or Democrat or \nIndependent in this country, only Republicans need apply because they \nwill control the executive branch, the House of Representatives, the \nSenate, and now the independent Federal judiciary. That is what it \ncomes down to. There will be no checks and balances on who goes on a \nFederal bench for a lifetime job, lifetime position. There will be no \nchecks and balance. It will be, if you are a Republican, you can be on \nthe Federal bench and help shape it; otherwise, forget about it.\n  This is not a country of one-party rule. I hope this country is never \none of one-party rule. No democracy law exists if it is there by one-\nparty rule.\n  Our Senate Parliamentarian, who is nonpartisan, our Congressional \nResearch Service, which is there to serve both Republicans and \nDemocrats, have said the so-called nuclear option would go against \nSenate precedent. In other words, to change the rule, you would have to \nbreak the rule. In other words, to say we are going to talk about how \njudges should judge, we will break our own laws to do it. What an \nexample to a great and good country like ours. What an example to say \nwe are somehow above the law.\n  What it is saying to the American people, you 280 million Americans, \nyou follow the law, but 100 Senators are better than that. We don't \nhave to follow the law. We stand above the law. In fact, if we don't \nlike the law, we will break the law and make a new one.\n\n  Do our friends on the other side of the aisle want to so blatantly \nbreak the rules for short-term political gain? Do they desire to turn \nthe Senate into a place where the parliamentary equivalent of brute \nforce is whatever can be rammed through by partisan ramrodding and arm \ntwisting?\n  We are not playing king of the hill. We are protecting the \nConstitution. We are protecting the best checks and balance of our \nNation, the Senate, and we are doing it so we can remove the checks and \nbalance of the Federal judiciary. What enormous stakes.\n  That is why I say if this were a secret ballot, the nuclear option \nwould never pass. There are too many Senators who state privately in \nthe cloakrooms, the dining room, and the Senate gym, they know this is \nwrong but they have to follow party discipline.\n  We did not come to this crossroad overnight. No Democratic Senator \nwanted to filibuster. Not one of us came to those votes easily. We hope \nwe are never forced by an overaggressive executive and compliant \nmajority into another filibuster over a judicial nomination. \nFilibusters, like the confrontation the Senate is being forced into \nover the last several days, are the direct result of a deliberate \nattack by the current administration and its supporters in the Senate \nagainst not only the traditions of the Senate but the rules: We are \nwilling to break the rules that serve our purpose for the moment.\n  The nuclear option is the grand culmination of their efforts. It is \nintended to clear the way for this President to appoint a more extreme \nand more divisive choice--not only in the circuit courts of appeals but \nshould a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court. That is not how the Senate \nhas worked or should work.\n  I have been here with six Presidents. It has been the threat of a \nfilibuster that has encouraged a President to moderate his choice and \nwork with Senators on both sides of the aisle, both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators. Of the six Presidents I have served with, five of \nthem actually looked at the advice and consent clause and worked with \nSenators from both parties for both advice and consent of the judges. \nBut this has been politicized and the Senate Republicans have \nsystematically eliminated every other traditional protection for the \nminority. Now their target is a Senate filibuster, the only route that \nis left to allow a significant Senate minority to be heard.\n  Under pressure from the White House over the last 2 years prior to \nthis year, the former Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nled Senate Republicans in breaking the longstanding precedent and \nSenate tradition with respect to handling lifetime appointments to the \nFederal bench. Senate Republicans have had one set of practices to \ndelay and defeat 61 of a Democratic President's moderate, qualified \njudge nominations. But then they suddenly switch gears and switch the \nrules to rubberstamp a Republican President's choices to lifetime \njudicial positions, including many who were very controversial.\n  The list of broken rules and precedents is long, including in the way \nthe home State Senators were treated, the way hearings were scheduled, \nin the way the committee questionnaire was unilaterally altered, to the \nway the Judiciary Committee historic protection of the minority by \ncommittee rule IV was repeatedly violated. In the last Congress they \ndestroyed virtually every custom and courtesy used throughout history \nto enforce cooperation and civility in the confirmation process.\n  For years, Democratic Senators have been warning that the \ndeterioration of Senate rules and practices, if done away with, would \nalso do away with the protection of minority rights.\n  So that is where we are. I have been proud to serve here both in the \nmajority and the minority. I remember all the times when I was here as \na member of the majority party, it was constantly drummed into us at \nour party\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\ncaucuses, at party meetings, we have to maintain the Senate rules to \nprotect the rights of the then minority, the Republicans.\n  It is amazing to me the Senate, the place that is supposed to be the \nconscience of our Nation, would allow a President, any President, to \nconvince them to turn their back on precedent, on history, but also on \ntheir own rules.\n  We have always been a check and balance on Presidents. Now we have \nSenators who will tell you, quietly outside the Chamber, they are \nfrustrated by taking orders from the White House and yet will not stand \nup and say no, we don't work for the White House. We are not appointed \nby the White House. We are elected by the people of our State. We swear \non the oath to protect the Constitution. We are not protecting it when \nwe break our own rules. We are not protecting the people of this \ncountry when we throw away the ability to have checks and balances. \nThis is a serious mistake, and we will rue this day.\n\n  So at this ninth hour, I say to Senators: Vote your conscience. As I \nsaid earlier, if this was a secret ballot, the nuclear option would \nnever pass. But vote your conscience. And again, I would urge both the \nRepublican leader and the Democratic leader to announce on the floor of \nthe Senate that nobody will be punished if they vote their conscience \nbecause, after all, why would anybody want to serve, why would anybody \nwant to be 1 of 100 to represent 280 million Americans? Why would you \nwant to serve in the Senate if you felt you could not vote your \nconscience? I will vote mine on this issue. I will vote to protect the \nrights of the minority--all minorities throughout this country. I will \nvote to uphold the law. I will vote to uphold the rules of the Senate. \nAnd I will vote to uphold that which causes us to have a check and \nbalance where instead of rushing off the cliff following one person on \neither the right or the left, we seek the compromises that are best for \nthis country.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from New York on the floor. I am \nperfectly willing to yield the remainder of my time to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont who has \nbeen a stalwart defender of the Constitution his entire public life. \nAnd as a member of the Judiciary Committee, as chair and ranking \nmember, and all of his activities on behalf of this issue, he has \ndemonstrated the highest level of leadership.\n  Mr. President, I started my day today in Newburg, NY, at the military \nheadquarters of GEN George Washington. Many of the most important \nbattles of the Revolutionary War were fought in New York, up and down \nthe Hudson River Valley, the Champlain Valley, the Mohawk Valley, down \ninto New York City, out on Long Island. Today, we were announcing \nlegislation that I had sponsored here in the Senate with my friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, to commemorate \nthe Revolutionary War.\n  We were reminded at this event today of something called the Newburg \nConspiracy. What was that? That was an effort by a small group of \npeople to persuade George Washington to begin to assume the mantle of \nabsolute power, to, in effect, become more like a king than what had \nbeen envisioned for this new Republic, a President and a system of \ngovernment with checks and balances.\n  In one of his greatest speeches, then General Washington repudiated \nthe Newburg Conspiracy and memorably said that we should all stand \nagainst any effort to consolidate power. We must stand for our \nRepublic. And that Republic, which is unique in human history, has this \nunusual system of checks and balances that pit different parts of the \nGovernment against one another that, from the very beginning, \nrecognized the importance of minority rights because, after all, that \nis what the Senate is, a guarantor of minority rights.\n  I represent 19 million people. Yet my vote is no more important than \nthe Presiding Officer's or any of my other colleagues who may represent \nStates with far fewer citizens because we have always understood that \nmajority rule too easily can become abusive, that those in the majority \nand particularly those who lead that majority always believe that what \nthey want is right by definition. It is what they fight for. It is what \nthey care about. But we have understood, thanks to the genius of our \nFounders--great leaders such as George Washington--that human nature \nbeing what it is, we have to restrain ourselves, not only in the \nconduct of our day-to-day relations with one another but in the conduct \nof our government.\n  So we have created this rather cumbersome process of government. \nSometimes people in a parliamentary system look at it and say: What is \nthis about? You have a House of Representatives where you have majority \nrule, and then you have this Senate over here where people can slow \nthings down, where they can debate, where they have something called \nthe filibuster. It seems as if it is a little less than efficient.\n  Well, that is right. It is, and deliberately designed to be so, with \nthe acute psychological understanding that every single one of us needs \nto be checked in the exercise of power, that despite what we may \nbelieve about our intentions and our views, not one of us has access to \nthe absolute truth about any issue confronting us. So one of the ways \nwe have protected the special quality of the Senate over all of these \nyears is through unlimited debate, through the creation of rules that \nwould make it possible for a minority to be heard, and more than that, \ncreate a supermajority for certain actions that the Constitution \nentrusts to the Senate, and, in particularly, the appointment of judges \nfor lifetime tenure.\n\n  Now, why would you have a supermajority for judges? Again, I think it \nshows the genius of our Founders in their understanding of human \nnature. This is a position of such great importance, such overwhelming \npower and authority, that anyone who comes before this body should be \nable to obtain the support of 60 of our fellow Senators. It has worked \nwell.\n  There have been people going back in American history, and not just \nback to the beginning but back just a few years into the Clinton \nadministration, who I believe should have been confirmed as judges. The \nSenate decided not to. The President has sent us his nominees, and we \nhave confirmed more than 95 percent of them. I voted against a number \nof them, but the vast majority were acceptable to more than 60 Members \nof this body.\n  What is happening now with this assault on the idea of the Senate, on \nthe creation of this unique deliberative body that serves as a check \nand a balance to Presidential power, to the passions of the House, \nwhich has exercised the opportunity to create consensus with respect to \njudicial nominees, is that we have a President who is not satisfied \nwith the way every other President has executed his authority when it \ncomes to judicial nominees.\n  Many Presidents have not liked what the Senate has done to their \njudicial nominees. We can go back to Thomas Jefferson. Thomas \nJefferson, one of our greatest Presidents, was really upset because \nJohn Adams appointed people Thomas Jefferson did not think should be on \nthe Federal bench. He did not agree with their philosophy. He had \npersonal problems with some of them and the relationships between them. \nSo he tried to undue what his predecessor had done. And the Senate, \nrecognizing what General Washington had understood back during the \nRevolutionary War, what the writers of the Constitution had understood \nin Philadelphia, said: No. Wait a minute, Mr. President. We are not \nsubstituting one king for another. We are trying something entirely \ndifferent. You may get a little frustrated, but Presidential authority \nis not absolute, so we are going to expect you to abide by the rules.\n  Every President has faced these frustrations. Franklin Roosevelt, at \nthe height of his power, with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress, \nfaced all kinds of setbacks from the judiciary, and he wanted to change \nthem. He wanted to pack the courts, and the Democrats in the Senate, \nwho put the Senate first, who put the Constitution first, said: No. \nWait a minute. We admire you. You are saving our country. You are doing \ngreat things. But, no, we cannot let you go this far.\n  Well, today, we are here because another President is frustrated. He \nhas gotten 95 percent of his judges. He\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nwants 100 percent. I can understand that. That is the way a lot of \npeople get when they have power. They want it all. If you are against \nhim, then he thinks you are against everything he stands for as opposed \nto having legitimate disagreements.\n  So this President has come to the majority in the Senate and \nbasically said: Change the rules. Do it the way I want it done. And I \nguess there were not very many voices on the other side of the aisle \nthat acted the way previous generations of Senators have acted and \nsaid: Mr. President, we are with you. We support you. But that is a \nbridge too far. We cannot go there. You have to restrain yourself, Mr. \nPresident. We have confirmed 95 percent of your nominees. And if you \ncannot get 60 votes for a nominee, maybe you should think about who you \nare sending to us to be confirmed because for a lifetime appointment, \n60 votes, bringing together a consensus of Senators from all regions of \nthe country, who look at the same record and draw the same conclusion, \nmeans that perhaps that nominee should not be on the Federal bench.\n  But, no, apparently that is not the advice that has been given to the \nPresident. Instead, it looks as though we are about to have a showdown \nwhere the Senate is being asked to turn itself inside out, to ignore \nthe precedent, to ignore the way our system has worked--the delicate \nbalance we have obtained that has kept this constitutional system \ngoing--for immediate gratification of the present President.\n  When I was standing on the banks of the Hudson River this morning, \nlooking at General Washington's headquarters, thinking about the \nsacrifice that he and so many others made, many giving the ultimate \nsacrifice of their life, for this Republic--if we can keep it, as \nBenjamin Franklin said--I felt as though I was in a parallel universe \nbecause I knew I was going to be getting on an airplane and coming back \nto Washington. And I knew the Republican majority was intent upon this \nshowdown. I knew the President had chimed in today and said he wants \nup-or-down votes on his nominees. And I just had to hope that maybe \nbetween now and the time we have this vote there would be enough \nSenators who will say: Mr. President, no. We are sorry, we cannot go \nthere. We are going to remember our Founders. We are going to remember \nwhat made this country great. We are going to maintain the integrity of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand we have 1 minute left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 40 seconds, to be \nexact.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, and I thank \nthe Senator from New York for her comments.\n  Mr. President, I would simply reiterate what I said before. If the \nvote on the nuclear option was cast in secret, from everything I have \nbeen told by my fellow Senators, it would go down to crashing defeat. \nAs Senators know, we have to break the rules to change the rules.\n  Again, I would just urge that both leaders, both the Republican and \nDemocratic leaders, make it clear to their Members that nobody is going \nto be punished for a vote on conscience. I hope Senators will stand up \nand be a profile in courage, vote their conscience, and vote the right \nway.\n  Mr. President, the hour of 5:30 has arrived, so I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Mr. President, I see the Republican leader is not on the floor yet, \nso I will suggest the absence of a quorum to accommodate him. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending business is the nomination of \nJudge Priscilla Owen to be U.S. circuit court judge.\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our colleagues complained that by \naffording any President's nominees a simple up-or-down vote, we are \ntrying to stifle the right to debate, while I think it is worth noting \nthat we have devoted 20 days--20 days--to the Owen nomination. So this \nis not about curtailing debating rights. This is about using the \nfilibuster to kill nominations with which the minority disagrees so 41 \nSenators can dictate to the President whom he can nominate to the \ncourts of appeal and to the Supreme Court.\n  If there is any doubt about this, I remind our colleagues that last \nyear the distinguished minority leader said:\n\n       There is not enough time in the universe--\n\n  ``Not enough time in the universe'' for the Senate to allow an up-or-\ndown vote on the Owen nomination. So we should stop pretending this \ndebate is simply about preserving debating prerogatives. It is clearly \nabout killing nominations.\n  Our debate is about restoring the practice honored for 214 years in \nthe Senate of having up-or-down votes on judicial nominees. Never \nbefore has a minority of Senators obstructed a judicial nominee who \nenjoyed clear majority support.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle recite a list of nominees \non whom there were cloture votes, but the problem with their assertion \nthat these nominees were filibustered is that the name of each of these \nnominees is now preceded by the title ``judge,'' meaning, of course, \nthey were confirmed.\n  So what my Democratic colleagues did last Congress is, indeed, \nunprecedented. Even with controversial nominees, the leaders of both \nparties historically have worked together to afford them the courtesy \nof an up-or-down vote.\n  When he was minority leader, Senator Byrd worked with majority leader \nHoward Baker to afford nominees an up-or-down vote, even when they did \nnot have a supermajority, nominees such as J. Harvey Wilkinson, Alex \nKozinski, Sidney Fitzwater, and Daniel Manion.\n  As Senator Byrd knows, it is not easy being the majority or minority \nleader. He, Senator Byrd, could have filibustered every one of those \nnominations but he did not. Instead, he chose to exercise principled \nand restrained leadership of the Democratic caucus when he was minority \nleader. I would like to compliment Senator Byrd for that decision.\n  Affording controversial judicial nominees the dignity of an up-or-\ndown vote did not stop, however, with Senator Byrd. It was true as \nrecently as 2000, when Senator Lott worked to stop Senators on our side \nof the aisle, the Republican side, who sought to filibuster the Paez \nand Berzon nominations. But, in 2001, as the New York Times has \nreported, our Democratic colleagues decided to change the Senate's \nground rules, a media report they have yet to deny.\n  Just 2 years later, after they had lost control of the Senate, our \nDemocratic colleagues began to filibuster qualified judicial nominees \nwho enjoyed clear majority support here in the Senate. They did so on a \nrepeated partisan and systematic basis. After 214 years of precedent, \nin a span of a mere 16 months, they filibustered 10 circuit court \nnominees--totally without precedence. Many of these nominees would fill \nvacancies that the administrative offices of the courts have designated \nas judicial emergencies, including several to the long-suffering Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, in which my State is located. As a result, \nPresident Bush has the lowest percentage of circuit court nominees \nconfirmed in modern history, a paltry 69 percent.\n  The Senate, as we all know, works not just through the application of \nits written rules but through the shared observance of well-settled \ntraditions and practices. There are a lot of things one can do to gum \nup the works here in the Senate, a lot of things you could do. But what \ntypically happens is we exercise self-restraint, and we do not engage \nin that kind of behavior because invoking certain obstructionist \ntactics would upset the Senate's unwritten rules. Filibustering \njudicial nominees with majority support falls in that category. Let me \nrepeat, it could have always been done. For 214 years, we could have \ndone it, but we did not. We could have, but we did not.\n  By filibustering 10 qualified judicial nominees in only 16 months, \nour Democratic colleagues have broken this unwritten rule. This is not \nthe first time a minority of Senators has upset a Senate tradition or \npractice, and the current Senate majority intends to do what the \nmajority in the Senate has often done--use its constitutional authority \nunder article I, section 5, to reform Senate procedure by a simple \nmajority vote.\n  Despite the incredulous protestations of our Democratic colleagues, \nthe Senate has repeatedly adjusted its rules as circumstances dictate. \nThe first Senate adopted its rules by majority vote, rules, I might \nadd, which specifically provided a means to end debate instantly by \nsimple majority vote. That was the first Senate way back at the \nbeginning of our country. That was Senate rule VIII, the ability to \nmove the previous question and end debate.\n  Two decades later, early in the 1800s, the possibility of a \nfilibuster arose through inadvertence--the Senate's failure to renew \nSenate rule VIII in 1806 on the grounds that the Senate had hardly ever \nneeded to use it in the first place.\n  In 1917, the Senate adopted its first restraint on filibuster, its \nfirst cloture rule--that is, a means for stopping debate--after Senator \nThomas Walsh, a Democrat from Montana, forced the Senate to consider \ninvoking its authority on article I, section 5, to simply change Senate \nprocedure. Specifically, in response to concerns that Germany was to \nbegin unrestricted submarine warfare against American shipping, \nPresident Wilson sought to arm merchant ships so they could defend \nthemselves. The legislation became known as the armed ship bill.\n  However, 11 Senators who wanted to avoid American involvement in the \nFirst World War filibustered the bill. Think about this. In 1917, there \nwas no cloture rule at all. The Senate functioned entirely by unanimous \nconsent. So how did the Senate overcome the determined opposition of 11 \nisolationist Senators who refused to give consent to President Wilson \nto arm ships? How did they do it?\n  Senator Walsh made clear the Senate would exercise its constitutional \nauthority under article I, section 5, to reform its practices by simple \nmajority vote. A past Senate could not, he concluded, take away the \nright of a future Senate to govern itself by passing rules that tied \nthe hands of a new Senate. He said:\n\n       A majority may adopt the rules in the first place. It is \n     preposterous to assert that they may deny future majorities \n     the right to change them.\n\n  What he said makes elementary good sense. Because Walsh made clear he \nwas prepared to end debate by majority vote, both political parties \narranged to have an up-or-down vote on a formal cloture rule. Senator \nClinton Anderson, a Democrat from New Mexico, noted years later that \n``Walsh won without firing a shot.'' And Senator Paul Douglas, a \nDemocrat from Illinois, observed also years later that consent was \ngiven in 1917 because a minority of obstructing Senators had Senator \nWalsh's proposal ``hanging over their heads.''\n  I know that the Senate's 1970 cloture rule did not pertain to a \nPresident's nominations, nor did any Senators, during the debate on the \nadoption of the 1917 cloture rule, discuss its possible application to \nnominations. This was not because Senators wanted to preserve the right \nto filibuster nominees. Rather, Senators did not discuss applying the \ncloture rule to nominations because the notion of filibustering \nnominations was alien to them. It never occurred to anybody that that \nwould be done.\n  In the middle of the 20th century, Senators of both parties, on a \nnearly biennial basis, invoked article I, section 5 constitutional \nrulemaking authority. Their efforts were born out of frustration of the \nrepeated filibustering of civil rights legislation to protect black \nAmericans. A minority of Senators had filibustered legislation to \nprotect black voters at the end of the 19th century. They had \nfilibustered antilynching bills in 1922, 1935, and 1938; antipoll tax \nbills in 1942, 1944 and 1946; and antirace discrimination bills.\n  In 1959, Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson agreed to reduce the number \nrequired for cloture to two-thirds of Senators who were present and \nvoting because he was faced with a possibility\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\nthat a majority would exercise its constitutional authority to reform \nSenate procedure. He knew the constitutional option was possible.\n  Additionally, the Senate had voted four times for the proposition \nthat the majority has the authority to change Senate procedures. For \nexample, in 1969, Senators were again trying to reduce the standard for \ncloture--that is, the rule to cut off debate--from 67 down to 60. To \nshut off debate on this proposed rule change, Democratic Senator Frank \nChurch from Idaho secured a ruling from the Presiding Officer, \nDemocratic Vice President and former Senator Hubert Humphrey, that a \nmajority could shut off debate, irrespective of the much higher cloture \nrequirement under the standing rules. A majority of Senators then voted \nto invoke cloture by a vote of 51 to 47 in accord with the ruling of \nVice President Humphrey. This was the first time the Senate voted in \nfavor of a simple majority procedure to end debate.\n  The Senate reversed Vice President Humphrey's ruling on appeal. But \nas Senator Kennedy later noted:\n\n       This subsequent vote only cemented the principle that a \n     simple majority could determine the Senate's rules.\n\n  Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       Although [Vice President Humphrey's] ruling may have been \n     reversed, the reversal was accomplished by a majority of the \n     Senate. In other words, majority rule prevailed on the issue \n     of the Senate's power to change its rules.\n\n  Senator Kennedy made this observation in 1975, when reformers were \nstill trying to reduce the level for cloture from 67 down to 60. \nReformers had been thwarted in their effort to lower this standard for \nseveral years.\n  In 1975, once again, Senate Democrats asserted the constitutional \nauthority of the majority to determine Senate procedure in order to \nensure an up-or-down vote. The Senate eventually adopted a three-fifths \ncloture rule--that is, 60 votes to cut off debate--but only after the \nSenate had voted on three separate occasions in favor of the principle \nthat a simple majority could end debate. They had voted on three \nseparate occasions that a simple majority could end debate, after which \nit was a compromise establishing the level at 60.\n  The chief proponent of this principle was former Democratic Senator \nWalter Mondale and four current Democratic Senators voted in favor of \nit: Senator Biden, Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Inouye. \nIndeed, Senator Kennedy was an especially forceful adherent to the \nconstitutional authority of the Senate majority to govern--a mere \nmajority. He asked:\n\n       By what logic can the Senate of 1917 or 1949 bind the \n     Senate of 1975?\n\n  That was Senator Kennedy. He then echoed Senator Walsh's observation \nfrom almost 60 years earlier:\n\n       A majority may adopt the Rules in the first place. It is \n     preposterous to assert that they may deny to later majorities \n     the right to change them.\n\n  Finally, referring to unanimous consent constraints that faced the \nSenate in 1917, Senator Kennedy made an astute observation as to why a \nmajority of the Senate had to have rulemaking authority. Senator \nKennedy said:\n\n       Surely no one would claim that a rule adopted by one \n     Senate, prohibiting changes in the rules except by unanimous \n     consent, could be binding on future Senates. If not, then why \n     should one Senate be able to bind future Senates to a rule \n     that such change can be made only by a two-thirds vote?\n\n  Recently, the authority to which I have been referring has been \ncalled the ``constitutional option,'' or the pejorative term, ``nuclear \noption.'' But while the authority of the majority to determine Senate \nprocedures has long been recognized, most often in Senate history by \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle--incidentally, it was the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia who employed this constitutional \nauthority most recently, most effectively, and most frequently.\n  Senator Byrd employed the constitutional option four times in the \nlate 1970s and 1980s. The context varied but three common elements were \npresent each time: First, there was a change in Senate procedure \nthrough a point of order rather than through a textual change to Senate \nrules; second, the change was achieved through a simple majority vote; \nthird, the change in procedure curtailed the options of Senators, \nincluding their ability to mount different types of filibusters or \notherwise pursue minority rights.\n  The first time Senator Byrd employed the constitutional option was in \n1977 to eliminate postcloture filibuster by amendment. Senate rule XXII \nprovides once cloture is invoked, each Member is limited to 1 hour of \ndebate, and it prohibits dilatory and nongermane amendments. But \nbecause Democratic Senators Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and James \nAbourezk of South Dakota opposed deregulating natural gas prices, they \nused existing Senate procedures to delay passage of a bill that would \nhave done so after cloture had been invoked. They stalled debate by \nrepeatedly offering amendments without debating them, thereabout \ndelaying the postcloture clock.\n  If points of order were made against the amendments, they simply \nappealed the ruling of the Chair which was debatable, and if there were \na motion to table the appeal then there would have to be rollcall \nvotes. Neither of these options would consume any postcloture time.\n  After 13 days of filibustering by amendment, the Senate had suffered \nthrough 121 rollcall votes and endured 34 live quorums with no end in \nsight.\n  Under then existing precedent, the Presiding Officer had to wait for \na Senator to make a point of order before ruling an amendment out of \norder. By creating a precedent, Senator Byrd changed that procedure. He \nenlisted the aid of Vice President Walter Mondale as Presiding Officer \nand made a point of order that the Presiding Officer now had to take \nthe initiative to rule amendments out of order that the Chair deemed \ndilatory. Vice President Mondale sustained Senator Byrd's new point of \norder. Senator Abourezk appealed, but his appeal was tabled by majority \nvote. The use of this constitutional option set a new precedent. It \nallowed the Presiding Officer to rule amendments out of order to crush \npostcloture filibusters.\n  With this new precedent in hand, Senator Byrd began calling up \namendments, and Vice President Mondale began ruling them out of order. \nWith Vice President Mondale's help, Senator Byrd disposed of 33 \namendments, making short work of the Metzenbaum-Abourezk filibuster.\n  Years later, Senator Byrd discussed how he created new precedent to \nbreak this filibuster. This is what Senator Byrd said years later about \nwhat he did.\n\n       I have seen filibusters. I have helped to break them.\n\n  There are a few Senators in this body who were here when I broke the \nfilibuster on the natural gas bill. . . .I asked Mr. Mondale, the Vice \nPresident, to go please sit in the chair; I wanted to make some points \nof order and create some new precedents that would break these \nfilibusters.\n\n       And the filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, and arms. \n     It went away in 12 hours.\n       So I know something about filibusters. I helped to set a \n     great many of the precedents that are in the books here.\n\n  That is Senator Byrd on his effort--one of his efforts--involving the \nuse of the constitutional option.\n  Although Senator Byrd acted within his rights, his actions were \ncertainly controversial. His Democrat colleague, Senator Abourezk, \ncomplained that Senator Byrd had changed the entire rules of the Senate \nduring the heat of the debate on a majority vote. And according to \nSenator Byrd's own history of the Senate, the book that he wrote that \nwe all admire so greatly, he and Vice President Mondale were severely \ncriticized for the extraordinary actions taken to break the postcloture \nfilibusters.\n  Some might argue that in 1977 Senator Byrd was not subscribing to the \nconstitutional option. However, the procedure he employed, making a \npoint of order, securing a ruling from the Chair, and tabling the \nappeal by a simple majority vote, is the same procedure the current \nSenate majority may use. Moreover, 15 months later, Senator Byrd \nexpressly embraced the Senate majority's rulemaking authority.\n  Back in January of 1979, Majority Leader Byrd proposed a Senate rule \nto greatly reform debate procedure. His proposed rules change might \nhave been filibustered, so he reserved the right to use the \nconstitutional option. Here is what he said.\n\n       I base this resolution on Article I, Section 5 of the \n     Constitution. There is no higher law, insofar as our \n     government is concerned, than the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\n       The Senate rules are subordinate to the Constitution of the \n     United States. The Constitution in Article I, section 5, says \n     that each House shall determine the rules of its proceedings. \n     . . . This Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead \n     hand of the past. . . .\n\n  Senator Byrd did not come to his conclusion lightly. In fact, in 1975 \nhe had argued against the constitutional option but faced with a \nfilibuster in 1979 he said he had simply changed his mind. This is what \nhe had to say:\n\n       I have not always taken that position but I take it today \n     in light of recent bitter experience. . . . So, I say to \n     Senators again that the time has come to change the rules. I \n     want to change them in an orderly fashion. I want a time \n     agreement.\n       But, barring that, if I have to be forced into a corner to \n     try for majority vote I will do it because I am going to do \n     my duty as I see my duty, whether I win or lose. . . . If we \n     can only change an abominable rule by majority vote, that is \n     in the interests of the Senate and in the interests of the \n     Nation that the majority must work its will. And it will work \n     its will.\n\n  Senator Byrd did not have to use the constitutional option in early \n1979 because the Senate relented under the looming threat and agreed to \nconsider his proposed rule change through regular order.\n  As another example, in 1980, Senator Byrd created a new precedent \nthat is the most applicable to the current dispute in the Senate. This \nuse of the constitutional option eliminated the possibility that one \ncould filibuster a motion to proceed to a nomination. We are on a \nnomination now on the Executive Calendar. The reason it was not \npossible to filibuster a motion to proceed to that nomination, we can \nthank Senator Byrd in 1980 when he exercised the constitutional option \nto simply get rid of the ability to filibuster a motion to proceed to \nan item on the Executive Calendar.\n  Before March of 1980, reaching a nomination required two separate \nmotions, a nondebatable motion to proceed to executive session, which \ncould not be filibustered and which would put the Senate on its first \ntreaty on the calendar; and a second debatable motion to proceed to a \nparticular nominee which could be filibustered.\n  Senator Byrd changed this precedent by conflating these two motions, \none of which was debatable, into one nondebatable motion. Specifically, \nhe made a motion to go directly into executive session to consider the \nfirst nominee on the calendar. Senator Jesse Helms made a point of \norder that this was improper under Senate precedent; a Senator could \nnot use a nondebatable motion to specify the business he wanted to \nconduct on the Executive Calendar. The Presiding Officer sustained \nSenator Helms's point of order under Senate rules and precedence.\n  In a party-line vote, Senator Byrd overturned the ruling on appeal. \nAnd because of this change in precedent, it effectively is no longer \npossible to filibuster the motion to proceed to a nominee.\n  So where are we? There are other examples where our distinguished \ncolleague used the Senate's authority to reform its procedures by a \nsimple majority vote. We on this side of the aisle may have to employ \nthe same procedure in order to restore the practice of affording \njudicial nominees an up-or-down vote. We did not cavalierly decide to \nuse the constitutional option. Like Senator Byrd in 1979, we arrived at \nthis point after ``recent bitter experience,'' to quote Senator Byrd, \nand only after numerous attempts to resolve this problem through other \nmeans had failed.\n  Here is all we have done in recent times to restore up-or-down vote \nfor judges: We have offered generous unanimous consent requests. We \nhave had weeks of debate. In fact, we spent 20 days on the current \nnominee. The majority leader offered the Frist-Miller rule compromise. \nAll of these were rejected. The Specter protocols, which would \nguarantee that nominations were not bottled up in committee, was \noffered by the majority leader. That was rejected; Negotiations with \nthe new leader, Senator Reid, hoping to change the practice from the \nprevious leadership in the previous Congress, that was rejected; the \nFrist Fairness Rule compromise, all of these were rejected.\n  Now, unfortunately, none of these efforts have, at least as of this \nmoment, borne any fruit.\n  Our Democrat colleagues seem intent on changing the ground rules, as \nthe New York Times laid it out in 2002. They want to change the ground \nrules as they did in the previous Congress in how we treat judicial \nnominations.\n  We are intent on going back to the way the Senate operated quite \ncomfortably for 214 years. There were occasional filibusters but \ncloture was filed and on every occasion where the nominee enjoyed \nmajority support in the Senate cloture was invoked. We will have an \nopportunity to do that in the morning with cloture on Priscilla Owen. \nColleagues on both sides of the aisle who want to diffuse this \ncontroversy have a way to do it in the morning, and that is to do what \nwe did for 214 years. If there was a controversial nominee, cloture was \nfiled, cloture was invoked, and that controversial nominee got an up-\nor-down vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. One of the things that the public at large can get \nconfused about is that we are going to eliminate the use of the \nfilibuster entirely. I have seen some of the ``527'' commercials \nadvising constituents to get hold of their Congressman because minority \nrights are going to be trampled.\n  I, obviously, find that ludicrous. I know this debate is not about \nchanging anything dealing with legislation. It is just maintaining the \nsystem we have had in the Senate on judges for 214 years. I wonder if \nthe Senator would clear up that we are talking just about judicial \nnominees, and not even all judicial nominees, and nothing to change the \nfilibuster on legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Iowa, if the majority leader \ndoes have to exercise the constitutional option and ask us to support \nit, it will be narrowly crafted to effect only circuit court \nappointments and the Supreme Court, which are, after all, the only \nareas where there has been a problem.\n  I further say to my friend from Iowa, in the years I have been in the \nSenate, the only time anyone has tried to get rid of the entire \nfilibuster was back in 1995 when such a measure was offered by the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Interestingly enough, the principal beneficiaries of getting rid of \nthe filibuster in January of 1995 would have been our party because we \nhad just come back to power in the Senate, yet not a single Republican, \nnot one, voted to get rid of the filibuster. Nineteen Democrats did, \ntwo of whom, Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry, are still in the Senate \nand now arguing, I guess, the exact opposite of their vote a mere 10 \nyears ago.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So when we just came back into the majority, after the \n1994 election, there was an effort by Democrats to eliminate the \nfilibuster?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Entirely.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For everything, including legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We were the new majority.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And we would have benefited very much from that. It \nwould have given us an opportunity to get anything done that we could \nget 51 votes for doing, with no impediment, and we voted against that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Unanimously. And interestingly enough, it was the \nfirst vote cast by our now-Senate majority leader, Senator Frist, here \nin the Senate. The very first vote he cast, along with the rest of us \non this side of the aisle, was to keep the filibuster.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So I think that ought to make it clear we are just \ntalking about the unprecedented use of the filibuster within the last 2 \nyears. We are not talking about changing anything in regard to \nfilibusters on legislation because we understand that is where you can \nwork compromises. You cannot really work compromises when it comes to \nan individual--is it either up or down. But you can change words, you \ncan change paragraphs, you can rewrite an entire bill to get to 60, to \nget to finality, on any piece of legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Iowa is entirely correct. The \nfilibuster would be preserved for all legislative items, preserved for \nexecutive branch nominations, not for the judiciary. It would be \npreserved even for district court judges, where Senators have \nhistorically played a special role in either\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\nselecting or blocking district judges. All of that would be preserved. \nIf we have to exercise the constitutional option tomorrow, it will be \nnarrowly crafted to deal only with future Supreme Court appointments \nand circuit court appointments, which is where we believe the \naberrational behavior has been occurring in the past and may occur in \nthe future.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And maintain the practice of the Senate as it has been \nfor 214 years prior to 2 years ago.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is precisely the point. My friend from Iowa is \nentirely correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the assistant majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Just to make it clear, there are two calendars in the \nSenate. One is the legislative calendar and the other is the Executive \nCalendar; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. The legislative calendar is the main calendar for the \nSenate, and it is solely the Senate's; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. But the Executive Calendar involves nominations through \nthe nomination power granted by the Constitution to the President of \nthe United States, and the Senate has the power to advise and consent \non that nomination power, is that right, to exercise that power?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is entirely correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. What we are talking about here is strictly the Executive \nCalendar, ending the inappropriate filibusters on the Executive \nCalendar and certainly not ending them on the legislative calendar?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Utah is entirely correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, our Democratic friends argue--just to change the \nsubject a little bit here--they argue we have to institute the judicial \nfilibuster to maintain the principle of checks and balances as provided \nin the Constitution. But unless my recollection of events is different, \nthis contention does not fit with the historical record.\n  Isn't it the case that the same party has often been in the White \nHouse and in the majority in the Senate, such as today, but in the \npast, while the same party has controlled the White House and been a \nmajority in the Senate, neither party, Democrats or Republicans, over \nthe years, has filibustered judicial nominations until this President's \nterm?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend is entirely correct. The temptation may have \nbeen there. I would say to my friend from Utah, the temptation may have \nbeen there.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. During the 20th century, the same party controlled the \nexecutive branch and the Senate 70 percent of the time. Seventy percent \nof the time, in the 20th century, the same party had the White House \nand a majority in the Senate. So I am sure--by the way, that aggrieved \nminority in the Senate, for most of the time, was our party, the \nRepublican Party.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. You got that right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are hoping for a better century in the 21st \ncentury. But it was mostly our party. So there had to have been \ntemptation, from time to time, and frustration, on the part of the \nminority. Seventy percent of the time, in the 20th century, they could \nhave employed this tactic that was used in the last Congress but did \nnot.\n  Senator Byrd led the minority during a good portion of the Reagan \nadministration. Actually, during all of the Reagan administration, 6 \nyears in the minority, 2 years in the majority, Senator Byrd could have \ndone that at any point. He did not do it, to his credit. To his credit, \nhe did not yield to the temptation.\n  As I often say, there are plenty of things we could do around here, \nbut we do not do it because it is not good to do it, even though it is \narguably permissible. So when our friends on the other side of the \naisle say the filibuster has been around since 1806, they are right. It \nis just that we did not exercise the option because we thought it was \nirresponsible.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not quite right because the filibuster rule did not come \ninto effect until 1917.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No. The ability to stop the filibuster did not come \nabout until 1917. The ability to filibuster came about in 1806.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, Senators had the right to speak, and they could \nspeak.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HATCH. So in a sense it was not even known as a filibuster at \nthat time. Nevertheless, they had the right to speak.\n  To follow up on what you just said, we heard repeatedly from liberal \ninterest groups that we must maintain the filibuster to maintain \n``checks and balances.'' My understanding of the Constitution's checks \nand balances is that they were designed to enable one branch of \nGovernment to restrain another branch of Government. Are there really \nany constitutional checks that empower a minority within one of those \nbranches to prevent the other branch from functioning properly?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, my friend from Utah is again entirely correct. \nThe term ``checks and balances'' has actually nothing to do with what \nhappened to circuit court appointments during the previous Congress. \nThe term ``checks and balances'' means institutional checks against \neach other, the Congress versus the President, the judiciary versus \nboth--the balance of power among the branches of Government. It has \nnothing whatsoever to do with the process to which the Senate has been \nsubjected in the last few years. It is simply a term that is \ninapplicable to the dilemma in which we find ourselves now.\n  Mr. HATCH. One last point. The 13 illustrations that the Democrats on \nthe other side have given that they have said are filibusters, if I \nrecall it correctly, 12 of those 13 are now sitting on the Federal \nbench, as you have said; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Utah, as far as I can \ndetermine, for every judge who enjoyed majority support, upon which \nthere was subsequently a filibuster, cloture was invoked, and all of \nthose individuals now enjoy the title ``judge.''\n  Mr. HATCH. In other words, they are sitting on benches today?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Because they ultimately got an up-or-down vote. I \nwould say to my friend from Utah, we will have an opportunity tomorrow, \nin the late morning, to handle the Priscilla Owen nomination the way \nour party, at your suggestion and Senator Lott's suggestion, toward the \nend of the Clinton years, handled the Berzon and Paez nominations. They \nhad controversy about them, just as this nomination has controversy \nabout it.\n  How did we deal with controversy? We invoked cloture. And I remember \nyou and Senator Lott saying, to substantial grief from some, that these \njudge candidates had gotten out of committee, and they were entitled to \nan up-or-down vote on the floor. Senator Lott joined Senator Daschle \nand filed cloture on both of those nominations, not for the purpose of \ndefeating them but for the purpose of advancing them. They both got an \nup-or-down vote. They both are now called judge.\n  Mr. HATCH. So the cloture votes in those instances were floor \nmanagement devices to get to a vote so we could vote those nominations \nto the bench?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the purpose of advancing the nominations, not \ndefeating them.\n  Mr. HATCH. So they were hardly filibusters in that sense?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. They were not. They were situations which do occur, \nfrom time to time, where a nominee has some objection. And around here, \nif anybody objects, it could conceivably end up in a cloture vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. And spend a lot of time on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. It does not mean the nomination is on the way to \nnowhere. It could mean the nomination is on the way to somewhere \nbecause you invoke cloture and then you get an up-or-down vote. And I \nremember you, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, advocating that \nstep, even though we all ended up, many of us, voting against those \nnominations once we got to the up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Advocating the step that we should invoke cloture and give \nthese people a vote up or down?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Precisely.\n  Mr. HATCH. One last thing. As to the 13, 12 of them are sitting on \nthe bench.\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\nThe 13th that they mentioned was the Fortas nomination. In that case, \nthere was the question of whether there was or was not a filibuster. \nBut let's give them the benefit of the doubt and say there was a \nfilibuster, since there are those who do say there was, although the \nleader of the fight, Senator Griffin, at the time said they were not \nfilibustering, that they wanted 2 more days of debate, and they were \ncapable and they had the votes to win up or down--\n  Mr. McCONNELL. He withdrew, didn't he?\n  Mr. HATCH. He did. But what happened was there was one cloture vote, \nand it was not invoked. But even if you consider it a filibuster, the \nfact is, it was not a leader-led filibuster. It was a nomination that \nwas filibustered--if it was a filibuster--almost equally by Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And isn't it also true, I ask my friend from Utah, \nthat it was apparent that Justice Fortas did not enjoy majority support \nin the Senate and would have been defeated?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Had he not withdrawn his nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. The important thing here is it was a bipartisan filibuster \nagainst a nominee by both parties, and in these particular cases, these \nare leader-led partisan filibusters led by the other party.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I hope Senator Hatch will remain because he has been, \nmuch of the first years of my career in the Senate, chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I think it is important to drive home what \nyou have been discussing. I think it is so important.\n  First, I will say to the distinguished assistant majority leader how \nmuch I appreciate his comprehensive history of debate in the Senate. I \nthink it is invaluable for everyone here. But I remember the Berzon and \nPaez nominations. Both of those were nominees to the Ninth Circuit. \nJudge Paez, a magistrate judge, declared that he was an activist \nhimself, as I recall, and even said that if legislation does not act, \njudges have a right to act. And the Supreme Court had reversed the \nNinth Circuit 28 out of 29 times one year and consistently reversed \nthem more than any other circuit in America. And here we had an ACLU \ncounsel, in Marsha Berzon, and Paez being nominated.\n  There was a lot of controversy over that. We had a big fuss over \nthat. We had an objection. I voted for 95 percent of President \nClinton's nominees, but I did not vote for these two. I remember we had \na conference.\n  I will ask the assistant majority leader--we were having House \nMembers saying: Why don't you guys filibuster? People out in the \nstreets were saying: Don't let them put these activist judges on the \nbench. We had our colleagues saying it. I did not know what to do. I \nwas new to the Senate. Do you remember that conference when we had the \nmajority in the Senate, and President Clinton was of the other party \nand we were not in minority like the Democrats are today--we had the \nmajority--and Senator Hatch explained to us the history of filibusters, \nwhy we never used them against judges, and urged us not to filibuster \nthose Clinton nominees?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I remember it well. I would say, our colleague from \nUtah got a little grief for that from a number of members on our side \nof the aisle who were desperately looking for some way to sink those \nnominations. And he said: Don't do it. Don't do it. You will live to \nregret it. And thanks to his good advice, we never took the Senate to \nthe level--never descended to the level that the Senate has been in the \nprevious Congress.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me ask this, with the presence of the distinguished \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Chamber. At that very \nmoment when it was to the Republican interests to initiate a \nfilibuster, if we chose to do so, at that moment, when he was, on \nprinciple, opposing it, the very Members of the opposite party, leading \nSenators on that side--Senator Leahy and Senator Kennedy and Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Boxer--were making speeches saying how bad the \nfilibuster was and how it should not be done.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend that is why we have been \nquoting them so much in all of our speeches on this side of the aisle. \nYou could just change the names, and they could have been giving our \nspeeches as recently as 1998, 1999, and even 2000.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I could not agree more. A half-dozen years ago, the \npeople who are leading the filibuster were the very ones objecting to \nit. But Senator Hatch and the Republicans, isn't it fair to say, have \nbeen consistent?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Absolutely. Let's just be fair here. I would say to \nboth of my colleagues, without getting into the details of any \nparticular nomination, that I think the Democrats have arguably a \nlegitimate complaint--it has a patina of legitimacy--when they argue \nthat we simply did in committee what they are doing on the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has now \nexpired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I didn't hear that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. They argue that we simply did in committee what they \nare doing on the floor, and that there is not a dime's worth of \ndifference between holding up a nominee in committee and holding up a \nnominee on the floor. I think there are some distinctions to be made.\n  It is not entirely the same thing, but granting that that might have \nsome legitimacy, the majority leader offered these Specter protocols \nwith which the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee is intimately \nfamiliar, which would have guaranteed some kind of procedure to \nextricate those nominations from committee and bring them out to the \nfloor and give them an up-or-down vote. We are in the majority, and we \nvolunteered to give up the ability to routinely kill nominations in \ncommittee. Yet they turned that down, too.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. The fact is, there have always been holdovers at the end \nof every administration. There were 54 holdovers at the end of the Bush \n1 administration, and he was only there 4 years. We didn't cry and moan \nand groan and threaten to blow up the Senate over that. We recognized \nit was part of the process.\n  I have to say with regard to the holdovers that were there at the end \nof the Clinton administration, there were some which they could have \ngotten through, but there were like 18 that were withdrawn. Ten \nwithdrew their names. Some were not put up again between the two \nadministrations. There is no question that I tried to do the very best \nI could to give President Clinton every possible edge.\n  But this has always been the case. It isn't just this time. It \nhappened with Democrats in control of the Senate and Republicans in \ncontrol of the White House. I think that point needs to be made. I have \nheard a lot of moaning and groaning. I know my colleagues know I did \neverything in my power to accommodate them and help them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe that is entirely correct. The only point I \nwas seeking to make was if that criticism had any validity whatsoever--\nand the former chairman has pointed out that it has very little \nlegitimacy--the distinguished majority leader offered to make that \nessentially impossible, and yet that was rejected as well.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Isn't it true that Trent Lott, the Republican majority \nleader, sought cloture to give Berzon and Paez an up-or-down vote, and \nthose of us who opposed Berzon and Paez, as the Senator from Kentucky \ndid, voted for cloture to give them an up-or-down vote and then voted \nagainst them when they came up for the up-or-down vote?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator is entirely correct. That is the way I \nvoted. I believe that is the way he voted. That is the way the Senate \nought to operate.\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nThat is a good model for how we ought to behave tomorrow. We will have \na cloture vote on Justice Priscilla Owen. If the Senate wants to \noperate the way it used to, we will invoke cloture on Justice Owen and \nthen give her the up-or-down vote which she richly deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, more than 2 years ago, this Senate first \ntook a cloture vote to end a filibuster on the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada for a seat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada \nepitomizes the American dream. An immigrant from Honduras, who arrived \nin America speaking no English, he graduated from Harvard Law School \nand became one of America's most distinguished lawyers. Mr. Estrada \nworked for Solicitors General under both President Bill Clinton and \nPresident George W. Bush. He argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court. \nThe American Bar Association gave him its highest recommendation, and \nMiguel Estrada's confirmation by a bipartisan majority of the full \nSenate was assured.\n  But the confirmation vote never came. Instead, Mr. Estrada's \nnomination was filibustered. Each time we sought a consent agreement to \nlimit debate, the Democratic leadership objected. We asked over and \nover for a simple up or down vote. If you oppose the nominee, we \nstressed, then vote against him, but give him a vote. But the partisan \nminority refused. In open session, they remarked that no amount of \ndebate time would be sufficient and that they would not permit the \nSenate to vote.\n  After 13 days of debate, with no end in sight, I filed a cloture \nmotion. Every Republican and a handful of Democrats voted for cloture, \nbringing us to 55 affirmative votes, 5 short of the 60 we needed. \nShortly thereafter, we tried again. We got the same 55 votes. And then \nwe tried five more times, never budging a single vote. It was crystal \nclear that the object of the filibuster was not to illuminate Mr. \nEstrada's record but to deny him an up or down vote. Debate was not the \nobjective. Obstruction was the objective. Finally, to the shame of the \nSenate and the harm of the American people, Mr. Estrada asked President \nBush to withdraw his nomination.\n  Before the last Congress, the record number of cloture votes on a \njudicial nomination was two, and no nomination with clear majority \nsupport ever died by filibuster. The Estrada case rewrote that \ntradition, and for the worse. On Miguel Estrada, seven cloture votes \nwere taken, to no avail. He was a nominee who plainly could have been \nconfirmed, but he was denied an up or down vote. Miguel Estrada's \nnomination died by filibuster.\n  And Mr. Estrada's case was just the beginning. After him, came the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen, a Justice on the Texas Supreme Court. \nFour cloture votes did not bring an end to the debate and we again were \ntold on the record that no amount of debate would be enough and a \nconfirmation vote simply would not be allowed. Thereafter, eight \nadditional nominees were filibustered and Democrats threatened \nfilibusters on six more. Something had radically changed in the way the \nSenate deals with nominations. Two hundred years of Senate custom lay \nshattered, with grave implications for our constitutional system of \nchecks and balances.\n  As the filibusters began to mushroom, Democratic Senator Zell Miller \nand I introduced a cloture reform resolution. Our proposal would have \npermitted an end to nominations filibusters after reasonable and \nsubstantial debate. The Rules Committee held a hearing on our \nresolution and reported it with an affirmative recommendation. But the \nproposal languished on the Senate Calendar, facing a certain filibuster \nfrom Senators opposed to cloture reform. Quite simply, those who \nundertook to filibuster these nominees wanted no impediments put in \ntheir way.\n  When Congress convened this January, I was urged to move immediately \nfor a change in Senate procedure so that these unprecedented \nfilibusters could not be repeated. But I decided on a more measured and \nless confrontational course. Rather than move immediately to change \nprocedure, I promoted dialogue at the leadership and committee level to \nseek a solution to this problem. Rather than act on the record of the \nlast Congress, I hoped that the passage of a clearly won election and \npresence of new Democratic leadership would result in a sense of \nfairness being restored.\n  Sadly, these hopes were not fulfilled. More filibusters have been \npromised, not only against seven nominees President Bush has \nresubmitted but also against other nominees not yet sent up. A renewal \nof filibusters against persons denied an up or down vote in the last \nCongress is a grave problem and would be reason enough for reform. \nThreatening filibusters against new nominees compounds the wrong and is \nfurther reason for reform.\n  For many decades, two great Senate traditions existed side by side. \nThese were a general respect for the filibuster and a consensus that \nnominations brought to the floor would receive an up-or-down vote. \nFilibusters have been periodically conducted on legislation, sometimes \nsuccessfully and sometimes ended by cloture. However, filibusters have \nnot impeded the Senate's advice and consent role on nominations. In the \nexceedingly rare cases they were attempted, cloture was always invoked \nwith bipartisan support and the filibusters ceased.\n  But in the last Congress, judicial filibusters became instruments of \npartisan politics. Organized and promoted by the Democratic leadership, \nthese filibusters proved resilient to cloture. And that was the \ndifference between these filibusters and the handful of judicial \nfilibusters conducted in the past. For example, to close debate on \nPresident Clinton's nominees, Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez, the \nRepublican leader, Senator Lott, took the initiative to file for \ncloture. Because he acted to conclude the debate, both Berzon and Paez \nsit on the bench today.\n  Due to the current filibusters, two great Senate traditions that used \nto coexist now collide. If matters are left in this posture, either the \npower of advice and consent will yield to the filibuster or the \nfilibuster will yield to advice and consent.\n  Until these judicial filibusters were launched, the Senate observed \nthe principle that filibusters would not impede the exercise of \nconstitutional confirmation powers and that a majority of Senators \ncould vote to confirm or reject a nominee brought to the floor. The \nunparalleled filibusters undermine that tradition, denying nominees the \ncourtesy of an up or down vote. They represent an effort by a Senate \nminority to obstruct the duty of the full Senate to advise and consent. \nThe current minority claims it has no choice but to filibuster, because \nRepublicans control the White House and Senate. But the minority's \nconclusion defies history.\n  For 70 of the 100 years of the last century, the same party \ncontrolled the Presidency and the Senate, but the minority party \nleadership exercised restraint and refused to filibuster judicial \nnominees. The past half century amply illustrates this point. During \nthe Kennedy and Johnson administrations, Democrats controlled the \nSenate, but the Republican Minority Leaders Everett Dirksen did not \nfilibuster judicial nominees. While President Carter was in office, \nDemocrats controlled the Senate, but Republican Leader Howard Baker did \nnot filibuster judicial nominees. For President Reagan's first 6 years, \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, but Democratic Leader Robert Byrd \ndid not filibuster judicial nominees. In President Clinton's first 2 \nyears, Democrats had the Senate but Republican Leader Bob Dole did not \nfilibuster judicial nominees. During all those years, all those \nCongresses, and all those Presidencies, nominees brought to the floor \ngot an up-or-down vote.\n  Each of those Senate minorities could have done what this minority \nhas done, using the same rationale. But none of them did. To the great \ndetriment of the Senate and to the constitutional principle of checks \nand balances, such self-restraint has vanished.\n  Democrats argue that by curbing judicial filibusters, we would turn \nthe Senate into a rubberstamp. But for more than two centuries, those \nfilibusters did not exist. Shall we conclude that for 200 years the \nSenate was a rubberstamp and only now has awakened to its \nresponsibilities? What of those minority leaders who did not \nfilibuster? Were they also rubberstamps? Was Dirksen? Was Baker? Was \nByrd? Was Dole? Can the minority be right\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\nthat only through the filibuster may the Senate's advice and consent \ncheck be vindicated? This is a novel conclusion and it stains the \nreputation of the great Senators that have preceded us.\n\n  To make their case against curbs on judicial filibusters, Democrats \ntry to reach into history. In so doing, they cite the 1968 nomination \nof Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and \nFranklin Roosevelt's court-packing plan of 1937. But use of these \nexamples is an overreach and draws false comparisons.\n  In 1968, Abe Fortas was serving on the Supreme Court as an Associate \nJustice. Three years earlier, he had been confirmed by the Senate by \nvoice vote, following a unanimous affirmative recommendation from the \nJudiciary Committee. Then Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his \nretirement, effective on the appointment of his successor. President \nLyndon Johnson proposed to elevate Fortas to succeed Warren.\n  The noncontroversial nominee of 1965 became the highly controversial \nnominee of 1968. Justice Fortas was caught in a political perfect \nstorm. Some Senators raised questions of ethics. Others complained \nabout cronyism. Yet others were concerned about Warren Court decisions. \nAnd still others thought that with the election looming weeks away, a \nnew President should fill the Warren vacancy. But this political \nperfect storm was thoroughly bipartisan in nature, and reflected \nconcerns from certain Republicans as well as numerous southern and \nnorthern Democrats.\n  Senator Mike Mansfield brought the Fortas nomination to the Senate \nfloor late on September 24, 1968. After only 2 full days of debate, \nMansfield filed a cloture motion. Almost a third of the 26 Senators who \nsigned the cloture motion were Republicans, including the Republican \nwhip. The vote on cloture was 45 yeas and 43 nays, well short of the \ntwo-thirds then needed to close debate. Nearly a third of Republicans \nsupported cloture, including the Republican whip. Nearly a third of \nDemocrats opposed it, including the Democratic whip. Of the 43 negative \nvotes on cloture, 24 were Republican and 19 were Democratic.\n  Opponents of cloture claimed that debate had been too short in order \nto develop the full case against the Fortas nomination. In contrast to \nthe Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen filibusters, no one claimed that \ndebate would go on endlessly and that no amount of time would be \nsufficient. Indeed, those who opposed cloture denied there was a \nfilibuster at all.\n  So, Mr. President, the Fortas case is not analogous to the judicial \nfilibusters we now confront. Support for and opposition to Fortas was \nbroadly bipartisan, a fact that stands in stark contrast to the \npartisan filibusters that began in the last Congress as an instrument \nof party policy. At most, it was opposition to one man, and was not an \neffort to leverage judicial appointments through the threat of a \nfilibuster-veto. The Fortas opposition came together in one \naberrational moment. Nothing like it happened in the previous 180 years \nand nothing like it happened for the next 35 years. Absolutely, it did \nnot represent a sustained effort by a minority party to shatter Senate \nconfirmation traditions and exercise a filibuster-veto destructive of \nchecks and balances. No comparison can be made between that single \naberrational moment and the pattern of judicial filibusters we now \nconfront.\n  Democrats also contend that if we move against the judicial \nfilibusters, we will follow in the footsteps of Franklin Roosevelt's \nattempt to pack the Supreme Court. But this is a scare tactic and it, \ntoo, is a comparison without basis.\n  Frustrated by the Supreme Court's ruling unconstitutional several New \nDeal measures, President Roosevelt sought legislation to pack the court \nby appointing a new Justice for every sitting Justice over the age of \n70. In a fireside chat, he compared the three branches of government to \na three horse team pulling a plow. Unless all three horses pulled in \nthe same direction, the plow could not move. To synchronize all the \nhorses, Roosevelt proposed to pack the court.\n  Roosevelt's effort was a direct assault on the independence of the \njudiciary and plainly undermined the principles of separation of powers \nand checks and balances. He failed in a Senate with 76 Members of his \nown party. But no good analogy can be drawn between what he attempted \nand our effort to end judicial filibusters.\n  Unlike Roosevelt, Republicans are not trying to undermine the \nseparation of powers. And unlike Roosevelt, Republicans are not trying \nto destabilize checks and balances, but to restore them.\n  Mr. President, that the judicial filibusters undermine a longstanding \nSenate tradition is evident. But traditions are not laudable merely \nbecause they are old. This tradition is important because it underpins \na vital constitutional principle that the President shall nominate, \nsubject to the advice and consent of the Senate. When filibusters are \nused to block a vote, the advice and consent of the Senate is not \npossible.\n  A cloture vote to end a filibuster is not advice and consent within \nthe Constitution's meaning. Notwithstanding the minority's claim, \nnominees denied a confirmation vote due to filibuster have not been \n``rejected.'' Instead, what has been rejected is the constitutional \nright of all Senators to vote up or down on the nominees.\n  To require a cloture threshold of 60 votes for confirmation disturbs \nchecks and balances between the Executive and the Senate and creates a \nstrong potential for tyranny by the minority. A minority may hold \nhostage the nomination process, threatening to undermine judicial \nindependence by filibustering any appointment that does not meet \nparticular ideological or litmus tests.\n  This is not a theoretical problem. Look what has happened already. \nAsserting claims that nominees from the last Congress were \n``rejected,'' Democrats have urged President Bush to withdraw the \nnominations he has submitted anew. If he does not, they will ensure the \nnominees are denied a confirmation vote. It is but a tiny step from \nthere to claim that any nominee must first secure minority clearance, \nor else be filibustered. And at that point, the nominating power \neffectively passes to the Senate minority. If Senate traditions are not \nrestored, this audacious and unprecedented assertion of minority power \nis coming next, and Presidents will be subject to it from now on.\n  The Constitution provides that a duly elected Executive shall \nnominate, subject to advice and consent by a majority of the Senate. \nImplicit in that structure is that the President and the Senate shall \nbe politically accountable to the American people, and that \naccountability will be a sufficient check on the decisions made by each \nof them. That was the system by which we Americans addressed \nnominations for more than two centuries, until the last Congress. If \nwe allow recent precedents to harden and give the minority a \nfilibuster-veto in the confirmation process, that system and the checks \nand balances it serves, will be permanently destroyed.\n\n  Trying to legitimize their judicial filibusters, Democrats have taken \nto the floor to extol the virtue of filibusters generally. And as to \nlegislative filibusters, I agree with them. But judicial filibusters \nare not cut from the same cloth as legislative filibusters and must not \nreceive similar treatment. So, I concur with the sentiments Senator \nMansfield expressed during the Fortas debate:\n\n       In the past, the Senate has discussed, debated and \n     sometimes agonized, but it has always voted on the merits. No \n     Senator or group of Senators has ever usurped that \n     constitutional prerogative. That unbroken tradition, in my \n     opinion, merely reflects on the part of the Senate the \n     distinction heretofore recognized between its constitutional \n     responsibility to confirm or reject a nominee and its role in \n     the enactment of new and far-reaching legislative proposals.\n\n  Mr. President, history demonstrates that filibusters have almost \nexclusively been applied against the Senate's own constitutional \nprerogative to initiate legislation, and not against nominations. The \nFrist-Miller cloture reform proposal from the last Congress dealt with \nnominations only, not legislation and not treaties. We addressed solely \nwhat was broken. Over many decades, numerous cloture reforms have been \nproposed. But ours was the only one to apply strictly to nominations. \nWe left legislative filibusters alone.\n  Contrary to what Democrats would have you believe, no Republican \nseeks\n\n[[Page S5755]]\n\nto end legislative filibusters. The Democrats are creating a myth. \nThese are the facts: my first Senate vote was to defeat a 1995 rules \nchange proposal to curtail filibusters of every kind. Introduced by \nDemocrats, it received 19 votes, all from Democrats. In 1995, we had a \nnew Republican majority. We would have been the prime beneficiaries of \nthe rules change, but we supported minority rights to filibuster on \nlegislation. Some of the Senators who most vigorously promote judicial \nfilibusters and condemn us for trying to restore Senate traditions, \nwere among those voting for the 1995 change. And here is the irony: had \nthe 1995 change been adopted, the judicial filibusters would be \nimpossible.\n  Some who oppose filibuster reform do so because they fear that \ncurbing judicial filibusters will necessarily lead to ending the right \nto filibuster legislation. But history strongly suggests this slippery \nslope argument is groundless. In 1980, under the leadership of Senator \nByrd and on a partisan vote, Senate Democrats engineered creation of a \nprecedent to bar debate on a motion to proceed to a nomination. Before \nthen, the potential existed for extended debate on the motion to \nproceed to a nomination and again on the nomination itself. Indeed, \ndebate on the Fortas nomination occurred on the motion to proceed. The \n1980 precedent rendered such debate impossible.\n  Simple logic would dictate that a parallel precedent would be \nestablished next, to bar debate on motions to proceed to legislation. \nBut that logic was not followed. The Byrd precedent of 1980 has stood \nfor 25 years and no move has ever been made to extend it to \nlegislation. Why not? I suggest there are two reasons. First, the \nSenate has recognized substantial distinctions between procedures \napplicable to Executive matters--nominations and treaties--and those \napplicable to legislation. Second, within the Senate there is no \ndiscernible political sentiment to curtail the right to debate a motion \nto proceed to legislation.\n  Given those substantial procedural distinctions and the absence of \nsuch political sentiment, the spillover from the 1980 Byrd precedent \nhas been nil.\n  There is a further reason why I do not believe curbing judicial \nfilibusters implicates legislation. For 22 years, between 1953 and \n1975, floor fights over the cloture rule were a biennial ritual. \nFinally, in 1975, the rule was amended to require 60 votes before \ncloture could be invoked. A bipartisan consensus gathered around the \nnew cloture threshold and, at least as to legislation, this consensus \nhas held fast. That is the principal cause why the 1995 effort by \ncertain Democrats to liberalize the cloture rule got only 19 votes. \nIndeed, both the Republican and Democratic leadership opposed it.\n  The 30-year bipartisan consensus on cloture has unraveled on judges, \nwhere filibusters are new, but it remains intact on legislation, where \nfilibusters are traditional. While no one can be sure what procedural \nchanges a future majority may propose, this consensus is so broad and \nlongstanding that predictions of a move against the legislative \nfilibuster lack basis.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I will repeat what I have said in a series of \npublic statements both on this floor and to the press: the Republican \nmajority will oppose any effort to restrict filibusters on legislation.\n  All this, Mr. President, brings us to the question of how to address \nthe problem of judicial filibusters. What might reform look like and \nhow might the Senate adopt it?\n  A good place to start is with first principles. In the case of \njudicial nominations, I believe the foundational principle is that if a \nmajority of Senators wishes to exercise its right to advise and consent \nto a nomination, it must be able to do so.\n  To that end, I have offered a Fairness Rule, which takes account of \ncomplaints set forth by both parties. My proposal addresses the \nquestion of holding nominations in committee, so that nominations can \nmove to the floor for a conformation vote. By this step, the Senate \nwould respond specifically to concerns Democrats have voiced about the \ntreatment of Clinton nominees. So, if a majority of Senators wishes to \nadvise and consent, committee inaction would not block it. Thereafter, \na majority can bring a nomination to the floor. After 100 hours of \ndebate, equally divided, the Senate can vote up or down on the nominee. \nThis step responds specifically to concerns Republicans have had about \nfilibusters of Bush nominees.\n  The Fairness Rule is the product of listening to the often rancorous \narguments expressed by Democrats and Republicans. It would reform the \nconfirmation process fairly and completely, and well serve this and \nfuture Senates and this and future Presidents.\n  The cycle of blame and finger-pointing must halt. We must stop \nnursing grievances and start addressing problems. Thus far, the \nFairness Rule has received an unwelcoming response. I urge the minority \nto reconsider. I urge them to join hands with us in dissipating bitter \npartisanship by considering this proposal.\n  For some time, the issue of judicial filibusters has captured \nconsiderable attention in the Senate. Both parties have had substantial \nopportunities to think about reform, so we can initiate consideration \nof it through the committee process and should be able to move ahead \nwith alacrity.\n  But to act on reform by this method, we must have a unanimous consent \nagreement that allows time for debate, a chance for amendment, and the \ncertainty of a final vote. An agreement can provide for robust, \nprincipled, and lengthy discussion. Without an agreement, any reform we \nbring to the floor is subject to being filibustered itself.\n\n  So, I ask the minority for an agreement to move matters forward. It \nrepresents an opportunity, much desired by Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle, to avoid a confrontation on judges. But if the answer is \nobstruction, then we are faced with having to initiate exercise of the \nSenate's constitutional option--best understood as reliance on the \npower the Constitution gives the Senate to govern its own proceedings.\n  The Senate is an evolving institution. Its rules and processes are \nnot a straitjacket. Over time, adjustments have occurred in Senate \nprocedure to reflect changes in Senate behavior. Tactics no longer \nlimited by self-restraint became constrained by rules and precedents. \nThis Senate, equal to the first Senate, has the constitutional right to \ndetermine how it wishes to conduct its business.\n  Self-governance involves writing rules or establishing precedents, \nand the Constitution fully grants to the Senate the power to do either.\n  Democrats contend that if the constitutional option is used to \nrestore checks and balances, Republicans would be veering into \nunchartered waters. But history is rich with examples of how Senate \nrules and precedents have changed in response to changing conditions. \nAnd quite often, it was the credible threat or actual use of the \nconstitutional option that caused these changes to be made.\n  The cloture rule itself was created in 1917, under pressure from \nMontana Democrat Thomas Walsh. Fed up with obstruction and with the \nprospect that any effort to amend Senate rules would be filibustered, \nWalsh proposed exercising the constitutional option. Old Senate rules \nwould not operate while the Senate considered new rules, including a \ncloture procedure. Meanwhile, general parliamentary law would govern--\naffording the Senate a way to break the rules change filibuster. Faced \nwith that pressure, and with an appropriate parliamentary tool at hand, \nthe Senate adopted its first cloture rule.\n  As the issue of civil rights gripped the Senate in the 1950s, a \nbipartisan group of Senate liberals, led by New Mexico Democrat Clinton \nAnderson, proposed using the constitutional option to liberalize a \ncloture process, because filibusters had either doomed or weakened \ncivil rights legislation. Anderson's support grew throughout the \ndecade. By 1959, it was apparent he might command a majority, which \nforced Senator Lyndon Johnson into a compromise by which the cloture \nthreshold was relaxed. But for the credible threat the constitutional \noption would be exercised, the rules change would not have happened.\n  In 1975, Minnesota Democrat Walter Mondale and Kansas Republican Jim \nPearson pressed for cloture reform through the constitutional option. \nMajority Leader Mike Mansfield, who earlier in his career had supported \nthis tactic, offered three separate points of order against it. Three \ntimes, those points of order were tabled. With a majority of Senators \nsquarely on record\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nsupporting the constitutional option, the Majority Whip, Senator Byrd, \noffered a successful leadership compromise to lower the cloture \nthreshold. But for the constitutional option, the change would not have \nhappened.\n  In 1979, Majority Leader Byrd sought to make a variety of rules \nreforms, principally with regard to cloture. Introducing a rules change \nresolution, he beseeched Republicans for a time agreement to consider \nit. But he also expressly warned that, if an agreement were not \nforthcoming, he would use the constitutional option to change the \nrules. Minority Republicans did not threaten to shut the Senate down. \nInstead, they gave him an agreement, from which followed a lengthy and \nspirited debate. In the end, the cloture rule was amended--a change \nthat happened under pressure from the constitutional option.\n  From this history, one must conclude that the threat or use of the \nconstitutional option was a critical factor in the creation and \ndevelopment of the Senate cloture rule.\n  The constitutional option is also exercised every time the Senate \ncreates a precedent. Four examples will illustrate the point. I have \nspoken already of Senator Byrd's 1980 precedent to bar debate on \nmotions to proceed to nominations. In 1977, 1979, and 1987 he led a \nSenate majority to establish precedents that restricted minority rights \nand tactics in use at the time. We do not have to pass judgment on the \npurposes or value of any of these moves to note the following: three of \nthese cases were decided on a party-line or near party-line vote. \nMoreover, every time Senator Byrd commanded a majority to make these \nprecedents, minority rights were limited.\n  We have been publicly threatened that if we act to end judicial \nfilibusters, Democrats will fundamentally shut the Senate down. To \nfollow their logic, if we expect to get the public's business done, we \nmust tolerate upending Senate traditions and constitutional checks and \nbalances.\n  I would strongly prefer that matters not come to that. It would be \nfar better for the Senate to have a vigorous and elevated debate about \nreforming the entire confirmation process, followed by a vote. I am \nready for that debate and willing to schedule the floor time necessary \nto make it happen.\n  Mr. President, I introduced the Frist-Miller cloture reform proposal \nnearly 2 years ago, on May 9, 2003. The problem of judicial filibusters \nhad just taken root. At the time, I said that I was acting with regret \nbut determination. Regret, because no one who loves the Senate can but \nregret the need to alter its procedures, even if to restore old \ntraditions. Determination, because I was determined that the changes \njudicial filibusters had wrought in the Senate could not become \nstandard operating procedure in this Chamber.\n  Since then, the Senate majority has exercised self-restraint, hoping \nfor a bipartisan understanding that would make procedural changes \nunnecessary. But if an extended hand is rebuffed, we cannot take \nrejection for an answer.\n  Much is at stake in resolving the issue of judicial filibusters. \nSenator Mansfield spoke to this issue during the Fortas debate in 1968. \nHis words are instructive now:\n\n       I reiterate we have a constitutional obligation to consent \n     or not to consent to this nomination. We may evade that \n     obligation but we cannot deny it. As for any post, the \n     question which must be faced is simply: Is the man qualified \n     for the appointed position? That is the only question. It \n     cannot be hedged, hemmed or hawed. There is one question: \n     shall we consent to this Presidential appointment? A Senator \n     or group of Senators may frustrate the Senate indefinitely in \n     the exercise of its constitutional obligation with respect to \n     this question. In so doing, they presume great personal \n     privilege at the expense of the responsibilities of the \n     Senate as a whole, and at the expense of the constitutional \n     structure of the Federal government.\n  Mr. President, exercising the constitutional option to restore Senate \ntraditions would be an act of last resort. It would be undertaken only \nif every reasonable step to otherwise resolve this impasse is \nexhausted. At stake are the twin principles of separation of powers as \nwell as checks and balances bedrock foundations for the Constitution \nitself. And at stake is our duty as Senators of advice and consent, to \nconfirm a President's nominee or reject her, but at long last to give \nher a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the debate bounces back and forth, and \nwe hear the complaints about the change in the system, one that has \nbeen in existence for some 200 years. It was formally adopted in the \nearly part of the 20th century.\n  I see the fact that the traditions and rules of the Senate are, \nfrankly, in deep jeopardy. The current majority leader is threatening \nto annihilate over 200 years of tradition in this Senate by getting rid \nof our right to extended debate. The Senate that will be here as a \nresult of this nuclear option will be a dreary, bitter, far more \npartisan landscape, even though it obviously prevents us from operating \nwith any kind of consensus. It will only serve to make politics in \nWashington much more difficult.\n  One has to wonder, what happened to the claims that were made so \nfrequently, particularly in the election year 2000, when then-candidate \nBush, now President, talked about being a uniter, not a divider? It has \nbeen constantly referenced. ``I want to unite the American people, not \ndivide them.''\n  With this abuse of power, the majority is about to further divide our \nNation with the precision of a sledgehammer.\n  I want the American people to understand what is going to happen on \nthe floor of the Senate if things go as planned. Vice President Cheney, \nwhom we rarely see in this Chamber, is going to come here for the \nspecific purpose of breaking existing rules for the operation of the \nSenate. He is going to sit in the Presiding Officer's chair and do \nsomething that, frankly, I don't remember in my more than 20 years in \nthe Senate. He could intentionally misstate, if what we hear is what we \nare going to get, the rules of the Senate.\n  Think about the irony. Vice President Cheney gets to help nominate \nFederal judges. Then when the Senate objects to the administration's \nchoices, he is going to come over here and break our rules to let his \njudges through. Talk about abuse of power. The Founding Fathers would \nshudder at the thought of this scenario. It runs counter to the entire \nphilosophy of our Constitution. Our Constitution created a system that \nthey thought would make it impossible for a President to abuse his \npowers.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to see what amounts to a coup d'etat, a \ntakeover right here in the Senate. The Senate, just like society at \nlarge, has rules. We make laws here and we brag about the fact that \nthis is a country of laws. We make laws here and expect Americans to \nfollow them. But now the majority leader wants the Senate to make it \neasier for the Republican Senators to change the rules when you don't \nlike the way the game is going. What kind of an example does that set \nfor the country? Some may ask if we don't follow our own rules, why \nshould the average American follow the rules that we make here?\n  If the majority leader wants to change the rules, there is a legal \nway to do it. A controversial Senate rule change is supposed to go \nthrough the Rules Committee. Once it reaches the full Senate for \nconsideration, it needs 67 votes to go into effect. But rather than \nfollow the rules, Vice President Cheney will break the rules from his \nposition as the Presiding Officer and change the rules by fiat. In \nother words, we will see an attempt to overthrow the Senate as we know \nit.\n  Hopefully, some courageous Senators will step forward, vote their \nconscience, and put a stop to this once and for all. There are several \npeople who disagree with their leader on the Republican side, and they \nhave expressed their unwillingness to go through with this muscular \ntakeover of the Senate.\n  It is unbefitting the body. President Bush and the majority leader \nwant to get rid of the filibuster because it is the only thing standing \nbetween them and absolute control of our Government and our Nation. \nThey think the Senate should be a rubberstamp for the President. That \nis not what our Founders intended. It is an abuse of power, and it is \nwrong, whether a Republican or a Democrat lives in the White House.\n  I say to the American people: Please, get past the process debate \nhere. Let's not forget how important our Federal judges are. They make \ndecisions about\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\nwhat rights we have under our Constitution. They make decisions about \nwhether our education and environmental laws will be enforced. They \nmake decisions about whether we continue to have health care as we know \nit. And sometimes, let us not forget, they may even step in to decide a \nPresidential election.\n  The Constitution says the Senate must advise and consent before a \nPresident's judicial nominations are allowed to take the bench. It \ndoesn't say advise and relent. It doesn't say consent first and then \nadvise. As Democratic leader Harry Reid recently said: George Bush was \nelected President, not king.\n  The Founding Fathers, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, did not \nwant a king. And that is why the Constitution created the Senate as a \ncheck on the President's power. With terrible ideas like Social \nSecurity privatization coming from the President these days, the \nAmerican people are thankful that we are here to stop it.\n\n  President Bush once famously said:\n\n       If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot \n     easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.\n\n  I am hopeful that President Bush was kidding when he said that. But \nthe President's allies don't seem to be. They want the Senate to simply \napprove every Bush nominee regardless of the record.\n  We have confirmed 208 of President Bush's nominees. But there are \nseveral we objected to because we believed they were too extreme. They \nvoiced their opinions. This was not based on hearsay. It was based on \nthings they said. They are too extreme to sit on the Federal bench.\n  The Republican side of the aisle calls this the tyranny of the \nminority. But in the Senate, who is the minority and who is the \nmajority? When you do the math on the current Senate, you will find \nthat the majority is actually in the minority. The minority is the \nmajority. Here is what I mean: Majority or minority. Current Senate: \nRepublican caucus, 55 Senators, they represent 144,765,000 Americans. \nThe Democratic caucus has less Senators, 45 as opposed to 55, and they \nrepresent some 148,336,000 Americans. So where is the minority here?\n  In this chart each Senator is allotted one-half of his or her State's \npopulation, just to explain how we get there. What you find is that the \nminority in this body, the Democratic caucus, represents 3.5 million \nmore people than does the majority. That is exactly why the Founding \nFathers wanted to protect minority rights in the Senate because a \nminority of Senators may actually represent a majority of the people.\n  How do you discard that and say: Well, we are the majority? You don't \nown the place. It is supposed to be a consensus government, \nparticularly in the Senate.\n  I make one last appeal to the majority leader: Don't take this \ndestructive action.\n  I want the American people to understand one thing: The big fight \nhere is because the people who will get these positions have lifetime \ntenure. That means they could be here 20, 30, or 40 years.\n  I have faith in the courage of my colleagues across the aisle. I hope \nthey are going to put loyalty to their country ahead of loyalty to a \npolitical party.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from New Jersey \nfor his eloquence and for his insight on the important role the \nfilibuster has always played in building consensus in our society.\n  It is unfortunate that we are here. It is unfortunate for this \ninstitution. It is unfortunate for the Members of this body. It is \nunfortunate for our country and for the political process that governs \nus all.\n  Mr. President, let there be no illusions. There will be no winners \nhere. All will lose. The victors, in their momentary triumph, will find \nthat victory is ephemeral. The losers will nurture their resentments \nuntil the tables one day turn, as they inevitably will, and the \nrecrimination cycle will begin anew.\n  This sorry episode proves how divorced from the reality of most \nAmerica Washington and the elites that too often govern here have \nbecome. At a time when Americans need action on health care, the \neconomy, deficit, national security, and at a time when challenges form \naround us that threaten to shape the future, we are obsessing about the \nrules of the Senate and a small handful of judges. At times like this, \nI feel more like an ambassador to a foreign nation than a \nrepresentative of my home.\n  This episode feeds the cynicism and apathy that have plagued the \nAmerican people for too long. It brings this institution and the \nprocess that has brought us here into disrepute and low esteem. No \nwonder so few of our citizens take the time to exercise even the most \nelementary act of citizenship--the act of going to the polls to vote.\n  Very briefly, let me say what this is all about, but let me begin by \nsaying what it is most definitely not about. This is not about the \nprecedents and history of this body. It has been interesting to sit \nsilently and observe colleagues on both sides of the aisle make appeals \nto precedent and history, and both do so with equal passion. History \nwill not provide an answer to this situation that confronts us. It is \nnot about whether nominees get an up-or-down vote. In fact, it is about \nthe threshold for confirmation that nominees should be held to, a \nsimple majority or something more. It is not about whether the chief \nexecutive will have his way the vast majority of the time. This \nPresident has seen 96 percent, or more, of his nominees confirmed by \nthis Senate, which is a high percentage by any reckoning. This debate \nis not about whether or not there are ideological or partisan tests \nbeing applied to nominees. I would assume that the 200-some nominees \nsent to us by this President are, for the most part, members of his \nparty, that most share his ideology, and yet more than 200 have been \nconfirmed. There are no litmus tests here.\n  Mr. President, this is really about the value we, as a people, place \nupon consensus in a diverse society. It is about the reason that the \nseparation of powers and the balance of powers were created by the \nFounders of this Republic in the first place. And it is ultimately \nabout whether we recall our own history and the understanding of human \nnature itself, the occasional passions and excesses and deals of the \nmoment that lead us to places that threaten consensus and the very \nsocial fabric of this Republic. It is about the value we place upon \nrestraint in such moments.\n  Is it unreasonable to ask more than a simple majority be required for \nconfirmation to lifetime appointments to the courts of appeal or the \nSupreme Court of the United States, who will render justice and \ninterpret the most fundamental, basic framing documents of this Nation? \nShould something more than a bare majority be required for lifetime \nappointments to positions of this importance and magnitude? I believe \nit should.\n  Should we be concerned about a lack of consensus on such appointees \nwho will be called upon to rule upon some of the most profound \ndecisions which inevitably touch upon the political process itself? I \nthink my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, mentioned the decision in Gore \nv. Bush. And if a sizable minority of the American people come to \nconclude that individuals who are rendering these verdicts are unduly \nideological or perhaps unduly partisan themselves, will this not \nundermine the respect for law and the political process itself and \nultimately undermine our system of governance that brought us here? I \nfear it might. Essentially, aren't these concerns--respect for the rule \nof law, respect for the independence of the judiciary, the importance \nof building consensus, and the need in times of crisis to lay aside the \npassions of the moment and understand the importance of restraint on \nthe part of the majority--aren't these concerns more fundamentally \nimportant to the welfare of this Republic than four or five individuals \nand the identities of those who will fill these vacancies? The answer \nto that must be, unequivocally, yes.\n  There are deeper concerns than even these, Mr. President. The real \nconcerns that I have with regard to this debate have to do with the \ncoarsening of America's politics. In the 6\\1/2\\ years I have been \nhonored to serve in this body, there have been just two moments of true \nunity, when partisanship and rancor and acrimony were placed\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\naside. First was in the immediate aftermath of the first impeachment of \na President since 1868 and the feeling that perhaps we had gone too \nfar. The second was in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when our \ncountry had literally been attacked and there was a palpable \nunderstanding that we were first not Republicans or Democrats, but \nfirst and foremost Americans. It is time for us to recapture \nthat spirit once again.\n\n  Today, all too often, we live in a time of constant campaigns and \npoliticking, an atmosphere of win at any cost, an aura of ideological \nextremism, which makes principled compromise a vice, not a virtue. \nToday, all too often, it is the political equivalent of social \nDarwinism, the survival of the fittest, a world in which the strong do \nas they will and the weak suffer what they must. America deserves \nbetter than that.\n  I would like to say to you, Mr. President, and to all my colleagues, \nthat you, too, have suffered at our hands. Occasionally, we have gone \ntoo far. Occasionally, we have behaved in ways that are injudicious. I \nthink particularly about the President's own brother, who was brought \nto the brink of personal bankruptcy because he was pursued in an \ninvestigation by the Congress, not because he had plundered his savings \nand loan, but because he happened to be the President's brother. Each \nof us is to blame, Mr. President. More importantly, each of us has a \nresponsibility for taking us to the better place that the American \npeople have a right to deserve.\n  There is a need for unity in this land once again. We need to \nremember the words of a great civil rights leader who once said: We may \nhave come to these shores on different ships, but we are all in the \nsame boat now.\n  We need to remember the truth that too many in public life don't want \nus to understand; that, in fact, we have more in common than we do that \ndivides us. We are children of the same God, citizens of the same \nNation, one country indivisible, with a common heritage forged in a \ncommon bond and a common destiny. It is about time we started behaving \nthat way. We need to remember the words of Robert Kennedy, who was in \nmy home State the day Martin Luther King was assassinated. Indianapolis \nwas the only major city that escaped the violence of that day, most \nattributed by Kennedy's presence in our city. He went into Indianapolis \nin front of an audience that was mostly minority citizens. He went up \non a truck bed and said: I am afraid I have some bad news. Martin \nLuther King was killed today. A gasp went up from the audience. He \nsaid: For those of you who are tempted to lash out in anger and \nviolence, I can only say that I too had a relative who was killed. He \ntoo was killed by a white man. Kennedy went on to say that what America \nneeds today in these desperate times is not more hatred, or more anger, \nor more divisiveness; what America needs today is more unity, more \ncompassion, and more love for one another.\n  That was true in 1968; it is true today. The time has come for the \nsons and daughters of Lincoln and the heirs of Jefferson and Jackson to \nno longer wage war upon each other, but instead to take up again our \nstruggles against the ancient enemies of man--ignorance, poverty, and \ndisease. That is what has brought us here. That is why we serve.\n  Mr. President, we need to rediscover the deeper sense of patriotism \nthat has always made this Nation such a great place, not as Democrats \nor Independents, not as residents of the South, or the East, or the \nWest, not as liberals or conservatives, or those who have no \nideological compass, but as one Nation, understanding the threats that \nface us, determined to lead our country forward to better times.\n  So I will cast my vote against changing the rules of this Senate for \nall of the reasons I have mentioned in my brief remarks and those that \nhave been mentioned by speakers before me. But more than that, I will \ncast my vote in the profound belief that this is a rare opportunity to \nput the acrimony aside, put us on a better path toward more \nreconciliation, more understanding and cooperation for the greater \ngood. And if in so doing, I and those of similar mind can drain even a \nsingle drop of blood or venom from the blood that has coarsed through \nthe body of this politic for too long, we will have done our duty to \nthis Senate and to the Republic that sent us here, and that is reward \nenough for me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague for his wise \nwords. I thank Senator Bayh. This morning I had the occasion to meet \nwith members of the press and the public at the Old State House in \nProvidence, RI, the seat of Rhode Island Government for many years in \nthe early days of this country. In fact, in 1790, George Washington and \nThomas Jefferson enjoyed a banquet in that building to celebrate the \nConstitution of the United States--that careful balancing of majority \npower and minority rights.\n  Unfortunately, these days in Washington, we are on the verge of \nupsetting that balance, of using majority power to undermine minority \nrights. In doing so, we are stilling the voices of millions of \nAmericans--the millions of Americans that we represent--and not just \ngeographically represent--the poor, the disabled, those who fight \nvigorously for environmental quality--all of those individuals will see \ntheir voices diminished and perhaps extinguished if we choose this \nnuclear option.\n  The Senate was created to protect the minority. It was also clearly \nenvisioned to serve as a check on Presidential power, particularly on \nthe power to appoint judges. Indeed, it was in the very last days of \nthe Constitutional Convention in 1787 that the Founding Fathers decided \nto move the power to appoint Federal judges from the control \nexclusively of the Senate to that of a process of a Presidential \nnominee with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  Indeed, in those last days, there was a shift of power, but not a \nsurrender of power. This Senate still has an extraordinary \nresponsibility to review, to carefully scrutinize the records of those \nindividuals who would serve for a lifetime on our Federal courts.\n  It is very important that the American people, when they come before \nthe bar of Federal justice, stand before a judge of the United States, \nfeel and know that that individual has passed a very high test, that \nthat individual is not a Republican judge or a Democratic judge, not an \nideologue of the right or left, but they received broad-based support \nin the Senate, and they stand not for party, but for law and the United \nStates of America.\n  We are in danger of upsetting that balance, of putting on the court \npeople who are committed to an ideological plan. We are seeing people \nwho are being presented to us who will, I think, undermine that sense \nof confidence that the American people must have in the judges they \nface in the courts of this land.\n  Indeed, it is also ironic that today as we discuss this issue of \neviscerating minority rights in the United States Senate, we hear our \nleaders talk about the necessity--the absolute necessity--of protecting \nthe minority in Iraq. If you listen to the President, Secretary of \nState Rice, and others, they talk about how essential it is to ensure \nthat there are real procedural protections for the Sunni minority in \nIraq. In fact, what they are trying to do in Iraq they are trying to \nundo in America by stripping away those procedural protections that \ngive the minority a real voice in our Government.\n  In a recent National Review article by John Cullinan, a former senior \npolicy adviser to the U.S. Catholic Bishops, he said it very well. He \nposed a question in this way:\n\n       Will Iraq's overwhelming Shiite majority accept structural \n     restraints in the form of guaranteed protections for others? \n     Or does the majority see its demographic predominance as a \n     mandate to exercise a monopoly of political power?\n\n  This, in a very telling phrase, sums it up:\n\n       Does a 60-percent majority translate into 100 percent of \n     the political pie?\n\n  The question we will answer today, tomorrow, and this week: Does the \n55-vote majority in the Senate translate to 100 percent of the \npolitical pie when it comes to naming Federal judges? Just as it is \nwrong in Iraq, I believe it is wrong here because without minority \nprotections, without the ability of the minority to exercise their \nrights, to raise their voice, this process is\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\ndoomed to a very difficult and, I think, disastrous end.\n  We have today measures before us that threaten the filibuster, and I \nbelieve this is not the end of the story if this nuclear option \nprevails because I think the pressure by the interest groups that are \npushing this issue--the far right who are demanding that this nuclear \noption be exercised--will not be satisfied by simply naming judges \nbecause that is just part of what we do. They will see in the days \nahead, if this nuclear option succeeds, opportunities to strike out our \nability to stop legislative proposals, to stop other Executive \nnominees. They will be unsatisfied and unhappy that in the course of \ndebate and deliberation here, we are not willing to accept their most \nextreme views about social policy, about economic policy, about the \nworld at large. The pressure that is building today will be brought to \nbear on other matters.\n  So this is a very decisive moment and a very decisive step. I hope we \ncan avoid stepping over it into the abyss. I hope we can maintain the \nprotections that have persisted in this Chamber in one form or another \nfor 214 years. The rules give Senators many opportunities to express \nthemselves. It is not just the cloture vote. There are procedures to \ncall committee hearings, to call up nominees that have been appointed, \nthat also give Senators an opportunity to express themselves.\n  I need not remind many people here that at least 60 of President \nClinton's judicial nominees never received an up-or-down vote, and it \nis ironic, to say the least, that many who participated in that process \nnow claim a constitutional right for an up-or-down vote on a Federal \nnominee to the bench.\n  In fact, according to the Congressional Research Service, since 1945, \napproximately 18 percent of judicial nominees have not received a final \nvote. By that measure, President Bush has done remarkably well by his \nnominees--218 nominees, 208 confirmations, a remarkable record, which \nshows not obstruction but cooperation; which shows that this Senate, \nacting together, with at least 60 votes, but still exercising its \nresponsibility to carefully screen judges has made decisions that by a \nvast majority favor the President's nominees. That is not a record of \nobstruction, that is a record of responsibility.\n  Again, at the heart of this is not simply the interplay of Senators \nand politics. At the end of the day, we have to be able to demonstrate \nto the American public that if they stand before a Federal judge, they \nwill be judged on the law; they will be judged by men and women with \njudicial temperament, who understand not only the law and precedent, \nbut understand they have been given a responsibility to do justice, to \ndemonstrate fairness.\n  If we adopt this new procedure and are able to ram through \npolitically, ideologically motivated judges, that confidence in the \nfairness of federal judges might be fatally shaken and that would do \ndamage to this country of immense magnitude.\n  The procedure that is being proposed is not a straightforward attempt \nto change the rules of the Senate because that also requires a \nsupermajority. No, this is a parliamentary ploy, an end run around the \nrules of the Senate, a circumvention, and a circumvention that will do \nviolence to the process here and, again, I think create a terrible \nexample for the American public.\n  We have difficult choices before us. There are those who suggest that \nit is somehow unconstitutional not to provide an up-or-down vote. Where \nwere they when the 60 judges nominated by President Clinton were denied \nan up-or-down vote? No, the rules of the Senate prevailed at that time, \nas they should prevail at this time because the Constitution clearly \nstates that each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. And \nwe have done that in a myriad of ways and will continue to do that. The \nright to unlimited debate in this Senate is one of the rights that has \nbeen protected by rules that have been in force for many years.\n  We are involved in a debate that has huge consequences for the \ncountry and for the Senate. I believe this institution must remain a \nplace where even an individual Senator can stand up and speak in such a \nway and at such length that he not only arouses the conscience of the \ncountry, but, indeed, he or she may be able to deflect the country away \nfrom a dangerous path.\n  In the 1930s, President Roosevelt also had problems with the court \nsystem, he thought. He decided he would pack the courts. He would \npropose the expansion of the U.S. Supreme Court. Even though it was \nsupported by the majority leader at that time, it was brought to this \nfloor, and a small band of Senators stood up and spoke and convinced \nthe public of the wrongness of that path and saved this country and \nsaved President Roosevelt from a grave mistake.\n\n  Today, once again, we are debating the future of our judicial system, \nand I believe without the filibuster, we will make grave mistakes about \nwho goes on our courts and what will be the makeup of those courts.\n  It might be that I have a particular fondness for the ability to \nrepresent those who are not numerous. I come from the smallest State, \ngeographically, in the country, Rhode Island. We have two Senators, and \nwe have two Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. But myself \nand my colleague, Senator Chafee, can stand up and speak and have the \nforce of any of the larger States in this country. That is an essential \npart of our Federal system, an essential part of the Constitution that \nprovided this wise balance between majority power and minority rights.\n  We are in danger of seeing that power--I believe arrogantly \ndisplayed--potentially undercutting the rights of one Senator or two \nSenators or eight Senators to stand up, to speak truth to power, to \nchallenge the views, to awaken the conscience of the country, to \nprevent the accumulation of so much power that we slowly and perhaps \nimperceptibly slide to a position where there is no effective \nchallenge, and that would do great harm to this constitutional balance.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious debate--a very serious debate. It is \none in which I hope cooler heads prevail. It is one in which I hope we \nall step back and recognize that what we do will affect this \ninstitution and this country for a long time. I hope that we will \nrefrain from invoking this nuclear option, that we recognize the \ntraditions of the Senate not out of nostalgia but because they have \nserved us well, and will continue to serve us well. They will ensure \nthat we can speak not just as an exercise in rhetoric, but to have real \neffect in this body, the greatest deliberative assembly the world has \never known.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor to my colleague from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, President Harry Truman once said that the \nonly thing new in the world is the history that you do not know. And so \nit is today with those who think this effort to amend the rules by \nbreaking them, the nuclear option, is something new under the Sun.\n  This is not the first time that it has been tried. Sadly, there have \nbeen a few other efforts to amend the rules by fiat, but, and this is \nthe crucial point, the Senate has never done it.\n  Whenever an effort was made to change the rule by fiat, it has been \nrejected by this body. There are procedures for amending the Senate's \nrules, and the Senate has always insisted that they be followed. In \nprevious cases, the majority of Senators has stood up for that \nprinciple, often over the wishes of their own party's leader. It is my \nhope there will be a majority of such Senators tomorrow.\n  I entered some of that history in the Congressional Record last week, \nand I will not repeat it all now. One incident stands out and bears \nrepeating, and after doing so, I will add a second chapter to that \nincident.\n  In 1949, Vice President Alben Barkley ruled that cloture applied to a \nmotion to proceed to consideration of a bill. In other words, that rule \nXXII, which allows for the cutoff of debate, applied to a motion to \nproceed to consideration of a bill. The ruling was contrary to Senate \nprecedent and against the advice of the Senate Parliamentarian and was \nmade despite the fact that rule XXII, as it then existed, clearly \nprovided only that the pending matter was subject to cloture.\n  The Senate rejected Vice President Barkley's ruling by a vote of 46 \nto 41. Significantly, 23 Democratic Senators, nearly half of the \nDemocrats voting,\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\nopposed the ruling by the Vice President of their own party. Later, the \nSenate, using the process provided by Senate rules, by a vote of 63 to \n23, adopted a change in rule XXII to include a motion to proceed.\n  After that rule change, changed according to the procedures for \namending rules, a supermajority could end a debate on the motion to \nproceed to a bill, for instance, as well as ending debate on the bill \nitself.\n  Last week, I quoted the words of one of the giants of Senate history, \nSenator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan about that debate. This is what \nSenator Vandenberg said:\n\n       I continue to believe that the rules of the Senate are as \n     important to equity and order in the Senate as is the \n     Constitution to the life of the Republic, and that those \n     rules should never be changed except by the Senate itself, in \n     the direct fashion prescribed by the rules themselves.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       One of the immutable truths in Washington's Farewell \n     Address, which cannot be altered even by changing events in a \n     changing world, is the following sentence: ``The Constitution \n     which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and \n     authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory \n     upon all.''\n\n  [T]he father of his country said to us, by analogy, ``the rules of \nthe Senate which at any time exist until changed by an explicit and \nauthentic act of the whole Senate are sacredly obligatory upon all.''\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       When a substantive change is made in the rules by \n     sustaining a ruling by the Presiding Officer of the Senate--\n     and that is what I contend is being undertaken here--it does \n     not mean that the rules are permanently changed. It simply \n     means, that regardless of precedent or traditional practice, \n     the rules, hereafter, mean whatever the Presiding Officer of \n     the Senate, plus a simple majority of Senators voting at the \n     time, want the rules to mean. We fit the rules to the \n     occasion, instead of fitting the occasion to the rules. \n     Therefore, in the final analysis, under such circumstances, \n     there are no rules except the transient, unregulated wishes \n     of a majority of whatever quorum is temporarily in control of \n     the Senate.\n\n  And Senator Vandenberg added:\n\n       That, Mr. President, is not my idea of the greatest \n     deliberative body in the world. . . . No matter how important \n     [the pending issue's] immediate incidence may seem today, the \n     integrity of the Senate's rules is our paramount concern, \n     today, tomorrow, and so long as this great institution lives.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       This is a solemn decision--reaching far beyond the \n     immediate consequence--and it involves just one \n     consideration. What do the present Senate rules mean; and for \n     the sake of law and order, shall they be protected in that \n     meaning until changed by the Senate itself in the fashion \n     required by the rules?\n\n  Senator Vandenberg eloquently summarized what is at the root of the \nnuclear option:\n\n        . . . [T]he rules of the Senate as they exist at any given \n     time and as they are clinched by precedents should not be \n     changed substantively by the interpretive action of the \n     Senate's Presiding Officer, even with the transient sanction \n     of an equally transient Senate majority. The rules can be \n     safely changed only by the direct and conscious action of the \n     Senate itself, acting in the fashion prescribed by the rules. \n     Otherwise, no rule in the Senate is worth the paper that it \n     is written on, and this so-called ``greatest deliberative \n     body in the world'' is at the mercy of every change in \n     parliamentary authority.\n\n  Mr. President, tonight, I do more than underscore the foresightful \nwords of Senator Vandenberg, which are all the more significant \nbecause, as he made clear, he agreed that the Senate's cloture rule \nneeded to be changed in the fashion proposed but not by using the \nillegitimate process proposed of amending our rules by fiat of a \nPresiding Officer.\n  There was even more to it--and it is again directly relevant to the \nproceeding that is pending. The year was 1948, 1 year before the \nBarkley ruling which I just described. Senator Vandenberg was President \npro tempore of the Senate and was presented with a motion to end debate \non a motion to proceed to consideration of an antipoll tax bill.\n  Senator Vandenberg ruled, as Presiding Officer, that the then-\nlanguage of rule XXII, providing a procedure for terminating debate for \n``measures before the Senate'' did not apply to cutting off debate on \nthe motion to proceed to a measure, even though he thought that it \nshould on the merits. So he ruled against what he believed in on the \nmerits because of his deep belief in the integrity of the rules of the \nSenate. And in making that ruling, again while serving as the Presiding \nOfficer, this is what Senator Vandenberg said.\n\n       The President pro tempore [that's him] finds it necessary . \n     . . before announcing his decision, to state again that he is \n     not passing on the merits of the poll-tax issue nor is he \n     passing on the desirability of a much stronger cloture rule \n     in determining this point of order. The President pro tempore \n     is not entitled to consult his own predilections or his own \n     convictions in the use of this authority. He must act in his \n     capacity as an officer of the Senate, under oath to enforce \n     its rules as he finds them to exist, whether he likes them or \n     not. Of all the precedents necessary to preserve, this is the \n     most important of them all. Otherwise, the preservation of \n     any minority rights for any minority at any time would become \n     impossible.\n\n  Senator Vandenberg continued:\n\n       The President pro tempore is a sworn agent of the law as he \n     finds the law to be. Only the Senate has the right to change \n     the law. The President pro tempore feels that he is entitled \n     particularly to underscore this axiom in the present instance \n     because the present circumstances themselves bring it to such \n     bold and sharp relief.\n\n  He further stated, again referring to himself:\n\n       In his capacity as a Senator, the President pro tempore \n     favors the passage of this anti-poll-tax measure. He has \n     similarly voted on numerous previous occasions. In his \n     capacity as President pro tempore believes that the rules \n     of the Senate should permit cloture upon the pending \n     motion to take up the anti-poll-tax measure, but in his \n     capacity as President pro tempore, the senior Senator from \n     Michigan is bound to recognize what he believes to be the \n     clear mandate of the Senate rules and the Senate \n     precedents; namely that no such authority presently \n     exists.\n  So, again, Senator Vandenberg says that he believes the rules of the \nSenate should be changed to permit cloture on the pending motion to \ntake up the antipoll-tax measure, but he is bound to recognize those \nrules. He cannot rule against what the rules clearly provide.\n  Senator Vandenberg then went on to say:\n\n       If the Senate wishes to cure this impotence it has the \n     authority, the power, and the means to do so. The President \n     pro tempore of the Senate does not have the authority, the \n     power, or the means to do so except as he arbitrarily takes \n     the law into his own hands. This he declines to do in \n     violation of his oath. If he did so, he would feel that the \n     what might be deemed temporary advantage by some could become \n     a precedent which ultimately, in subsequent practice, would \n     rightly be condemned by all.\n\n  I want to emphasize Senator Vandenberg's point for our colleagues. In \nthe view of that great Senator, it would have been a violation of his \noath of office to change the Senate rules by fiat; to rule, as \nPresiding Officer, contrary to the words of the Senate rules, even \nthough he personally agreed with the proposition that the rule needed \nto be changed. Senator Vandenberg's ruling was a doubly difficult one \nbecause it left the Senate with no means of cutting off debate on the \nmotion to proceed to a measure. The Senate then voted to change the \nrule a year or so later, with Senator Vandenberg's support, to allow \nfor cutting off debate on the motion to proceed.\n  Senator Vandenberg's words and his example are highly relevant to us \ntoday. The majority leader's tactic to have the Presiding Officer by \ndecree, by fiat amend our rules by exercising the so-called nuclear \noption is wrong. It has always been wrong. And the Senate has rejected \nit in the past.\n  I want to simply read that one last line of Senator Vandenberg one \nmore time:\n\n       In his capacity as a Senator, the President pro tempore \n     [Senator Vandenberg] favors the passage of the anti-poll-tax \n     measure [before him].\n\n  He has voted for it on similar occasions, he said.\n\n       In his capacity as President pro tempore [he] believes the \n     rules of the Senate should permit cloture on the pending \n     motion to take up the . . . measure. But . . .\n\nand this is the ``but'' which everybody in this Chamber should think \nabout--\n\n     in his capacity as President pro tempore the senior Senator \n     from Michigan is bound to recognize what he believes to be \n     the clear mandate of the Senate rules and the Senate \n     precedents; namely that no such authority presently exists.\n\n  For him to rule as President pro tempore against the clear meaning of \nrule XXII and our rules would be to take the law, the rules, into his \nown hands. Senator Vandenberg was not about to do that.\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\n  Rule XXII is clear. It takes 60 votes to end debate on any measure, \nmotion, or other matter pending before the Senate. It does not make an \nexception for nomination of judges. The nuclear option is not an \ninterpretation of rule XXII. It runs head long into the words of rule \nXXII and our rules. We in this body are the custodians of a great \nlegacy. The unique Senate legacy can be lost if we start down the road \nof amending our rules by fiat of a Presiding Officer. We are going to \nbe judged by future generations for what we do here this week. Arthur \nVandenberg has been judged by history as well. If you want to know what \nthe verdict of history is relative to Arthur Vandenberg, look up when \nwe leave this Chamber at Arthur Vandenberg's portrait in the Senate \nreception room alongside of just six other giants for more than 215 \nyears of Senate history.\n  As the present-day custodians of the great Senate tradition, we \nshould uphold that tradition by rejecting an attempt to change the \nrules by arbitrary decree of the Presiding Officer instead of by the \nprocess in our rules for changing our rules. We must reject that \nattempt to rule by fiat instead of by duly adopted rules of the Senate. \nIn that way, we will pass on to those who follow us a Senate that is \nenhanced, not diminished, by what we do here this week.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to remind \nmy colleagues across the aisle just what the Constitution has to say \nabout the confirmation of judges.\n  In a recent speech on the filibuster of President Bush's judicial \nnominees, I cited the actions of Senator Byrd when he was majority \nleader in 1979 as justification for the proposed constitutional option. \nHowever, the historical precedent for the actions the Minority is \nforcing the majority to take goes much further back than even the \ntenure of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The Senate has the power to confirm or deny the President's judicial \nnominees because the Constitution explicitly grants us that power. \nArticle II, section 2 reads:\n\n       He [the president] shall nominate, and, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, \n     other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme \n     Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose \n     appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, which \n     shall be established by law.\n\n  The President gets to nominate a judge, but only with the consent of \nthe Senate is that judge actually appointed to serve.\n  The Constitution is not totally clear on the surface as to what \nshould constitute ``advice and consent'' by the Senate. But, \nfortunately, our Founding Fathers provided us with not just a \nConstitution but with a whole raft of writings that help us understand \njust what they were thinking when they drafted it. Those records \nconfirm, I believe, that they were not concerned with a clash between \npolitical parties when they wrote the Constitution, but with the \nbalance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial \nbranches.\n  The history of the ``advice and consent'' clause suggests that the \nFounders were uncomfortable with either branch completely controlling \nthe nomination of judges. As a result, they found a compromise that \nsought to prevent either the executive or the legislative branch from \ndominating the nomination process.\n  In the Constitutional Convention of 1787, there was lengthy \ndiscussion about who should appoint judges to the bench--the executive \nor the legislative branch.\n  After extensive debate, the delegates to the Constitutional \nConvention rejected the possibility that the power to elect judges \nwould reside exclusively with one body or another. On June 5, 1787, the \nRecords of the Federal Convention record James Madison's thoughts on \nthe issue:\n\n       Mr. Madison disliked the election of the Judges by the \n     Legislature or any numerous body. Besides the danger of \n     intrigue and partiality, many of the members were not judges \n     of the requisite qualifications. . . . On the other hand he \n     was not satisfied with referring the appointment to the \n     Executive.\n\n  Madison and others were concerned that vesting the sole power of \nappointment in the executive would lead to bias and favoritism.\n  In the end, the Framers of the Constitution arrived at the language I \njust read. Should there be any doubt as to what was intended, Alexander \nHamilton and others provided us with the Federalist papers. In \nFederalist 76, Hamilton discusses the nominations clause:\n\n       . . . his [referring to the president] nomination may be \n     overruled: this it certainly may, yet it can only be to make \n     a place for another nomination by himself. The person \n     ultimately selected must be the object of his preference. . . \n     .\n\n  Let me emphasize that--Hamilton says the person elected is ultimately \nthe object of the president's preference. That suggests to me that it \nis not up to the Senate to demand that nominees be withdrawn and that \nothers be nominated in accordance with the leadership in the Senate or \nthe home State senators of the nominee. It sounds to me like the \nFramers intended for the president to choose and then the Senate to \neither reject or accept the nominee.\n  However, I would argue that we don't even need to look to Hamilton to \ndecide that the eventual appointee should be the object of the \npresident's preference. Look where the power to nominate and appoint is \nplaced in the Constitution--in article II, which sets out the powers of \nthe President--not Congress.\n  In Federalist 76, Hamilton goes on to describe the role of the \nSenate:\n\n       To what purpose then require the cooperation of the Senate? \n     I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have \n     a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would \n     be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the \n     President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment \n     of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family \n     connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to \n     popularity.\n\n  Nowhere in that description of the Senate's role does it suggest that \nthe Senate is supposed to reject nominations based on judges' views of \nthe issues. It suggests that we are here to prevent the president from \nappointing only nominees from Texas, from appointing only friends or \ncampaign contributors, or from otherwise abusing this power. It does \nnot suggest that we should go through a lengthy process of trying to \nanticipate how a particular judge would rule on all future cases that \nmay come before him or her.\n  In fact, given that it was the intent of the Founders to create an \nappointments process that would allow for the appointment of judges who \ncould serve as a check on the other two branches, I think they would be \nappalled to think that the Senate might be prepared to block any judges \nthat will not rule on abortion or gay marriage or the reinsertion of a \nfeeding tube in the way the Senate happens to favor at any one time. \nThat sounds to me like anything but an independent judiciary branch. \nWhat's next? Will senators ask judges how they will rule on pending \nbills and support only those judges who will uphold the laws passed by \nthis body?\n  The role of the Senate having been established, I also want to \naddress the mechanism by which we confirm these judges.\n  The issue before us centers around whether the Constitution requires \na simple majority or a supermajority to confirm judicial nominations. \nOnce again, an analysis of the history suggests that it was the \nintention of the Framers to provide for only a simple majority of the \nSenate to confirm nominees.\n  Look at the language of all of article II, section 2. In the clause \nimmediately before the nominations clause, the Constitution \nspecifically calls for two-thirds of the Senate to concur. In the \nnominations clause, there is no such provision.\n  I don't believe that this is an inadvertent omission. During the \ndrafting of the Constitution, Roger Sherman of Connecticut argued at \ngreat length for the insertion of a comma instead of a semicolon at one \npoint to make a section on Congressional powers crystal clear. I find \nit hard to believe that in the meantime the Framers deliberately left \nthis section vague.\n  In fact, the debate around this section of the bill suggests that \nthere was a specific discussion about how many Senate votes would be \nrequired to confirm judges. On July 18, 1787, James Madison proposed a \nplan that would allow judges to be confirmed with only one-third of the \nSenate. The record of the debate states that Madison felt that such a \nrequirement would ``unite the advantage of responsibility in the\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nExecutive with the security afforded in the second branch against any \nincautious or corrupt nomination by the Executive.''\n  So that sounds to me like the Framers viewed the role of the Senate \nin such a way as to consider the possibility that even less than a \nmajority could be required to confirm a judge--because the Senate was \nthere as backstop to prevent the appointment of political cronies and \nunfit characters. That is a far cry from the role my colleagues across \nthe aisle would like for us to play today--that of co-equal to the \npresident in the process and capable of demanding nominees that would \nrule in favor of their positions.\n  Madison's language was not adopted, but the language that was adopted \ncertainly cannot be read to require a supermajority. You don't have to \njust accept my interpretation of this language. Shortly after the \nConstitutional Convention, Justice Joseph Story--appointed to the \nSupreme Court by President James Madison--wrote his Commentaries on the \nConstitution and stated explicitly:\n\n       The president is to nominate, and thereby has the sole \n     power to select for office; but his nomination cannot confer \n     office, unless approved by a majority of the Senate.\n\n  Judges are to be confirmed by a majority vote. That is the bottom \nline. That decision was made long before the first Senate was gaveled \ninto session and before any thought was given to rules of procedure and \nfilibusters.\n  You will hear during this debate ominous warnings from my colleagues \nacross the aisle about ``the tyranny of the majority.'' You will hear \nthat the Founders intended for the Senate to protect the rights of the \nminority. You will hear that our Founders created the Senate as a check \non the popular whim of the day, as a place to slow down legislation and \nensure that only the very best laws are passed. This is true. George \nWashington is said to have said of the Senate that ``we pour \nlegislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it.''\n\n  But the Founders did not create the Senate to give a minority of \nSenators the power to stop the President from appointing judges. Quite \nthe opposite. As I have outlined, James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, \ntwo of the greatest minds that helped design our Constitution, put it \ndown in writing for us that judges are to be confirmed by a majority \nvote.\n  So it is not a new idea for the majority in the Senate to believe \nthey should have the power to confirm the president's nominees. It is a \nvery old idea that dates back to the founding of our country.\n  It is a new idea, however, that a minority should have the power to \ndeny the President's choice. The minority used the filibuster rule in \nthe Senate 10 times in the last Congress to create this new idea that \n40 percent should be able to thwart the will of both the President and \nthe majority. It is time for us to restore the Senate to the operation \nenvisioned by the Founding Fathers more than 200 years ago that the \nPresident's judicial nominees should be able to be confirmed by \nmajority vote.\n  Mr. President, 2 years ago, my first speech as a Member of the Senate \nwas on the topic of judges. I have spoken many times since then on this \nsame subject. I would like to not talk about it again--other than to \ndiscuss the merits of a particular judge before having an up-or-down \nvote on confirmation.\n  That is the way we have functioned in the past, it is the way the \nFounders meant for us to operate, and it is the way the American people \nshould demand their elected representatives work together.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have made no secret how I regard the \nRepublican Leader's bid for one-party rule through his insistence to \ntrigger the ``nuclear option.'' I view it as a misguided effort that \nwould undercut the checks and balances that the Senate provides in our \nsystem of government, undermine the rights of the American people, \nweaken the independence and fairness of the Federal courts, and destroy \nminority rights here in the Senate. In that regard, I thank the \nSenators who joined in the debate on Friday for their contributions, \nincluding in particular Senator Dodd, Senator Levin, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Dayton, Senator Lincoln, Senator Lieberman and Senator Dorgan. \nTheirs were outstanding statements.\n  The Senate is not the House. It was not intended to function like the \nHouse. The ``Great Compromise'' of the Constitutional Convention more \nthan 200 years ago was to create in the Senate a different legislative \nbody from the House of Representatives. Those fundamental differences \ninclude equal representation for each State in accordance with article \nI, section 3. Thus, Vermont has equal numbers of Senators to New York \nand Idaho, as compared to California. The Founders intended this as a \nvital check. Representation in the Senate is not a function of \npopulation or based on the size of a State or its mineral wealth.\n  Another key difference is the right to debate in the Senate. The \nfilibuster is quintessentially a Senate practice. James Madison wrote \nin Federalist No. 63 that the Senate was intended to provide \n``interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens'' \nagainst ``illicit advantage'' and the ``artful misrepresentations of \ninterested men.'' It was designed and intended as a check and to \nprovide balance. In no way do I intend to disrespect the House of \nRepresentatives by these remarks. I respect the House. I respect its \ntraditions. But it is the Senate that protects the minority and thereby \nserves a special role in our national government.\n  Others have alluded to some valuable history lessons during the \ncourse of this debate. One of those lessons comes from 1937, the last \ntime a President sought to pack the courts. President Franklin \nRoosevelt was coming off a landslide victory over Alf Landon. He \nattempted to pack the Supreme Court. Democrats--Senators from President \nRoosevelt's own party--stood up to him. In May 1937 the Senate \nJudiciary Committee criticized the Roosevelt court-packing plan as an \neffort by the executive branch to dominate the Judicial Branch with the \nacquiescence of the legislative branch. The Senate stood up for checks \nand balances and protected the independence of the judiciary. It is \ntime again for the Senate to stand up, and I hope that there are \nSenators of this President's party who have the courage to do so, \ntoday.\n  The Constitution nowhere says that judicial confirmations require 51 \nvotes. Indeed, when Vermont became the 14th State in 1791, there were \nthen only 28 Members of the U.S. Senate. More recently, Supreme Court \nJustices Sherman Minton, Louis Brandeis, and James McReynolds were \nconfirmed with 48 votes, 47 votes and 44 votes, respectively.\n  As the Republican leader admitted in debate with Senator Byrd last \nweek, there is also no language in the Constitution that creates a \nright to a vote for a nomination or a bill. If there were such a right, \nit was violated more than 60 times when Republicans refused to consider \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service more than 500 judicial nominations for circuit and \ndistrict courts have not received a final Senate vote between 1945 and \n2004--over 500--that is 18 percent of those nominations. By contrast, \nthis President has seen more than 95 percent of his judicial \nnominations confirmed, 208 to date.\n  The Constitution provides for the Senate to establish its own rules \nin accordance with article I, section 5. The Senate rules have for some \ntime expressly provided for nominations not acted upon by the Senate--\n``neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at which they are \nmade''--being ``returned by the Secretary to the President.'' That is \nwhat happened to those 500 nominations over the last 60 years.\n  What the Republican leadership is seeking to do is to change the \nSenate rules not in accordance with them but by breaking them. It is \nironic that Republican Senators, who prevented votes on more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees and hundreds of his executive \nbranch nominees because one anonymous Republican Senator objected, now \ncontend that the votes on nominations are constitutionally required.\n  No President in our history, from George Washington on, has ever \ngotten all his judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate. President \nWashington's nomination of John Rutledge to be Chief Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court was not confirmed by the Senate. Senate Republicans \nnow deny the\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nfilibusters they attempted against President Clinton's judicial \nnominees and they ignore the filibusters they succeeded in using \nagainst his executive branch nominees. They seek not only to rewrite \nthe Senate's rules by breaking them but to rewrite history. I ask that \na copy of the recent article by Professor John J. Flynn be included in \nthe Record.\n  Helping to fuel this rush toward the nuclear option is new vitriol \nthat is being heaped both upon those who oppose a handful of \ncontroversial nominees and oppose the nuclear option, as well as on the \njudiciary itself. We have seen threats from House Majority Leader Tom \nDelay and others about mass impeachments of judges with whom they \ndisagree. We have seen Federal judges compared to the KKK, called ``the \nfocus of evil,'' and we have heard those supporting this effort quote \nJoseph Stalin's violent answer to anyone who opposed his \ntotalitarianism by urging the formula of ``No man, No problem.'' Stalin \nkilled those with whom he disagreed. That is what the Stalinist \nsolution is to independence. Regrettably, we have heard a Senator \ntrying to relate the recent rash of courtroom violence and the killings \nof judges and judges' family members with philosophical differences \nabout the way some courts have ruled.\n\n  This debate in the Senate last week started with rhetoric from the \nother side accusing disagreeing Senators of seeking to ``kill'' and \n``assassinate.'' Later in the week another member of the Republican \nleadership likened Democratic opponents of the nuclear option to Adolph \nHitler. Still another Republican Senator accused Senators who oppose \njudicial nominees of discriminating against people of faith. This is in \ndirect violation of the Republican leader's own statement at the outset \nof this debate that the rhetoric in this debate should ``follow the \nrules, and best traditions of the Senate.'' This has sunk too low and \nit has got to stop.\n  It is one thing for those outside the Senate to engage in incendiary \nrhetoric. In fact, I would have expected Senators and other leaders to \ncall for a toning down of such rhetoric rather than participating and \nlending support to events that unfairly smear Senators as against \npeople of faith. Within the last several days, the Rev. Pat Robertson \ncalled Federal judges, quote, ``a more serious threat to America then \nAl Qaeda and the Sept. 11 terrorists'' and ``more serious than a few \nbearded terrorists who fly into buildings.'' He went on to proclaim the \nFederal judiciary ``the worst threat American has faced in 400 years \nworse than Nazi Germany, Japan and the Civil War.'' This is the sort of \nincendiary rhetoric that Republican Senators should be disavowing. \nInstead, they are adopting it and exploiting it in favor of their \nnuclear option.\n  It is base and it is wrong, and just the sort of overheated rhetoric \nthat we should all repudiate. Not repeating such slander is not good \nenough. We should reject it and do so on a bipartisan basis. \nRepublicans as well as Democrats should affirmatively reject such harsh \nrhetoric. It does not inspire; it risks inciting.\n  Last week as we began this debate, the Judiciary Committee heard the \ntestimony of Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago. She is the Federal judge \nwhose mother and husband were murdered in their home. She counsels: \n``In this age of mass communication, harsh rhetoric is truly dangerous. \n[F]ostering disrespect for judges can only encourage those that are on \nthe edge, or on the fringe, to exact revenge on a judge who ruled \nagainst them.'' She urged us as public leaders to condemn such \nrhetoric. I agree with her. She is right and she has paid dearly for \nthe right to say so.\n  Those driving the nuclear option engage in a dangerous and corrosive \ngame of religious McCarthyism, in which anyone daring to oppose one of \nthis President's judicial nominees is branded as being anti-Christian, \nor anti-Catholic, or ``against people of faith.'' It continued over the \nlast several weekends, it continued last week on the Senate floor. It \nis wrong; it is reprehensible. These charges, this virulent religious \nMcCarthyism, are fraudulent on their face and destructive.\n  Injecting religion into politics to claim a monopoly on piety and \npolitical truth by demonizing those you disagree with is not the \nAmerican way. Injecting politics into judicial nominations, as this \nadministration has done, is wrong, as well.\n  I would like to keep the Senate safe and secure and in a ``nuclear \nfree'' zone. The partisan power play now underway by Republicans will \nundermine the checks and balances established by the Founders in the \nConstitution. It is a giant leap toward one-party rule with an \nunfettered Executive controlling all three branches of the Federal \nGovernment. It not only will demean the Senate and destroy the comity \non which it depends; it also will undermine the strong, independent \nFederal judiciary that has protected the rights and liberties of all \nAmericans against the overreaching of the political branches.\n  Our Senate Parliamentarian and our Congressional Research Service \nhave said that the so-called nuclear option would go against Senate \nprecedent. Do Republicans really want to blatantly break the rules for \nshort-term political gain? Do they really desire to turn the Senate \ninto a place where the parliamentary equivalent of brute force is what \nprevails?\n  Just as the Constitution provides in article V for a method of \namendment, so, too, the Senate rules provide for their own amendment. \nSadly, the current crop of partisans who are seeking to limit debate \nand minority rights in the Senate have little respect for the Senate, \nits role in our government as a check on the executive, or its rules. \nRepublicans are in the majority in the Senate and chair all of its \ncommittees, including the Rules Committee. If Republicans have a \nserious proposal to change the Senate rules, they should introduce it. \nThe Rules Committee should hold meaningful hearings on it and consider \nit and create a full and fair record so that the Senate itself would be \nin position to consider it. That is what we used to call ``regular \norder.'' That is how the Senate is intended to operate, through \ndeliberative processes and with all points of view being protected and \nbeing heard.\n  That is not how the ``nuclear option'' will work. It is intended to \nwork outside established precedents and procedures. Use of the \n``nuclear option'' in the Senate is akin to amending the Constitution \nnot by following the procedures required by article V but by \nproclaiming that 50 Republican Senators and the Vice President have \ndetermined that every copy of the Constitution shall contain a new \nsection--or not contain some of those troublesome amendments that \nAmericans like to call the Bill or Rights. That is wrong. It is a kind \nof lawlessness that each of us should oppose. It is rule by the \nparliamentary equivalent of brute force.\n  Never in our history has the Senate changed its governing rules \nexcept in accordance with those rules. I was a young Senator in 1975 \nwhen Senate rule XXII was last amended. It was amended after cloture on \nproceeding to the resolution to change the rule was invoked in \naccordance with rule XXII itself and after cloture on the resolution \nwas invoked in accordance with the requirement then and still in our \nrules that ending debate on a rule change requires the concurrence of \ntwo-thirds of the Senate. That was achieved in 1975 due in large part \nto the extraordinary statesmanship and leadership of Senator Byrd. And \nthen the Senate adopted the resolution, which I supported. The \nresolution we adopted reduced the number of votes needed to end debate \nin the Senate from two-thirds to three-fifths of those Senators duly \nchosen and sworn. The Senate has operated under these rules to \nterminate debate on legislative matters and nominations for the last 30 \nyears. Before that the Senate's requirement to bring debate to a close \nwas even more exacting and required more Senators to vote to end a \nfilibuster. I say, again, that the change in the Senate rules was \naccomplished in accordance with the Senate rules and the way in which \nthey provide for their own amendment.\n\n  There has been a good deal of chest pounding on the other side of the \naisle recently about the supposed sanctity of 51 votes to prevail, to \nend debate, to amend the Senate rules. Senators know that, in truth, \nthere are a number of instances in which 60 votes are needed to \nprevail. These are not theoretical matters, but matters constantly used \nby Republican leaders to thwart ``majority'' votes on matters they do \nnot like.\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\n  The most common 60-vote threshold is what is required to prevail on a \nmotion to waive a series of points of orders arising from the Budget \nAct and budget resolutions. In fact, just this year in the deficit-\ncreating budget passed by the Senate with Republican votes, they \ncreated new points of order that will require 60 votes in order to be \novercome.\n  There are dozens of recent examples, but a few should make this \nconcrete. In March 2001, a majority of Senators voted to establish a \nSocial Security and Medicare ``lockbox.'' That was a good idea. Had we \nbeen able to prevail then, maybe some of the problems being faced by \nthe Social Security trust fund and Medicare might have been averted or \nmitigated. But even though 53 Senators voted to waive the point of \norder and create the lockbox, it was not adopted by the Senate.\n  There is another example from soon after the 9/11 attacks. A number \nof us were seeking to provide financial assistance, training and health \ncare coverage for aviation industry employees who lost their jobs as a \nresult of the terrorist attacks. We had a bipartisan coalition of more \nthan 50 Senators; it was, as I recall, 56. But the votes of 56 Senators \nwere not sufficient to end the debate and enact that assistance.\n  I also remember an instance in October 2001, when I chaired the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nI very much wanted to have the Senate do our job and complete our \nconsideration of the funding measure necessary to meet the commitments \nmade by President Bush to foreign governments and to provide life-\nsaving assistance around the world. We voted on whether the Senate \nwould be allowed to proceed to consider the bill--not to pass it, mind \nyou, just to proceed to debate it. Republicans objected to considering \nthe bill both times. We were required to make a formal motion to \nproceed to the bill. Then minority Senators, Republican Senators, \nfilibustered proceeding to consideration of the bill. We were required \nto petition for cloture to ask the Senate to agree to end the debate on \nwhether to proceed to consider the bill and begin that consideration. \nFifty Senators voted to end the debate. Only 47 Senators voted to \ncontinue the filibuster. Still, the majority, with 50 votes to 47 votes \ndid not prevail. Although we had a majority, we failed and the Senate \ndid not make progress.\n  It happened again, in the summer of 2002, a bipartisan majority here \nin the Senate wanted to make progress on hate crimes legislation. The \nSenate got bogged down when the bill was filibustered. The effort to \nend the debate and vote up or down on the bill got 54 votes, 54 to 43. \nFifty Senators voted to end the debate. Only 43 Senators voted to \ncontinue the filibuster. Did the majority prevail? No. The bill was not \npassed.\n  More recently, in 2004, 59 Senators supported a 6-month extension of \na program providing unemployment benefits to individuals who had \nexhausted their State benefits. Those 59 Senators were not enough of a \nmajority to overcome a point of order and provide the much-needed \nbenefits for people suffering from extensive and longstanding \nunemployment. The vote was 59 to 40, but that was not a prevailing \nmajority.\n  Around the same time in 2004 we tried to provide the Federal \nassistance needed to fund compliance with the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. Although 56 Senates voted in support and \nonly 41 in opposition, that was not enough to overcome a point of \norder. The vote was 56 to 41, but that was not a sufficient majority.\n  Just last month, too recently to have been forgotten, there was an \neffort to amend the emergency supplemental appropriations bill to \ninclude the bipartisan Agricultural Jobs bill that Senator Craig has \nchampioned. That amendment was filibustered and the Senate voted \nwhether to end debate on the matter. The vote was 53 in favor of \nterminating further debate and proceeding to consider this much needed \nand long overdue measure. Were those 53 Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, enough of a majority to have the Senate proceed to consider \nan up or down vote on the AgJobs bill to help our local industries? No, \nhere, again, the Republican leadership prevailed and prevented \nconsideration of the bipartisan measure with only 45 votes.\n  Every Senator knows, and others who have studied the Senate and its \npractices to protect minority rights, know that the Senate rules \nretained a provision that requires a two-thirds vote to end debate on a \nproposed change to the Senate rules. Thus, rule XXII provides that \nending debate on ``a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules'' \ntakes ``two-thirds of the Senators present and voting.'' If all 100 \nSenators vote, that means that 67 votes are required to end debate on a \nproposal to amend the Senate rules. In 1975, for example, the vote to \nend debate on the resolution I have spoken about to change the Senate \nrules was 73 to 21.\n  Every Senator knows that for the last 30 years, since we lowered the \ncloture requirement in 1975, it takes ``three-fifths of the Senators \nduly chosen and sworn,'' or 60 votes to end debate on other measures \nand matters brought before the Senate. Just recently there was a \nfilibuster on President Bush's nomination to head the Environmental \nProtection Agency, Douglas Johnson. Sixty-one Senators voted to end \nthat filibuster, to bring that debate to a close, and Mr. Johnson was \nconfirmed. I voted for cloture and for Mr. Johnson. Despite Republican \nfilibusters of Dr. Henry Foster to be the Surgeon General, Sam Brown to \nbe an ambassador and others during the Clinton years, I considered the \nmatter on its merits, as I always try to do, and voted to provide the \nsupermajority needed for Senate action.\n  So when Republican talking points trumpet the sanctity of 51 votes, \nSenators know that the Republican majority insists upon 60-vote \nthresholds all the time, or rather all the time that it is in their \nshort-term interests.\n  Finally, Mr. President, for purposes of the record, I need to set the \nrecord straight, again. I have done so periodically, including most \nrecently on May 9, 2005, and toward the end of the last session of \nCongress on November 23, 2004.\n  Unlike the frog in the water who fails to notice the heat slowly \nrising until he finds himself boiling, Democrats have been warning for \nyears that the Republican destruction of Senate rules and traditions \nwas leading us to this situation. The administration and its \nfacilitators in the Senate have left Democrats in a position where the \nonly way we could effectively express our opposition to a judicial \nnominee was through the use of the filibuster.\n  We did not come to this crossroads overnight. No Democratic Senator \nwanted to filibuster, not a one of us came to those votes easily. We \nhope we are never forced by an aggressive Executive and compliance \nmajority into another filibuster for a judicial nominee, again. The \nfilibusters, like the confrontation that the Senate is being forced \ninto over the last several days, are the direct result of a deliberate \nattack by the current administration and its supporters here in the \nSenate against the rules and traditions of the Senate. Breaking the \nrules to use the Republican majority to gut Senate rule XXII and \nprohibit filibusters that Republicans do not like is the culmination of \ntheir efforts. That is intended to clear the way for this President to \nappoint a more extreme and more divisive choice should a vacancy arise \non the Supreme Court.\n  This is not how the Senate has worked or should work. It is the \nthreat of a filibuster that should encourage the President to moderate \nhis choices and work with Senators on both sides of the aisle. Instead, \nthis President has politicized the process and Senate Republicans have \nsystematically eliminated every other traditional protection for the \nminority. Now their target is the Senate filibuster, the only tool that \nwas left for a significant Senate minority to be heard.\n  Under pressure from the White House, over the last 2 years, the \nformer Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee led Senate \nRepublicans in breaking with longstanding precedent and Senate \ntradition with respect to handling lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench. With the Senate and the White House under control of the same \npolitical party we have witnessed one committee rule after another \nbroken or misinterpreted away. The Framer's of the Constitution warned \nagainst the dangers of such factionalism, undermining the structural \nseparation of powers. Republicans in the Senate have utterly failed to \ndefend this institution's role as a check on the President in the area \nof nominations. It surely\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nweakens our constitutional design of checks and balances.\n  As I have detailed over the last several years, Senate Republicans \nhave had one set of practices to delay and defeat a Democratic \nPresident's moderate and qualified judicial nominations and a different \nplaybook to rubberstamp a Republican President's extreme choices to \nlifetime judicial positions. The list of broken rules and precedents is \nlong--from the way that home State Senators were treated, to the way \nhearings were scheduled, to the way the committee questionnaire was \nunilaterally altered, to the way the Judiciary Committee's historic \nprotection of the minority by committee rule IV was repeatedly \nviolated. In the last Congress, the Republican majority of the \nJudiciary Committee destroyed virtually every custom and courtesy that \nhad been used throughout Senate history to help create and enforce \ncooperation and civility in the confirmation process.\n  We suffered through 3 years during which Republican staff stole \nDemocratic files off the Judiciary computers reflecting a ``by any \nmeans necessary'' approach. It is as if those currently in power \nbelieve that that they are above our constitutional checks and balances \nand that they can reinterpret any treaty, law, rule, custom or practice \nthey do not like or they find inconvenient.\n  The Constitution mandates that the President seek the Senate's advice \non lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. Up until 4 years ago, \nPresidents engaged in consultation with home State Senators about \njudicial nominations, both trial court and appellate nominations. This \nconsultation made sense: Although the judgeships are Federal positions, \nhome State officials were best able to ensure that the nominees would \nbe respected. The structure laid out by the framers for involving the \nSenate contemplated local involvement in the appointments, and for \nalmost 200 years, with relatively few exceptions, the system worked. \nThis administration, by contrast, rejects our advice but demands our \nconsent.\n  The sort of consultation and accommodation that went on in the \nClinton years is an excellent example. The Clinton White House went to \ngreat lengths to work with Republican Senators and seek their advice on \nappointments to both circuit and district court vacancies. There were \nmany times when the White House made nominations at the direct \nsuggestion of Republican Senators, and there are judges sitting today \non the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit, in the district courts in \nArizona, Utah, Mississippi, and many other places because President \nClinton listened to the advice of Senators in the opposite party. Some \nnominations, like that of William Traxler to the Fourth Circuit from \nSouth Carolina; Barbara Durham and Richard Tallman to the Ninth Circuit \nfrom Washington; Stanley Marcus to the Eleventh Circuit from Florida; \nTed Stewart to the District Court in Utah; James Teilborg to the \nDistrict Court in Arizona; Allen Pepper to the District Court in \nMississippi; Barclay Surrick to the District Court in Pennsylvania, and \nmany others were made on the recommendation of Republican Senators. \nOthers, such as President Clinton's two nominations to the Supreme \nCourt, were made with extensive input from Republican Senators. For \nevidence of this, just look at Orrin Hatch's book ``Square Peg,'' where \nhe tells the story of suggesting to President Clinton that he nominate \nRuth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court and of \nwarning him off of other nominees whose confirmations would be more \ncontroversial or politically divisive.\n  In contrast, since the beginning of its time in the White House, this \nBush administration has sought to overturn traditions of bipartisan \nnominating commissions and to run roughshod over the advice of \nDemocratic Senators. They changed the systems in Wisconsin, Washington, \nand Florida that had worked so well for so many years. Senators Graham \nand Nelson were compelled to write in protest of the White House \ncounsel's flaunting of the time-honored procedures for choosing \nqualified candidates for the bench. They ignored the protests of \nSenators like Barbara  Boxer and John Edwards who not only objected to \nthe unsuitable nominee proposed by the White House, but who, in \nattempts to reach a true compromise, also suggested Republican \nalternatives. Those overtures were flatly rejected.\n\n  Indeed, the problems we face today in Michigan are a result of a lack \nof consultation with that State's Senators. The failure of the \nnomination of Claude Allen of Virginia to a Maryland seat on the Fourth \nCircuit shows how aggressive this White House has been. Now, the White \nHouse counsel's office will say it informs Democratic Senators' offices \nof nominations about to be made. Do not be fooled. Consultation \ninvolves a give and take, a back and forth, an actual conversation with \nthe other party and an acknowledgement of the other's position. That \ndoes not happen.\n  The lack of consultation by this President and his nominations team \nresulted in a predictable outcome--a number of instances where home \nState Senators withheld their consent to nominations. The next action, \nhowever, was unpredictable and unprecedented. The former Republican \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee went ahead, ignored his own perfect \nrecord of honoring Republican home State Senators' objections to \nPresident Clinton's nominees and scheduled hearings nonetheless. In \ndefense of those hearings we have heard how other chairmen, Senators \nKennedy and Biden, modified the committee's policies to allow for more \nfairness in the consideration of a more diverse Federal bench. That is \nnot what the former Republican chairman was doing, however. His was a \ncase of double standards--one set of rules and practices for honoring \nRepublican objections to President Clinton's nominees and another for \noverriding Democratic objections to President Bush's.\n  While it is true that various chairmen of the Judiciary Committee \nhave used the blue-slip in different ways, some to maintain unfairness, \nand others to attempt to remedy it, it is also true that each of those \nchairmen was consistent in his application of his own policy--that is, \nuntil 2 years ago. When a hearing was held for Carolyn Kuhl, a nominee \nto the Ninth Circuit from California who lacked consent from both of \nher home State Senators, that was the first time that the former \nchairman had ever convened a hearing for a judicial nominee who did not \nhave two positive blue slips returned to the committee. The first time, \never. It was unprecedented and directly contrary to the former \nRepublican chairman's practices during the Clinton years.\n  Consider the two different blue slips utilized by the former \nRepublican Chairman: one used while President Clinton was in office, \nand one used after George W. Bush became the President. These pieces of \nblue paper are what then-Chairman Hatch used to solicit the opinions of \nhome-state Senators about the President's nominees. When President \nClinton was in office, the blue slip sent to Senators, asked their \nconsent. On the face of the form was written the following: ``Please \nreturn this form as soon as possible to the nominations office. No \nfurther proceedings on this nominee will be scheduled until both blue \nslips have been returned by the nominee's home state senators.''\n  Now consider the blue slip when President Bush began his first term. \nThat form sent out to Senators was unilaterally changed. The new \nRepublican blue slip said simply: ``Please complete the attached blue \nslip form and return it as soon as possible to the committee office.'' \nThat change in the blue slip form marked the about-face in the \ndirection of the policy and practice used by the former Republican \nchairman once the person doing the nominating was a Republican.\n  I understand why Republican Senators want to have amnesia when it \ncomes to what happened to so many of President Clinton's nominees. The \ncurrent Republican chairman calculates that 70 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees were not acted upon. One of the many techniques used \nby the former Republican chairman was to enforce strictly his blue slip \npolicy so that no nominee to any court received a hearing unless both \nhome State Senators agreed to it. Any objection acted as an absolute \nbar to the consideration of any nominee to any court. No time limit was \nset for returning the blue slip. No reason had to be articulated. In \nfact, the former Republican chairman cloaked the matter in secrecy\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nfrom the public. I was the first Judiciary chairman to make blue slips \npublic. During the Clinton years home State Senators' blue slips were \nallowed to function as anonymous holds on otherwise qualified nominees. \nIn the 106th Congress, in 1999-2000, more than half of President \nClinton's circuit court nominees were denied confirmation through such \nsecret partisan obstruction, with only 15 of 34 confirmed in the end. \nOutstanding and qualified nominees were never allowed a hearing, an up \nor down vote in committee vote or on the Senate floor. These nominees \nincluded the current dean of the Harvard Law School, a former attorney \ngeneral from Iowa, a former law clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist and \nmany others--women, men, Hispanics, African Americans and other \nminorities, an extensive collection of qualified nominees.\n  Another longstanding tradition that was broken in the last two years \nwas a consistent and reasonable pace of hearings. Perhaps it is not \nentirely accurate to say the tradition had been respected during the \nClinton administration, since during Republican control months could go \nby without a single hearing being scheduled. But as soon as the \noccupant of the White House changed and a Republican majority \ncontrolled the committee that all changed. In January, 2003, one \nhearing was held for three controversial circuit court nominees, \nscheduled to take place in the course of a very busy day in the Senate. \nThere was no precedent for this in the years that Republicans served in \nthe majority and a Democrat was in the White House. In 6 years during \nthe Clinton administration, never once were three circuit court \nnominees, let alone three very controversial ones, before this body in \na single hearing. But it was the very first hearing that was scheduled \nby the former Republican chairman when he resumed his chairmanship. \nThat first year of the 107th Congress, with a Republican in the White \nHouse, and a Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the \nRepublican majority went from idling--the restrained pace it had said \nwas required for Clinton nominees--to overdrive for the most \ncontroversial of President Bush's nominees.\n  When there was a Democratic President in the White House, circuit \nnominees were delayed and deferred, and vacancies on the courts of \nappeals more than doubled under Republican leadership, from 16 in \nJanuary 1995, to 33 when the Democratic majority took over midway \nthrough 2001.\n  Under Democratic leadership we held hearings on 20 circuit court \nnominees in 17 months. Indeed, while Republicans averaged seven \nconfirmations to the circuit courts every 12 months for President \nClinton, the Senate under Democratic leadership confirmed 17 circuit \njudges in its 17 months in the majority--and we did so with a White \nHouse that was historically uncooperative.\n  Under Republican control, the Judiciary Committee played fast and \nloose with other practices. One of those was the committee practice of \nplacing nominees on markup agendas only if they had answered all of \ntheir written questions within a reasonable amount of time before the \nmeeting. Last Congress that changed, and nominees were listed when the \nformer chairman wanted them listed, whether they were ready or not. Of \ncourse, any nominee can be held over one time by any member for any \nreason, according to longstanding committee rules. By listing the \nnominees before they were ready, the former chairman ``burned the \nhold'' in advance, circumvented the committee rule, and forced the \ncommittee to consider them before they were ready. Another element of \nunfairness was thereby introduced into the process.\n  Yet another example of the kind of petty changes that occurred during \nthe last Congress were the bipartisan changes to the committee \nquestionnaire that were unilaterally rescinded by the former Republican \nchairman. In April of 2003 it became clear that the President's \nnominees had stopped filling out the revised Judiciary Committee \nquestionnaire we had approved a year and a half earlier with the \nagreement of the administration and Senate Republicans. It was a shame, \nbecause my staff and Senator Hatch's staff worked hard to revise the \nold questionnaire, which had not been changed in many years, and was in \nneed of updating for a number of reasons. There were obsolete \nreferences, vague and redundant requests for information, and \ninstructions sorely in need of clarification. There were also important \npieces of information not asked for in the old questionnaire, including \ncongressional testimony a nominee might have given, writings a nominee \nmight have published on the Internet, and a nominee's briefs or other \nfilings in the Supreme Court of the United States. We worked hard to \ninclude the concerns of all members of the committee, and we included \nthe suggestions from many people who had been involved in the judicial \nnominations process over a number of years.\n  Indeed, after the work was finished, Senator Hatch himself spoke \npositively about the revisions we had made. At a Committee business \nmeeting he praised my staff for, ``working with us in updating the \nquestionnaires.'' He noted: ``Two weeks ago, we resolved all remaining \ndifferences in a bipartisan manner. We got an updated questionnaire \nthat I think is satisfactory to everybody on the committee, and the \nWhite House as well.'' I accepted his words that day.\n  As soon as he resumed his chairmanship, he rejected the improvements \nwe made in a bipartisan way, however. The former Republican chairman \nnotified the Department of Justice that he would no longer be using the \nupdated questionnaire he praised not so long before but, instead, \ndecided that the old questionnaire be filled out. He did not notify any \nmember of the minority party on the committee. Unlike the bipartisan \nconsultation my office engaged in during the fall of 2001, and the \nbipartisan agreement we reached, the former Republican chairman acted \nby unilateral fiat without consultation.\n  The protection of the rights of the minority in the committee was \neliminated with the negation of the committee's rule IV, a rule \nparallel to the Senate filibuster rule. In violation of the rules that \nhave governed that committee's proceedings since 1979, the former \nRepublican chairman chose in 2003 to ignore our longstanding committee \nrules and he short-circuited committee consideration of the circuit \ncourt nominations of John Roberts and Deborah Cook.\n  Since 1979 the Judiciary Committee has had this committee rule to \nbring debate on a matter to a close while protecting the rights of the \nminority. It may have been my first meeting as a Senator on the \nJudiciary Committee in 1979 that Chairman Kennedy, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Cochran and others discussed adding this rule to \nthose of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch and \nthe Republican minority at that time took a position against adding the \nrule and argued in favor of any individual Senator having a right to \nunlimited debate--so that even one Senator could filibuster a matter. \nSenator Hatch said that he would be ``personally upset'' if unlimited \ndebate were not allowed. He explained:\n\n       There are not a lot of rights that each individual Senator \n     has, but at least two of them are that he can present any \n     amendments which he wants and receive a vote on it and number \n     two, he can talk as long as he wants to as long as he can \n     stand, as long as he feels strongly about an issue.\n\n  It was Senator Bob Dole who drew upon his Finance Committee \nexperience to suggest in 1979 that the committee rule be that ``at \nleast you could require the vote of one minority member to terminate \ndebate.'' Senator Cochran likewise supported having a ``requirement \nthat there be an extraordinary majority to shut off debate in our \ncommittee.''\n  The Judiciary Committee proceeded to refine its consideration of what \nbecame rule IV, which was adopted the following week and had been \nmaintained ever since. It struck the balance that Republicans had \nsuggested of at least having one member of the minority before allowing \nthe chairman to cut off debate. That protection for the minority had \nbeen maintained by the Judiciary Committee for 24 years under five \ndifferent chairmen--Chairman Kennedy, Chairman Thurmond, Chairman \nBiden, under Chairman Hatch previously and during my tenure as \nchairman.\n  Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee rules provided the minority with a\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nright not to have debate terminated and not to be forced to a vote \nwithout at least one member of the minority agreeing to terminate the \ndebate. That rule and practice had until two years ago always been \nobserved by the committee, even as we dealt with the most contentious \nsocial issues and nominations that come before the Senate. Until that \ntime, Democratic and Republican chairmen had always acted to protect \nthe rights of the Senate minority.\n  Although it was rarely utilized, rule IV set the ground rules and the \nbackdrop against which rank partisanship was required to give way, in \nthe best tradition of the Senate, to a measure of bipartisanship in \norder to make progress. That is the important function of the rule. \nJust as we have been arguing lately about the Senate's cloture rule, \nthe committee rule protected minority rights, and enforced a certain \nlevel of cooperation between the majority and minority in order to get \nanything accomplished. That was lost last Congress as the level of \npartisanship on the Judiciary Committee and within the Senate sunk to a \nnew low when Republicans chose to override our governing rules of \nconduct and proceed as if the Senate Judiciary Committee were a minor \ncommittee of the House of Representatives.\n\n  That this was a premeditated act was apparent from the debate in the \ncommittee. The former Republican chairman indicated that he had checked \nwith the Parliamentarians in advance, and he apparently concluded that \nsince he had the raw power to ignore our committee rule so long as all \nRepublicans on the committee stuck with him, he would do so. It was a \nprecursor of what is happening now in the Senate.\n  I understand that the Parliamentarians advised the former chairman \nthat there is no enforcement mechanism for a violation of committee \nrules and that the Parliamentarians view Senate committees as \nautonomous. I do not believe that they advised him that he should \nviolate our committee rules or that they interpreted our committee \nrules. I cannot remember a time when Senator Kennedy or Senator \nThurmond or Senator Biden were chairing the committee when any of them \nwould have even considered violating their responsibility to the Senate \nand to the committee and to our rules or that we needed an enforcement \nmechanism or penalty for violation of a fundamental committee rule.\n  In fact, the only occasion I recall that the former Republican \nchairman was previously faced with implementing committee rule IV, he \nhimself did so. In 1997, Democrats on the committee were seeking a \nSenate floor vote on President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to \nbe the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the Department of \nJustice. Republicans were intent on killing the nomination in \ncommittee. The committee rule came into play when in response to an \nalternative proposal by the Republican Chairman, I outlined the \ntradition of our Committee and said:\n\n       This committee has rules, which we have followed \n     assiduously in the past and I do not think we should change \n     them now. The rules also say that 10 Senators, provided one \n     of those 10 is from the minority, can vote to cut off debate. \n     We are also required to have a quorum for a vote.\n       I intend to insist that the rules be followed. A vote that \n     is done contrary to the rules is not a valid one.\n\n  Immediately after my comment, the same former Republican Chairman \nabandoned his earlier plan and said:\n\n       I think that is a fair statement. Rule IV of the Judiciary \n     Committee rules effectively establishes a committee \n     filibuster right, as the distinguished Senator said.\n\n  With respect to that nomination in 1997, he acknowledged:\n\n       Absent the consent of a minority member of the Committee, a \n     matter may not be brought to a vote. However, Rule IV also \n     permits the Chairman of the Committee to entertain a non-\n     debatable motion to bring any matter to a vote. The rule also \n     provides as follows: `The Chairman shall entertain a non-\n     debatable motion to bring a matter before the Committee to a \n     vote. If there is objection to bring the matter to a vote \n     without further debate, a rollcall vote of the Committee \n     shall be taken, and debate shall be terminated if the motion \n     to bring the matter to a vote without further debate passes \n     with ten votes in the affirmative, one of which must be cast \n     by the Minority.'\n\n  Thereafter, he made the nondebatable motion to proceed to a vote and \nunder the rules of the committee there was objection and a rollcall \nvote was taken on whether to end the debate. In that case, the former \nRepublican chairman followed the rules of the committee.\n  At the beginning of the last Congress, we reaffirmed our tradition \nand clarified that at the time the Senate was divided 50-50 and the \ncommittee was divided 50-50, the rules would be interpreted so that the \nminority was the party other than that of the chairman.\n  But when the nominations of John Roberts, Deborah Cook and Jeff \nSutton were being considered simultaneously, Democrats sought to \ncontinue debate on some of them and focus first on Sutton. We were \noverridden and the bipartisan tradition and respect for the rights of \nthe minority ended when the former Republican Chairman decided to \noverride our rights and the rule rather than follow it. He did so \nexpressly and intentionally, declaring: ``[Y]ou have no right to \ncontinue a filibuster in this committee.'' He decided, unilaterally, to \ndeclare the debate over even though all members of the minority were \nprepared to continue the debate and it was, in fact, terminated \nprematurely. I had yet to speak to any of the circuit nominees and \nother Democratic Senators had more to say. He completely reversed his \nown position from the Bill Lann Lee nomination and took a step \nunprecedented in the history of the committee.\n  I know the frustrations that accompany chairing the Judiciary \nCommittee. I know the record we achieved during my 17 months of \nchairing that committee, when we proceeded with hearings on more than \n100 of President Bush's judicial nominees and scores of his executive \nnominees, including extremely controversial nominations, when we \nproceeded fairly and in accordance with our rules and committee \ntraditions and practices to achieve almost twice as many confirmation \nfor President Bush as the Republicans had allowed for President \nClinton, and know how that record was mischaracterized by partisans. I \nknow that sometimes a chairman must make difficult decisions about what \nto include on an agenda and what not to include, what hearings to hold \nand when. In my time as chairman I tried to maintain the integrity of \nthe committee process and to be bipartisan. I noticed hearings at the \nrequest of Republican Senators and allowed Republican Senators to chair \nhearings. I made sure the committee moved forward fairly on the \nPresident's nominees in spite of the administration's unwillingness to \nwork with us to fill judicial vacancies with consensus nominees and \nthereby fill those vacancies more quickly. But I cannot remember a time \nwhen Chairman Kennedy, Chairman Thurmond, Chairman Biden, or I, ever \noverrode by fiat the right of the minority to debate a matter in \naccordance without longstanding committee rules and practices.\n  By bending, breaking and changing so many committee rules, \nRepublicans crossed a threshold of partisan overreaching that should \nnever have been crossed. As they passed each awful milestone, I urged \nthe Republican leadership to reconsider, to turn back and to reinstate \ncomity.\n  That is the backdrop for this debate now before the Senate. An overly \naggressive executive, added by a majority of the same political party \nin the Senate, acted last Congress to eliminate any meaningful role of \nthe minority at the committee level and to eliminate our traditions, \nrules and practices that had protected the minority. This abuse of \npower and drive toward one-party rule by the Republican leadership has \nbeen building for years and is culminating this week through their \nunprecedented attack on the Senate's rules, role and history. For years \nnow, Democratic Senators have been warning that the deterioration of \nSenate rules and practices that have protected minority rights was \nleaving us, the Senate, and the American people in a dire situation.\n  This systematic and corrosive erosion of checks and balances has \nbrought the Senate to this precipice. The filibuster in the Senate is \nthe last remaining check on the abuses of one-party rule and the \nundermining of the fairness and independence of the federal judiciary. \nIf the Senate is to serve its constitutional role as a check on\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\nthe executive, its protection must be preserved. That is the decision \nthe Senate will be facing tomorrow.\n\n                      [From the Salt Lake Tribune]\n\n         Hatch is Wrong About History of Judicial Appointments\n\n                           (By John J. Flynn)\n\n       The Constitution provides the president ``shall nominate, \n     and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate,'' \n     appoint judges and all other officers of the United States.\n       Throughout most of the Constitutional Convention, the power \n     to appoint ambassadors, judges and other officers of the \n     United States was vested solely in the Senate. It was decided \n     late in the convention that the Senate should share the \n     appointment power with the president. Clearly, the framers \n     expected the Senate would have an equal say in appointments.\n       Several nominations for positions in the executive branch \n     have been rejected over the past two centuries. Even more \n     nominations for life-time appointments to the judiciary have \n     been rejected because such nominations are for life and they \n     are nominations to an independent branch of government.\n       For many years rejections were often carried out by the \n     informal process of senators withholding ``blue slips'' for \n     nominees from their home states. When a senator did not \n     return a blue slip approving the nominee, the nomination was \n     killed without a vote by the full Senate. It was a method for \n     insuring the president sought the ``advice'' of the Senate \n     and senators before nominating a person for the judiciary. \n     The result was that only qualified moderates were usually \n     appointed to the bench.\n       Utah's Sen. Orrin Hatch ended the ``blue slip'' practice. \n     Sen. Hatch also began the practice of ``filibustering by \n     committee chairperson'' nominees proposed by President \n     Clinton. He simply refused to hold hearings on nominations \n     even where senators from the nominee's home state approved of \n     the nomination.\n       More than 60 Clinton judicial nominees were not even \n     accorded the courtesy of a hearing during the Hatch \n     chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. They were \n     never given the chance for an ``up or down vote'' by the full \n     Senate. For Sen. Hatch to now object to the use of a \n     filibuster to halt nominations is less than disingenuous.\n       Contrary to Sen. Hatch's representations in his Tribune op-\n     ed piece last Sunday, Republicans led a filibuster of the \n     nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to the position of chief \n     justice in 1968. I watched the filibuster. When a cloture \n     vote failed to muster the necessary super majority to end the \n     debate after four days of the filibuster, Justice Fortas \n     asked to have his nomination withdrawn.\n       The modem divisiveness in the Senate over judicial \n     nominations is directly traceable to the Senate's partisan \n     treatment of judicial nominations beginning with Justice \n     Fortas. The level of divisiveness has been increased by \n     President Bush. He threw down a partisan gauntlet by \n     renominating several controversial candidates not confirmed \n     by the prior Senate.\n       The main qualifications of these candidates appears to be \n     their appeal to the religious right and their rigid \n     ideological views calling into question their capacity to \n     judge objectively contentious issues coming before the \n     courts.\n       The Bush administration apparently believes that the Senate \n     should simply rubber-stamp nominees it selects without Senate \n     advice, much less the consent of a sizeable majority of the \n     Senate. Slogans like seeking the appointment of judges who \n     will not ``make law'' are trumpeted while President Bush \n     nominates persons who will ``make law''--law of the sort \n     advocated by his administration and its closed-minded right-\n     wing supporters.\n       Because of the nature of the job of judges, the framers of \n     the Constitution vested the Senate with a co-equal power over \n     the nomination and confirmation of persons for lifetime \n     appointments to the judiciary. The Senate's role is not a \n     subservient one of rubber-stamping anyone the president \n     nominates unless it is found that they are an ax murderer or \n     child molester.\n       This was made clear in the Federalist Papers, numbers 76-\n     78. Over the past two centuries, the Senate developed a \n     number of checks on both the president and members of the \n     Senate to prevent the president and a majority of the Senate \n     from running roughshod over those with substantial objections \n     to nominations made by the president.\n       The result, until the first Bush administration and Sen. \n     Hatch's chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, has been \n     negotiation and compromise over judicial nominees and the \n     appointment of qualified moderates to the bench for the most \n     part.\n       The present dispute over whether to eliminate the \n     filibuster as a device to block nominees that a sizeable \n     block of senators finds objectionable presents a further and \n     dangerous erosion of the Senate's advice-and-consent \n     function.\n       The Republicans hold a 55-to-45 majority of the seats in \n     the Senate. The Republican majority represents approximately \n     47 percent of the United States population, while the 45-\n     member Democrat minority represent 53 percent of the \n     population. Senators representing less than a majority of the \n     population are advocating the complete ceding of the advice-\n     and-consent function to any president with a numerical \n     majority of the membership of the Senate from his or her own \n     political party.\n       The end result of the political campaign to further weaken, \n     if not eliminate, the advice and-consent function of the \n     Senate, will be to establish powers similar to those of the \n     English monarch in 1789. The founders expressly sought to \n     avoid this result by requiring the independent advice and \n     consent of senators in the nomination and confirmation of \n     important executive branch positions and lifetime \n     appointments to the bench.\n       For Republicans to repudiate that role of the Senate, \n     especially after their sorry record in dealing with the \n     judicial nominees of President Clinton, is not only the \n     height of hypocrisy, but is a dangerous precedent they will \n     live to regret.\n       This is not the time for political opportunism, \n     presidential arrogance or misleading oped pieces by Sen. \n     Hatch. It is a time for members of the Senate to begin to act \n     responsibly when carrying out their advice-and-consent \n     function rather than further erode an important institutional \n     check upon executive branch power and a majority party in the \n     Senate that does not represent a majority of the American \n     people.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Justice Priscilla Owen to serve as a judge on the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  When I evaluate individuals for Federal judgeships, I turn first to \nthe U.S. Constitution. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution gives \nthe President the responsibility to nominate, with the ``Advice and \nConsent of the Senate,'' individuals to serve as judges on the Federal \ncourts. Thus, the Constitution provides a role for both the President \nand the Senate in this process. The President is given the \nresponsibility of nominating, and the Senate has the responsibility to \nrender ``advice and consent'' on the nomination.\n  As I have fulfilled my constitutional responsibilities as a Senator \nover the past 27 years that I have had the honor of representing the \ncitizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. Senate, I have \nconscientiously made the effort to work on judicial nominations with \nthe Presidents with whom I have served.\n  Whether our President was President Carter, President Reagan, \nPresident Bush, President Clinton, or President George W. Bush, I have \naccorded equal weight to the nominations of all Presidents, \nirrespective of party.\n  I have always considered a number of factors before casting my vote \nto confirm or reject a nominee. The nominee's character, professional \ncareer, experience, integrity, and temperament are all important. In \naddition, I consider whether the nominee is likely to interpret law \naccording to precedent or impose his or her own views. The opinions of \nthe officials from the State in which the nominee would serve and the \nviews of my fellow Virginians are also important. In addition, I \nbelieve our judiciary should reflect the broad diversity of the \ncitizens it serves.\n  These principles have served me well as I have closely examined the \nrecords of thousands of judicial nominees.\n  With respect to the nominee currently before the Senate, I reviewed \nJustice Owen's record, met with her personally last week, and \nconsidered her qualifications in light of all of these aforementioned \nfactors. And let me say, Mr. President, that I came away rather \nimpressed with this nominee.\n  You see, out of the thousands of nominees I have reviewed in the U.S. \nSenate, I have to say that Justice Owen has, without a doubt, one of \nthe more impressive records.\n  In 1975, she earned her bachelors degree, cum laude, from Baylor \nUniversity. She then remained at Baylor to earn her law degree. While \nin law school, she served as a member of the Baylor Law Review. And, \nwhen she graduated from law school in 1977, she once again earned the \nhonors of graduating cum laude.\n  Upon graduating from law school, Justice Owen took the Texas bar \nexam. Not only did she pass it, she earned the highest score in the \nState on the December 1977 exam.\n  Since passing the bar, she spent approximately 16 years practicing \nlaw in a distinguished Houston law firm. She started as a young \nassociate and through her efforts as a commercial litigator she later \nbecame a partner at the firm.\n  In 1994, Priscilla Owen was first elected to the Texas Supreme Court. \nSix years later, she overwhelmingly won a second term with 84 percent \nof the vote--a strong testament of public support given to her by the \ncitizens of the State of Texas.\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\n  But not only do the people of Texas overwhelmingly believe that Judge \nOwens is a highly qualified Federal judge, it is important to recognize \nthat every major newspaper in Texas endorsed her reelection.\n  She also has notable bipartisan support for her nomination, including \nthree former Democrat judges on the Texas Supreme Court and the \nbipartisan support of 15 past Presidents of the State bar of Texas. The \nAmerican Bar Association, often called the ``gold standard'' around \nhere for evaluating judges, has unanimously deemed Justice Owen ``Well \nQualified''--its highest rating.\n  Despite all of this strong, bipartisan support, however, over the \ncourse of the past 4 years, we have been unable to get to an up-or-down \nvote in the Senate on Justice Owen's nomination. All the while, this \noutstanding nominee has been waiting patiently for the Senate to act on \nher nomination. In my view, such an exemplary nominee should have been \nconfirmed far sooner, especially since the seat for which she has been \nnominated has been dubbed by the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates as a ``judicial emergency.''\n  The fact of the matter is that Justice Priscilla Owen is a highly \ndistinguished jurist with impeccable credentials. There is no doubt in \nmy mind that she should be confirmed for this lifetime appointment.\n  I look forward to voting in support of her nomination and encourage \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to review the \nagreement signed by the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from \nArizona, the Senator from Nebraska, and 11 other Senators, an agreement \nthat I have reviewed but to which I am not a party.\n  Let me start by reminding the Senate of my principle, a simple \nprinciple, that I have come to this Senate day after day stating, \nstressing. It is this: I fundamentally believe it is our constitutional \nresponsibility to give judicial nominees the respect and the courtesy \nof an up-and-down vote on the floor of the Senate. Investigate them, \nquestion them, scrutinize them, debate them in the best spirit of this \nbody, but then vote, up or down, yes or no, confirm or reject, but each \ndeserves a vote.\n  Unlike bills, nominees cannot be amended. They cannot be split apart; \nthey cannot be horse traded; they cannot be logrolled. Our Constitution \ndoes not allow for any of that. It simply requires up-or-down votes on \njudicial nominees. In that regard, the agreement announced tonight \nfalls short of that principle.\n  It has some good news and it has some disappointing news and it will \nrequire careful monitoring.\n  Let me start with the good news. I am very pleased, very pleased that \neach and every one of the judges identified in the announcement will \nreceive the opportunity of that fair up-or-down vote. Priscilla Owen, \nafter 4 years, 2 weeks, and 1 day, will have a fair and up-or-down \nvote. William Pryor, after 2 years and 1 month, will have a fair up-or-\ndown vote. Janice Rogers Brown, after 22 months, will have a fair up-\nor-down vote. Three nominees will get up-or-down votes with certainty \nnow because of this agreement, whereas a couple of hours ago, maybe \nnone would get up-or-down votes. That would have been wrong.\n  With the confirmation of Thomas Griffith to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals we have been assured--though it is not part of this particular \nagreement--there will be four who will receive up-or-down votes. And \nbased on past comments in this Senate--although not in the agreement--I \nexpect that David McKeague, after 3 years and 6 months, will get a fair \nup-or-down vote. I expect that Susan Neilson, after 3 years and 6 \nmonths, will get a fair or up-or-down vote. I expect Richard Griffin, \nafter 2 years and 11 months, will get a fair up-or-down vote.\n  Now, the bad news, to me, or the disappointing news in this \nagreement. It is a shame that well-qualified nominees are threatened, \nstill, with not having the opportunity to have the merits of their \nnominations debated on the floor.\n  Henry Saad has waited for 3 years and 6 months for the same courtesy. \nHenry Saad deserves a vote. It is not in this agreement. William Myers \nhas waited for 2 years and 1 week for a fair up-or-down vote. He \ndeserves a vote but is not in this agreement. If Owen, Pryor, and Brown \ncan receive the courtesy and respect of a fair up-or-down vote, so can \nMyers and Saad.\n  I will continue to work with everything in my power to see that these \njudicial nominees also receive that fair up-or-down vote they deserve. \nBut it is not in this agreement.\n  But in this agreement is other good news. It is significant that the \nsigners give up using the filibuster as it was deployed in the last \nCongress in the last 2 years. The filibuster was abused in the last \nCongress. Mr. President, 10 nominees were blocked on 18 different \noccasions, 18 different filibusters in the last 2 years alone, with a \nleadership-led minority party obstruction, threatening filibusters on \nsix others. That was wrong.\n  It was not in keeping with our precedents over the past 214 years. It \nmade light of our responsibilities as United States Senators under the \nConstitution. It was a miserable chapter in the history of the Senate \nand brought the Senate to a new low.\n  Fortunately, tonight, it is possible this unfortunate chapter in our \nhistory can close. This arrangement makes it much less likely--indeed, \nnearly impossible--for such mindless filibusters to erupt on this floor \nover the next 18 months. For that I am thankful. Circuit court and \nSupreme Court nominees face a return to normalcy in the Senate where \nnominees are considered on their merits. The records are carefully \nexamined. They offer testimony. They are questioned by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The committee acts, and then the Senate discharges \nits constitutional duty to vote up or down on a nominee.\n  Given this disarmament on the filibuster and the assurance of fair \nup-or-down votes on nominees, there is no need at present for the \nconstitutional option. With this agreement, all options remain on the \ntable, including the constitutional option.\n  If it had been necessary to deploy the constitutional option, it \nwould have been successful and the Senate would have, by rule, returned \nto the precedent in the past 214 years. Instead, tonight, Members have \nagreed that this precedent of up-or-down votes should be a norm of \nbehavior as a result of the mutual trust and good will in that \nagreement.\n  I, of course, will monitor this agreement carefully as we move ahead \nto fill the pending 46 Federal vacancies today and any other vacancies \nthat may yet arise during this Congress. I have made it clear from the \noutset that I haven't wanted to use the constitutional option. I do not \nwant to use the constitutional option, but bad faith and return to bad \nbehavior during my tenure as majority leader will bring the Senate back \nto the point where all 100 Members will be asked to decide whether \njudicial nominees deserve a fair up-or-down vote.\n  I will not hesitate to call all Members to their duty if necessary. \nFor now, gratified that our principle of constitutional duty to vote up \nor down has been taken seriously and as reflected in this agreement, I \nlook forward to swift action on the identified nominations.\n  Now, the full impact of this agreement will await its implementation, \nits full implementation. But I do believe that the good faith and the \ngood will ought to guarantee a return to good behavior, appropriate \nbehavior, on the Senate floor and that when the gavel falls on this \nCongress, the 109th Congress, the precedent of the last 214 years will \nonce again govern up-or-down votes on the floor of the Senate.\n  Now, this will be spun as a victory, I would assume, for everybody. \nSome will say it is victory for leadership, some for the group of 14. I \nsee it as a victory for the Senate. I honestly believe it is a victory \nfor the Senate where Members have put aside a party demand to block \naction on judicial nominees. They have rose to principle and then acted \naccordingly.\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\n  I am also gratified with how clearly the Democratic leader has \nrepeated over and over again during this debate how much he looks \nforward to working with us, and I with him, as we move forward on the \nagenda of the 109th Congress. Our relationship has been forged in part \nby circumstance, but it has been leavened by friendship. I look forward \nto working with him as we work together to move the Nation's agenda \nforward together.\n  We have a lot to do, from addressing those vital issues of national \ndefense and homeland security, to reinforcing a bill that hopefully \nwill come very soon, addressing our energy independence, our role as a \nreliable and strong trading partner, to an orderly consideration of all \nthe bills before us about funding, and to put the deficit on the \ndecline. I look forward to working with the Democratic leader on these \nand many other issues of national importance.\n  Mr. President, a lot has been said about the uniqueness of this body. \nIndeed, our Senate is unique, and we all, as individuals and \ncollectively as a body, have a role to play in ensuring its cherished \nnature remains intact. Indeed, as demonstrated by tonight's agreement, \nand by the ultimate implementation of that agreement, we have done just \nthat.\n  It has withstood mighty tests that have torn other governments apart. \nIts genius is in its quiet voice, not in any mighty thunder. The \nharmony of equality brings all to its workings with an equal stake at \ndetermining its future. In all that the Senate has done in the last 2 \nyears, I, as leader, have attempted to discharge my task to help \nsteward this institution consistent with my responsibilities, not just \nas majority leader and not just as Republican leader, but also as a \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  In closing tonight, with this agreement, the Senate begins the hard \nwork of steering back to its better days, leaving behind some of its \nworst. While I would have preferred and liked my principle of up-or-\ndown votes to have been fully validated, for this Congress now we have \nbegun our labors for fairness and up-or-down votes on judicial nominees \nwith a positive course. And as all involved keep their word, it should \nbe much smoother sailing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a day I have waited for for a long \ntime. We can put the 8 years of the Clinton administration behind us, \nthe problems he had with the judges, over 60. We can put the first 4 \nyears of the Bush administration behind us. I have looked forward to \nthis day for a long time. We are now in a new Congress and a new day, \nand it was made possible by virtue of some very, very unique \nindividuals called Senators. One of them is here on the floor. The \nother, Senator Byrd, has left.\n  Senator Byrd has served 53 years in the Congress, 47 in the Senate, 6 \nin the House. The chairman of the most important committee, many say \naround here, the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner of Virginia--\nif there were ever a southern gentleman, it is the white-haired Senator \nfrom Virginia, John Warner. They worked for months with some of the \nyoungsters here, Lindsey Graham, Mark Pryor, Ken Salazar, in coming up \nwith this unique instrument that is only possible in the Senate.\n  Now, Mr. President, I say that this is not a victory for the Senate, \nthough it is. I say this is a victory for the American people. It is a \nvictory for the American people because the Senate has preserved the \nConstitution of the United States. No longer will we have to be giving \nthe speeches here about breaking the rules to change the rules. We are \nmoving forward in a new day, a new day where the two leaders can work \non legislation that is important to this country.\n  Just as a side note, I can throw away this rumpled piece of paper I \nhave carried around for more than a month that has the names McCain, \nChafee, Snowe, Warner, Collins, Hagel, Specter, Murkowski, and Sununu. \nIt is gone. I do not need that any more because of the bravery of these \nSenators. I am grateful to my colleagues, as I have said, who brokered \nthis deal. And it was a brokerage, for sure.\n\n  Now we can move beyond this time-consuming process that has \ndeteriorated the comity of this great institution called the Senate. I \nam hopeful we can quickly turn to work on the people's business. We \nneed to ensure that our troops have the resources they need to fight in \nIraq and around the world and that Americans are free from terrorism. \nWe need to protect retirees' pensions and long-term security. We need \nto expand health care opportunities for all families. We need to \naddress rising gasoline prices and energy independence, and we need to \nrestore fiscal responsibility and rebuild our economy so it lifts all \nAmerican workers. That is our reform agenda. Together we can get the \njob done.\n  It is off the table. People of good will recognize what is best for \nthe institution. There are no individual winners in this. Individual \nwinners? No. A little teamwork it took. And the American people should \nsee this picture: Democrats and Republicans, some who have been here as \nlong as Senator Byrd and Senator Warner, and some newcomers. Senator \nSalazar has been here for 5 months. He was part of this arrangement. \nPeople from red States, from blue States, they represent America. That \nis what happened tonight.\n  Now, I would rather that something else had happened. I would rather \nthat we had marched down here tomorrow and voted and we gave our high \nfives and we had won. We are not doing that. We have won anyway because \nthis is a victory for the American people.\n  I love this country, Mr. President. I have devoted my life to public \nservice. I do not regret a day of it. I will have been in public \nservice 41 years, and I said to my caucus that there has never been a \nmore important issue I have dealt with in my political life than this \nissue that is now terminated. It is over with. And I feel so good. This \nwill be the first night in at least 6 weeks that I will sleep \npeacefully. I have not had a peaceful night's rest in at least 6 weeks.\n  I owe a debt of gratitude to these Senators who did what the two \nleaders could not do. I tried. It could not be done. But I hope, as we \nproceed in the days to come, that this is past history. Of course, \nthere will be filibusters in the future. It is the nature of this \ninstitution. And that is the way it should be. We are not on a slippery \nslope to saying all the Presidential nominations are subject to a \nsimple majority--to change the rules. We are not going to say that \nlegislation is subject to a simple majority to change the rules. The \nfilibuster is here. Mr. Smith can still come to Washington.\n  I, through the Chair, extend my appreciation to the distinguished \nRepublican leader for his patience, my many trips to his office, the \nfew trips he made to my office, the many telephone calls, the \nBlackBerrys we exchanged. I have admiration for the good doctor from \nTennessee. And I hope that we, working together, can do good things for \nthis country. The country needs a Senate that works together.\n  Again, Mr. President, the only person I see here who I can personally \nthank is the distinguished Senator from Virginia. I say, through the \nChair, to you and the other 13 Senators, thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I want to \nextend my congratulations to the majority leader for moving us to this \npoint. Obviously, human nature, being what it is, had we not had a \ndeadline, had the Priscilla Owen nomination not been brought up, had \nthe debate not begun, we would not be where we are today. Senator \nFrist, in a tireless and persistent manner, has been working on this \nissue since shortly after the election last year, talking to Senator \nReid.\n  I also want to compliment the Democratic leader. I suspect there is \nno issue upon which Senator Frist and Senator Reid have had discussions \nmore frequently than this one, going back for the last 6 months.\n  I think there was bipartisan unhappiness in the Senate with the \ndegree to which the Senate had deteriorated in the last Congress--this \nsort of random, mindless killing of nominees, 10 of them.\n  I think what has happened tonight is a result not only of the \nsteadfastness of our majority leader, Bill Frist, but also this coming \ntogether of the group\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\nof 14, led in large measure on our side by Senator McCain and Senator \nWarner from Virginia, one of the real true supporters of this \ninstitution. They have allowed us to sort of step back from the brink. \nAs I read this memorandum of understanding, signed by the seven \nDemocrats and seven Republicans, all options are still on the table \nwith regard to both filibusters and constitutional options. But what I \nalso hear from these 14 distinguished colleagues is that they do not \nexpect this to happen.\n  We have marched back from the brink, hopefully taken the first step, \nbeginning tomorrow with cloture on Justice Priscilla Owen, to begin to \ndeal with judicial nominations the way we always have prior to the last \nCongress. Sure, there were occasional cloture votes, but they were \nalways invoked. They were always for the purpose of getting the nominee \nan up-or-down vote.\n  I want to thank Senator Warner and his colleagues for making it \npossible for us to get back to the way we operated quite comfortably \nfor 214 years. So even though this is not an agreement that I would \nhave made or that the majority leader would have made--because he and I \nboth believe that all nominees who come to the floor are entitled to an \nup-or-down vote--it is certainly a good beginning. And three very, very \ndistinguished nominees, whose nominations have been languishing for a \nnumber of years, are going to get an up-or-down vote. I think that is \nsomething we can all celebrate on a bipartisan basis.\n  So I do indeed think this has been a good night for the Senate. And I \nam optimistic that for the balance of this Congress, we will operate \nthe way we did for 214 years prior to the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Winston Churchill once said there is nothing more exhilarating than \nbeing shot at and missed. This evening I think Members of the Senate \nfeel as I do----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will excuse me. Let me say that I \nneed to recognize the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I inquire what the regular order might be. \nI was scheduled to speak at 8:15. I am not entirely sure on the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority controls the time until 9 \no'clock.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my time right now as set aside for the \nmajority is now being taken up by this discussion. I would like to have \nsome time reserved for myself in the 30 minutes. Right now we have 6 or \n7 or 8 speakers lined up, and so I want to have an opportunity to make \nmy views known at some point in time. I think we need to establish \nregular order, and if both parties have agreed that it goes back over \nto the other side at 9 o'clock, I would like to have that extended out \nso that when we reach 9 o'clock then I can speak from 9 to 9:30.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I make the unanimous consent request that \nas soon as I finish speaking, and the other Senators who have sought \nrecognition, the Senator from Colorado be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, do I \nunderstand the order is that when 9 o'clock comes what is in order is \nbefore the Senate right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did not hear the unanimous consent request of my friend \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say through the Chair to my friend from Iowa, since \nthere has been the interruption of the good news of this agreement, it \nwas taken from the time of the Senator from Colorado, the majority, and \nI am trying to make sure his time is protected and that we can move all \ntimes to the point where the Senator from Colorado has his 30 minutes \nas soon as a few of us have spoken for just a few minutes and then we \nwill continue.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent at the conclusion of the 30 \nminutes for the Senator from Colorado, the Senator from Iowa be \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I shall not \nobject--I hope I could state a few words following the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois. I was scheduled to speak at 8 o'clock. My time I \nthink has been put to good use, and I would be very pleased if I could \nmake my remarks. So if I could follow the Senator from Illinois for not \nto exceed 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just want to get the regular order. I \nwas scheduled to speak at 9 o'clock on our side. Is that time preserved \nunder the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request that the Senator \nfrom Colorado have 30 minutes is also at 9 o'clock; is that correct?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. All right, then, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat immediately after the Senator from Colorado, I be given the 15 \nminutes I was going to be given at 9 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Illinois modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me try to modify this appropriately. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I speak for 5 minutes, that I be followed by Senator \nWarner who wishes to speak for 5 minutes, Senator Schumer for 5 \nminutes, then Senator Allard for 30 minutes, and Senator Harkin \nfollowing him for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. And after Senator Harkin, Senator Boxer for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, since I was to \nspeak at 9:30, I want to intervene. I will withhold depending upon what \nmy colleagues say in the spirit of the latest agreement to see whether \nit is necessary to comment, and if not then I won't, but otherwise I \nwill not object to the request that has been made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleagues.\n  It is great to have these bipartisan agreements on the floor of the \nSenate. Maybe a new spirit is dawning. I am going to take a very few \nmoments. As I said at the outset, Winston Churchill said there is \nnothing more exhilarating than being shot at and missed. Many of us in \nthe Senate feel that this agreement tonight means some of the most \ncherished traditions of the Senate will be preserved, will not be \nattacked, and will not be destroyed. I think it is a time for \ncelebration on both sides of the aisle.\n  I salute one of my colleagues who is on the Senate floor this \nevening, Senator Warner of Virginia. I was asked by my friends back in \nIllinois not long ago, Senator Warner, tell us the Republican Senators \nyou really respect, and I said John Warner is certainly one of those \nSenators. And I mean it sincerely. He has played a central role with \nSenator McCain, Senator Byrd, Senator Nelson, Senator Pryor, and so \nmany others to bring us to this point.\n\n  What I think is important is this: What we have seen as the emergence \nof resolving this issue is the emergence of people from the center who \nare dedicated to this institution and to our role in our government. I \nhope that continues over to other issues, and I hope the White House, \nas well as the leaders of both political parties, will try to work in \nthat same spirit, the spirit of moving toward the center in moderation. \nI might say that the fact that the President has had 95 percent of his \nnominees to the bench approved by the Senate is an indication that if \nhe will pick men and women more toward the center, even a little right \nof center, which we expect, that the President is not going to run into \nthe resistance he did with a handful of nominees that we on the \nDemocratic side thought went too far.\n  I would like to say a word about Senator Harry Reid, who was in the \nChamber just a moment ago. He spoke about sleepless nights. He and I \ntalked about that for weeks. No one has spent more time worrying over \nthis situation. He understood, as we all did, that this was not just \nanother political issue, not just another political vote, but had Vice \nPresident Cheney come to that chair tomorrow and ruled as we heard he \nwould under the nuclear option, the Senate would have been changed \nforever. This institution has been preserved. The nuclear option is off \nthe table. We have been admonished, and I think appropriately so, not\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nto misuse the filibuster, certainly when it comes to judicial nominees. \nThat is good advice on both sides of the aisle under Democratic and \nRepublic Presidents. I thank my colleagues, too, for bringing up some \nof the more contentious judges as part of this debate.\n  Senator Reid went to Senator Frist weeks ago and said if this is \nabout one or two judges, let us get that resolved. The Senate, its \ntraditions and the constitutional issues at stake, are more important \nthan any single judge in our land. Unfortunately, that negotiation \nbetween Senator Reid and Senator Frist did not lead to the culmination \nthat we had hoped it would. But thanks to the leadership of colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in good faith and good spirit on a \nbipartisan basis we have now moved ourselves beyond this crisis. Now \nthe challenge is whether we can continue in this spirit: Will we \ntomorrow come together and start working on important issues such as \nretirement security, health care in America, the protection of our \nNation, the support of our men and women in uniform, doing something to \nhelp with education? It is an important agenda that calls for the best \non both sides of the aisle to work together.\n  Again, let me thank Senator Warner for his leadership. I know he has \nbeen patient. A couple weeks ago, the Senator came over to me in the \ncorner of the Chamber and said: We ought to work together to get this \nresolved.\n  The Senator never quit. I admire him for that. I admire Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle who brought us to this happy occasion.\n  And at that point, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, when we opened our brief press conference upstairs, \nSenator McCain and Senator Ben Nelson spoke for the entire group. It \nwas made clear our everlasting gratitude to the tireless efforts by \nSenator Frist and Senator Reid. The framework that we have created can \nbe no stronger than the foundation on which it rests. And that \nfoundation was laid by our two respective leaders, and, indeed, the \nwhips, Senator McConnell and the Senator from Illinois. So we are not \naround this evening to try to take credit for anything. As a matter of \nfact, this was the most unusual gathering of Senators, and the manner \nin which it was conducted over a number of days--total humility among \nour group.\n  We are proud of the leadership that Senator McCain gave, Senator Ben \nNelson, Senator Robert Byrd, and others. But each Senator of the 14 was \n1, but 1 among equals, working toward a common goal. And no one \narticulated that goal time and time again in every meeting more than \nSenator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who said it is the Nation, it is \nthe institution of the Senate, and the third priority is our own \ncareer. So I thank him for that.\n  I am proud to have been a part of this. I do hope that our wonderful \nSenate can now resume its long and distinguished service to our Nation \nover these 214 or 216 years, and I am very privileged to have been a \nsmall part of it at this time.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank all my \ncolleagues. This will go down, hopefully, as a fine night in the \nSenate, in the U.S. Government. Armageddon has been avoided, and thank \nGod for that. We in the Senate stepped right up to the precipice, but \nwe did not fall in. This Republic works in amazing ways. And just as we \nwere about to fall into an abyss of partisanship, of a destruction of \nthe checks and balances that are the hallmark of this institution and \nthis government, 12 Senators, many Democrats from red States, some \nRepublicans from blue States, came together and created an agreement \nthat I think serves this body well.\n  Does it have everything that we would have wanted on this side? No. \nBut it takes the nuclear option off the table. It says that filibusters \nmay continue to be used, albeit in a restrained way--although many \nwould argue 10 out of 218 was restrained in itself. It also asks the \nPresident to consult and that, to me, would be a key lesson of this \nagreement. The reason that we came so close to this Armageddon is \nbecause, in my judgment, we didn't have the typical consultation that \nprevious Presidents--Clinton, Bush, Reagan--had with the Senate before \nnominating judges.\n  The agreement widely states that it is the hope of the Senate--at \nleast of the 12 signatories, but I am sure the other 88 Senators would \njoin--that the President will begin to consult. That will not mean that \njudges will be so far from his political philosophy. He is the \nPresident and he gets to choose them. But it will mean that the kinds \nof partisan division that we have seen here is gone.\n  Mr. President, what I most feared about the nuclear option was the \ndestruction of the checks and balances that are the hallmark of this \ninstitution. Those checks and balances have been preserved tonight. But \nmake no mistake about it, if we don't all make efforts, we could get \nright back to this point soon enough. It could be on the issue of \njudges or on the issue of something else. The poison of too much \npartisanship is still here, and it is hoped that this agreement will \nset a model where everyone can pull back, it is hoped that there will \nbe consultation on judges, and it is hoped that this agreement will set \nthe stage for a better Senate, a better Congress, and a better Republic \nin the future.\n  Mr. President, this could become a historic night if the agreement \nthat has been created keeps. We must preserve the checks and balances \nin the Senate. We must preserve the rights of the minority in the \nSenate. We must understand that a vote of 51 percent on the most major \nof decisions is not the right vote that is always called for. That has \nbeen the tradition in the Senate.\n  The reason we say that our rules take two-thirds to change is exactly \nto make it hard to change the rules and force the proposed changer to \nseek a bipartisan coalition. That bipartisanship is what differentiates \nus from the other body. Those checks and balances differentiate us from \nmost other governments. We must fight to keep them and tonight we have \nmade a giant step in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his \nkind comments on the judicial nomination process. My thanks extend to \nall my colleagues tonight for their comments on the judicial nomination \nprocess and compromise negotiations.\n  I rise to congratulate the 14 Senators who have indicated through a \nMemorandum of Understanding that they will no longer support a \nfilibuster on 3 of President Bush's judicial nominees. This is a good \nfirst step toward a bipartisan resolution.\n  My statement this evening is based on remarks that I prepared prior \nto the announcement of the judicial nomination compromise; however, the \nbasic intent of my remarks has not changed even though the filibuster \nhas been broken on three of the President's nominees. Tonight, I will \naddress the qualifications of Priscilla Owen, and how important it is \nthat we allow a yes or no vote on judicial nominees. All I ask for is \nan opportunity to have a yes or no vote on those judges that are \npending before the Senate.\n  I am concerned about the next step in the judicial nomination \ndebate--where are we going to go from here when it comes to the \nfilibuster? I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who wish to \nmove forward and forget about finger pointing and blame--who voted for \nwho, who voted for a filibuster and how many times did they vote \nagainst cloture. I just hope we do indeed move forward. I hope we will \nlook at each judge that is before the Senate for confirmation and vote \nthem up or down based on their qualifications. That is what our \nforefathers had in mind when the advise and consent.\n  I join my colleagues in support of the nomination of Priscilla Owen, \nthe Texas Supreme Court justice who was first nominated to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals in May 2001 by President Bush. I urge my \ncolleagues to support her confirmation and allow an up-or-down vote on \nher nomination. I hope that fairness prevails and that we do indeed \nproceed with a vote on her nomination, and it looks like that is indeed \nthe way the events have unfolded this evening.\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\n  I have had the opportunity to meet with Priscilla Owen personally. I \ndon't know how many of my colleagues who oppose or who continue to \noppose her have accepted her offer to visit with them, but I hope they \nwill have the courtesy to meet her in person before deciding to refuse \nto offer her a fair up-or-down vote. If they do, they will quickly \nlearn she is a person of integrity, humility, and possesses a keen \nunderstanding of the law.\n  On a personal note, she is a wonderful human being. I was \nparticularly impressed when she told me that growing up she hoped to be \na veterinarian. As a veterinarian myself, you can understand why I was \nimpressed. She spoke of growing up and participating in a family cattle \nranching enterprise, helping her parents and grandparents during \ncalving season, nursing and branding.\n  There is something special about a person who has been kicked by a \ncow and swatted across the face with a dirty cow tail. It makes a \nperson more real, more understanding of life and hard work. This is \nexactly the type of judge we need on the bench, one who understands \nreal life, honest-living and hard-working people.\n  Instead of defaming her, I wish my colleagues would get to know her \nso that they might recognize the legal skill and value she would bring \nto the United States as a member of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nPriscilla Owen will uphold the law, not make the law. Some find this to \nbe a problem. I find it to be a blessing.\n  Priscilla Owen has served the law with distinction. A justice of the \nTexas Supreme Court since 1995, she received overwhelming approval from \nthe people of Texas, 84 percent of whom voted to retain her service on \nthe bench.\n  Unlike many Members of the Senate, including myself, when it came \ntime for the voters to decide whether or not she should remain on the \nbench, Ms. Owen received the endorsement of every major newspaper in \nthe State of Texas. I ask, does that sound like someone who is too \nextreme?\n  Priscilla Owen's life has not been limited to the law. She is a \ndecent human being and dedicated community servant. She has worked to \neducate parents about the effect divorce has on children and worked to \nlessen the adversarial nature of legal proceedings when a marriage is \ndissolved. She works with the hearing impaired and organizations \ndedicated to service animals for those with disabilities. She teaches \nSunday school and is committed to the poor and underprivileged.\n  It is clear that she is qualified to serve on the Fifth Circuit \nCourt. The American Bar Association unanimously rated Justice Owen \n``well qualified,'' its highest possible rating. She has the support of \nformer Democrat justices on the Texas Supreme Court and 15 past \npresidents of the Texas State Bar.\n  To say that she is not qualified is utterly ridiculous. Because her \ncredentials are so outstanding, throughout this debate, the other side \nhas relied on hyperbole and rhetoric, accusing her of being ``extreme'' \nin order to smear her nomination. So the question her nomination \npresents us, then, is whether she is extreme or qualified? The great \nthing about the Constitution is that it provides us with a mechanism to \nmake this type of ``advice and consent'' determination on whether she \nis extreme or qualified--through a simple up-or-down vote.\n  An up-or-down vote is a simple matter of fairness. Every judicial \nnominee that makes it out of the Judiciary Committee should receive an \nup or down vote. The filibuster is not in the Constitution. It is \nmerely a parliamentary delay tactic that was relatively unused until \nmodern times. In 214 years, never has a nominee with the majority of \nsupport of the United States Senate been denied a vote.\n  Throughout the history of the United States, a nominee who clearly \nheld the majority support of the Senate had never been defeated by the \nuse of the filibuster--until now. During the last Congress those \nopposed to President Bush's nominees tried to establish a precedent by \nusing the filibuster to block a nomination. Having witnessed what was \ntaking place, I appealed to my colleagues to restore the fairness that \nthis body and the American people deserve. That is why I am so excited \nabout moving forward with 3 of the nominations, which includes \nPriscilla Owen, so we can have an up-or-down vote.\n  Throughout this debate, I have consistently stated we must reach a \ncompromise that allows an up-or-down vote on all nominees, while \naffording everybody an opportunity to be heard. This is not a partisan \nissue or flippant suggestion; it is simply a matter of fairness. If a \nnominee reaches the floor, then they should receive a vote--up or down. \nI don't believe there is anything wrong with providing a nominee an up-\nor-down vote once they reach the floor.\n  Some in this body act as if the filibuster has been used before to \nkill a judicial nominee. But such actions are simply misguided. Every \nnominee with a majority of support has received an up-or-down vote--\nevery nominee for over 200 years.\n  I do not take the confirmation of judicial nominations lightly, nor \ndo my colleagues. But we must not twist the confirmation process into a \npartisan platform.\n  Our fundamental duty to confirm the President's nominees is not an \neasy task. It carries with it the weight and responsibility of \ngenerations--a lifetime appointment to a position that requires a deep \nand mature understanding of the law.\n  We were elected to the Senate by people who believed we would \naccomplish our fundamental duties--as representatives of the people to \nsay yes or no to the President's nominees.\n  I believe Members have a right to express their opinions. I also \nbelieve that Members have a right to a vote and that it is wrong to \ndeny others of their opportunity to vote on judicial nominations.\n  The debate is not about numbers. It is not about percentages--how \nmany judges that Republicans confirmed or how many judges Democrats \nhave confirmed. To frame this debate as a numbers fight is not being \nfair to the American people. We were not sent to Congress to focus on a \nnumerical count, but instead to carry out our constitutional \nobligations, in this instance the advice and consent clause.\n  Some Senators have come to the floor to argue that the advice and \nconsent clause doesn't mean that we actually vote on nominees. They \nargue that a vote is only needed to confirm the nominee, but that other \ntactics can be used to disapprove the nominee. Unfortunately, these \nother tactics that have been used to kill a nomination have resulted in \nthe obstruction of our constitutional duties.\n  To help address this point, I will turn to a recent article published \nin the National Review, which discusses the meaning of the advise and \nconsent clause through the eyes of our country's Founders. The article \nnotes the appointment clause is listed as an explicit power vested in \nthe executive.\n  The advise and consent obligation follows this clause but it is in \nthe article addressing executive powers. It is not listed in the \narticle addressing legislative powers. The author believes that this is \ninstructive because it helps us understand that the Founders intended \nthe President to play the main role in the nomination process, not the \nlegislature. Had the Founders intended the legislature to be the \nfulcrum, they would have listed the advise and consent clause as a \nfundamental duty in the article addressing legislative powers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From National Review Online, May 17, 2005]\n\nBreaking the Rules: The Framers Intended No More Than a Senate Majority \n                           To Approve Judges\n\n                        (By Clarke D. Forsythe)\n\n       The sharpening debate in the U.S. Senate over whether \n     Democrats can block President Bush's judicial nominations by \n     filibuster raises the basic question of the scope of the \n     Senate's constitutional role to give ``Advice and Consent.'' \n     What does it mean for the Senate to give ``Advice and \n     Consent'' for federal judges?\n       Many people question whether changing the rules to allow \n     only a majority vote for confirmations is proper, or even \n     constitutional. However, the text of the Constitution, the \n     record of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and Supreme \n     Court decisions all concur to show that the Constitution \n     intended no more than a majority ``vote'' for the Senate's \n     ``Advice and Consent'' for judicial appointments.\n       The key provision is Article II, Section 2, called the \n     Appointments Clause: ``[The president] shall have Power, by \n     and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n     Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; \n     and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent \n     of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public \n     Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all \n     other Officers of the United States . . .''\n       There are three striking aspects of the Appointments \n     Clause, all of which are intentional and not accidental.\n       First, it is instructive if not definitive that the \n     Appointments Clause is contained as an explicit power in \n     Article II, involving executive powers, not in Article I, \n     involving legislative powers.\n       Second, only a simple majority is required. The clause on \n     the treaty power, after mentioning ``Advice and Consent,'' \n     requires concurrence by ``two thirds of the Senators \n     present.'' The clause on the appointment of ambassadors and \n     others, including Supreme Court justices--by contrast--does \n     not.\n       This is reinforced by the contrast found in several other \n     provisions in the Constitution where a ``supermajority'' vote \n     is required. In Article I, section 3, two-thirds (of members \n     present) are required for Senate conviction for impeachment. \n     In Article I, section 5, two-thirds are required to expel a \n     member of either House. Article I, section 7 requires two-\n     thirds for overriding a presidential veto. The fact that the \n     Constitution explicitly requires two-thirds in some contexts \n     indicates that the Senate's consent in Article II, section 2 \n     is by majority vote when no supermajority vote is required.\n       The general rule is that majorities govern in a legislative \n     body, unless another rule is expressly provided. Article I, \n     section 5, for example, provides that ``a Majority of each \n     [House] shall constitute a Quorum to do Business.''\n       More than a century ago, the Supreme Court stated in United \n     States v. Ballin, a unanimous decision, that ``the general \n     rule of all parliamentary bodies is that, when a quorum is \n     present, the act of a majority of the quorum is the act of \n     the body. This has been the rule for all time, except so far \n     as in any given case the terms of the organic act under which \n     the body is assembled have prescribed specific limitations . \n     . . No such limitation is found in the federal constitution, \n     and therefore the general law of such bodies obtains.''\n       Third, the particular process in the Appointments Clause--\n     of presidential nomination and Senate ``consent'' by a \n     majority--was carefully considered by the Constitutional \n     Convention. A number of alternative processes for \n     appointments were thoroughly considered--and rejected--by the \n     Constitutional Convention. And this consideration took place \n     over several months.\n       The Constitutional Convention considered at least three \n     alternative options to the final Appointments Clause: (1) \n     placing the power in the president alone, (2) in the \n     legislature alone, (3) in the legislature with the \n     president's advice and consent.\n       On June 13, 1787, it was originally proposed that judges be \n     ``appointed by the national Legislature,'' and that was \n     rejected; Madison objected and made the alternative motion \n     that appointments be made by the Senate, and that was at \n     first approved. Madison specifically proposed that a \n     ``supermajority'' be required for judicial appointments but \n     this was rejected. On July 18, Nathaniel Ghorum made the \n     alternative motion ``that the Judges be appointed by the \n     Executive with the advice & consent of the 2d branch,'' \n     (following on the practice in Massachusetts at that time). \n     Finally, on Friday, September 7, 1787, the Convention \n     approved the final Appointments Clause, making the president \n     primary and the Senate (alone) secondary, with a role of \n     ``advice and consent.''\n       Obviously, this question is something that the Framers \n     carefully considered. The Constitution and Supreme Court \n     decisions are quite clear that only a majority is necessary \n     for confirmation. Neither the filibuster, nor a supermajority \n     vote, is part of the Advice and Consent role in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Until the past four years, the Senate never did \n     otherwise. Changing the Senate rules to eliminate the \n     filibuster and only require a majority vote is not only \n     constitutional but fits with more than 200 years of American \n     tradition.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, had the Founders intended a 60-vote \nsupermajority, they would have included the requirement in the \nConstitution the way they did on the treaty power clause. The clause on \nthe treaty power, after mentioning ``advice and consent,'' requires \nconcurrence by two-thirds of the Senators present. The clause on the \nappointment of ambassadors and others, including Supreme Court \nJustices, by contrast, does not.\n  The author then pointed out several other provisions in the \nConstitution where a supermajority vote is required. In article I, \nsection 3, two-thirds of Members present are required for Senate \nconviction for impeachment. In article I, section 5, two-thirds are \nrequired to expel a member of either House. Article I, section 7 \nrequires two-thirds for overriding a Presidential veto.\n  The fact that the Constitution explicitly requires two-thirds in some \ncontexts indicates that the Senate's consent in article II, section 2 \nis by majority vote when no supermajority vote is required. The general \nrule is that majorities govern in a legislative body unless another \nrule is expressly provided.\n  The article also cited a Supreme Court case noting that more than a \ncentury ago, in United States v. Ballin, that ``the general rule of \nparliamentary bodies is that, when a quorum is present, the act of a \nmajority of the quorum is the act of the body. This has been the rule \nfor all time, except so far as in any given case the terms of the \norganic act under which the body is assembled have prescribed specific \nlimitations. . . . No such limitation is found in the Federal \nConstitution and, therefore, the general law of such bodies obtains.''\n  In the author's own words: ``. . . the particular process in the \nAppointments Clause--of presidential nomination and Senate `consent' by \na majority''--was carefully considered by the Constitutional \nConvention. A number of alternative processes for appointments were \nthoroughly considered--and rejected--by the Constitutional Convention. \nAnd this consideration took place over several months.\n  The Constitutional Convention considered at least three alternative \noptions to the final appointments clause: (1) placing the power in the \nPresident alone,(2) in the legislature alone, (3) in the legislature \nwith the President's advice and consent.\n  On June 13, 1787, it was originally proposed that judges be \n``appointed by the national Legislature,'' and that was rejected. \nMadison objected and made the alternative motion that appointments be \nmade by the Senate, and that was at first approved. Madison \nspecifically proposed that a ``supermajority'' be required for judicial \nappointments, but this was rejected.\n  On July 18, Nathaniel Ghorum made the alternative motion ``that the \nJudges be appointed by the Executive with the advice & consent of the \n2d branch,'' following on the practice in Massachusetts at that time.\n  Finally, on Friday, September 7, 1787, the Convention approved the \nfinal appointments clause, making the President primary and the Senate \nalone secondary with the role of advise and consent.\n  I am no lawyer, but to me if a document consistently states when a \nsupermajority vote is required and silent when it is not required, that \nthey meant to write it that way and it was not a mere oversight no \nsupermajority was required for the approval of judicial nominees.\n  Clearly, a supermajority was never intended, but what was intended \nwas an up-or-down vote, a fair nonpartisan up-or-down vote.\n  If a Member of the Senate disapproves of a judge, then let them vote \nagainst the nominee. I encourage them to express their dissatisfaction \nand vote no on the nominee. But do not deprive those of us in the \nSenate who support a nominee of our right to a vote. Do not deny an up-\nor-down vote entirely. Let's decide whether the Members of this body \napprove or disapprove of the nominees, and let's vote. Let's vote to \nshow whether this body believes the nominees are unfit for service or \nout of the mainstream. I believe they have majority support--majority \nsupport from the elected representatives of the people. But let's vote \nand find out.\n  It is our vote--the right of each Member to collectively participate \nin a show of advise and consent to the President--that exercises the \nremote choice of the people who sent us to Congress.\n  Our three-branch system of government cannot function without an \nequally strong judiciary. It is through the courts that justice is \nserved, rights protected, and that lawbreakers are sentenced for their \ncrimes.\n  Unfortunately, one out of four of President Bush's circuit nominees \nhave been subjected to the filibuster, the worst confirmation of \nappellate court judges since the Roosevelt administration. The minority \ncannot willingly refuse to provide an up-or-down vote on judicial \nnominees without acknowledging that irreparable harm may be done to an \nequal branch of government.\n  The decision to vote up or down on a nominee or deny that vote \nentirely pits the Constitution against parliamentary procedure. That is \nthe Constitution versus the filibuster. I urge my colleagues to put \ntheir faith in the\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nfounding document and not in a filibuster. To do anything else \ndishonors the Constitution and relegates it to a mere rule of \nprocedure.\n  I am pleased that we have reached a common ground on three of the \njudicial nominees. I am pleased that we have recognized our duties as \nMembers of this body to uphold the Constitution. But I would ask my \ncolleagues for fairness as we move forward for the rest of the session, \nfor the rest of this Congress, to put partisan politics aside and to \nfulfill our advise and consent obligations on all nominations. As we \nmove through the rest of the Congress, let's vote up or down and end \nthis debate about filibusters with honor.\n  Mr. President, I am excited that we can now move forward.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it seems as though we need to do closing \nscript, and if the Senator from Iowa will yield to me, I will be glad \nto do that formality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Ted Stevens,\n     President pro tempore of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am providing this supplemental \n     consolidated report, prepared by my Administration and \n     consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-\n     148), as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed \n     about deployments of U.S. combat-equipped armed forces around \n     the world. This supplemental report covers operations in \n     support of the global war on terrorism, Kosovo, and Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina.\n\n\n                      the global war on terrorism\n\n       Since September 24, 2001, I have reported, consistent with \n     Public Law 107-40 and the War Powers Resolution, on the \n     combat operations in Afghanistan against al-Qaida terrorists \n     and their Taliban supporters, which began on October 7, 2001, \n     and the deployment of various combat-equipped and combat-\n     support forces to a number of locations in the Central, \n     Pacific, and Southern Command areas of operation in support \n     of those operations and of other operations in our global war \n     on terrorism.\n       I will direct additional measures as necessary in the \n     exercise of the U.S. right to self-defense and to protect \n     U.S. citizens and interests. Such measures may include short-\n     notice deployments of special operations and other forces for \n     sensitive operations in various locations throughout the \n     world. It is not possible to know at this time either the \n     precise scope or duration of the deployment of U.S. Armed \n     Forces necessary to counter the terrorist threat to the \n     United States.\n       United States Armed Forces, with the assistance of numerous \n     coalition partners, continue to conduct the U.S. campaign to \n     pursue al-Qaida terrorists and to eliminate support to al-\n     Qaida.\n       These operations have been successful in seriously \n     degrading al-Qaida's training capabilities. United States \n     Armed Forces, with the assistance of numerous coalition \n     partners, ended the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and are \n     actively pursuing and engaging remnant al-Qaida and Taliban \n     fighters. Approximately 90 U.S. personnel are also assigned \n     to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in \n     Afghanistan. The U.N. Security Council authorized the ISAF \n     in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1386 of December 20, \n     2001, and has reaffirmed its authorization since that \n     time, most recently, for a 12-month period from October \n     13, 2004, in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1563 of \n     September 13, 2004. The mission of the ISAF under NATO \n     command is to assist the Government of Afghanistan in \n     creating a safe and secure environment that allows \n     reconstruction and the reestablishment of Afghan \n     authorities. Currently, all 26 NATO nations contribute to \n     the ISAF. Ten non-NATO contributing countries also \n     participate by providing military and other support \n     personnel to the ISAF.\n       The United States continues to detain several hundred al-\n     Qaida and Taliban fighters who are believed to pose a \n     continuing threat to the United States and its interests. The \n     combat-equipped and combat-support forces deployed to Naval \n     Base, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in the U.S. Southern Command area \n     of operations since January 2002 continue to conduct secure \n     detention operations for the approximately 520 enemy \n     combatants at Guantanamo Bay.\n       The U.N. Security Council authorized a Multinational Force \n     (MNF) in Iraq under unified command in U.N. Security Council \n     Resolution 1511 of October 16, 2003, and reaffirmed its \n     authorization in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546 of \n     June 8, 2004, noting the Iraqi Interim Government's request \n     to retain the presence of the MNF. Under U.N. Security \n     Council Resolution 1546, the mission of the MNF is to \n     contribute to the security and stability in Iraq, as \n     reconstruction continues, until the completion of Iraq's \n     political transformation. These contributions include \n     assisting in building the capability of the Iraqi security \n     forces and institutions, as the Iraqi people, represented by \n     the Transitional National Assembly, draft a constitution and \n     establish a constitutionally elected government. The U.S. \n     contribution to the MNF is approximately 139,000 military \n     personnel.\n       In furtherance of our efforts against terrorists who pose a \n     continuing and imminent threat to the United States, our \n     friends and allies, and our forces abroad, the United States \n     continues to work with friends and allies in areas around the \n     globe. United States combat-equipped and combat-support \n     forces are located in the Horn of Africa region, and the U.S. \n     forces headquarters element in Djibouti provides command and \n     control support as necessary for military operations against \n     al-Qaida and other international terrorists in the Horn of \n     Africa region, including Yemen. These forces also assist in \n     enhancing counterterrorism capabilities in Kenya, Ethiopia, \n     Yemen, Eritrea, and Djibouti. In addition, the United States \n     continues to conduct maritime interception operations on the \n     high seas in the areas of responsibility of all of the \n     geographic combatant commanders. These maritime operations \n     have the responsibility to stop the movement, arming, or \n     financing of international terrorists.\n\n\n                      NATO-LED KOSOVO FORCE (KFOR)\n\n       As noted in previous reports regarding U.S. contributions \n     in support of peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, the U.N. \n     Security Council authorized Member States to establish KFOR \n     in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999. \n     The mission of KFOR is to provide an international security \n     presence in order to deter renewed hostilities; verify and, \n     if necessary, enforce the terms of the Military Technical \n     Agreement between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n     (which is now Serbia and Montenegro); enforce the terms of \n     the Undertaking on Demilitarization and Transformation of the \n     former Kosovo Liberation Army; provide day-to-day operational \n     direction to the Kosovo Protection Corps; and maintain a safe \n     and secure environment to facilitate the work of the U.N. \n     Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK).\n       Currently, there are 23 NATO nations contributing to KFOR. \n     Eleven non-NATO contributing countries also participate by \n     providing military personnel and other support personnel to \n     KFOR. The U.S. contribution to KFOR in Kosovo is about 1,700 \n     U.S. military personnel, or approximately 10 percent of \n     KFOR's total strength of approximately 17,000 personnel. \n     Additionally, U.S. military personnel occasionally operate \n     from Macedonia, Albania, and Greece in support of KFOR \n     operations.\n       The U.S. forces have been assigned to a sector principally \n     centered around Gnjilane in the eastern region of Kosovo. For \n     U.S. KFOR forces, as for KFOR generally, maintaining a safe \n     and secure environment remains the primary military task. The \n     KFOR operates under NATO command and control and rules of \n     engagement. The KFOR coordinates with and supports UNMIK at \n     most levels; provides a security presence in towns, villages, \n     and the countryside; and organizes checkpoints and patrols in \n     key areas to provide security, protect minorities, resolve \n     disputes, and help instill in the community a feeling of \n     confidence.\n       In accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, \n     UNMIK continues to transfer additional competencies to the \n     Kosovar provisional Institutions of Self-Government, which \n     includes the President, Prime Minister, multiple ministries, \n     and the Kosovo Assembly. The UNMIK retains ultimate authority \n     in some sensitive areas such as police, justice, and ethnic \n     minority affairs.\n       NATO continues formally to review KFOR's mission at 6-month \n     intervals. These reviews provide a basis for assessing \n     current force levels, future requirements, force structure, \n     force reductions, and the eventual withdrawal of KFOR. NATO \n     has adopted the Joint Operations Area plan to regionalize and \n     rationalize its force structure in the Balkans. The UNMIK \n     international police and the Kosovo Police Service (KPS) \n     have full responsibility for public safety and policing \n     throughout Kosovo except in the area of South Mitrovica, \n     where KFOR and UNMIK share this responsibility due to \n     security concerns. The UNMIK international police and KPS \n     also have begun to assume responsibility for guarding \n     patrimonial sites and established border-crossing \n     checkpoints. The\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\n     KFOR augments security in particularly sensitive areas or \n     in response to particular threats as needed.\n\n\n         nato headquarters--sarajevo in bosnia and herzegovina\n\n       Pursuant to the June 2004 decision made by NATO Heads of \n     State and Government, and in accordance with U.N. Security \n     Council Resolution 1575 of November 22, 2004, NATO concluded \n     its Stabilization Force (SFOR) operations in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina and established NATO Headquarters--Sarajevo to \n     continue to assist in implementing the Peace Agreement in \n     conjunction with a newly established European Force (EUFOR). \n     NATO Headquarters--Sarajevo, to which approximately 235 U.S. \n     personnel are assigned, is, with EUFOR, the legal successor \n     to SFOR. The principal tasks of NATO Headquarters--Sarajevo \n     are providing advice on defense reform and performing \n     operational supporting tasks, such as counterterrorism and \n     supporting the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \n     Yugoslavia.\n       I have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in \n     all of these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive. Officials of my Administration \n     and I communicate regularly with the leadership and other \n     Members of Congress with regard to these deployments, and we \n     will continue to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5776-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on this year's \nMemorial Day and the importance of this holiday in American life.\n  As I attend Memorial Day parades and commemorations, I am struck by \nthe spirit of national unity because I know that across Michigan and \nacross our Nation our fellow Americans are taking part in similar \ngatherings where we take the time to reflect on our history and the \nsacrifice that brought us to where we are today.\n  Memorial Day is unique among American holidays. On Memorial Day we do \nnot honor a particular date or event, a battle or the end of a war. On \nMemorial Day we do not honor an individual leader--a President or a \ngeneral. On Memorial Day we do not even honor ourselves at least not in \nthe present tense.\n  On Memorial Day we pay homage to the thousands and thousands of \nindividual acts of bravery and sacrifice that stretch back to the \nbattlefields of our revolution and to those taking place today in the \ndeserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan.\n  This year, Memorial Day has a special significance as the 60th \nanniversary of the battle of Iwo Jima. This past February marks the \ndates in history that cost nearly 26,000 lives. The service members \ninvolved in that battle responded with courage and bravery. Iwo Jima is \none of the most important battles of World War II. On behalf of a \ngrateful Nation, we pay respect to the veterans of Iwo Jima and those \nwho made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  This Memorial Day we also honor the men and women currently serving \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. We must honor our commitment to them by making \nsure they have everything they need to complete their mission and come \nhome safely. We must also keep our promises to those who proudly served \nour country by making sure they receive the benefits they deserve.\n  So, as we observe this holiday we call Memorial Day, let us remember \nthe centuries of sacrifice by the many men and women that this day \nrepresents. And let's make sure that all who served with honor are \nhonored in return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5776-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      THE PASSING OF GEORGE POOLE\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \non the passing of a dedicated, 28-year employee of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Insurance Center, Mr. George Poole. Until his untimely \ndeath, Mr. Poole served within the VA Insurance Service, widely \nregarded as a model of efficiency and service excellence within the \nFederal Government.\n  We in the Congress spent a considerable amount of time on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill debating enhancements to insurance \nbenefits for our servicemembers fighting abroad. We were successful in \nnot only increasing the amount of life insurance benefits available for \nservicemembers, but also creating a new traumatic injury insurance \nbenefit for those severely disabled. Without the assistance of public \nservants like George, who provide the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and \nthe Congress, with invaluable technical assistance on all legislation \naffecting insurance benefits, our job would be very difficult.\n  George began his life-long dedication to public service while serving \nhonorably in the U.S. Air Force from 1964 through 1968. Subsequent to \nhis service, he then received a bachelor's degree and a law degree, \ntaking full advantage of the Department of Veterans Affairs-\nadministered GI bill. There is little doubt that his time in the \nmilitary service of his country, and his subsequent studies under the \nGI bill, inspired him to pursue a career dedicated to helping his \nfellow veterans. This dedication to fellow veterans translated into a \nlong and distinguished 28-year career with the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs where he served his Nation from 1977 until his death.\n  His long career with the Department of Veterans Affairs was entirely \nwithin the Insurance Service where he served in an impressive litany of \ncapacities. Starting as a claims examiner in the death claims activity, \nhe worked his way up through numerous management level positions \nincluding section chief, division chief and finally culminating his \ndistinguished career as chief, program administration, a senior \nmanagement position. In this, the final step in his career ladder, he \nwas responsible for a variety of duties, not the least of which was \ncomposing legislative initiatives concerning servicemembers' and \nveterans' group life insurance programs. This insurance coverage is \nintended for members of this Nation's Active-Duty military and Reserve \ncomponents, as well as veterans recently released from Active service, \nwho are in, or recently were in, harm's way defending the United \nStates. The importance of assuring that all members of the military, \nveterans, and their families are properly provided for in their time of \nneed goes without question. Therefore, George's work will undoubtedly \nhave a lasting effect on the families of thousands.\n  I would like to extend my sincere appreciation on behalf of a \ngrateful Nation to the Poole family for George's dedicated service to \nthis Nation's veterans. I also extend my heartfelt sympathies to the \nPoole family during their time of sorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5776-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5776-S5777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO GLENN D. CUNNINGHAM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, Today I wish to pay tribute to \none of New Jersey's most acclaimed advocates of social justice, mayor \nand State senator Glenn D. Cunningham, on the 1-year anniversary of his \npassing.\n  Although Glenn's life was tragically cut short by a heart attack, his \nextraordinary legacy of public service lives on. His remarkable \naccomplishments are surpassed only by the love he felt for his family, \nfriends, and the people in the community he served.\n  A lifelong resident of Jersey City, Glenn demonstrated his sense of \nduty early in life, enlisting in the United States Marine Corps after \nhe completed high school. He served his country with distinction for \nfour years, and then continued his commitment to public safety by \njoining the Jersey City Police Department in 1967.\n  Aided by a strong work ethic and intelligence, Glenn rose through the \nranks of the department over the next 25 years, attaining the position \nof Captain. Realizing the value of education and the power of ideas, \nduring this same time period he attended Jersey City State College and \nearned a bachelor's degree, graduating cum laude in 1974.\n  Glenn had a passion for helping people and the ability to take on \nmany diverse responsibilities and perform many tasks at once. He \nexpanded his public service career in 1975, serving as a Hudson County \nFreeholder until 1978. He was subsequently elected to the Jersey City \nCouncil, where he served two consecutive terms, including one term as \ncity council president.\n  Upon his retirement from the police department in 1991, Glenn was \nappointed the director of the Hudson County Department of Public \nSafety.\n  In 1996, President Clinton appointed Glenn as United States Marshall \nfor\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\nthe State of New Jersey. This appointment broke a barrier for African \nAmerican leaders in our State, and I was proud to support Glenn for the \nposition, knowing that he would do a great job.\n  Never one to be complacent or satisfied with the status quo, Glenn \nset his sights on another historic milestone, and in 2001 he became the \nfirst African-American mayor of Jersey City. Adding to his already \nimpressive list of ``firsts,'' Glenn's 2004 election to the New Jersey \nState senate marked the first time a mayor of Jersey City has \nsimultaneously held State office.\n  Glenn's illustrious career in public service was marked first and \nforemost by his unwavering commitment to the citizens of Jersey City. \nLike Frederick Douglass, Glenn battled to improve the lives of the \npeople he represented even if his efforts hurt him politically.\n  Glenn's constituents could always approach him with their problems or \nconcerns, and he made time to listen to them. His genuine care for \nothers inspired hope, and his courage, dignity, and fierce \ndetermination helped reinvigorate a once-distressed city.\n  The effects of his reform-minded, progressive initiatives continue to \nresonate today. As a friend, a dedicated public servant, and a \ngroundbreaking pioneer, Glenn is sorely missed by many. His memory, \nhowever, lives on, and will continue to inspire others to work for the \nsame positive social change that was so close to his heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5777-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE VERMONT ARTS COUNCIL\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \n40th anniversary of the establishment of the Vermont Arts Council and \nits dedicated support for the arts in Vermont.\n  The Vermont Arts Council, the only nonprofit State arts agency in the \ncountry, was founded four decades ago ``on a simple and powerful \npremise: that the arts enrich lives and form a vital part of Vermont \ncommunity life.''\n  Throughout the years, the Vermont Arts Council has served as \nVermont's foremost arts advocate. Its resources are dedicated to the \nprofessional development of local artists, and it is a primary source \nof information about the arts, their impact on Vermont and across the \nNation.\n  Vermont is rich in culture and creativity, and the Vermont Arts \nCouncil has played such a vital role in contributing to this \nenvironment where artists and arts organizations thrive. The arts and \nhumanities are a powerful force in bringing us together and their \npresence is to be nurtured and integrated into our communities at every \nopportunity.\n  The Vermont Arts Council became a reality 40 years ago thanks to \nthose who understand the important role the arts play in education and \nin our daily lives. Pauline Billings, who served as one of the original \ntrustees of the council, has worked tirelessly in support of the arts \nin Vermont. It is so fitting that she is being honored with the \ncouncil's Lifetime Achievement Award for the Arts. I cannot think of a \nmore deserving recipient, and I welcome this opportunity to acknowledge \nPolly for her invaluable contributions.\n  It is with great pleasure that I recognize the Vermont Arts Council \nas it marks its 40th anniversary and pay tribute to the council's work \nin helping the arts remain a vibrant force in Vermont.

Mr. President, because truth in labeling is \nimportant these days, let me just simply label this as some old-\nfashioned bragging about my brother.\n  In last Sunday's Fargo Forum, a column by Jack Zaleski described the \nwork of my brother Darrell in an extraordinary way and I wanted to \nshare it far and wide.\n  Darrell has been a journalist, filmmaker, a writer, a historian and \nnow a builder. It is already a remarkable career and much is yet to \ncome.\n  But today I am reprinting for my colleagues the newspaper column that \ndescribes his latest project: the North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame. It \nwill be dedicated to the history of ranch life and cowboy life on the \nnorthern Great Plains. His work is an inspiration to those who have a \npassion about honoring our history.\n  From the Indians, to the settlers and ranchers, to the rodeo cowboys \nand the bucking horses, the stories will be brought to life in the \nCowboy Hall of Fame in Medora, North Dakota beginning next month.\n  It is a tribute to the dreams and hard work of Darrell Dorgan and \nmany others who share in this accomplishment.\n  Congratulations to all of them.\n  I ask to have the attached article entitled ``Long Ride to Cowboy \nHall of Fame'' from the May 22nd edition of the Fargo Forum printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                     [From the Forum, May 22, 2005]\n\n                    Long Ride to Cowboy Hall of Fame\n\n                           (By Jack Zaleski)\n\n       I've known Darrell Dorgan for 30 years. He's a member of a \n     shrinking cadre of journalists and former journalists who got \n     started in this business in North Dakota at about the same \n     time. Most of them still are at it. Dorgan (a former \n     journalist) is a contemporary of Grand Forks Herald editor/\n     publisher Mike Jacobs, Bismarck Tribune managing editor Ken \n     Rogers, North Dakota Public Radio news director Dave \n     Thompson, and me.\n       These days Dorgan is executive director of the North Dakota \n     Cowboy Hall of Fame. A few years ago he wrapped up a career \n     in broadcast journalism during which he established himself \n     as one of the most knowledgeable, dogged reporters in the \n     Bismarck press corps. His work for Prairie Public \n     Broadcasting was some of the best ever done for public \n     television. For his efforts he won nearly every award a \n     broadcaster can win.\n       But history was calling--specifically the history, legend \n     and lore of western North Dakota. A bona fide expert on the \n     exploits and foibles of Gen. George A. Custer, Dorgan \n     eventually found a way to fold his love for the state's \n     history into a craft and a living: filmmaking. His videos on \n     such topics as Lewis & Clark in North Dakota, Fort Abraham \n     Lincoln and Custer's 7th, and Sheheke, Ambassador of the \n     Mandan have won praise and plaudits across the nation and in \n     Europe.\n       It wasn't a big leap when Dorgan took on the task of \n     raising funds to establish a North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame \n     in historic Medora in the Badlands. As executive director, he \n     worked tirelessly for several years to raise public and \n     private money to fund the $4 million western heritage and \n     cultural center. His efforts have paid off: The hall of fame \n     has a sneak preview scheduled May 28 during the Cowboy Poetry \n     and Art Show. The center will open officially in mid-June. A \n     dedication celebration, complete with induction of hall of \n     fame candidates, will come in early August, at about the time \n     of the Champions Ride rodeo near Sentinel Butte, one of the \n     state's premier bronc riding and roping events.\n       Dorgan would be the first to say he didn't do it alone. And \n     of course, a lot of people deserve a measure of credit for \n     the success of the project. But without his vision and focus \n     on the task, the hall would still be a wish. It takes a point \n     man to raise that much money. It takes perserverance.\n       I know there were times when Dorgan was discouraged. But he \n     knew North Dakotans would respond to a center where cowboy \n     and ranch life could be enshrined. He understood how deep \n     western roots are planted in the state's history and \n     heritage.

A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \nportions of the Musconetcong River in the State of New Jersey as a \ncomponent of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Lautenberg, I \nam introducing legislation, the Musconetcong Wild and Scenic Rivers \nAct, to designate portions of the Musconetcong River in New Jersey as a \ncomponent of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. I am proud to \nbe joining my New Jersey colleague, Representative Scott Garrett, who \nhas introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives, with \nthe support of Congressmen Robert Andrews, Michael Ferguson, Rodney \nFrelinghuysen, Robert Menendez, Frank Pallone, Donald Payne and James \nSaxton.\n  This is important legislation to help preserve and protect one of the \nmost valuable natural resources in the State of New Jersey. The \nMusconetcong River is a 43 mile river that runs westward from Lake \nMusconetcong to the Delaware River. It provides many ecological, \nrecreational and scenic benefits to the northwestern portion of our \nState. In addition, it is also home to a number of archeological sites \nand other historic areas, including one site in Warren County where \nscientists have discovered stone knives and other weapons dating back \nat least ten thousand years. Finally, it feeds acquifers that provide \nmany residents in Hunterdon and Warren counties with quality drinking \nwater.\n  Unfortunately, the beauty and value that the Musconetcong provides is \nat risk. The river faces pressures, for example, from the development \nthat is occurring on or near its shores. This has caused water quality \nto deteriorate from increased levels of bacteria, silt and runoff from \nroadways. Further, many of the municipalities that lie along the river \nlack the financial resources to adequately protect the river for future \ngenerations.\n  The Musconetcong Wild and Scenic Rivers Act would help state, county \nand local officials begin to address these concerns, working alongside \nenvironmental and public interest groups. By including this river in \nthe Wild and Scenic River System, it would allow New Jersey to \nimplement a management plan for the river that has the support of three \ncounties and 13 municipalities. In addition it would make the river \neligible for financial, planning, and technical assistance to help \npreserve and protect it. The goal is to encourage uses and development \nthat is compatible with the river.\n  The Wild and Scenic River System already includes the Maurice and \nGreat Egg Harbor Rivers in New Jersey as well as the lower and middle \nportions of the Delaware River\n  I will work hard in the 109th Congress to see that the Musconetcong \nis added to this list. I hope my colleagues will support this \nlegislation, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 4 of the United States Code to \nprohibit the double taxation of telecommuters and others who work from \nhome; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I am pleased to rise today, together with my \ncolleague Senator Lieberman, to introduce The Telecommuter Tax Fairness \nAct of 2005.\n  The Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act of 2005 will put an end to legal \ndoctrine that unfairly penalizes thousands of workers in Connecticut \nand in other States throughout the country whose only offense is that \nthey sometimes work from home or from a local office of their employer.\n  Technology has changed the way business is conducted in America. With \nthe use of cell phones, lap-top computers, email, the Internet, mobile \nnetworking, and many other telecommunication advancements of the 21st \ncentury, Americans have a greater flexibility in where they can work, \nwithout compromising productivity. Many citizens now choose to work \nfrom home or alternative offices when their physical presence is not \nnecessary at their primary place of work.\n  Telecommuting provides enormous benefits for businesses, families, \nand communities. It helps businesses lower costs and raise worker \nproductivity. It reduces congestion on our roads and rails, and in so \ndoing it lowers pollution. It helps workers better manage the demands \nof work and family. And last but not least, it can mean lower income \ntaxes for working men and women.\n  Yet, the many benefits to workers of telecommuting are today placed \nin jeopardy because of current law in New York and a few other States. \nToday, New York State requires that workers pay income tax on income \neven if it is not earned in the State through their ``convenience of \nthe employer'' rule. While there are several States that have the \n``convenience of the employer'' rule, no other State applies it with \nthe same rigor as New York.\n  New York's ``convenience of the employer'' rule requires that by \nworking for a New York employer, all income earned from that employer \nmust be declared in New York so long as the worker ``could'' perform \nhis or her duties in New York. A worker for a New York employer who \nworks part-time from home in Connecticut or another State is still \nsubject to taxation by New York on 100 percent of his or her income. At \nthe same time, the work done by that worker in a State outside New York \nis subject to taxation by that State.\n  This unfairly subjects many workers who telecommute from their homes \nor from satellite offices outside of New York to a double tax on that \npart of the income earned from home. According to Connecticut's \nAttorney General, thousands of Connecticut residents alone are affected \nby this unfair double taxation.\n  However, it isn't only Connecticut residents that are affected.\n  Thomas Huckaby is a Tennessee-based computer programmer that \ntelecommuted for a firm in Queens, NY. In 1994 and 1995, Mr. Huckaby \nspent 75 percent of his time working in Tennessee and the remaining 25 \npercent working in the Queens office and attempted to apportion his \nincome accordingly. New York, however, sought to tax 100 percent of his \nincome and was successful due to it's ``convenience of employer'' rule. \nOn March 29, 2005 the New York Court of Appeals upheld New York's rule \nin a 4 to 3 decision. Currently, Mr. Huckaby is in the process of \npetitioning the Supreme Court.\n  A similar story involves Arthur Gray, a New Hampshire resident who \nworked for the New York Company Cowen & Co. as an investment counselor \nfrom 1976 through 1996, and paid New York State income taxes during \nthat time. In 1997, Arthur Gray, per his employer's request, opened and \nmanaged an office from his home in New Hampshire. Several times during \nthe year, Mr. Gray worked in New York, but most of his days were spent \nin New Hampshire. When paying his taxes during this time, he paid New \nYork State income taxes for the days he was in New York, but not for \nthe days he worked in New Hampshire. New York, however, sought to tax \n100 percent of his income and was successful due to this ``convenience \nof the employer'' rule.\n  These are only two examples of the far-reaching consequences of this \n``convenience of employer'' rule. There are thousands of individuals \nacross the country who are adversely impacted by this rule. Most, \nhowever, but most lack the time, money, or energy to take their case to \ncourt.\n  This potential for double taxation is not only unfair, it also \ndiscourages workers from telecommuting when we should be doing the \nopposite.\n  Legislation is needed to protect these honest workers who deserve \nfair and equitable treatment under the law. The Telecommuter Tax \nFairness Act of 2005 accomplishes this by specifically preventing a \nState from engaging in the current fiction of deeming a nonresident to \nbe in the taxing State when the nonresident is actually working in \nanother State. In doing so, it will eliminate the possibility that \ncitizens will be double-taxed when telecommuting.\n  Establishing a ``physical presence'' test--as this legislation would \ndo--is the most logical basis for determining tax status. If a worker \nis in a State, and taking advantage of that State's infrastructure, the \nworker should pay taxes in that State.\n  Some suggest that the double-taxation quandary can easily be fixed by \nhaving other States provide a tax credit to those telecommuters. \nHowever, why should Connecticut, or any other\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\nState, be required to allow a credit on income actually earned in the \nState? If a worker is working in Connecticut, he or she is benefiting \nfrom a range of Services paid for and maintained by Connecticut \nincluding roads, water, police, fire protection, and communications \nservices. It's only fair that Connecticut ask that worker to help \nsupport the services that he or she uses.\n  This is not just an issue which deals with a small group of citizens \nfrom one small State. Rather, this is an issue which affects workers \nthroughout the country. It will only grow more pressing as people and \nbusinesses continue to seek to take advantage of new technologies that \naffect the way we live and work.\n  I hope our colleagues will favorably consider this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1097\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the current Internal Revenue Code and \nreplace it with a flat tax, thereby guaranteeing economic growth and \ngreater fairness for all Americans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce my \nflat tax bill, S. 1099 the ``Tax Simplification Act of 2005.'' The \nPresident has made fundamental tax reform a top priority for his second \nterm. I believe my bill offers that fundamental tax reform and will \ndrastically improve our Nation's economy and the way Americans go about \nthe business of paying taxes. This bill would repeal the current \nInternal Revenue Code and create a single rate for all taxpayers--\nseventeen percent when the tax is fully implemented--and gives tax-free \ntreatment to all savings and investment, not just dividends.\n  A major reason why I support a flat tax is because it wil1 place more \nmoney into the hands of hardworking Americans. It will allow \nindividuals--not the government--to decide how to best spend their \nmoney. Lowering taxes allows Americans to keep more of their money to \nkeep up with monthly expenses like, insurance coverage, educational \ncosts, and prescription drugs. Lowering taxes also makes it easier for \nAmericans to save for their retirement through private savings plans. \nAlthough I strongly believe in the importance of private savings, my \nbill leaves the Social Security system intact and, in fact, provides \nseniors with more money by repealing the current tax on Social Security \nbenefits.\n  I have said many times before that our current progressive tax system \nis unfair. It punishes success and stymies economic growth. The only \nway we can remedy this is to adopt a single tax rate for all taxpayers. \nTransitioning to a flat tax will not only increase the fairness of the \ntax code, but it will also increase the incentives to work and thus \nboost economic growth.\n  Today our tax code and its regulations total more than 60,000 pages \nwhich are complex, confusing and costly to comply with. Were a flat tax \nin place now, taxpayers would file a return the size of a postcard, and \nevery American would be taxed equally and at the same rate. Rather than \nspending hours poring over convoluted IRS forms, or resorting to \nprofessional tax assistance, the flat tax allows taxpayers to determine \ntheir taxes quickly and easily. Everyone will fill out the same simple \nreturn, everyone will be taxed at the same rate, and everyone will pay \ntheir fare share. Paying taxes may never be a pleasant experience, but \nat least under a flat tax it wouldn't be mind-boggling.\n  I fully realize that the bill I am introducing today is a monumental \nshift from the current tax code, but the time is ripe for fundamental \ntax reform. We must not allow the enormity of the task to deter us from \nenacting better, more efficient tax laws.

A bill to amend the Head Start Act to address the needs of \nvictims of child abuse and neglect, children in foster care, children \nin kinship care, and homeless children; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator DeWine to \nintroduce the ``Improving Head Start Access for Homeless and Foster \nChildren Act of 2005.''\n  Head Start has made significant strides in providing comprehensive \nservices to low-income children. Since\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\nHead Start was established in 1965, low-income preschool-aged children \nhave received education, health, nutritional, social and developmental \nservices they would not otherwise have access to. Unfortunately, \nchildren in greatest need of these services--homelss and foster youth--\nare not receiving those services at adequate levels.\n  It is estimated that 1.35 million children experience homelessness \neach year, and the mean income of a homeless family is at 46 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level. Due to extreme poverty and the inherent \ninstability of homelessness, children facing these conditions have \nconsiderably higher physical, mental and emotional difficulties. It is \nnot surprising that homeless children are reported to be twice as \nlikely to have a learning disability and three times as likely of \nhaving an emotional or behavioral problem that interferes with their \nlearning.\n  These children also face significant barriers to participation in \nHead Start. These children lack transportation. They lack the necessary \ndocumentation. They suffer from the invisibility of homeless families \nwhich leaves the community unaware of the need to include these \nchildren in Head Start recruitment and prioritization. As a result of \nthese and other barriers, only 15 percent of preschool children \nidentified as homeless are enrolled in preschool programs of any kind, \ncompared to the 57 percent of low-income preschool children. Currently \nonly 2 percent of the more than 900,000 students served by Head Start \nare children identified as homeless. States report that 60 percent of \nhomeless students are having difficulties gaining access to Head Start.\n  In addition to homeless children, kids in foster care face a unique \nset of challenges which both increase their need for the stability and \neducational services provided by Head Start. Tragically, these same \nchallenges also hinder their ability to gain access to those services. \nFoster children are likely to suffer from both emotional and physical \ninstability. With more than 500,000 children in foster care and a \nshortage of foster parents in this country, these children often go \nwithout the attention and advocacy that preschool age children need.\n  More than 40 percent of the children in homeless shelters are under \nthe age of five. The first years of a child's life significantly impact \npersonal development and future academic achievement. That is why I \nonce again stand with Senator DeWine to increase access to Head Start \nfor homeless and foster children.\n  Our bill would ensure equal access and benefits from to early \neducation and supportive services provided by Head Start for the \nNation's poorest children. It would make all homeless children eligible \nfor Head Start. The bill also allow homeless children to be immediately \nenrolled in Head Start by allowing them extra time to provided required \ndocumentation; providing that that documentation be in a reasonable \ntime frame. And, our bill would require school, district liaisons to \nassist families in obtaining necessary documents. In addition, our bill \nincreases Head Start's outreach to homeless and foster children. \nFurther, the bill would reduce barriers by encouraging coordination \nbetween Head Start agencies and community programs that serve these \nvulnerable populations.\n  Again, I would like to thank my colleague Senator DeWine for his many \nefforts in supporting homeless and foster youth. I urge the Senate to \nensure that all children, despite their background and socioeconomic \nsituation receive equal access to a quality education.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join with Senator MURRAY to \nintroduce the ``Improving Head Start Access for Homeless and Foster \nChildren Act of 2005.'' The problems children who are homeless and in \nfoster care face are daunting. I am grateful to Senator Murray for her \nleadership in this area. She and I worked on coordinating and improving \naccess to services for homeless and foster children in the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and I am glad to have had the \nopportunity to work with her again on this issue.\n  Who is more vulnerable than a child, under the age of five, living on \nthe street or in a shelter? Who is more vulnerable than a child under \nfive who has been abused and neglected? Just because young children \ncannot speak to their needs does not mean that they should have no \nvoice. The hundreds of thousands of children in the United States who \nexperience homelessness, separation from their parents, or abuse and \nneglect each year are in need of our help to ensure their needs are \nmet. Unfortunately, their voices are all too often not heard and their \nneeds go unmet. The bill we are introducing\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\ntoday would serve as one more step, one move closer, to ensuring \nhomeless and foster children are visible and their voices audible.\n  In the United States, on any given day, more than half a million \nchildren are in foster care, 20,000 of whom are in my home State of \nOhio, alone. Of this group, 27 percent are age five and--under. In \n2003, we also know that more than 900,000 children were found to be \nvictims of child abuse or neglect. Children as young as six months old \ncan suffer from long-term effects after experiencing or witnessing \ntrauma. More than half of the children in foster care experience \ndevelopmental delays. Children in foster care have three to seven times \nmore chronic medical conditions, birth defects, emotional disorders, \nand academic failures than children of similar socioeconomic \nbackgrounds who never enter foster care.\n  In its 2000 Report to Congress, the U.S. Department of Education \nnoted that only 15 percent of preschool children identified as homeless \nwere enrolled in preschool programs. In comparison, 57 percent of low-\nincome preschool children participated in preschool in 1999. These \nstatistics are especially troubling in light of the fact that over 40 \npercent of children living in shelters are under the age of five--an \nage when early childhood education can have a significant positive \nimpact on a child's development and future academic achievement.\n  Head Start began in 1965, and since its inception, it has served more \nthan 22 million of America's poorest children. This important program \nhas helped these children build the skills they need to succeed in \nschool and provide them with the services they need to be healthy and \nactive in society. With its comprehensive services and family-centered \napproach, Head Start often offers the most appropriate educational \nsetting for children and families experiencing homelessness and for \nchildren in foster care. By providing comprehensive health, nutrition, \neducation, and social services, Head Start helps provide for the needs \nof these vulnerable children. And, with the passage of this bill, Head \nStart could help even more. Yet, programmatic and policy barriers \ncontinue to limit their access to and participation in Head Start. Some \nbarriers to Head Start access are related to lack of coordination with \nchild welfare agencies, high mobility, lack of required documentation, \nand lack of transportation.\n  Our bill would encourage Head Start grantees to reduce these barriers \nby directing them to increase their outreach to homeless and foster \nchildren. It also would encourage coordination between Head Start \ngrantees and community service providers and homeless and foster \nchildren. It would increase the coordination for these populations as \nthey transition out of Head Start to elementary school and increase \nreporting requirements. And, it would allow homeless children to be \nautomatically eligible for Head Start.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Murray, for her leadership on \nthis issue. I look forward to working with her to incorporate these \nideas into the Head Start reauthorization bill currently being \nconsidered in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1102. A bill to extend the aviation war risk insurance program for \n3 years; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto mandate that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) extend the \noffering of war risk insurance through August 31, 2007, to our Nation's \nair carriers. I am very pleased that Senator Burns, the Chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, has agreed to co-sponsor this legislation.\n  Prior to September 11, 2001, war risk insurance was generally \nattainable and affordable for U.S. airlines. But, as we know, that day \nchanged everything for America. No industry was more dramatically and \nfundamentally changed than the U.S. aviation industry. Recognizing that \nthe commercial insurance market was not willing to provide war risk \ninsurance to the airline industry in the immediate aftermath of \nSeptember 11, Congress required the FAA provide war risk insurance to \nU.S. air carriers. We expected that in time U.S. air carriers would be \nable to obtain commercial war risk insurance. Unfortunately, the \ncommercial war risk insurance market has priced its products beyond the \nmeans of our air carriers. According to the Air Transport Association, \na return to the commercial market to obtain war risk insurance could \ncost U.S. airlines $600 million to $700 million a year, up from the \ncurrent $140 million. Because of the lack of a vibrant competitive \ncommercial market, last year, Congress extended its mandate that the \nFAA provide this insurance.\n  In a report to Congress, the FAA noted that even though war risk \ninsurance is available in the private market, it is offered on terms \nthat the industry just cannot afford. My bill would mandate the \ncontinuation of this vital program through August 31, 2008. In time, we \nshould expect the private market to offer this coverage, but the \nreality is that the insurance industry continues to seek exorbitant \nrates for this coverage. The market has failed and it is the \ngovernment's responsibility to provide this insurance as we have done \nin previous times of war.\n  The financial conditions faced by domestic airlines have seen little, \nif any, improvement. This legislation is supported by the low-cost \ncarriers who are the healthiest companies in the industry, as they know \nthat their profitability would be at risk if they were forced to go to \ncommercial market for this insurance at this time. The current \ncommercial market is simply unable to provide adequate war-risk \ncoverage without unreasonable cost to airlines. For airlines, private \ncoverage would mean annual payment increases of millions of dollars. \nEven with FAA insurance coverage, airlines are projected to lose $5.5 \nbillion this year. This legislation will help the airlines weather \ntheir current financial crisis. If U.S. airlines were forced to go to \nthe commercial market for this insurance, we would likely see more \nairlines in bankruptcy or cease to exist at all.\n  I believe that airlines remain a prime targets for terrorist acts. It \nis because of this threat that the commercial insurance market is \nunaffordable for the airlines. My legislation seeks to address a \npressing problem facing one of the most critical industries in the \ncountry. My bill is one small but important measure that Congress can \ntake to make sure our nation has a vibrant and financially secure \nairline industry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AIRLINE WAR RISK POLICIES AND \n                   TERRORISM COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) Extension of Policies.--Section 44302(f) of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``August 31, 2005, \n     and may extend through December 31, 2005,'' in paragraph (1) \n     and inserting ``August 31, 2008, and may extend through \n     December 31, 2008,''.\n       (b) Extension of Terrorism Coverage.--Section 44303(b) of \n     title 49, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     ``December 31, 2005,'' and inserting ``December 31, 2008,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 1103. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe individual alternative minimum tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this weekend, millions of Americans \nwatched in suspense as Anakin Skywalker was lured to the Dark side and \nbecame Darth Vader. What millions of those same Americans may not be \naware of is another Darth Vader lurking in our tax code; that is, the \nAlternative Minimum Tax, or AMT.\n  The AMT has many of the same qualities as Anakin Skywalker. The AMT \nwas supposed to bring order and fairness to the tax world, but it \neventually got off on the wrong path and became a threat to middle-\nincome taxpayers. Both Skywalker and the AMT started off with great \nintentions, but eventually they went astray. And now we have the Darth \nVader of the Tax Code bearing down on millions of unsuspecting \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\n  That is why I am pleased to join with my friend and Chairman Chuck \nGrassley, and our fellow committee colleagues, Senators Wyden and Kyl, \nto introduce legislation today that will repeal the individual AMT. Our \nbill simply says that individuals beginning January 1, 2006 will owe \nzero, I repeat, zero dollars under the AMT. Further, our bill provides \nthat individuals with AMT credits can continue to use those up to 90 \npercent of their regular tax liability.\n  If we do not act, CRS estimates that in 2006, the family-unfriendly \nAMT will hit middle-income families earning $63,000 with three \nchildren. What was once meant to ensure that a handful of millionaires \ndid not eliminate all taxes through excessive deductions is now meaning \nmillions of working families, including thousands in my home State of \nMontana, are subject to a higher stealth tax. It is truly bizarre, Mr. \nChairman, that we have designed a tax deeming more children ``excessive \ndeductions'' and duly paying your State taxes a bad thing. Already, \n5,000 Montana families pay a higher tax because of the AMT. But this \nnumber could multiply many times over if we do not act soon.\n  Not only is the AMT unfair and poorly targeted, it is an awful mess \nto figure out. The Finance Committee heard testimony today from our \nNational Taxpayer Advocate, who has singled out this item as causing \nthe most complexity for individual taxpayers, and also from a tax \npractitioner who has seen first-hand how difficult this is for her \nclients. We heard also from other witnesses who said it is time for \nrepeal of the AMT.\n  Of course, repeal does not come without cost and that cost is \nsignificant even if we assume the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are not \nextended. We are committed to working together to identify reasonable \noffsets. Certainly, I do not think we want a tax system unfairly \nplacing a higher tax burden on millions of middle-income families with \nchildren. But it does not serve those families either if our budget \ndeficit is significantly worse.\n  Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues on this AMT \nrepeal bill will put an end to the Darth Vader of the tax code, without \nany sequels.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1104. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to provide States with the option to cover certain legal immigrants \nunder the medicaid and State children's health insurance programs; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould allow States to use Federal funds to provide critical healthcare \nservices to pregnant women and children. I want to thank Senator Chafee \nfor his leadership on this important issue. I also want to recognize \nformer Senator Bob Graham and the late Senator John Chafee, who \nchampioned this legislation for many years. Their commitment laid the \ngroundwork for our bill introduction today.\n  This bill, the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, is \nfundamentally about three things--fairness, fiscal relief, and \nfinancial savings.\n  I will start with fairness. All across New York and America, legal \nimmigrants work hard, pay taxes, and exercise their civic \nresponsibilities. I see examples of this every day in New York. They \nfight for our country in the military. They contribute to our Nation's \ncompetitiveness and economic growth. They help revitalize neighborhoods \nand small towns across the country. And most are fiercely proud to call \nthemselves Americans.\n  Yet, in 1996, Congress denied safety net services to legal immigrants \nwho had been in the country for less than 5 years. Today, Senator \nChafee and I are here to introduce legislation that would take a first \nstep towards correcting that injustice. The Immigrant Children's Health \nImprovement Act will allow States to use, Federal funds to make SCHIP, \n(the State Children's Health Improvement Program, and Medicaid \navailable to pregnant women and children who are legal immigrants \nwithin the 5-year ban.\n  There is tremendous need for this legislation. An Urban Institute \nstudy found that children of immigrants are three times as likely to be \nin fair or poor health. While most children receive preventative \nmedicine, such as vaccines, too often immigrant children do not. They \nare forced to receive their healthcare via emergency rooms--the least \ncost-effective place to provide care. To make matters worse, minor \nillnesses, which would be easily treated by a pediatrician, may \nsnowball into life-threatening conditions.\n  This legislation is also a matter of good fiscal policy. Today, 19 \nStates, including New York and Rhode Island, plus the District of \nColumbia, use State funds to provide healthcare services to legal \nimmigrants within the 5-year waiting period. According to the most \nrecent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, at least 155,000 \nchildren and 60,000 adults are receiving these benefits. A total of \n387,000 recent legal immigrants would be eligible to receive these \nservices if their States opt to take advantage of the program.\n  And finally, this bill is about long-term healthcare cost savings. \nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, covering \nuninsured children and pregnant women through Medicaid can reduce \nunnecessary hospitalization by 22 percent. Pregnant women who forgo \nprenatal care are likely to develop complications during pregnancy, \nwhich results in higher costs for postpartum care. And women without \naccess to prenatal care are four times more likely to deliver low birth \nweight infants and seven times more likely to deliver prematurely than \nwomen who receive prenatal care, according to the Institute of \nMedicine. All of these health outcomes are costly to society and to the \nindividuals involved.\n  Thank you for allotting me this time to speak on such an urgent \nmatter. I look forward to working with you and the rest of my \ncolleagues to enact this bill into law in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1105. A bill to amend title VI of the Higher Education Act of 1965 \nregarding international and foreign language studies; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Cochran, Levin, \nKennedy and Akaka to introduce The International and Foreign Language \nStudies Act of 2005.\n  In recent years, foreign language needs have significantly increased \nthroughout the Federal Government due to the presence of a wider range \nof security threats, the emergence of new nation states, and the \nglobalization of the U.S. economy. Likewise, American business \nincreasingly needs internationally experienced employees to compete in \nthe global economy and to manage a culturally diverse workforce.\n  Currently, the U.S. government requires 34,000 employees with foreign \nlanguage skills across 70 Federal agencies. These agencies have stated \nover the last few years, that translator and interpreter shortfalls \nhave adversely affected agency operations and hindered U.S. military, \nlaw enforcement, intelligence, and diplomatic efforts.\n  Despite our growing needs, the number of undergraduate foreign \nlanguage degrees conferred is only one percent of all degrees. Only one \nthird of undergraduates report that they are taking foreign language \ncourses and only 11 percent report that they have studied abroad.\n  At a time when our security needs are more important than ever, at a \ntime when our economy demands that we enter new markets, and at a time \nwhen the world requires us to engage in diplomacy in more thoughtful \nand considered ways, it is extremely important that we have at our \ndisposal a multilingual, multicultural, internationally experienced \nworkforce. The Dodd-Cochran International and Foreign Language Studies \nAct attempts to do this in a number of ways.\n  The Dodd-Cochran International and Foreign Language Studies Act will \nincrease undergraduate study abroad as a means to enhance foreign \nlanguage proficiency and deepen cultural knowledge. The bill will \nreinstate undergraduate eligibility for Foreign Language and Area \nStudies Fellowships. The bill will encourage the Department of \nEducation to engage in the collection, analysis and dissemination of\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\ndata on international education and foreign language needs so that we \nknow and understand exactly what our needs in this area are. Within the \nInstitute for International and Public Policy, the bill provides \nscholarships and creates an ``expert track'' for doctoral students in \ncritical areas, disciplines and languages. And, most importantly, the \nDodd-Cochran bill will demonstrate our nation's commitment to \nincreasing the foreign language proficiency and international expertise \nof our citizens by increasing the amount appropriated to international \neducation, including international business education, to allow for \nmore opportunities for more students.\n  The Higher Education Act authorizes the Federal Government's major \nactivities as they relate to financial assistance for students \nattending colleges and universities. It provides aid to institutions of \nhigher education, services to help students complete high school and \nenter and succeed in postsecondary education, and mechanisms to improve \nthe training of our emerging workforce. This bill will help fulfill \nthat mission.\n  Foreign language skills and international study are vital to secure \nthe future economic welfare of the United States in an increasingly \ninternational economy. Foreign language skills and international study \nare also vital for the nation to meet 21st century security challenges \nproperly and effectively, especially in light of the terrorist attacks \non September 11, 2001.\n  I hope our colleagues who are not cosponsoring this bill will give it \nserious consideration. By working together, I believe that the Senate \nas a body can act to ensure that we strengthen our Nation's security \nand economy by capitalizing on the talents and dreams of those who wish \nto enter the international arena.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenators Dodd, Cochran, Levin and Akaka in introducing the \nInternational and Foreign Languages Studies Act to increase study \nabroad and increase foreign language study here at home for \nundergraduate and graduate students.\n  The study of foreign language and foreign cultures is more important \nthan ever. Yet in 2003, the number of fellowships awarded for such \nstudies was 30 percent less than the high point in 1967. Only 40 \npercent of undergraduates report taking any foreign language coursework \nand only 20 percent have studied abroad.\n  Learning another language is more than a desirable educational goal. \nIt is a national security goal as well. We need more students to pursue \nother languages, especially the lesser taught languages like Chinese, \nJapanese, Farsi, Dari Persian and Arabic, which will be critical for \ninternational business as well as for national defense.\n  In addition to supporting language studies, the bill builds bridges \nwith overseas universities to promote research and training abroad for \nAmerican students. It supports the expansion of the Centers for \nInternational Business Education, and increases the scope of the \nInstitute for International and Public Policy by creating an \naccelerated track for PhD students in key areas.\n  This bill is an important part of America's participation in \nglobalization, and I urge my colleagues to strongly support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 1106. A bill to authorize the construction of the Arkansas Valley \nConduit in the State of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is with much excitement and \nanticipation that I, along with Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave in the \nHouse of Representatives, introduce legislation known as ``The Arkansas \nValley Conduit.'' This bill will ensure the expedited construction of a \npipeline that will provide the small, financially strapped towns and \nwater agencies along the Arkansas River with safe, clean, affordable \nwater. By creating a Federal-Local cost share to help offset the costs \nof constructing the Conduit, this legislation will protect the future \nof Southeastern Colorado. First introduced during the 107th Session of \nCongress and subsequently in the 108th, we have redrafted the \nlegislation for the 109th Session to create a stronger stand-alone \nbill. Congresswoman Musgrave and I have worked hard to craft it so that \nit meets the needs of a region of Colorado that has suffered from \ndecades of inadequate drinking water supplies. On the heels of one of \nthe worst droughts in Colorado history, the Conduit will provide a \ndependable source of water to communities--water that will allow these \ncommunities to grow and prosper.\n  By way of background, the Arkansas Valley Conduit was originally \nauthorized by Congress forty years ago as a part of the Fryingpan-\nArkansas Project. Due to the authorizing statute's lack of a cost share \nprovision and Southeastern Colorado's depressed economic status, the \nConduit was never built. Until recently, the region has been fortunate \nto enjoy an economical and safe alternative to pipeline-transportation \nof Project Water: the Arkansas River. Sadly, the water quality in the \nArkansas has degraded to a point where it is no longer economical to \nuse as a means of transport. At the same time, the Federal Government \nhas continued to strengthen its unfunded water quality standards.\n  Several years ago, in an effort to resurrect the Conduit, Senator Ben \nNighthorse Campbell and I worked to secure $200,000 for a Bureau of \nReclamation Re-evaluation Statement on the project. Thanks to this \neffort, the people of the valley began to realize that the Conduit may \none day be more than just a pipedream, and that Congress was serious \nabout fulfilling the promise of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project.\n  Our legislation calls for a 80/20 Federal/Local cost share. This is a \nsizeable sum, but is a far cry from the estimated $640 million it would \ntake to build new treatment facilities for each of the communities if \nthe Conduit was not built. It requires cooperation of the Department of \nthe Interior, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and local project \nparticipants.\n  The Arkansas Valley Conduit will deliver fresh, clean water to dozens \nof valley communities and tens-of-thousands of people along the river. \nLocal community participants continue to explore options for financing \ntheir share of the costs, and are working hard to develop the \norganization that will oversee the Conduit project. I applaud those in \nthe community who have worked so hard for the past several years to \nmake the Conduit a reality. Upon its completion, it will stand as \ntestament to a pioneering vision and commitment to sensible water \npolicy.\n  With the help of my colleagues, the promise made by Congress forty \nyears ago to the people of Southeastern Colorado, will finally become a \nreality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arkansas Valley Conduit \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Public Law 87-590 (76 Stat. 389) authorized the \n     Fryingpan-Arkansas project, including construction of the \n     Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline extending from Pueblo \n     Reservoir, Pueblo, Colorado to Lamar, Colorado;\n       (2) the Arkansas Valley Conduit was never built, partly \n     because of the inability of local communities to pay 100 \n     percent of the costs of construction of the Arkansas Valley \n     Conduit;\n       (3) in furtherance of the goals and authorization of the \n     Fryingpan-Arkansas project, it is necessary to provide \n     separate authorization for the construction of the Arkansas \n     Valley Conduit;\n       (4) the construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit is \n     necessary for the continued viability of southeast Colorado; \n     and\n       (5) the Arkansas Valley Conduit would provide the \n     communities of southeast Colorado with safe, clean, and \n     affordable water.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure a safe and adequate water supply for the \n     beneficiaries identified in Public Law 87-590 (76 Stat. 389) \n     and related authorizing documents and subsequent studies; and\n       (2) to establish a cost-sharing requirement for the \n     construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit.\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reauthorize the Head Start Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Head Start \nImprovements for School Readiness Act with my colleague, Senator \nKennedy.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the Head Start program and make \nimportant improvements to the Head Start Act and help ensure that \ntoday's children receiving services by this important program will be \nbetter prepared for success in the future. Success in life depends a \ngreat deal on the preparation for that success, which comes early in \nlife. It is well documented in early childhood education research that \nstudents who are not reading well by the third grade will struggle with \nreading most of their lives. That is why the Head Start program is so \nimportant. Head Start provides early education for thousands of \nchildren each year, most of whom would not have the opportunity to \nattend preschool programs elsewhere.\n  The Head Start program is important generally, but there is some room \nfor improvement. Earlier this year the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions held a hearing on the administration of \nthe Head Start program, and found that a number of changes might help \nimprove the performance of the program overall.\n  The first change required by this program would be providing for all \nHead Start grantees found to have a deficiency to recompete the next \ntime the program's grant is up for renewal. The bill would also require \ngrantees to recompete if they have not resolved issues of noncompliance \nwithin 120 days, or a longer time specified by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services. This will create an important incentive for \nprograms to operate at their best, which is in the best interest of our \nchildren.\n  The bill would also shorten the timeline for programs to be \nterminated. In some instances, Head Start grantees have been found to \nbe operating programs that are unsafe, or improperly using Federal \nfunds. In these cases, the Administration has acted to terminate these \nprograms. Unfortunately, under the law, Head Start grantees have been \nable to appeal these rulings. This process can be lengthy, some \nexamples exceed 600 days, or almost two years, before a final ruling is \nmade. In order to address this issue, and put the health and education \nof children first, the legislation we introduce today would limit the \ntime available for Head Start grantees to appeal decisions made by the \nSecretary to terminate grants.\n  A third improvement is to clarify the role of the governing body and \npolicy councils in individual Head Start programs. After careful \nreview, the Committee found that many of the important fiscal and legal \nresponsibilities of Head Start grantees were not explicitly assigned to \neither the policy council or the governing body, or in many instances, \nwere assigned equally to both. In order to clarify the shared \ngovernance model, the bill we introduce today would clarify the \nresponsibilities of the governing body and the policy council for each \nHead Start grantee. We believe this will lead to more consistent, high \nquality fiscal and legal management, which will ensure these programs \nare serving children in the best way they can.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues on the Committee, particularly Senator \nKennedy, for their help in drafting this bipartisan legislation to \nreauthorize the Head Start Act. I believe the legislation we are \nintroducing today will improve the quality and effectiveness of the \nHead Start program for generations of children to come.\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 153\n\n       Whereas Americans have been formally recognizing the \n     sacrifice of those who gave their lives in the service of \n     their country since 1868 when General John A. Logan, \n     Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, designated May \n     30 as Decoration Day;\n       Whereas those early commemorations encouraged Americans to \n     decorate the graves of war dead with flowers so that, as \n     General Logan stated, ``We should guard their graves with \n     sacred vigilance . . . Let pleasant paths invite the coming \n     and going of reverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no \n     neglect, no ravages of time, testify to the present or to the \n     coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the \n     cost of a free and undivided republic.'';\n       Whereas in these times of challenge, when Americans have \n     once again answered the call to defend freedom, it is as \n     important as ever that all Americans take time to honor those \n     brave men and women who throughout our Nation's history have \n     given their lives in the cause of liberty;\n       Whereas in 2000, President Clinton signed into law ``The \n     National Moment of Remembrance Act'' to encourage Americans \n     to pause at 3:00 pm local time on Memorial Day for a minute \n     of silence to remember and honor those who have died in the \n     service of their Nation; and\n       Whereas the National Moment of Remembrance brings the \n     country together in unity of purpose, to honor the sacrifice \n     of those who have died for their Nation, and to rededicate \n     all Americans to the original spirit of Decoration Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its support for the National Moment of \n     Remembrance at 3:00 pm on Memorial Day, created to honor the \n     men and women of the United States who died in the pursuit of \n     freedom and peace; and\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to observe the \n     National Moment of Remembrance this Memorial Day so that the \n     sacrifices of those who have died are not forgotten and that, \n     as President Abraham Lincoln said, ``The mystic chords of \n     memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave \n     to every living heart . . . should swell into a mighty chorus \n     of remembrance, gratitude and rededication . . .''.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Resolution \nwith my good friend, Senator Jeff Sessions. Our resolution reaffirms \nthe Senate's support for a National Moment of Remembrance at 3:00 p.m. \non Memorial Day, and calls upon all Americans to observe the National \nMoment of Remembrance this Memorial Day.\n  Memorial Day is a holiday unique in the world and distinctly American \nin spirit.\n  On Memorial Day we honor no single man or woman--no general or \nadmiral--but generations of Americans who selflessly answered their \nNation's call to defend not national boundaries but a noble cause.\n  On Memorial Day we pay homage not to a single battle or war, but to \nthe enduring struggle for freedom that stretches from Bunker Hill to \nBaghdad.\n  In these challenging times, when we hear almost daily of American \nservicemen and women who have sacrificed their lives to defend this \ngreat Nation, it is especially important that all Americans take a \nmoment on Memorial Day to honor all these fallen heroes who throughout \nour history have made the ultimate sacrifice so that we may enjoy the \nfreedoms we have today.\n  Many may not be aware, but Americans began formally recognizing the \nsacrifice of those who had given their lives in the service of their \ncountry in 1868 when General John A. Logan, Commander of the Grand Army \nof the Republic, designated May 30 as Decoration Day.\n  The first large observance was held that year in Arlington National \nCemetery.\n  Those early commemorations encouraged Americans to decorate the \ngraves of war dead with flowers. The goal of this, as General Logan \neloquently put it, was that ``We should guard their graves with sacred \nvigilance. . . Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of \nreverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no neglect, no ravages of \ntime, testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have \nforgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic.''\n  Through Decoration Day, General Logan began a noble tradition that we \ncarry forward to this day.\n  We in Congress recently sought to reinforce that tradition and \nencourage all Americans to not lose sight of the meaning of Memorial \nDay, as Decoration Day has been known since 1971.\n  In 2000 we passed and the President signed the ``National Moment of \nRemembrance Act'' which encouraged all Americans to pause wherever they \nare at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day for a moment of silence to \nremember and honor those who have died in service to their country.\n  Since we passed that legislation, we have seen our Nation attacked.\n  Once again our fighting men and women have responded to the call to \ndefend their Nation. They have done so magnificently. Their courage and \nvalor are inspiring and are important reminders that we must continue \nto support those that fight, and honor those who have fallen.\n  We honor our heroes who founded and preserved our Nation and have \nsince carried the torch of freedom into corners of the world where \npeople huddled under tyranny's dark shadows.\n  We honor these heroes with the words of President Abraham Lincoln in \nour heart when he said: ``The mystic chords of memory, stretching from \nevery battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart . . should \nswell into a mighty chorus of remembrance, gratitude and \nrededication.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5805-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5805-S5807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 36--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n CONCERNING ACTIONS TO SUPPORT THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY ON \n           THE OCCASION OF THE SEVENTH NPT REVIEW CONFERENCE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Corzine, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Levin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 36\n\n       Whereas the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, \n     and entered into force March 5, 1970 (in this resolution \n     referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty''), \n     codifies one of the most important international security \n     arrangements in the history of arms control, the arrangement \n     by which states without nuclear weapons pledge not to acquire \n     them, states with nuclear weapons commit to eventually \n     eliminate them, and nonnuclear states are allowed to use for \n     peaceful purposes nuclear technology under strict and \n     verifiable control;\n       Whereas the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is one of the \n     most widely supported multilateral agreements, with 188 \n     countries adhering to the Treaty;\n       Whereas the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty has encouraged \n     many countries to officially abandon nuclear weapons or \n     nuclear weapons programs, including Argentina, Belarus, \n     Brazil, Kazakhstan, Libya, South Africa, South Korea, \n     Ukraine, and Taiwan;\n       Whereas, at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, \n     the states-parties agreed to extend the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty indefinitely, to reaffirm the principles \n     and objectives of the Treaty, to strengthen the Treaty review \n     process, and to implement further specific and practical \n     steps on non-proliferation and disarmament;\n       Whereas, at the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the states-\n     parties agreed to further practical steps on non-\n     proliferation and disarmament;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush stated on March 7, 2005, \n     that ``the NPT represents a key legal barrier to nuclear \n     weapons proliferation and makes a critical contribution to \n     international security,'' and that ``the United States is \n     firmly committed to its obligations under the NPT'';\n       Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is \n     responsible for monitoring compliance with safeguard \n     agreements pursuant to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     and reporting safeguard violations to the United Nations \n     Security Council;\n       Whereas Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin stated \n     on February 24, 2005, that ``[w]e bear a special \n     responsibility for the security of nuclear weapons and \n     fissile material in order to ensure that there is no \n     possibility such weapons or materials would fall into \n     terrorist hands'';\n       Whereas Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     calls for the fullest possible exchange of equipment and \n     materials for peaceful nuclear endeavors and allows states to \n     acquire sensitive technologies to produce nuclear fuel for \n     energy purposes but also recognizes that such fuel could be \n     used to secretly produce fissile material for nuclear weapons \n     programs or quickly produce such material if the state were \n     to decide to withdraw from the Treaty;\n       Whereas the Government of North Korea ejected international \n     inspectors from that country in 2002, announced its \n     withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, \n     has recently declared its possession of nuclear weapons, and \n     is in possession of facilities capable of producing \n     additional nuclear weapons-usable material;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has pursued an undeclared \n     program to develop a uranium enrichment capacity, repeatedly \n     failed to fully comply with and provide full information to \n     the IAEA regarding its nuclear activities, and stated that it \n     will not permanently abandon its uranium enrichment program \n     which it has temporarily suspended through an agreement with \n     the European Union;\n       Whereas the network of arms traffickers associated with \n     A.Q. Khan has facilitated black-market nuclear transfers \n     involving several countries, including Iran, Libya, and North \n     Korea, and represents a new and dangerous form of \n     proliferation;\n       Whereas governments should cooperate to control exports of \n     and interdict illegal transfers of sensitive nuclear and \n     missile-related technologies to prevent their proliferation;\n       Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General's High-Level \n     Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change concluded that \n     ``[a]lmost 60 States currently operate or are constructing \n     nuclear power or research reactors, and at least 40 possess \n     the industrial and scientific infrastructure which would \n     enable them, if they chose, to build nuclear weapons at \n     relatively short notice if the legal and normative \n     constraints of the Treaty regime no longer apply,'' and \n     warned that ``[w]e are approaching a point at which the \n     erosion of the non-proliferation regime could become \n     irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation'';\n       Whereas stronger international support and cooperation to \n     achieve universal compliance with tighter nuclear non-\n     proliferation rules and standards constitute essential \n     elements of nuclear non-proliferation efforts;\n       Whereas sustained leadership by the United States \n     Government is essential to help implement existing legal and \n     political commitments established by the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and to realize a\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\n     more robust and effective global nuclear non-proliferation \n     system; and\n       Whereas the governments of the United States and other \n     countries should pursue a comprehensive and balanced approach \n     to strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation system, \n     beginning with the Seventh NPT Review Conference of 2005: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hagel, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Durbin, Senator Corzine, and Senator \nFeingold to submit a resolution calling on the parties participating at \nthe Seventh Review Conference in New York City to reaffirm their \nsupport for and take additional measures to strengthen the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty.\n  Our resolution calls on parties to the conference to, among other \nthings: insist on strict compliance with the nonproliferation \nobligations of the Treaty and to undertake effective enforcement \nmeasures against states that are in violation of their Article I or \nArticle II obligations; agree to establish more effective controls on \nsensitive technologies that can be used to produce materials for \nnuclear weapons; support the efforts of the United States and the \nEuropean Union (EU) to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \ncapability; support the Six-Party talks that seek the verifiable \ndisarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons program; accelerate \nprograms to safeguard and eliminate nuclear-weapons usable material to \nthe highest standards to prevent access by terrorists or other states; \nagree that no state may withdraw from the Treaty and escape \nresponsibility for prior violations of the treaty or retain access to \ncontrolled materials and equipment acquired for ``peaceful'' purposes, \nand; accelerate implementation of the NPT-related disarmament \nobligations and commitments that would, in particular, reduce the \nworld's stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-grade material.\n  More than 180 states have gathered in New York to review progress on \nimplementing their respective obligations as signatories of the Treaty \nand discuss additional steps each party can take to fulfill all of the \nNPT objectives.\n  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has played a critical role in \nprotecting U.S. national security interests and promoting peace and \nstability in the international community by bringing nuclear armed and \nnon-nuclear armed states together to stop the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons.\n  Each party has clear and specific obligations. States with nuclear \nweapons pledge to eventually eliminate them while states without \nnuclear weapons pledge not to acquire them.\n  The track record of the Treaty speaks for itself. This framework has \nsuccessfully convinced countries such as Ukraine, Kazahkstan, Belarus, \nLibya and South Africa to forgo possession of nuclear weapons. At the \ndawn of the nuclear age, who would have thought this would be possible?\n  Simply put, the fewer number of states with nuclear weapons, the less \nlikely such weapons will be used or fall into the wrong hands. The \nTreaty has saved lives and prevented unthinkable catastrophe.\n  The success of the Treaty is a testament to United States leadership \nand our commitment to multilateral diplomacy and cooperation. The gains \nin the area of nuclear nonproliferation over the past thirty plus years \nwould not have been possible if we had chosen to shut ourselves out of \nthe international community or take on the great challenges of the \nworld on our own.\n\n  And, I might point out, as a signatory to the Treaty, we have \nincreased the security of Americans and our national security interests \nat a far less cost than any military intervention. Successful arms \ncontrol treaties give us more bang for our buck.\n  Now is a critical opportunity to examine the successes of the past \nand the steps all parties can take to strengthen the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty in the future.\n  Indeed, the world has changed dramatically since the last Review \nConference in 1995 and the challenges to the nuclear nonproliferation \nregime have become more acute. In the past few years we have witnessed: \nthe September 11th attacks and the intent of terrorist groups such as \nal-Qaeda to acquire and use nuclear weapons; the discovery of the AQ \nKhan nuclear black market; North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty and announcement that it possessed nuclear \nweapons; the exposure of Iran's violations of its obligations as a \nsignatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the possibility \nthat states may use the ``Article 4 loophole'' and develop a nuclear \nfuel cycle capability; the existence of global stockpiles of nuclear \nweapons usable materials.\n  Combined with an uncertainty on the part of non-nuclear weapon states \nabout the intent of nuclear weapon states to fulfill their disarmament \nobligations, these challenges threaten the continuation of a successful \nnuclear nonproliferation regime.\n  As the United Nation's report ``A More Secure World'' states: ``We \nare approaching a point at which the erosion of the nonproliferation \nregime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of \nproliferation.''\n  North Korea has already withdrawn from the Treaty and escaped \npenalty. Iran may be next. How many others will follow if we stand \nstill and do nothing to strengthen the NPT?\n  It would be an understatement to say that the collapse of the nuclear \nnonproliferation regime will have a devastating effect on the security \nand stability of the entire world.\n  That is why the Review Conference is so important and why we must not \nlet divisions between nuclear armed and non-nuclear armed states \nprevent the conclusion of a successful conference. We must come \ntogether to breathe new life into the nuclear nonproliferation regime \nand seriously consider the steps\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\noutlined above that will strengthen the treaty and make the world safer \nfrom the threat of nuclear terror.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5807-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 37--HONORING THE LIFE OF SISTER DOROTHY \n                                 STANG\n\n  Mr. DeWine submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S.

They have the sacrosanct right \n     to aspire to a better life on land where they can live and \n     work with dignity while respecting the environment.'';\n       Whereas Sister Dorothy was born in Dayton, Ohio, entered \n     the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur community in 1948, and \n     professed final vows in 1956;\n       Whereas, from 1951 to 1966, Sister Dorothy taught \n     elementary classes at St. Victor School in Calumet City, \n     Illinois, St. Alexander School in Villa Park, Illinois, and \n     Most Holy Trinity School in Phoenix, Arizona, and began her \n     ministry in Brazil in 1966, in Coroata, in the state of \n     Maranhao;\n       Whereas, last June, Sister Dorothy was named ``Woman of the \n     Year'' by the state of Para for her work in the Amazon \n     region, in December 2004, she received the ``Humanitarian of \n     the Year'' award from the Brazilian Bar Association for her \n     work helping the local rural workers, and earlier this year, \n     she received an ``Honorary Citizenship of the State'' award \n     from the state of Para; and\n       Whereas Sister Dorothy lived her life according to the \n     mission of the Sisters of Notre Dame: making known God's \n     goodness and love of the poor through a Gospel way of life, \n     community, and prayer, while continuing a strong educational \n     tradition and taking a stand with the poor, especially poor \n     women and children, in the most abandoned places, and \n     committing her one and only life to work with others to \n     create justice and peace for all: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress hereby honors the life and \n     work of Sister Dorothy Stang.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5807-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 763.

I was glad \nto see when we got to the last part of the iteration we had the Senator \nfrom Vermont included.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator has always been \nprotective of the rights of Members of both sides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5807-8", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5807-S5813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have other Senators who wish to speak.\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\nThere has been a lot that has gone on here tonight. I will speak \nfurther on this tomorrow. I thought on this occasion it would not be \ninappropriate to quote again from ``Profiles in Courage.''\n  At the end of that book, President Kennedy included a eulogy. \nInterestingly enough, it was a eulogy in 1866 upon the death of Senator \nSolomon Foot, a predecessor of mine from Vermont. The eulogy for \nSenator Foot of Vermont was delivered by Senator William Pitt Fessenden \nof Maine. Senator Fessenden, like Senator Foot, was a Republican--in \nfact, all Senators from Vermont, every single Senator from Vermont, \nwith the exception of one, has been a Republican. But Senator Fessenden \nwould soon thereafter vote against his party to acquit President Andrew \nJohnson of charges of impeachment.\n  Senator Fessenden was the first of seven courageous Republican \nSenators who voted his conscience before his country rather than party. \nDespite the pressures and whatever the consequences, he exercised his \njudgment as a Senator, consistent with his oath to do impartial \njustice.\n  Let me just read what he said after the death of Senator Foot of \nVermont:\n\n       When, Mr. President, a man becomes a member of this body, \n     he cannot even dream of the ordeal to which he cannot fail to \n     be exposed;\n       of how much courage he must possess to resist the \n     temptations which daily beset him;\n       of that sensitive shrinking from undeserved censure which \n     he must learn to control;\n       of the ever-recurring contest between a natural desire for \n     public appropriation and a sense of public duty;\n       of the load of injustice he must be content to bear, even \n     from those who should be his friends;\n       the imputations of his motives;\n       the sneers and sarcasms of inmorance malice;\n\n     all the manifold injuries which partisan or private \n     malignity, disappointed of its objects, may shower upon his \n     unprotected head.\n       All this, Mr. President, if he retained his integrity, he \n     must learn to bear unmoved, and walk steadily onward in the \n     path of duty, sustained only by the reflection that time may \n     do him justice, or if not, that after all his individual \n     hopes and aspirations, and even his name among men, should be \n     of little account to him when weighed in the balance against \n     the welfare of a people of whose destiny he is a constituted \n     guardian and defender.\n  A number of our Senate colleagues today from both parties stood up to \nkeep the Senate from making a terrible, an irreparable mistake--\nterrible and irreparable because, for the first time in over 200 years, \nthe Senate would no longer have a check and balance. For the first time \nin over 200 years, the Senate would no longer be able to protect the \nrights of the minorities.\n  I applaud them for this. As I said, I will speak more tomorrow. I \nthank my distinguished colleague and dear friend from Iowa for letting \nme go ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to hear about the \nbipartisan agreement that preserves minority rights in the Senate, that \npreserves the right of the minority to extended debate, that preserves \nthe checks and balances that our Founding Fathers prized so highly.\n  My hope now is that after weeks of distraction, after weeks during \nwhich the majority leader threatened the nuclear option, to sort of \nblow up the Senate, now we hopefully can return to the people's \nbusiness.\n  I thank the 14 Senators, I guess 7 Democrats and 7 Republicans, who \nworked so hard to bring us back from the brink and get us away from \nthis nuclear option that really would have destroyed the smooth \nfunctioning of the Senate.\n  But we have been talking for weeks and weeks about this, about this \nnuclear option. People I have talked to have been absolutely astonished \nthat the Senate has been distracted by these nuclear option threats. \nThey keep asking me why haven't we been addressing the real concerns \nthat keep Americans up at night: worrying about their jobs, their \nhealth care and their families' future. Why is the Senate spending its \ntime on this narrow ideological agenda and ignoring the people's \nbusiness?\n  The majority leader, the Senator from Tennessee, had planned to keep \nthe Senate up through the night tonight as a prelude to detonating this \nnuclear option.\n  In anticipation of that, early yesterday, on my Senate Web site and \nthrough the news outlets, I informed the people of my State of Iowa I \nwould be coming to the floor late this evening to share their concerns \nand their worries, the things that keep them up at night.\n  The response has been overwhelming. I said that my Des Moines office \nand my Washington offices would be open all night, answering calls and \nreceiving e-mails. I encouraged Iowans to keep the calls and e-mails \ncoming all through the night and to let me know what keeps them up at \nnight. I had planned to spend as much time as possible answering the \nphones myself.\n  Since noon today, we have received over 600 e-mails and 500 phone \ncalls. I thank all the Iowans who contacted me by e-mail or by phone. I \nhad planned to read as many as I could tonight, during the long night \nthat we were supposed to be here. Obviously, that is not going to \nhappen. But we have been inundated with messages from Iowans telling us \nwhat they want the Senate to stay up all night working on. Believe me, \ndetonating the nuclear option is not on their list.\n  To the contrary, my fellow Iowans are deeply concerned about \n``kitchen table'' issues such as health care, job security, pension \nsecurity, education, increasing the minimum wage, the war in Iraq, the \nprice of gasoline.\n  Sherry, in Sioux City e-mailed me to make two points.\n  One, I do not like the GOP violating the rules and violating the \nFounding Fathers' checks and balances; and, two, I am retiring from \nteaching tomorrow and I am afraid most of my students will not be in \ngood enough jobs to afford their own health care. Plus I myself must \nwait 24 months for health coverage because I don't qualify for \nMedicare.\n\n  Linda in Des Moines sent the following e-mail:\n\n       Mr. Harkin, thank you for asking. I will tell you what \n     keeps me up at night. The fear I will get sick and not be \n     able to work. I have to work some overtime every week right \n     now to just get by. I have not been able to accumulate a \n     savings to fall back on. What with more health care costs my \n     employer is putting on me, higher gas prices, higher grocery \n     costs. I have to run as fast as I can to just barely keep up.\n\n  Patricia in West Branch, IA, sent this e-mail:\n\n       I work two jobs, my husband 3, to send our son to college. \n     We all need some relief from this worry. Education, health \n     care, the poor who do not have homes or food. So let's worry \n     about the real issues here.\n\n  Patty in Olin, IA, e-mailed me with what keeps her up at night:\n\n       Two Things: Gas and College 1.\n\n  Shirley in Eldridge, IA, e-mailed me with the following brief \nmessage:\n\n       I am bothered about rising health costs for retirees. I am \n     concerned about the rising cost of gasoline and the rising \n     cost of a college education. I am concerned that my \n     grandchildren may not have the same opportunities that I and \n     my children had to obtain an advanced degree.\n\n  This is the message that Al in Hinton, IA, sent me:\n\n       Health Insurance--I am seeing many educators who want to \n     retire, some who need to retire, however they cannot, due to \n     the cost of health care. They have worked 30 years and must \n     keep working until age 65. After 30 years in the classroom, \n     an individual has earned the right to retire. Please address \n     health care, this is the National Crisis.\n\n  Sara in Anamosa, IA, shared a broad range of worries:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am a teacher who is concerned that \n     American High Schools are not given the funds needed to train \n     our students to compete in a global economy.\n\n  Sue, a librarian in Iowa City, told me:\n\n       I am concerned about the rising cost of a college \n     education. . . .I worry that the divide between those who can \n     afford college and those who cannot is growing ever wider. I \n     don't think our economy will be well-served by making an \n     education an opportunity that only the wealthy can afford.\n\n  Susan from Des Moines send me the following e-mail:\n\n       The fear that the Social Security system is going to be \n     changed keeps me up at night. . . . My worry is not just for \n     myself but everyone affected by the proposed revisions in the \n     social security system.\n\n  Barbara from Mount Vernon, IA, had this to say:\n\n       What keeps me up at night is how I'm going to pay my bills \n     and still provide care\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\n     for the kids. I serve at my job at Four Oaks, Inc. I'm a \n     youth counselor at 4 Oaks serving children in a residential \n     setting who have been abused or neglected. Some of the needs \n     these children are the need for deep relationships with \n     adults. With the high turnover in facilities such as mine, \n     children go through hardship once again. Staff needs to move \n     on to other fields where the pay will meet their day to day \n     obligations. As a supervisor I do stay up at night worrying \n     about the children and my own financial needs.\n\n  Shannon from Garwin, Iowa, sent me this message:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin. I can easily tell you what keeps me up \n     at night. Thank you for asking. I am a 30 year old Registered \n     Nurse. . . . I have a very expensive health insurance plan \n     that goes up every year. It does not cover my family, me \n     only. My husband works as an electrician and has no \n     insurance. Our children have health insurance that we pay for \n     out of pocket. We have no dental. We worry constantly. Save \n     for college? That is a joke in its self.\n\n  Ron, in La Mars, IA, said:\n\n       We need an aggressive program for alternative fuels. If we \n     do not break away from foreign oil we will be bogged down in \n     the Middle East forever.\n\n  Ann, an elementary school principal in Waukon, IA, had this to say:\n\n       There are many things that keep me up at night. Among these \n     concerns are the rising meth problem in Iowa. The reduction \n     of services to families through medicaid cuts and cuts in \n     the department of human services. I have families who fear \n     their foodstamps will be cut.\n\n  Here is Fabian from Bellevue, IA:\n\n       Collapse of the general economy in industrial and \n     manufacturing sectors.\n\n  Patrick from Sioux City, IA:\n\n       We need to reform the health care and transportation \n     systems in America.\n\n  Kim of Cresco, IA:\n\n       We need to be more focused on education in America than the \n     filibuster.\n\n  Here is Sandra, who e-mailed me:\n\n       Dear Senator Harkin, these are the things that keep me up \n     at night:\n       1. Social security--I think we just need to improve on the \n     program that exists. I know that my husband and I and our \n     children will not have the needed money to start our own \n     savings account. Our children have good jobs, but there is no \n     way they will be able to set-aside enough needed money to \n     retire on.\n       2. As a health professional, I can tell you first-hand what \n     is happening to people who cannot afford to pay health \n     insurance and also, prescription drugs needed. I treat the \n     results of that each day. Each month, we personally pay, out \n     of our own pocket, nearly $2000.00 for insurance and drugs. \n     Our drugs are for diabetes and prostate problems, something \n     we cannot help. That is $24,0000 a year, and farming is not \n     that profitable. Something has got to change or we will not \n     survive!\n\n  This is a comment from George:\n\n       I am 62 years old. I had surgery for prostate cancer 4 \n     years ago. Post op I can not afford $1000 month for health \n     insurance and have not seen a doctor in 3 years for follow up \n     procedures. I am sinking into depression (and debt) and see \n     no way out . . . .\n\n  Doris, from Wellman said:\n\n       We need to raise the minimum wage.\n\n  Here is Ann, another person who e-mailed me:\n\n       I have families without jobs or such low-paying jobs they \n     work several to make ends meet. Children are left \n     unsupervised. How about increasing the minimum wage?\n\n  Mr. President, this is what Iowans are telling me, in 600 plus e-\nmails, and over 500 phone calls today. This is what they want the \nSenate working on. And we spent all this time talking about a \nfilibuster, a nuclear option: This judge, that judge. People must \nwonder if we have become totally dysfunctional around here, so I am \nhopeful that, with this agreement, we are going to see a new day. I am \nhopeful that the majority leader will now turn his leadership and his \nenergy to turn the Senate to the people's business.\n  Let's have a bill out here to raise the minimum wage and let's get an \nup-or-down vote on it. Let's get the Energy bill here on the floor so \nwe can amend it and then have an up-or-down vote. Let's do something \nabout health care. Why don't we extend the Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Program that all of us have--why don't we extend it to small \nbusinesses all over America so they, too, can have the same kind of \nhealth coverage that we in the Congress have?\n  How about pension security? Let's get legislation on the floor so we \ndo not have more United Airlines, next maybe all the other airlines, \nperhaps even General Motors has now said they may not be able to meet \ntheir pension guarantees.\n  Education funding? How many times do we hear from our schools that we \nare not funding No Child Left Behind, that the guarantee we made almost \n30 years ago now that we were going to fund the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act at 40 percent of the cost, now we are still \nat less than 20 percent?\n  This is what the vast majority of my Iowans say we should be working \non. So I hope a new day is here. I hope, with this agreement that was \nforged, we can leave that past behind us and that we can now bring this \ntype of legislation to the floor. Forget about the nuclear option and \nget on with the people's business here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand that I have 15 minutes. I \nmight take 10 or I might want to take another 10 in addition. I ask \nunanimous consent I may speak up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I want to say, before my friend from Iowa leaves, \nthank you so much, Senator Harkin. I think what you addressed in your \nremarks is something that has been missing from this debate, and that \nis what the people are telling us back home. They, in my opinion, do \nnot want to see the filibuster go away because they understand it is a \nvery important part of the American fabric of politics for more than \n200 years. They also understand, without a doubt, that the issues that \nconcern their everyday lives are just not being addressed. My friend \nlaid them out beautifully.\n\n  In Iowa, CA, our people are feeling the same things. They are \nstruggling with high gas prices, lack of health care, worried about the \ncost of health care, and education. They are absolutely frightened \nabout the President's attack on Social Security. They want us to fight \nback. They want us to solve the Social Security long-range problem \nwithout reducing benefits, without taking away Social Security, and not \nturning Social Security into a guaranteed gamble. These are issues that \nare key. Transportation is another issue my friend mentioned. I thank \nSenator Harkin for his contribution tonight.\n  I also thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who took this \nSenate back from a cliff where there were very treacherous waters \nbelow. They turned us away from a power grab by the majority, from a \nmove that was clearly an abuse of power. They called it themselves, \nthose who wanted this option, the nuclear option. They were right to \ncall it the nuclear option because it would have been so devastating, \nnot only to the Senate, not only to the people of this country, but to \nthe foundation of our Republic--the checks and balances which were put \ninto this system by our brilliant Founders who came together. As \nSenator Byrd reminded us tonight that Benjamin Franklin said: ``I've \ngiven you a Republic, if you can keep it.''\n  That is the key. Can we keep the Republic? We do not keep a \nrepresentative democracy such as this if we allow one side, whichever \nside that is, to trample upon the rights of the other. What happens is \nyou wind up trampling on the rights of the American people themselves.\n  The other day I was making a mental note of who supported the nuclear \noption, taking away the right of any Senator to filibuster a judicial \nnominee, who in this body supported that, versus those who thought it \nought to be sustained and we ought to have that right. When we add up \nthe number of people we represent on each side, the senators on the \nside that wanted to keep the filibuster represented far more people, \nmillions more people. So this was a moment in time when the rights of \nso many of those people would have been taken away, just as the rights \nof their Senators would be taken away.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides who worked so hard to \nbring us back from this abuse of power. I hope that it means forever. I \npersonally hope we never hear the words ``nuclear option'' again. It \nwould be best for this country if we allowed the 200-year history plus \nof this country to sustain us.\n  The filibuster started in 1806. This is the filibuster's 200th year. \nIt has been used sparingly. Let's look at how many times we have \nblocked President Bush's judges. I hope I don't have to bring this \nchart out again. I hope we\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\nare done with this. But for tonight we need to summarize where we have \nbeen.\n  Mr. President, 208 to 10 is what caused all the angst by the \nRepublicans. They wanted to take away our right to block 5 percent of \nGeorge Bush's judges. As I have said at home in many meetings, if any \none of you got 95 percent of what you wanted in your life, you would be \nsmiling. I would be--unless I wanted everything and I thought I knew \nbest and I was the smartest. We all go through those times when we \nthink that way but one would hope at this point when we get here, after \nworking a little bit here in the Senate--and I admit I didn't see it \nright in the beginning--we come to respect rights of the minority. The \nfilibuster has been used rarely.\n  I also want to discuss what I call the filibuster fantasy world that \ncropped up in these debates. I will show a chart I was going to use in \nthe debate which, thankfully, we do not have to have. But for the \npurposes of history, we ought to look at what was shaping up.\n  First of all, every day we came to the Senate we heard Republicans \nsay: The Democrats started the filibusters on judges. That is funny, in \na way, because the opposite is true. In modern times, the use of the \nfilibuster began with Abe Fortas in the 1960s. I looked at a headline \nin the Washington Post from the 1960s. It said: ``Filibuster Launched \nAgainst Fortas.'' This was President Johnson's, a Democrat, nominee to \nthe Supreme Court. The first paragraph of that Post article said:\n\n       The Republicans launched an all-out filibuster against Abe \n     Fortas.\n\n  That is a fact. The filibuster fantasy says that Democrats started \nthe filibusters on judges.\n  The second fantasy we have heard repeatedly recently from Republicans \nis Republicans have never filibustered judges.\n  That one I can state from personal experience does not hold up--I \ndon't have to rely on newspapers; I don't have to rely on hearsay; I \ndon't have to rely on folk tales. I was here and I saw the Republican \nfilibuster against two terrific people from California, Marsha Berzon \nand Richard Paez. Guess what? That was not in the 1800s or the 1960s. \nIt was the year 2000. And do Members know who voted to continue to \nfilibuster Richard Paez? Bill Frist, the good doctor, who says he wants \nto take away our rights. Tonight he says he is backing off. He has no \nchoice but to back off because, luckily, we had enough people from both \nsides of the aisle to pull us back from this precipice. Bill Frist \nhimself filibustered Richard Paez. Pretty amazing for him to say that \nwe should never filibuster when he filibustered, when his Republican \ncolleagues are on the record saying they were proud to filibuster and \nit is their constitutional right to filibuster.\n  So you can't rewrite the record book. We have a Congressional Record. \nWe had a vote to end the filibuster on Richard Paez, a wonderful \ncandidate put up by President Clinton. Bill Frist voted to filibuster \nthat man. Yet he says if we Democrats vote to filibuster somebody, and \nI am quoting him, ``we are behaving badly.'' He said that four times \ntonight. Bad behavior.\n\n  This is not a kindergarten class. This is not even high school. This \nis the Senate. When I decide to filibuster a judge, which is my \nprerogative, and will remain so, I am happy to say under this good \nagreement, I am not behaving badly, I am behaving as a Senator who has \nlooked at this nominee, who has seen that this nominee is dangerous to \nAmerica, who has seen that this nominee is extremist and will hurt the \nAmerican families who I represent. Am I not behaving as a Senator? No, \nI am not behaving badly.\n  Let's look at the other Republican filibuster fantasies. They say all \njudges should get an up-or-down vote. Do you know how many votes \nPriscilla Owen had so far? Four. She is about to have the fifth. Janice \nRogers Brown has had one. Clinton judges, 61 of them, most of them \nnever made it out of committee. Most of them were pocket filibustered. \nThey never had an up-or-down vote. Every one of George Bush's nominees \nhave had an up-or-down vote. They may not have made the 60 votes they \nneeded to make because for 200 years-plus the Senate has had the right \nfor extended debate. These people could not get the 60 votes.\n  Why couldn't they get 60 votes? Because these nominees are so \nextreme. I will talk about one of them in a minute and tell Members why \nbecause it is an extraordinary circumstance. The President sent down a \nnominee who is out of the mainstream.\n  First, I want to tell you a story about Orrin Hatch who was the \nRepublican chairman of the Judiciary Committee for a time when Bill \nClinton was President. Orrin Hatch called me into his office and he \nsaid: Senator Boxer, if you want to get a vote on a judge from \nCalifornia, don't send me anyone from the liberal side. Send me \nmainstream judges, Senator. Send me mainstream judges and we will be \nOK. We had a great chat.\n  I said: Well, I am not so sure; maybe sometimes you want to have \nsomeone a little more liberal.\n  He said: Don't discuss it with me. Mainstream judges. That's it.\n  So for Orrin Hatch, when Bill Clinton was President, he had a litmus \ntest. Mainstream judges. I didn't think it was that unreasonable. Where \nis the litmus test now on mainstream judges? It has gone out the \nwindows.\n  Alberto Gonzales himself said that Priscilla Owen's opinions were \n``unconscionable judicial activism''. So we say to the President of the \nUnited States of America: Do what Bill Clinton did, send us mainstream \njudges and we do not have any problem with that. We will walk down this \naisle proudly. Frankly, we did it 208 times. I am not sure this \nPresident has any cause for alarm. He got 95 percent of his judges, but \nhe wants it all, after all, he is George Bush. We had a King George. We \nhad a king. Now we want a President of all the people. We do not want a \nking. We want him to govern. We do not want him to rule. There is a \ndifference.\n  This wonderful agreement sustains our right in the future to step out \nif each of us determines there is a reason to filibuster.\n  Now, again, the filibuster fantasy is that Priscilla Owen and Janice \nRogers Brown have never had a vote in the Senate. I have already \nstated, they just cannot make the 60-vote cut because they are so out \nof the mainstream.\n  Then there is this issue the Republicans have now said they want to \nchange from the nuclear option to the constitutional option. Nothing in \nthe Constitution prohibits filibusters. We know that. The Constitution \nsays the Senate shall writes its own rules, which brings me to another \npoint.\n  Here is something I want the American people to know. I want my \ncolleagues to understand. The Constitution says the Senate shall write \nits own rules, and Rule XXII of the Senate says if you want to change a \nrule of the Senate, folks, you have to get 67 votes to move to change \nthe rules. It is important to do this when you change the rules of the \nSenate. The Constitution says we shall write our own rules. But the \nSenate rules do not envision a small group of Senators changing the \nrules. It ensures that a large group of Senators must approve of \nchanging the Senate rules. If you have to change the rules, this is \nwhat you have to have 67 votes to close off debate for a rule change.\n  Guess what? My Republican friends who brought us the nuclear option \nknew they could not get 67 votes to destroy the system of checks and \nbalances, to change our government as we have known it for so many \nyears. They could not get 67 votes, not even close. They even had to \nhave Dick Cheney in the chair for this vote, folks, because it could be \nthat close; 51, maybe. What do they do? How are they going to get \naround the rules of the Senate? Well, not to worry about the rules of \nthe Senate. We will make a precedent.\n  The Parliamentarian will say that Senators have a right to \nfilibuster, absolutely. The Parliamentarian will say we need 67 votes \nto change the rules of the Senate, but Dick Cheney, sitting in the \nchair as a rubberstamp for this administration, as part of it, will \nsay: I disagree with the Parliamentarian. We can change this right now \nby declaring by fiat no more filibusters of judges ever again. That is \nthe new precedent.\n\n  I would ask my friends, what kind of an example is this to set for \nour children? Let's say our children go to school, and they know to get \nan 80 percent on a test is a B, and they get a 75 percent. Let's say \nthey then go to their teacher and say: Oh, I got a 75 percent,\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\nand I don't want to come home with a C. Can you just change the rules \ntoday for me and make it an A? Change the rules. Or if you are serving \non a jury, and everyone has to agree on the guilt of someone, but, oh, \nthey decide on this day, only 9 of the 12 have to agree.\n  I could go on and on with examples like this. The fact is, it is a \nterrible precedent for our children to see grown people in the Senate \nchange more than 200 years of Senate history by going around the rules \nof the Senate.\n  I was here when I was just a freshman. I was annoyed with the \nfilibuster. I was really annoyed. The Republicans were filibustering \nall the time. I thought it was terrible. One of my colleagues said: \nLet's change the rules.\n  I said: Great. I think President Clinton ought to get his whole \nagenda through. I am tired of hearing about what I don't agree with.\n  I was wrong. I did not know I was wrong. I was wrong. But one thing I \ndid, I did not try to do it with some slipshod, fake precedent change. \nI tried to do it by getting 67 votes. We did not even come near 20 \nbecause it is a losing proposition.\n  The nuclear option would have been a disaster. And I have to tell \nyou, out in the countryside, the polling is showing that the people are \nsick of this place. They do not understand what we are doing. We are \nirrelevant to them. And indeed it is no wonder we are viewed this way \ngiven all the effort we have expended on this nuclear option business. \nIt simply fits into what the people have been saying for a while, that \nwe just do not get it.\n  They are paying these gas prices at the pump, and what are we doing? \nNothing. The President could release some strategic petroleum reserves. \nOh, no, the first President in modern times never to do that. And, yes, \ngas is going down a few pennies, I am happy about that. But, believe \nyou me, it is not going down far enough. What are we doing about that? \nNothing that I could see. No, no, we are wasting our time on the \nnuclear option because the President wanted 100 percent of what he \nasked for. He did not want 95 percent. He wanted 100 percent of his \njudges.\n  Another President once tried to pack the courts, and his name was \nFranklin Roosevelt, a great Democratic President. Do you know what? \nWhen Franklin Roosevelt was in office, there were 74 Democrats in the \nSenate. Franklin Roosevelt was annoyed. He wanted 100 percent. He got \n60 percent in the election, a lot more than this President did. He had \n74 Democratic Senators. And he wanted to pack the courts. He wanted to \ndouble the number of Supreme Court Justices, put his people in play, \nhave the Democrats in the Senate rubberstamp and make sure that his New \nDeal would live forever more.\n  Do you know what stopped him? Democratic Senators. They said: Mr. \nPresident, we admire you. We respect you. But we know it is wrong to \npack the courts. It is not right. We want an independent judiciary. Let \nus not change the rules in the middle of the game.\n  I was so hopeful that we would have some Republican Senators this \ntime who had a sense of history, who understood better than I did when \nI was new here that the filibuster protects not only the minority but \nprotects the American people.\n  I want to explain to you, in my final moments, why it is so important \nthat we keep the filibuster. In this deal, three judges are going to go \nthrough, are going to have a simple majority vote. One of them is \nJanice Rogers Brown. Now, I am not thrilled about this because I think \nher record is so far out of the mainstream that she will hurt the \nAmerican people. But I do not want to just put out rhetoric. I want to \nshow you Janice Rogers Brown and some of the times in which Janice \nRogers Brown, as a judge on the California Supreme Court, stood alone \nin her dissents. So when you ask me: Senator Boxer, why is it that you \nfilibustered Janice Rogers Brown--and, by the way, I support this deal. \nEven though she will only need 51 votes, I still support the deal. But \nI have to tell you, I am going to fight to deprive her of those 51 \nvotes, if I can. She stood alone on a court of six Republicans and one \nDemocrat. She is a Republican. She stood alone 31 times because the \ncourt was not rightwing enough for her.\n  Let's look at some of the times Janice Rogers Brown stood alone, how \nway out of the mainstream to the extreme she is.\n  She said a manager could use racial slurs against his Latino \nemployees. Can you imagine a decision like that? It is OK to use racial \nslurs against Latino employees. Janice Rogers Brown said that in \nAguilar v. Avis Rental Car.\n  She is bad on first amendment rights. She argued that a message sent \nby an employee to coworkers criticizing a company's employment \npractices was not protected by the free speech first amendment, but she \nhas been very protective of corporate speech. So she walks away from \nthe individual but supports the right of corporate speech.\n  If you want individual rights protected, this is not your person. \nHere is one: She protects companies, not shareholders.\n  She is bad for rape victims. She was the only member of the court to \nvote to overturn the conviction of the rapist of a 17-year-old girl \nbecause she believed the victim gave mixed messages to the rapist.\n  Now, I just want to say something here. Every one of us here would \ncome to the defense of a 17-year-old rape victim. And on a court of six \nRepublicans and one Democrat, only one person stood alone, stood by the \nrapist, Janice Rogers Brown. So when I say I do not want her to be \npromoted, you can see why.\n  Janice Rogers Brown is bad for children and families. She was the \nonly member of the court to oppose an effort to stop the sale of \ncigarettes to children. Now, I do not know how you all feel about this, \nbut this is 2005, and we know what an addiction to cigarettes can be. \nWe do not want our kids being able to purchase cigarettes in stores. \nJanice Rogers Brown stood alone in Stop Youth Addiction v. Lucky \nStores. She stood alone on a court of six Republicans, one Democrat. \nShe stood alone and would not protect our children from the sale of \ntobacco.\n\n  Senior citizens: the only member of the court to find that a 60-year-\nold woman who was fired from her hospital job could not sue. This is \nwhat she said in this dissent, where she stood alone on a court of six \nRepublicans and one Democrat. She said:\n\n       Discrimination based on age does not mark its victims with \n     a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship.\n\n  Really? Really? A 60-year-old woman was fired from her hospital job \non age discrimination. State and Federal law prohibit age \ndiscrimination. Janice Rogers Brown stood alone and said there is no \nstigma. Someone fires you because you are old, and there is no stigma.\n  But that is the least of it. Janice Rogers Brown----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to \nclose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, I say to my friend from Alabama.\n  Janice Rogers Brown has an attitude toward seniors which is \nextraordinary. She calls senior citizens cannibals. She says they are \nmilitant and they cannibalize their grandchildren by getting free stuff \nfrom the Government. I have to tell you, this woman is so far out of \nthe mainstream, this is just a touch of the debate that is to hit the \nSenate floor.\n  So when we stand up as Democrats and say no to Janice Rogers Brown, \nwe have a reason. It is not about the Senate. It is not about \npartisanship. It is about the American people and the American family.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank those Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle for bringing us back from this precipice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator, before she \nleaves--I notice the debates over filibusters have seen people maybe \nflip and change their views--but I would ask her if it is not true that \nshe just said a few moments ago that we must\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\nkeep the filibuster, but in 1995 the Senator was one of 19 Senators who \nvoted to eliminate it entirely, not even just against judges but \nagainst the whole legislative calendar also?\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator heard me speak, I spoke quite a while \nabout that. I said how wrong I was, how green I was, how I was \nfrustrated with the Republicans blocking things. And I was dead wrong. \nI also said that what we tried to do is change the rules, which takes \n67 votes. We did not go in the dead of night to try and get it done. \nSo, yes, the Senator is right. I was dead wrong. Tough to admit that, \nbut I have been very open about that since the beginning of the debate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is good. And I apologize for not being here and \nhearing your remarks to begin with. I would not have asked that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't blame the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share a few thoughts at this \ntime. There is no doubt that there has not been maintained in this body \na successful filibuster against a President's nominee for a judicial \noffice until this last Congress when the Democrats changed the ground \nrules, as they stated they were going to do, and commenced systematic \nleadership-led filibusters against some of the finest nominees we have \never had.\n  People say: Well, you people in the Senate are upset, and you are \nfractious, and there is too much of this, and you guys need to get \ntogether. But it was not the Republicans who started filibustering \njudges. And it was a historic change in our procedures when the \nDemocrats started doing it. It caused great pain and anguish.\n  When you have somebody as fine as Judge Bill Pryor, who I know, from \nAlabama, the editor and chief of the Tulane Law Review, a man of \nincredible principle and intelligence and ability, and who always wants \nto do the right thing, to hear him trashed and demeaned really hurt me.\n  I am so pleased to hear today that those who have reached the \ncompromise have said that we will give Bill Pryor an up-or-down vote. \nHe had a majority of the Senate for him before, a bipartisan majority. \nAt least two Democrats voted for giving him an up-or-down vote and \nwould have voted for him, I am sure, if he had gotten that up-or-down \nvote. We would have had that done a long time ago except for having, \nfor the first time in history, a systematic tactic of blocking those \nnominees from an up-or-down vote through the use of the filibuster on \njudges.\n  Priscilla Owen made the highest possible score on the Texas bar exam, \ngot an 84-percent vote in Texas, was endorsed by every newspaper in \nTexas--a brilliant, successful private practitioner--and they have held \nher up for over 4 years. The only thing I can see that would justify \nholding her up was that she is so capable, so talented, that she would \nhave been on a short list for the Supreme Court. She should not have \nbeen blocked and denied the right to have an up-or-down vote.\n  Justice Janice Rogers Brown from California was on the ballot a few \nyears ago with four other judges in California. She got the highest \nvote in the California ballot, 74 percent of the vote on the California \nballot. California is not a rightwing State. She got three-fourths of \nthe vote. And they say she is an extremist? Not fair. It is just not \nfair to say that about these nominees.\n  It was said by the Senator from California that they did not get 60 \nvotes, they did not make the cut. When has 60 votes been the cut? The \nvote, historically, since the founding of this Republic, is a majority \nvote. Lets look at that. The Constitution says that the Congress shall \nadvise and consent on treaties, provided two-thirds agree, and shall \nadvise and consent on judges and other nominees.\n  Since the founding of the Republic, we have understood that there was \na two-thirds supermajority for ratification and advice and consent on \ntreaties and a majority vote for judges. That is what we have done. \nThat is what we have always done. But there was a conscious decision on \nbehalf of the leadership, unfortunately, of the Democratic Party in the \nlast Congress to systematically filibuster some of the best nominees \never submitted to the Senate. It has been very painful.\n  And to justify that, they have come up with bases to attack them that \nreally go beyond the pale. I talked to a reporter recently of a major \npublication, a nationwide publication. People would recognize his name \nif I mentioned it. I talked about why I thought the nominees had been \nunfairly attacked, their records distorted and taken out of context, \nand they really were unfairly misrepresenting their statements, \nopinions and actions. She said: Well, that's politics, isn't it?\n  Are we in a Senate now where because somebody is on a different side \nof the aisle, have we gotten so low that we can just distort somebody's \nrecord--a person, a human being who is trying to serve their country--\nwe can do that to them? I don't think that is right. I don't think we \nshould do it. But I do believe we are sliding into that and have been \ndoing so.\n  For example, it was said recently by Senator Boxer that Judge \nGonzales--now Attorney General of the United States--said that \nPriscilla Owen was an unconscionable activist. He did not say that \nabout her. He did not. He has written a letter to say he did not. He \ntestified under oath at a Judiciary hearing and said he did not. What \nhe said was he reached a certain conclusion about what the legislature \nmeant when they passed a parental notification statute, and based on \nthat, he himself, he said, would have been an unconscionable activist \nif he voted other than to say that the child did not have to notify her \nparents. Other members of the court reached a different conclusion \nabout what the legislature meant with the statute, and he did not \naccuse anyone else of being an unconscionable activist. They have been \nrunning ads on television saying that as if it were a fact. It is not. \nSurely, we should have the decency not to do those kinds of things.\n  An allegation just made about Janice Rogers Brown was that she \ncriticized the free speech of an employee for criticizing their boss. \nThat is not exactly what the case was. What the facts were--that \nemployee sent out 200,000 e-mails on the boss's computer system \nattacking the boss and the company. It was a disgruntled employee. How \nmuch do you have to take, clogging up the system with spam? One of the \nmost liberal justices on the California Supreme Court joined with her \nin that view. That is not an extreme position. She wasn't saying a \nperson could not criticize her boss.\n  Another comment that was really troubling to me--and I have to say it \nbecause Janice Rogers Brown, although very firmly established and \nhighly successful in California, grew up in Alabama, a small town not \ntoo far from where I grew up. She left Alabama as a young teenager and \nwent to California and ended up going to UCLA Law School and being \nawarded the distinguished graduate award there. She is a wonderful \nperson. I have taken an interest in her history. She grew up in \ndiscrimination in the South. That is one reason they left. A \nsharecropper's daughter, she was not raised in an environment where \nAfrican Americans were treated equally. That is a fact. They say now \nthat she said it is OK to use racial slurs against Latinos. You have \nheard that comment. She said that Janice Rogers Brown said that.\n  That is not what she said. That is absolutely not the facts of that \ncase. It is really sad to hear that said, and the facts would \ndemonstrate that that claim against her is a totally unfounded charge.\n  Also, with regard to her position on the Supreme Court of California, \nshe wrote more majority opinions in the year 2002 than any other judge \non the court. When a majority reaches a view about the case, and a \nmajority on the court decides how it should come out, they appoint \nsomeone to write the opinion for the majority. She wrote more majority \nopinions than any other justice on the court. How could she be out of \nthe mainstream of the California court? I felt really compelled to make \nsome comments about her and her record.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude tonight by once again recalling that \nwhen the Republicans had the majority in 1998, right after I came to \nthe Senate in 1997, President Clinton was nominating judges. Two of \nthem were very activist judge nominees for the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, the most activist court in the United States--the California, \nWest Coast Court of Appeals. It\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\nhad been reversed 27 out of 28 times by the U.S. Supreme Court, I \nbelieve, the year before that and consistently was the most reversed \ncourt in America. Those two nominees, Berzon and Paez, which I strongly \nopposed--and I think a review of their record would show they have been \nactivist and should not have been confirmed. But Orrin Hatch said in \nour Republican conference: No, let's don't filibuster judges; that is \nwrong.\n  I was a new Member of the Senate, as the Senator from California said \nshe was. He stepped up and said: Don't filibuster. We need to give them \nand up-or-down vote. The then-majority leader, Trent Lott, moved for \ncloture to give them an up-or-down vote. I voted to give Berzon and \nPaez an up-or-down vote, and we did that. We invoked cloture, brought \nthem up. The Republican majority brought up the Clinton nominees, and \nwe voted them up. They were both confirmed, and they are both on the \nbench today.\n  Our record was one that rejected filibusters. Now, what happened \nafter all of this occurred? It was a huge alteration of the Senate's \ntradition and, I think, the constitutional intent. I think the \nConstitution is clear that a majority is what we were looking for. So \nwe were faced with a difficult decision of what to do and how to handle \nit.\n\n  I compliment Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader of the Senate. \nHe systematically raised this issue with the leadership on the other \nside. He provided every opportunity to debate these nominees so that \nnobody could say they didn't have a full opportunity to debate. He \nresearched the history of the Senate, and he presented positions on it \nand why the filibuster on judicial nominees was against our history. He \nurged us to reach an accord and compromise. All we heard was no, no, \nno, you are giving a warm kiss to the far right, you are taking steps \nthat are extreme, you are approving extreme nominees, people who should \nnot be on the bench, and we are not going to compromise and we are not \ngoing to talk to you.\n  After considerable effort and determination and commitment to \nprinciple, Senator Frist moved us into a position to execute the \nconstitutional option, also referred to as the nuclear option. It has \nbeen utilized, as he demonstrated, many times by majority leaders in \nthe past. It is not something that should be done lightly, but it is \ncertainly an approved historical technique that has been used in this \nSenate. As a result of that, and the fact that they were facing a \nchallenge, I think it was at that point we began to have movement on \nthe other side, and they realized this deal was not going to continue \nas it was and that, under the leadership of Senator Frist, we were not \ngoing to continue this unprecedented, unhistorical action of \nfilibustering judicial nominees.\n  So it was out of that that we had the agreement that was reached \ntoday. With that constitutional option hanging over the heads of a \nnumber of people, a serious reconsideration took place. I think a \nnumber of Senators on the other side have been uneasy about this \nfilibuster. They have not felt comfortable with it, but it was \nleadership-led and difficult, apparently, for them to not go along. \nAlthough, I have to note that Senator Zell Miller and Ben Nelson \nconsistently opposed it and supported the Republican nominees each and \nevery time as they came forward.\n  So out of all of this, we have reached an accord tonight. It has led \nto what appears to be a guarantee that three nominees, at least--\nPriscilla Owen, Janice Rogers Brown, and William Pryor, who is sitting \nnow as a recess appointee on the Eleventh Circuit--will get an up-or-\ndown vote. I believe all three of them will, and should be, rightfully, \nconfirmed as members of the court of appeals of the United States of \nAmerica. They will serve with great distinction. I am sorry we don't \nhave that same confidence that Judge Saad or Judge Myers will also get \na vote. They may or may not, apparently. But we don't have the same \nconfidence from this agreement that they will. I think they deserve an \nup-or-down vote also. But today's agreement was a big step forward.\n  Maybe we can go forward now and set aside some of the things of the \npast, and we will see Members of the other side adhere to the view of \nthose who signed the agreement that a filibuster should not be executed \nexcept under extraordinary circumstances. Certainly, that is contrary \nto the position that they were taking a few months ago and certainly \nthe position being taken last year.\n  So progress has been made. I salute particularly the majority leader \nwho I believe, through his leadership and consistency, led to this \nresult today. I am thrilled for Judge Pryor and his family because I \nknow him, I respect him, and I know he will be a great judge. I am \nexcited for his future.\n  Mr. President, seeing no other Senator here, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/23/senate-section/article/S5813-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
