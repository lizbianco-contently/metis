Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin have started a \nprocess of lining up amendments to be considered. Last night we locked \nin a vote which will begin at 10:30 this morning. That vote will be on \nSenator Specter's amendment on Medicaid/Medicare centers for services.\n  I encourage Members who have amendments to the Labor-HHS bill to \ncontact both managers as soon as possible. In order to ensure we finish \nthe bill this week, we may have to file cloture at some point. We do \nnot want to foreclose Members' rights to offer amendments. Thus, \nSenators should exercise their right to offer those amendments and do \nit now, come over this morning and over the course of the day. We will \nhave multiple votes during today's session. Senators need to come to \nthe floor promptly once a vote is called. As both the Democratic leader \nand I mentioned yesterday, we need to be responsible in voting on time, \nand that is a courtesy to the rest of the Senate. But even more \nimportantly, we have so much to do that we do need to run the place in \na disciplined way. We will have our policy luncheons today from 12:30 \nto 2:15.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11777-7", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11777-S11778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ROSA PARKS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, this year the Grand Ole Opry celebrates 80 \nyears of star-studded country entertainment. This venerated institution \nstands as one the most important traditions in radio broadcasting and \ncountry music. If not for the Grand Ole Opry, my hometown of Nashville \nwould most likely have never gained that title of ``Music City USA.''\n  The Grand Ole Opry first broadcast on November 28, 1925. Originally \ncalled the WSM Barn Dance, the weekly radio show featured comedy and \nblue glass, gospel and country. Radio host George D. Hay made sure that \nevery broadcast was kept ``real down to Earth.''\n  Today, the Opry stands as the longest running continuous weekly radio \nbroadcast, with over 4,000 consecutive Saturday evening shows. \nAudiences can tune into the Grand Ole Opry via radio, satellite, \ntelevision or Internet. The show is even broadcast by the Armed Forces \nRadio and Television Services Network to entertain our troops around \nthe world.\n  Throughout its history, the Opry has embraced and celebrated the best \nin family entertainment, including those musical performances and \ncomedy sketches that have warmed the hearts of millions throughout the \nSouth, all over the country and, indeed, throughout the world. Country \ngreat and Opry member Dolly Parton explains that at the Opry, ``there's \na circle of friends, and a circle of performers and a circle of love at \nthe old place.''\n  Jeanie Seely puts it this way:\n\n       The Grand Ole Opry is not an institution. It's not a \n     building. It's the people, the performers, the people who \n     come. That's the Grand Ole Opry. That's what makes it \n     special.\n\n  And for new members, joining the Opry is joining a pantheon of \ncountry music greats. Roy Acuff, Chet Atkins, Johnny Cash, Dolly \nParton, Minnie Pearl, Grandpa Jones, Garth Brooks, Vince Gill, and Reba \nMcEntire, all have been members, and the list goes on. Even President \nNixon has played on that Grand Ole Opry stage.\n  As Loretta Lynn recently told a newspaper:\n\n       If you've never played at the Grand Ole Opry, you haven't \n     quite made it, yet.\n\n  The Opry has promoted country music in a unique way. It has promoted \nit to the entire world and has invited new generations to hear the best \nthat country has to offer. I am honored to represent the home State of \nsuch a dynamic part of American culture and music history.\n  Today, I proudly introduce a Senate resolution commending the Grand \nOle Opry for 80 years of music excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11778-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11778-S11779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING THE GRAND OLE OPRY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 286, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 286) commending the Grand Ole Opry on \n     the occasion of its 80th anniversary for its important role \n     in the popularization of country music and for its 8 decades \n     of musical and broadcast excellence.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 286) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 286\n\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry is a pioneer of commercial radio \n     in the United States, and is the longest running continuous \n     radio program in the United States, having operated since \n     November 28, 1925, and having broadcasted over 4,000 \n     consecutive Saturday evening shows on WSM Radio, Nashville, \n     Tennessee;\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry played an integral role in the \n     commercial development of the country music industry, and in \n     establishing Nashville, Tennessee, as ``Music City USA'';\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry has consistently promoted the \n     best in live entertainment and provided a distinctive forum \n     for connecting country music fans to musicians so as to \n     promote the popularity of this uniquely American genre;\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry serves as a unique American icon \n     that enshrines the rich musical history of country music, and \n     preserves the tradition and character of the genre through \n     commemorative performances and events;\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry is committed to quality \n     performances, and the membership of the Grand Ole Opry \n     represents the elite of country music performers, including \n     generations of America's most talented musicians, \n     encompassing the music legends of old and the superstars of \n     today that continue to define American country music;\n       Whereas performers at the Grand Ole Opry have included such \n     universally recognized names as Roy Acuff, Chet Atkins, \n     Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Porter Wagoner, Little Jimmy \n     Dickens, Connie Smith, Earl Scruggs, George Jones, Grandpa \n     Jones, Loretta Lynn, Uncle Dave Macon, Dolly Parton, Minnie \n     Pearl, Jim Reeves, Hank Williams, and many more;\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry celebrates the diversity of \n     country music, with membership spanning both generation and \n     genre, representing the best in folk, country, bluegrass, \n     gospel, and comedy performances;\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry continues to utilize \n     technological innovations to develop new avenues of \n     connecting country music to its fans, and can be seen and \n     heard around the world via television, radio, satellite \n     radio, and the Internet;\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry provides heartening support to \n     members of the Armed Forces by participating in the \n     Department of Defense's America Supports You Program, \n     providing live performances to American Forces serving abroad \n     via the American Forces Radio and Television Services \n     network;\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry is recognized as the world's \n     premiere country music show, and continues to entertain \n     millions of fans throughout the world, including United \n     States Presidents and foreign dignitaries, and serves as an \n     emissary of American music and culture; and\n       Whereas the Grand Ole Opry will continue to impact American \n     culture and music, and play an important role in presenting \n     the best in country music to new generations of fans \n     throughout the world, touching millions with music and \n     comedy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commends the Grand Ole Opry on \n     the occasion of its 80th anniversary for its important role \n     in the popularization of country music, and for its 8 decades \n     of musical and broadcast excellence.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I join the majority leader in the \nresolution that I have cosponsored honoring the Grand Ole Opry on its \n80th birthday.\n  I ask unanimous consent to bring on the Senate floor this piece of \ndemonstrative evidence which I hold in my hand and to which I will \nrefer in a moment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Those of us of a certain age will recognize this straw \nhat with a garland of flowers and a price tag that says $1.98 as the \nkind of hat that Minnie Pearl wore on the Grand Ole Opry on Friday and \nSaturday nights every year for about 40 years. Most of the time, Minnie \nPearl was the Grand Ole Opry, along with Roy Acuff. She welcomed people \nwith: Howdy, I'm so proud to be here. I didn't say it the way she would \nalways say it. Thousands and thousands of Americans sat on the \nuncomfortable wooden pews in the back of the Ryman Auditorium and later \nat the Opry to watch this radio show. One of those was a young man from \nMinnesota named Garrison Keillor, who, in the 1970s, sat back there and \nimagined the show which we call today ``The Prairie Home Companion.''\n  A couple weekends ago, I was the guest announcer on the Grand Ole \nOpry. They didn't trust me with the Goo Goo candy bar commercial or \nwith the 7 p.m. show which is nationally televised, so I was on at 8. \nBut I did get to do the Martha White flour commercial and to introduce \nPorter Waggoner three times.\n  There is nothing quite like the Grand Ole Opry. There are 3,400 \npeople out there every Friday night, every Saturday night, now \nsometimes on Tuesdays. Flashbulbs are popping. Everybody is having a \ngood time.\n  There was Jimmy C. Newman from Louisiana who next year will be on the \nGrand Ole Opry for 50 years. There was Susan Haynes, the daughter of my \nlaw school roommate. This is her first year on the Grand Ole Opry. \nThere was Carol Lee and Nora Lee, the back-up singers. They have been \nthere a long time, too.\n\n[[Page S11779]]\n\n  At 7 o'clock, there was Vince Gill who ended his hour-long session \nwith a piece of jazz music. The Grand Ole Opry is getting more \ndiversified. There was Keith Bilbrey backstage interviewing people. He \nwas explaining what Charlie McCoy, the great harmonicist, once said \nabout the four stages of being a country music star which sound a lot \nlike being a politician. Stage No. 1 is, Who is Charlie McCoy? Stage \nNo. 2 is, Get me Charlie McCoy. Stage No. 3 is, Get me somebody who \nsounds like Charlie McCoy. And stage No. 4 is, Who is Charlie McCoy?\n  The Opry was started so that the National Life and Accident Insurance \nCompany could sell debit insurance. They got a big tower in Nashville. \nI think it is 50,000 watts. So all the people who were on little radio \nstations came to Nashville so they could be on the big radio station.\n  That is when Roy Acuff and Chet Atkins and Archie Grandpappy Campbell \nand Dolly Parton all moved from east Tennessee to Nashville. If you \nunderstand how important the Alamo is to Texas, you will understand how \nimportant the Grand Ole Opry is to Tennesseans, not just Tennesseans \nbut many Americans, the 3,400 who every Friday and Saturday night have \ngone to thousands and thousands of these radio shows.\n  No one represented the Opry in its spirit better than Minnie Pearl. \nThere is a photograph of Minnie in dressing room No. 1 backstage, which \nwas Roy Acuff's dressing room until he died, which was the dressing \nroom that Vince Gill was using on the night I was there as the guest \nannouncer. There on the wall was a picture of a young Minnie Pearl in \nthe early 1940s with this hat or a hat similar to this one.\n  Where did this $1.98 price tag come from? I heard the story that \nnight for the first time. Minnie was performing on the Opry. She pinned \na garland of flowers to her hat. And during her performance, this price \ntag wiggled down and started dangling from her hat. She left it there \nfor the next 40 years as a reminder that anybody can make a mistake and \nit is all right to make one.\n\n  Minnie Pearl was a talented woman who wanted to be Katharine Hepburn. \nAs she said, that was already taken. She set a standard of conduct and \nstyle for the Grand Ole Opry that lasts and persists until today, and \nthat style was simply that she was just a very nice person. She would \nsign the last autograph; she would say hello to anyone; she would pay a \ncall on a Grand Ole Opry family member who was sick; she would see the \nlast fan who had waited for 2 hours after the show.\n  Minnie Pearl told me one time: I have gotten to the point in life \nwhere I have decided if people are not nice, they are not so hot in my \nbook no matter how big they are.\n  So in the spirit of Minnie Pearl and all of the thousands of \nAmericans who have created and enjoyed the Grand Ole Opry, happy 80th \nbirthday, Grand Ole Opry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11779-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, let me recognize that Minnie Pearl is a \ntough act to follow. Nonetheless, we must move on. Today, I am going to \nannounce a one-sentence initiative that I will try to put on the Labor-\nHHS appropriations bill. I won't be successful because there are some \nprocedural reasons. It would take a supermajority. But at least we will \nget a vote down so we will have an idea about who in this Chamber is \nreally serious about doing something about the deficit.\n  I had to oppose my dear friend and junior Senator from Oklahoma last \nweek because of the unintended consequences of interfering with local \nself-determination, and I caution any effort that would substitute or \npreempt States' sovereignty in favor of centralized control in the \nFederal bureaucracy unless substantial cuts in spending are \naccomplished.\n  The Framers of the Constitution feared one thing above all else, and \nthat was a tyrannical central Government made up of unaccountable \nFederal bureaucrats would someday be able to supersede States' rights \nin decisionmaking by locally elected representatives. There is nothing \nmore conservative than this very principle of preserving local control \nagainst the centralized Government.\n  As the author of the Transportation reauthorization bill, I was very \npleased at the way we drafted the legislation. We took a formula so \nthat we could allocate funds to the States but then didn't tell the \nStates what to do with them and said: You determine what your \npriorities should be at the State level. I believe it is a very good \nprocess. I was proud to be a part of that process.\n  There is a mentality in Washington, DC, that if a decision isn't made \nin Washington, it is not a good decision. The controversial Ketchikan \nto Gravina Island bridge in Alaska has become a rallying point about \nboondoggles, and maybe it is a boondoggle, but the people in Alaska \ndidn't think so. They have 100 projects. All States do it differently. \nBut in Alaska, they list 100 projects that are the projects they want \nto have someday. That particular bridge is ranked in the top 4 of those \n100. I think also that we have to recognize that we in Washington do \nnot really know what is the best thing for them.\n  The other thing that is very important is that most of the money, had \nthis amendment passed, is in accordance with the formula. So if we \ndirected them not to build their bridge, that money could still be \nspent in Alaska on other projects. We would just be saying that you \nhave to spend the dollars in a way that we in Washington say is best \nfor you.\n  I will support future amendments that will save taxpayers' dollars. \nIn the meantime, there is something we can do: support the one-sentence \namendment that I will introduce.\n\n       Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter nondefense, \n     nontrust fund discretionary spending shall not exceed \n     previous years without a two-thirds vote.\n\n  That is very simple, very straightforward, and something that will \nwork. I recognize that we are only talking in this case about 20 \npercent of the budget because we have so many entitlements and, of \ncourse, the defense spending. But those entitlements are being \naddressed right now in the budget reconciliation. We need to wait and \nsee how that washes out.\n  I had this as kind of a mission for a lot of years. I introduced the \nfirst amendment in 1987, the first year that I was here over in the \nother body at that time. But it goes all the way back to 1969 when then \nSenator Carl Curtis from Nebraska came up with the idea. He was the one \nwho always wanted to the pass the amendment as an amendment to the \nConstitution. So he said, Why don't you out in Oklahoma preratify a \nconstitutional amendment, so if we get enough States to do it, that \nwould give us the power needed to try to pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  It never worked. I think the idea was right. I think this very simple \nsolution is one we can address today. It will be something that will \ntake care of these problems in a much simpler way and will maintain the \nauthority out in the States where I believe it belongs. I have served \nas a mayor of a city, I have served in the State legislature, and I \nhave served here. It has been my experience that the closer you get to \nhome, the better the decisions, and that is consistent with what I am \nasking for today.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT.

Mr. President, these are serious and difficult times for \nour\n\n[[Page S11780]]\n\ncountry and for many Americans. These are times that demand bold and \nimmediate action. The American people do not want any more excuses. \nThey do not want to hear Congressmen and Senators arguing about who is \nto blame, and they are not impressed by those who constantly criticize \nthe proposals of others but never make any proposals of their own.\n  Energy prices are too high, and we have heard enough excuses about \nwhy America cannot develop our own oil and gas reserves, build more \nrefineries, and develop more alternative fuels to make us more \nindependent of Middle East oil.\n  Health care and health insurance are too expensive, and we have heard \nenough excuses about why individuals cannot buy health insurance from \nanywhere in the country and get the same tax breaks as businesses.\n  Illegal immigration is out of control, and we have heard enough \nexcuses about why we cannot control our borders.\n  Social Security is going broke, and we have heard enough excuses why \nCongress should continue to spend trillions of dollars of Social \nSecurity taxes on other Government programs.\n  We need action now, but we cannot solve these difficult problems that \nface us if we do not have a strong economy and a more efficient \nGovernment. House and Senate Republicans are developing budget \nreconciliation legislation now that will accomplish these goals to \nstrengthen our economy, create jobs, and cut the cost of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This package has two parts. The first part is to stop the scheduled \ntax increases that will soon add new burdens to our citizens and the \nbusinesses that pay their salaries. We must not allow new tax increases \nto steal our jobs and weaken our country at a time when we need all of \nour economic strength to solve the problems of today and to create new \nopportunities for the future.\n  The 2003 jobs and growth plan passed by Congress and signed by the \nPresident lowered taxes for capital gains and dividends, and it \nresulted in greater economic growth. Our economy has grown more than 4 \npercent a year since 2003, much faster than in the prior 2 years. Over \n4 million jobs have been created since 2003, and 7 million seniors \nsaved an average of over $1200 on their 2004 taxes. And while tax rates \nhave fallen, tax revenues have been increasing. In fact, as a result of \na growing economy, Federal tax receipts grew this year by over $270 \nbillion--$100 billion more than the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated earlier this year. If Congress does not pass this important \nbudget reconciliation legislation this year, taxes will go up and \neconomic growth will go down.\n  During uncertain times, Americans want stability. And that is why \nCongress must act now to bring certainty to America's families and stop \nthe scheduled tax increases.\n  The second part of the Republican budget reconciliation package is to \ncut Government waste and reduce Federal spending. There are many \nwasteful practices of Government. We have all heard the stories like \nthe dentist who overbilled Medicaid, claiming to perform as many as 991 \nprocedures a day during a 12-month period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Could I ask unanimous consent?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Does the Senator want to ask for further time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes, if I could have a couple more minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Provided it will not come out of our time, I have no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Examples like the Medicaid one I just mentioned are maddening. We \nmust stop this wasteful spending, and we also must slow the growth of \nnew spending. If we slow the growth of new spending only, we can save \nmuch of the money we need to help our States recover from this year's \ndevastating hurricanes. There is no problem too big for America to \nsolve if we have the commitment and the strength to do it. Mr. \nPresident, the time for criticism, excuses, and obstruction is over. I \nam here this morning to appeal to every Senator to support our budget \nreconciliation package that will stop new tax increases and help cut \nthe cost of Government so we have all the strength we need to secure \nthe future for every American.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 years ago when the Congress and the \ncountry debated the resolution to give President Bush the authority to \nlaunch a preemptive war against Iraq, reference was often made to the \nlessons of Vietnam.\n  There are many lessons, both of that war and of the efforts to end \nit. But one that made a deep impression on me came from former \nSecretary of Defense Robert McNamara. He was, after all, the architect \nof that war. He said our greatest mistake was not understanding our \nenemy.\n  Vietnam was a relatively simple country. It had changed little in the \npreceding 3,000 years. It was for the most part racially, ethnically, \nlinguistically, and even religiously homogeneous. One would have \nthought it would be easy for American military and political leaders to \nunderstand.\n  Apparently it was not. The White House and the Pentagon, convinced \nthat no country, particularly a tiny impoverished land of rice farmers, \ncould withstand the military might of the United States, never bothered \nto study and understand the history or culture of Vietnam, and they \nmade tragic miscalculations. They lacked the most basic knowledge of \nthe motivation and the capabilities and resolve of the people they were \nfighting.\n  At the start of the Iraq war, those who drew some analogies to \nVietnam were ridiculed by the Pentagon and the White House. Iraq is not \na Vietnam, they insisted. Our troops would be greeted as liberators. \nTroop strength was not a concern. Our mission would be quickly \naccomplished. Democracy would spread throughout the Middle East. \nFreedom was on the march.\n  It is true that Vietnam and Iraq are vastly different societies, but \nthe point was not that they are similar but that some of the same \nlessons apply.\n  We did not understand Vietnam, a simple country, and we paid a huge \nprice for our ignorance and our arrogance. Iraq, a complex country \ncomprised of rival clans, tribes, and ethnic and religious factions who \nhave fought each other for centuries, we understand even less.\n  If this were not apparent to many at the start of this ill-conceived \nand politically motivated war, a war I opposed from the beginning, it \nshould be obvious today. Yet to listen to the Secretary of Defense or \nto the President or the Vice President, one would never know it.\n  We know today that President Bush decided to invade Iraq without \nevidence to support the use of force and well before Congress passed a \nresolution giving him the authority to do so--actually, authority he \ndid not even believe he needed--despite our great Constitution which \ninvests in the Congress the power to declare war.\n  Twenty-three Senators voted against that resolution, and I will \nalways be proud to have been one of them.\n  We know today that the motivation for a plan to attack Iraq, hatched \nby a handful of political operatives, had taken hold within in the \nWhite House even before 9/11 and without any connection to the war on \nterrorism that came later.\n  We know that the key public justifications for the war--to stop \nSaddam Hussein from developing nuclear weapons and supporting al-\nQaida--were based on faulty intelligence and outright distortions, and \nthey have been\n\n[[Page S11781]]\n\nthoroughly discredited. United Nations weapons inspectors, who were \ndismissed by the White House as being naive and ineffective, turned out \nto have gathered far better information with a tiny fraction of the \nbudget of our own intelligence agencies.\n  We know the insurgency is continuing to grow along with American \ncasualties--1,999 killed, and at least 15,220 wounded, many with \ncrippling injuries, as of yesterday--despite the same old ``light at \nthe end of the tunnel'' assertions and cliches by the White House and \ntop officials in the Pentagon.\n  The sad but inescapable truth, which the President either does not \nsee or refuses to believe or admit, is the Iraqi insurgency has \nsteadily grown, in part because of, not in spite of, our presence \nthere.\n  After baiting the insurgents to ``bring them on,'' as the President \nsaid, we got what the President asked for. More than 2 years later, the \npendulum has swung against us and the question is no longer whether we \ncan stop the insurgency; the question is how do we extricate ourselves.\n  According to soldiers who volunteered for duty in Iraq believing in \nthe mission and who have returned home, many Iraqis who detest the \nbarbaric tactics of the insurgents have also grown to despise us. They \nblame us for the lack of water and electricity, for the lack of jobs \nand health care, for the hardships and violence they are suffering day \nin and day out.\n  Unlike our troops and their families who are making great sacrifices \nevery day, most Americans have been asked to sacrifice nothing for this \nwar. In fact, we don't pay the bills. The bills are being sent to our \nchildren and our grandchildren by way of our rapidly escalating \nnational debt and annual deficits.\n  Yet as the hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for the war \ncontinue to pile up and domestic programs, such as Medicaid, job \ntraining, and programs for needy students, are cut, then the sacrifices \nare going to be felt as well.\n  Slogans have become little more than political rallying cries for the \nWhite House, slogans as empty and unfulfilled as ``mission \naccomplished.'' Our troops were sent to fight an unnecessary war \nwithout sufficient armor against these ruthless and barbaric bombing \nattacks, without adequate reinforcements, without a plan to win the \npeace, and without adequate medical care and other services when they \nreturn home on stretchers or crutches or with eye patches, unable to \nwalk, to work, to pay their mortgages, or to support their families.\n  Many of our veterans have been treated shamefully by their Government \nwhen it sent them into harm's way under false pretenses and again after \nthey returned home.\n  Today I worry about places such as Ramadi, where more than 300 \nmembers of the Army National Guard from my State of Vermont are \ncurrently serving valiantly alongside their comrades in the Marine \nCorps and the Pennsylvania National Guard. Dozens of other citizen \nsoldiers from the Vermont Guard are serving across Iraq, while hundreds \nmore are deployed throughout the Persian Gulf region.\n  Many Vermonters have been killed in Ramadi and elsewhere by roadside \nbombs and all-too-accurate sniper attacks. The insurgents too often \nseem to attack and then escape with impunity. You can actually open \nnewspapers and see photos of armed insurgents walking the streets of \nIraq in broad daylight.\n  Many of these cold-blooded attacks are by people who are willing to \ntrade their own lives to kill civilians, security guards, and our \nsoldiers who now have no way of knowing whom they can trust among the \ngeneral population.\n  The President has no plan to deal with Ramadi, let alone the rest of \nIraq, except doing more of what we have been doing for more than 2 \nyears at a cost of $5 billion a month--money we don't have and that \nfuture generations of Americans are going to have to repay. Nor has he \nproposed a practical alternative to our wasteful energy policy that \nguarantees our continued dependence on Persian Gulf oil for decades to \ncome.\n  I am sure that what our military is doing to train the Iraqi Army and \nwhat our billions upon billions of dollars are doing to help rebuild \nIraq--whatever is not stolen or wasted by profiteering contractors--is \nmaking a difference. Iraq is no longer governed by a corrupt, ruthless \ndictator, and there have been halting but important steps toward \nrepresentative government.\n  I applaud the Iraqis who courageously stood in long lines to cast a \nballot for a new constitution, despite the insurgents' threats. There \nare many profiles in courage among the Iraqi people, just as there are \nin the heroic and daily endeavors of United States soldiers there.\n  But this progress masks deeper troubles and may be short lived, \nthreatened by a widening insurgency and a divisive political process \nthat is increasingly seen as leading to a Shiite-dominated theocracy \ngoverned by Islamic law and aligned with Iran, or the dissolution of \nIraq into separate Kurdish, Sunni, and Shiite states.\n  Mr. President, this war has been a costly disaster for the United \nStates of America. More than half of the American people now say they \nhave lost confidence in the President's handling of it.\n\n  Far from making us safer from terrorists, in fact, it has turned Iraq \ninto a haven and recruiting ground for terrorists and deflected our \nattention and resources away from the fight against terrorism. If \nanything, it has emboldened our enemies, as it has become increasingly \napparent that the most powerful army in the world cannot stop a \ndetermined insurgency.\n  Regrettably, it is no longer a secret how vulnerable we are. \nHurricane Katrina showed how tragically unprepared we are to respond to \na major disaster 4 years after 9/11 and after wasting billions of \ndollars on an unnecessary war.\n  Our cities are little further than the drawing board when it comes to \ndeveloping workable evacuation plans for a terrorist attack or other \nemergency, not to mention how to feed, house, and provide for millions \nof displaced persons.\n  This war has caused immense damage to our relations with the world's \nMuslims, a religion practiced by some 1.2 billion people, about which \nmost Americans know virtually nothing. We cannot possibly mount an \neffective campaign against terrorism without the trust, respect, and \nthe active support of Muslims, particularly in the Middle East where \nour image has been so badly damaged. Our weakened international \nreputation is another heavy price our country has paid for this war.\n  Each day, as more and more Iraqi civilians, often children, lose \ntheir lives and limbs from suicide bombers and also from our bombs, the \nresentment and anger toward us intensifies. And every week, the number \nof U.S. service men and women who are killed or wounded creeps higher \nand will soon pass 2,000, but, even more tragically, shows no sign of \ndiminishing.\n  This war has isolated us from our allies, most of whom want no part \nof it, and if we continue on the course the President has set, it will \nalso divide our country.\n  Other Senators and Representatives, Republicans and Democrats, have \nexpressed frustration and alarm with the President's failure to \nacknowledge that this war has been a costly mistake, that more of the \nsame is not a workable policy, and that we need to change course. My \nfriend Senator Hagel, a Vietnam veteran, has pointed out the increasing \nsimilarities to Vietnam. We learned this week that the administration \nhas even resumed the discredited Vietnam-era practice of measuring \nprogress by reporting body counts.\n  White House and Pentagon officials and their staunchest supporters in \nCongress warn of a wider civil war if we pull our troops out. They \ncould be right. In fact, it could be the first thing they have been \nright about since the beginning of this reckless adventure.\n  My question to them is: When and how then do we extract ourselves \nfrom this mess? What does the President believe needs to happen before \nour troops can come home? What is his plan for getting to that point?\n  If we cannot overcome the insurgency, what can we realistically \nexpect to accomplish in Iraq--and at what cost--that requires the \ncontinued deployment of our troops? What is it that compels us to spend \nbillions of dollars to rebuild the Iraqi military when our own National \nGuard is stretched to the breaking point and cannot even get the money \nfor the equipment it needs?\n\n[[Page S11782]]\n\n  I doubt the President or the Secretary of Defense will answer these \nquestions. Instead of answers, we get rhetoric that conflicts with just \nabout everything we hear or read, including from some of this country's \nmost distinguished retired military officers who served under both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations.\n  Six months ago, the Vice President said the insurgency was in its \nlast throes. That was just the latest in a long string of grossly \ninaccurate statements and predictions and false expectations about \nIraq.\n  Secretary Rice, when asked recently when U.S. forces could begin to \ncome home assuming the Administration's rosy predictions come true, \ncould not, or would not, even venture a guess.\n  Without answers--real answers, honest answers--to these questions, I \nwill not support the open-ended deployment of our troops in a war that \nwas based on falsehood and justified with hubris.\n  Even though I opposed this war, I have prayed, like other Americans, \nthat it would weaken the threat of terrorism and make the world safer, \nthat our troops' sacrifices would be justified, and that the President \nhad a plan for completing the mission.\n  Instead, it has turned Iraq into a training ground for terrorists, it \nis fueling the insurgency, it is causing severe damage to the \nreputation and readiness of the United States military, and it is \npreventing us from addressing the inexcusable weaknesses in our \nhomeland security.\n  The Iraqi people, at least the Shiites and Kurds, have voted for a \nnew constitution, as hastily drafted, flawed, and potentially divisive \nas it may be. Saddam Hussein, whose capacity for cruelty was seemingly \nlimitless, is finally facing trial for his heinous crimes. Elections \nfor a new national government are due by the end of the year. By then, \nit will be more than 2\\1/2\\ years since Saddam's overthrow, and we will \nhave given the Iraqi people a chance to chart their own course. The \nsooner we reduce our presence there, the sooner they will have to make \nthe difficult decisions necessary to solve their own problems in their \nown country.\n  Our military commanders say that Iraq's problems increasingly need to \nbe solved through the political process, not through military force. We \nmust show Iraq and the world that we are not an occupying force, and \nthat we have no designs on their country or their oil. The American \npeople need to know that the President has a plan to bring our troops \nhome.\n  Once a new Iraqi government is in place, I believe the President \nshould consult with Congress on a flexible plan that includes pulling \nour troops back from the densely populated areas where they are \nsuffering the worst casualties and to bring them home.\n  It is also long overdue for Congress and the White House to reassess \nour policy toward this region.\n  The President has declared democracy is taking root throughout the \nMiddle East, and there have been some small, positive steps. But they \nare dwarfed by the ongoing threat posed by Iran, Syria's continued \nmeddling in Iraq and Lebanon, repression and corruption in Saudi Arabia \nand Egypt, the danger that the momentum for peace from Israel's \nwithdrawal from Gaza will be lost as settlement construction \naccelerates in the West Bank, and the widespread--albeit mistaken--\nbelief among Muslims that the United States wants to destroy Islam \nitself.\n  Just as the White House's obsession with Iraq has diverted our \nresources and impeded our efforts to strengthen our defenses against \nterrorism at home, so has it made it more difficult to constructively, \nwith our allies, address these regional threats.\n  As I have said, I did not support this war, and I believe that \nhistory will not judge kindly those who got us into this debacle by \nattacking a country that did not threaten us, after deceiving the \nAmerican people and ridiculing those who appealed for caution and for \ninstead mobilizing our resources directly against the threat of \nterrorism.\n  I worry that many of our young veterans who have gone to Iraq and \nexperienced the brutality and trauma of war and may already feel guilty \nfor having survived, will increasingly question its purpose. As the \narchitects of this war move on to other jobs, I fear we are going to \nsee another generation of veterans, many of them physically and \npsychologically scarred for life, who feel a deep sense of betrayal by \ntheir Government.\n  If President Bush will not say what remains to be done before he can \ndeclare victory and bring our troops home, then the Congress should be \nvoting on what this war is really costing the Nation.\n  We should vote on paying for the war versus cutting Medicaid, as some \nare proposing; or pay for the war versus cutting VA programs that are \nalready unable to pay the staggering costs of treatment and \nrehabilitation for our injured veterans; or pay for it versus \nrebuilding our National Guard; or rebuilding FEMA; or securing our \nports and our borders; or investing in our intelligence so we can \nfinally capture Osama bin Laden; or investing in health care for the \ntens of millions of Americans who cannot afford to get sick; or fixing \nour troubled schools, so our children can learn to do a better job than \nwe have of making the world a safer place for all people.\n  These, and the tarnished reputation of a country that I love and so \nmany once admired as not only powerful buy also good and just are the \nreal costs of this war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I put all Senators on notice that we will \nsoon be starting the debate on an amendment to be offered by Senator \nDurbin. We had expected to go on the bill at 10, with morning business \nscheduled from 9:30 to 10, but morning business has run a little late. \nOne of the Senators asked for an extension of time, which was not \nobjected to. Now Senator Stabenow has asked for 5 minutes, which we \nwill agree to. Senator Harkin and I are on the floor, and we are \nanxious to proceed with the business of the bill. I know Senator Harkin \nwould like to make a comment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the distinguished chairman would yield, I am sorry I \nwas off the floor momentarily, but did the Senator from Pennsylvania do \nanything about the amendment that is pending?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the request was made to have the \namendment which is pending accepted by a voice vote. It is really in \nthe nature of a technical amendment. The amendment reduces Federal \nadministrative costs for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \nby $15 million with no cuts coming from oversight and enforcement. This \nreduction is necessary to bring the Labor-HHS bill into compliance with \nits allocation ceiling. Concerns have been raised that this reduction \nwould reduce the funds available to administer the new prescription \ndrug program. This is not the case--the reduction will come from \nadministrative overhead, supplies and contracts. We had talked about \nhaving a vote on it this morning at 10:30, but in light of the request \nthat we not vote on that amendment but vote on the Durbin amendment, \nthat is acceptable to this side.\n  As I said before, Senator Stabenow has asked for 5 minutes, and we \nare prepared to yield that time. But we want to put all Senators on \nnotice we are anxious to proceed with the bill, and I will expect to \nstart on the Durbin amendment at about 10:24 and expect to vote on it \nsometime between 10:45 and 11.\n  Senator Harkin and I, backed by the leaders, have said that we are \ngoing to do our best to enforce 20-minute votes, 15 and a 5-minute \nextension. So all Senators should know when we start the Durbin vote \nthat it will be limited to 20 minutes to the extent that Senator Harkin \nand I can prevail on that. When we finish the Durbin vote at about \n11:15, we would be pressing to have amendments filed. We have a long, \ncomplicated bill. There is an amendment lined up at 2:15, but if we are \nto move this bill along and to avoid pressing for third reading and \nfinal passage, we want to avoid lengthy quorum calls.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11782-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11782-S11784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROSA LOUISE PARKS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the courtesies \nextended to me by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S11783]]\n\n  I rise to pay tribute to one of the giants of American history. Today \nwe honor the remarkable life and legacy of Rosa Parks, who died just \nlast evening at the age of 92.\n  The Detroit News today says:\n\n       Courage in the face of oppression; resistance in the face \n     of injustice. That is the enduring legacy of Rosa Parks, \n     whose defiance on a racially segregated Montgomery, Ala., bus \n     lit the flame of the modern civil rights movement and \n     inspired freedom movements from South Africa to Poland.\n\n  The Detroit Free Press today:\n\n       When Rosa Parks refused to get up, an entire race of people \n     began to stand up for their rights as human beings. Her \n     refusal to give up her bus seat to a white man was a simple \n     act that took extraordinary courage in Montgomery, Ala., in \n     1955. It was a place where black people had no rights that \n     white people had to respect. It was a time when racial \n     discrimination was so common, many blacks never questioned \n     it. At least not out loud. But then came Rosa Louise Parks.\n\n  I am so proud Rosa Parks was a resident of Michigan. We have claimed \nher for many years and are so proud that she has left her legacy to all \nof us, particularly in Detroit, MI.\n  On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks left work in her hometown of \nMontgomery, AL, and boarded a bus headed for home. When the bus became \ncrowded, she was ordered by the bus driver to give up her seat to a \nwhite male passenger. She refused. Rosa Parks was arrested, and 4 days \nlater the Montgomery bus boycott began. The boycott lasted for over a \nyear until the Montgomery buses were officially desegregated in \nDecember of 1956.\n  Rosa Parks was a courageous woman who did what she believed was fair \nand right. She is a testament to the power of one individual willing to \nfight for their beliefs. Her actions set the civil rights movement in \nmotion and set a precedent for protest without violence. We all owe a \ndebt of gratitude to Rosa Parks for her contribution to freedom and \njustice for all men and women in this country. Truly, her actions \nchanged the course of history.\n  Rosa Parks moved to Detroit in 1957 and it became home for her for \nnearly 50 years. In 1977, she and Elaine Easton Steele founded the \nRaymond and Rosa Parks Institute for Self-Development in Detroit to \noffer guidance to young African-Americans. The institute's many \nprograms include the annual Pathways to Freedom bus tour that exposes \nyoung African Americans to landmarks of the civil rights era.\n  The people of Michigan take great pride in the fact that Rosa Parks \nbecame part of our community in our great State. She devoted her life \nto public service, to helping people, and to helping to serve as a role \nmodel for our children. She made such an impact on our country and on \nthe people of the metro Detroit community that the actual bus where \nRosa Parks made her defiant stand is now on display at the Henry Ford \nMuseum in Dearborn, MI.\n  Children from all over the world have come to see the bus that became \nthis symbol of the civil rights movement. Nicknamed the Mother of Civil \nRights, President Clinton awarded Rosa Parks the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom in 1996, the highest civilian award this country can bestow. \nMrs. Parks also received the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999. Earlier \nthis year, Senator Levin and I introduced a bill to name a Federal \nbuilding in Detroit after Mrs. Parks. We think it is important that we \nrecognize her in this way to thank her in some small way for her \nincredible contribution to our country. It is an honor she richly \ndeserves, and I believe it is important that we pass this bill this \nweek in the Senate, just as the House has passed the bill, so that we \ncan together, in a unanimous way, say: Thank you, Rosa Parks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join others the world over in mourning \nthe death and giving thanks for the life of Mrs. Rosa Parks. Someone \nonce said that in the instance Rosa Parks refused to move, somewhere in \nthe universe a gear in the machinery shifted. Jim Crow had finally met \nhis match.\n  Rosa Parks was an accomplished seamstress who helped us all see that \nAmerica's great strength is the fact that we are one cloth sewn \ntogether in a splendid coat of many colors. It is often reported that \nRosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus that day in \nMontgomery, AL, because her feet were tired.\n  That was not so. She said many times:\n\n       I was not physically tired--or no more than I usually was \n     at the end of a working day. No, the only tired I was, was \n     tired of giving in.\n\n  It would be more than a year before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled \nMontgomery's segregated buses were unconstitutional.\n  To this day, the Montgomery bus boycott remains the largest and most \nsuccessful act of civil disobedience in the history of the United \nStates of America, all inspired by this simple, courageous woman. For \n381 days, tens of thousands of hard-working middle class, lower class, \nand all classes of African Americans walked miles to work every day in \nthe heat, in the cold, in the rain. Many of the boycotters, including \nMrs. Parks and her husband Raymond, lost their jobs, but they never \nlost their faith. They persevered with courage and with dignity.\n  In the end, they did not just change the law; they changed our \nNation, and they changed the world. The image of Rosa Parks sitting \nquietly on that bus waiting to be arrested is etched forever in our \nnational consciousness, but it is not simply refusing to give up her \nseat that made Rosa Parks so great. It was a refusal to give up hope, \nespecially her hope in young people.\n  In 1955, Mrs. Parks was the leader of the Montgomery NAACP local \nyouth organization. It is one of the lesser known parts of her story \nthat the evening she was arrested she was in the process of \nrejuvenating that youth group. Her dedication to the next generation is \nthe reason she founded the Raymond and Rosa Parks Institute for Self-\nDevelopment in Detroit, MI. Her faith was tested, but it was never \nbroken. After Mrs. Parks was robbed and beaten in her own home in 1992, \nshe implored people ``not to read too much into the attack.''\n\n  ``Young people need to be taught to respect and care for their \nelders.'' she said. ``Despite the violence and crime in our society, we \nshould not let fear overwhelm us. We must remain strong. We must not \ngive up hope; we can overcome.''\n  This morning's Detroit Free Press has a wonderful story on Mrs. \nParks' life and legacy. In it, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Damon Keith, a \nlongtime friend of Mrs. Parks, recalls when another living icon of \nfreedom, Nelson Mandela, visited Detroit in 1990.\n  When he got off the plane, a long line of dignitaries was waiting to \ngreet the great man. President Mandela scanned the line until his eyes \nrested on a tiny woman. ``He chanted Rosa, Rosa, Rosa Parks,'' Judge \nKeith recalls.\n  President Mandela told Mrs. Parks that she was his inspiration during \nthe long years he was jailed on Robbins Island, and that her example \nhad inspired South Africa's freedom fighters. Later, in a 1993 speech \nto the NAACP, Nelson Mandela called Rosa Parks ``the David who \nchallenged Goliath.''\n  Ms. Johnnie Carr, Mrs. Parks' longtime friend, said Mrs. Parks always \nbelieved that the Montgomery bus boycott was ``ordained by God.'' It \nwas meant to be. But it almost did not happen. In her autobiography, \nMrs. Parks wrote that, had she not been so tired that day, she would \nhave waited for the next bus, because she would have recognized the \ndriver of the Number 7 bus as the same man who had put her off the bus \nyears earlier for refusing to board through the back door.\n  On that earlier occasion, in 1943, Mrs. Parks had just tried, \nunsuccessfully, to register to vote. Twelve years later--the morning \nafter the long Montgomery bus boycott ended--Mrs. Parks again boarded \nthe Number 7 bus, paid her fare, and took her seat in the front of the \nbus. By coincidence--or perhaps by divine design--the bus driver that \nday was the same man who had called the police to have her arrested \nmore than a year earlier. His name was James Blake. And he lived in a \nlittle town call Equality, GA.\n  The Detroit Free Press this morning quotes from one of the last \ninterviews Rosa Parks gave. A decade ago, in an interview with that \nnewspaper, Mrs. Parks was asked how she hoped to be remembered. She \nreplied, ``I'd like people to say that I'm a person that always wanted \nto be free, and wanted it not only for myself--freedom for all human \nbeings.''\n  That is a great tribute to a great lady who we remember today.\n  I yield the floor to the chairman of the committee.\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for yielding. Before \nproceeding to his amendment, I would like to commend the Senator from \nMichigan and the Senator from Illinois for their comments about the \ngreat leadership of Rosa Parks to the civil rights movement, and to \nassociate myself with those comments.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11784-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Would the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the chairman, I believe this amendment may be \nnoncontroversial. I do not know if there will be any time taken in \nopposition to the amendment.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nsubmit to Congress a plan for changing the numerical identifier used to \n      identify medicare beneficiaries under the medicare program)\n\n       After section 221, insert the following:\n       Sec. 222. Not later than June 30, 2006, the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services shall prepare and submit to \n     Congress a report outlining--\n       (1) a detailed plan for expeditiously changing the \n     numerical identifier used to identify medicare beneficiaries \n     under the medicare program so that a beneficiary's social \n     security account number is no longer displayed on the \n     identification card issued to the beneficiary under such \n     program or on any explanation of medicare benefits mailed to \n     the beneficiary; and\n       (2) the costs of implementing such plan.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, according to the Federal Trade Commission, \nidentity theft is the fastest growing crime in America, striking 27.3 \nmillion Americans who have been victims in the last 5 years. Not only \nis identity theft increasing, it is becoming more expensive.\n  Several years ago, I received a phone call from a credit agency at my \nhome in Springfield, IL. They said: Richard Durbin, we knew that we \nwould finally catch up with you.\n  I said: What are you talking about?\n  They said: It is your credit card charges with a major chain of \nstores that were incurred in Denver, CO.\n  I said: I didn't incur any credit card charges.\n  It turned out my identity had been stolen. It took some time, and I \nfinally got it straightened out, but I was one of the lucky ones.\n  Today's victims of identity theft spend an average of $1,400 in out-\nof-pocket expenses to remedy their situation, an increase of 85 percent \nfrom years past.\n  A recent survey indicates that identity theft cost Americans $52.6 \nbillion in 2004--much of it accrued by businesses forced to write-off \nfraudulent charges.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission, seniors are more \nvulnerable to fraud than other demographic groups.\n  In 2004, consumers over the age of 50 reported $152 million in fraud \nlosses to the FTC, which is likely only a small fraction of the fraud \nthat took place.\n  A Social Security number is a key for an identity thief. With it, he \nor she can open a new credit card or bank account, as well as access \nexisting accounts.\n  One of the main actions Federal, State and local governments instruct \nyou to take in protecting yourself from identity theft is guarding your \nSocial Security number.\n  Many States and local governments have gone further to protect their \ncitizens. Twelve States have passed laws restricting the use of Social \nSecurity numbers, including Illinois where private insurers are \nprohibited from using Social Security numbers as patient identifiers.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal Government continues to print Social Security \nnumbers on Medicare cards, leaving 40 million seniors with their Social \nSecurity numbers in plain sight.\n  Almost one-third of identity thieves get access to your personal \ninformation by stealing your wallet, checkbook or credit card.\n  If a senior's wallet is stolen, access to a Social Security number \nwould be simple. Just look on their Medicare card.\n  Walter Hornby from Bartlett, IL wrote to me to tell me about what he \ncalls a ``Catch-22 situation.'' After he fell victim to identity theft, \nhe was advised never to carry anything in his wallet that includes his \nSocial Security number.\n  Mr. Hornby wrote:\n\n       All Medicare cards have Social Security numbers emblazoned \n     on them in large print. I am sure many seniors carry their \n     cards with them as proof of insurance, leaving them open to \n     identity theft.\n\n  Mr. Hornby called CMS and the Social Security Administration, but was \ntold it would ``take an act of Congress to correct this situation.'' \nThat is why we are here today.\n  According to a recent poll by the AARP, most seniors agree with Mr. \nHornby. What is the percent of adults over the age of 50 who want \nSocial Security numbers to appear on various documents? They asked of \nthese seniors, How about Medicare cards? Yes, 25 percent; no, 70 \npercent. Seniors get it. They understand their vulnerability, but they \ndon't know which way to turn. You need a Medicare card if you go to a \nhospital or provider. They want to have easy access, but there sits \ntheir Social Security number which could turn out making them \nvulnerable to identity theft.\n  A reporter asked a CMS spokesperson about whether the agency plans to \nchange beneficiary identity numbers as a result of the rise of identity \ntheft from seniors, and here is what he said:\n\n       We're looking at all sorts of alternatives, but right now \n     our greatest priority is implementing the prescription drug \n     program. We\n\n[[Page S11785]]\n\n     continue to recommend treating your Social Security card like \n     a credit card.\n\n  That is a good recommendation. But if you lose your wallet or your \npurse, you know what might happen. When seniors write to CMS asking to \nhave their Social Security number removed from Medicare documents, CMS \nsends a reply:\n\n       Medicare is required to protect individual privacy and \n     confidentiality in accordance with applicable laws.\n\n  CMS is passing the buck. The buck stops here. It stops in Congress. \nWe are abiding by the current law, they say, and that is good enough. \nBut it really is not good enough.\n  Bob Filner is a Congressman from San Diego, and he is a person with \nwhom I worked and respect very much. He was attentive to this issue and \nraised it in consideration of this appropriations bill in the House. \nCongressman Filner said, in very simple and straightforward language: \nNo money can be spent on this bill to further issue these Medicare \ncards that contain Social Security numbers.\n  The amendment passed with a strong bipartisan vote. But if you look \nat it, we are afraid that perhaps it went too far--in the right \ndirection but maybe too far. The CMS said there is no way they could \ncut off immediately the issuance of these cards. So we are placed in a \ndifficult position. We know the problem, and we want to correct it. \nCutting off funds and trying to do it immediately may be something that \nis just unmanageable and cannot be achieved.\n  My amendment would require the CMS to send a report to Congress by \nthe end of next June outlining how the agency will expeditiously go \nabout changing the system of patient identifiers and how much it will \ncost. We put the CMS on notice that this is a problem they need to help \nus solve. They can't pass the buck off to another year and another year \nof possible identity theft for so many senior citizens.\n  It is time for the Federal Government to step up the fight against \nidentity theft. We have it in our power to make it much harder for \nidentity thieves who hurt our Nation's seniors, and I commend amendment \nNo. 2196, which I have introduced at this point, to all my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle and ask for their bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nIllinois is a good amendment. What has happened here is that the House-\npassed version of the bill requires the Centers for Medicaid and \nMedicare Services to remove Social Security numbers immediately in \norder to prevent identity theft. When the Senator from Illinois \noutlines the problems on identity theft, he is exactly right. The \nJudiciary Committee, on which both Senator Durbin and I sit, has \nlegislation pending now to deal with identity theft in a comprehensive \nway. But the substance of what Senator Durbin seeks is very sound.\n  CMS has advised that it is impossible to administer the House-passed \namendment in its present form, which would require immediate removal. \nThe amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois is a compromise to \nachieve greater protection against identity theft. It essentially calls \nfor a study to give us an opportunity to work it out in a way that CMS \ncan handle. I think the amendment is a good one, and it is agreeable to \nthis side of the aisle as well.\n  We are going to proceed to a vote--candidly, so we can get some focus \nof attention on this bill. Our staffs have called around to the offices \nof all Senators seeking amendments. We have a long list of prospective \namendments, but our experience has been that unless we have a vote \nwhere Senators come to the well of the Senate, which gives the managers \nan opportunity to talk to the many Senators who have stated an interest \nin offering an amendment--unless we proceed in that way, that we have \nprotracted quorum calls without any amendments being offered.\n  So as previously announced, at 10:45, by the unanimous consent \nagreement, we will proceed to a vote. Again, I repeat, it will be a 20-\nminute vote: 15 minutes under the rule, and a limited extension of 5 \nminutes.\n  We have 2 minutes until the 10:45 vote is scheduled. In the interim, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 267 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Corzine\n     Shelby\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2196) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleagues for the promptness on that vote. \nThe report was made to cut off the vote at 1 minute 6 seconds in excess \nof the 20 minutes, which is pretty good for voting in this Senate. We \nwill hold the votes to 20 minutes.\n  We have the Senator from Massachusetts lined up to offer an amendment \non Pell grants. We anticipate voting on it at 2:15, but they will have \ntime before the customary adjournment at 12:30 for the policy luncheons \nto start debate on another amendment.\n  I have talked to a number of Senators about offering an amendment if \nthat opportunity presents itself. We do want to push ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2213\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2213.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the maximum Federal Pell Grant award by $200 to \n                                $4,250)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $836,000,000 for \n     carrying out subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070). Such additional \n     appropriation shall be used to increase the maximum Pell \n     Grant for which a student shall be eligible during\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\n     award year 2006-2007 by $200 to $4,250, notwithstanding the \n     maximum Pell Grant amount provided under the heading \n     ``Student Financial Assistance'' under this title.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a very modest amendment. It is \ntargeted to a program which is a lifeline to millions of hard-working \nAmerican families in the form of education--the Pell grant. The Pell \ngrant is the major instrument by which the Federal Government provides \nhelp and assistance to needy families in this country. The median \nincome among families who benefit from the grant is about $24,000 a \nyear and the median income of independent students who receive the \ngrant is less than $13,000 per year. These families need help and \nassistance in going to college.\n  This particular amendment will raise the Pell grant from $4,050 to \n$4,250. The cost of the amendment is approximately $800 million.\n  I remind our colleagues of one of the great statements made in this \ncountry by an American Founding Father, John Adams, whose 270th \nbirthday we celebrate this week. He was the architect of the \nMassachusetts State Constitution, written in 1780. Many of the ideas \nfrom that constitution have been accepted in constitutions all over the \ncountry. The one aspect that has been replicated in every State \nconstitution is the State's commitment to educating children. It is \nsaid so well in the Massachusetts Constitution:\n\n       It will reward its patron and benefactors by shedding its \n     benign influence on the public minds. Laws for the liberal \n     education of youth, especially of the lower class of people, \n     are so extremely wise and useful that to a humane and \n     generous mind no expense for this purpose would be thought \n     extravagant.\n\n  That is what this amendment says. We are saying this Nation, at this \ntime, cannot afford to lose these young minds. We have 400,000 young \nAmericans who are qualified and would be accepted to 4-year colleges on \nthe basis of their academic records if they had the resources to be \nable to attend. It is an indictment of our Nation if we fail to provide \nthese young people with an opportunity to receive an education, \nparticipate in our society, and give something back to our country. We \ncannot afford to lose them. The Pell grant is the indispensable link \nbetween these families and an education.\n  This Nation has always responded when challenged in the areas of \neducation. In response to the Industrial Revolution, we made a national \ncommitment to expand access to high schools, and America prospered. It \nwas an extraordinary commitment and has made an extraordinary \ndifference in the success of this Nation, both commercially and \nmilitarily.\n  At the time of World War II, we had 12 to 14 million Americans who \nserved--many for 3, 5, 6, 7 years--in the Armed Forces of our country. \nWhen they returned, President Roosevelt offered the GI bill. That would \nopen the doors of opportunity for education. For all who came back from \nWorld War II, who had been out fighting for our Nation, they would have \nthe benefits of an education. By the millions, they took advantage of \nthe GI bill.\n  In reviewing the investment made by this Government, the figures show \nfor every $1 invested in education, it was returned seven times by \nthose who received or benefitted from the GI bill. We extended \neducation benefits in the time of the Vietnam war. Also, when \nchallenged technologically in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik--we had a \nRepublican President, Democratic Congress--we recognized the need to \ndramatically improve math and science achievement in this country. We \npassed the National Defense Education Act to strengthen both our \nnational security and our global competitiveness, and the Federal \ninvestment in education doubled, with a strong focus on math and \nscience education.\n  At that time the Federal Government was spending 5 cents out of every \n$1 on education. Now we are at 1\\1/2\\ cents, and going south. Do we \nunderstand that? Only 1\\1/2\\ cents out of every Federal dollar is spent \non education, and we are going, effectively, south. I think this is not \nthe kind of priority the American people expect and the American people \nwant. This is a very modest amendment, especially against that \nbackground. The amendment raises the maximum Pell grant by $200.\n  Let me first show what has happened to the Pell grant over the period \nof recent years. Some of us remember the great debates we had in the \n1960s. One of the principal issues in the 1960 campaign was: Should we \nprovide help and assistance to young people in the form of education? \nThat was heavily debated in the Presidential debates at that time. A \njudgment and decision was made when the votes were in and President \nKennedy won. One of the first things he did was submit a higher \neducation bill, which was eventually passed in 1965.\n  There was a great debate at that time: Should we provide help and \nassistance to the child or should we provide help and assistance to the \nuniversity? The decision was made that we would provide it to the young \nstudent so the student would have the flexibility to be able to go to \nthe college of their choice.\n  In 1965, when the higher education bill was passed, the Federal \nfunding for education was close to 80 percent in grants and 20 percent \nin loans, for students who qualified for grants. Those were families in \nthe lowest income bracket. The Pell grant was used extensively and \nbenefitted millions of young people.\n  This chart shows what has happened with the Pell grant between 1985 \nand 2005. It shows the shrinking buying power of the Pell grant over \nthe past 20 years. We find that during the 1985-1986 school year the \nmaximum Pell grant covered 57 percent of the cost of attendance at a 4-\nyear public institution. We see, as the cost of education has gone up, \nthat the purchasing power of the Pell grant has steadily declined. In \nthe 2005-2006 school year the maximum grant covers only 33 percent of \nthe cost of college attendance.\n  Look at this. This is a chart that shows the gap between the maximum \nPell grant and the cost of attending college, which continues to \nincrease. This is a reflection of the gradual increase in tuition over \nthe recent years, from 2001 and 2002 up to 2005 and 2006. This shows \nthe gap--now nearly $8,100. Here, this green line shows the maximum \nPell grant which has been effectively stable during that period of \ntime, while the cost of attending a 4-year public college has been \ngoing up and up and up, putting enormous pressure on these families who \nhave limited opportunities and resources.\n  The Federal Government provides Pell grants. It provides Stafford \nloans. States and local communities also provide help and assistance to \nstudents. Here is an indication of what is happening in our States. \nThis chart reflects the State and local funding per full-time student \nat public institutions, which has declined some 16 percent since 2001.\n  What all of this says is that the purchasing power of the Pell grant \nhas gone down. There are hundreds of thousands of children who are not \ngoing to college because they are unable to afford it. We have seen \nthat the help and assistance given to needy students has dropped at the \nState and local levels, but the costs have been continuing to go higher \nand higher.\n  This amendment requires a judgment and decision about a nation's \npriorities: whether we believe, as a nation, in the importance of \nsupporting education and making education available to all young \npeople, and for which we are prepared to support this very modest \nincrease.\n  It is useful to make a judgment based upon what we think we need here \nin the United States. But it is also relevant to get some idea about \nwhat is happening in other countries that are increasingly competing \nwith the American economy. Here is an example. The numbers of \nengineering graduates in China and India far outpace that of the United \nStates. In China, it is 600,000; in India, 350,000; in the United \nStates, 70,000, and many of these are foreign students who, more likely \nthan not, will be returning to their home countries.\n  We cannot expect to have a first-rate economy with a second-rate \neducational system. It does not work that way. Not only will we not \nhave a first-rate economy, but we will not have a first-rate military \nwith a second-rate educational system.\n  This is not going to be the answer to all of our problems in terms of \neducation. Later in the debate we consider other amendments to increase \nsupport for education and to improve math and science achievement. But \nthis amendment is essential to ensuring every\n\n[[Page S11787]]\n\nAmerican has an opportunity to go to college.\n  Fewer and fewer good jobs are available for those without a college \neducation. When I first came to the Senate, the greatest employer down \nin Quincy, Massachusetts was the Quincy Shipyard. I would say 90 \npercent of those workers had a high school education. They had a pretty \ngood middle-class life. They worked hard. They got some time off to \nspend with their families. More often than not, they would be able to \ntake a couple weeks with their children over the course of the \nsummertime. There was a great sense of community. There was great \ninvolvement in all of the activities in the community, and people were \nable to make a very decent and good living, just as their parents had, \nworking at that Quincy Fore River Shipyard.\n  Generally speaking, if you look back 40 or 45 years ago, an \nindividual had one job. More often than not, they kept that job their \nwhole life. Now we know that workers entering the workforce today will \nhave eight or nine different jobs during their lifetimes. Investing in \neducation and continuing training has to be a lifelong national \ncommitment.\n\n  This particular amendment is focused on those who are just entering \nthe educational process after they get out of high school and those who \nare from low-income families. We need the skills of those young people. \nWe cannot, as a nation, afford to let those skills go untapped. We \ncannot effectively write off a whole segment of our Nation because it's \ntoo expensive to go on into higher education. And too often, that is \nwhat is happening.\n  We have all seen the statistics about the increased cost of gasoline, \nthe increased cost of prescription drugs, the increased cost of energy, \nparticularly in my part of the country. We have talked about that and \ndebated it here in the last few weeks.\n  But we have also seen at other times that those in the basic middle \nincome, even though they have seen very dramatic increases in \nproductivity, in what they have been able to produce, have not seen a \nsignificant increase in their wages or in their family income over the \nperiod of these past years. That is a fact. That has been a reality. So \nthere is increasing pressure.\n  We find out that even for those families who are able to patch \ntogether the means to get to college, even with the Pell grants today, \nmore often than not, it takes the average family--even with their \nlimited ability to borrow--over 20 years to pay back those loans that \nwere needed to meet the cost of getting their child into higher \neducation.\n  We are trying to say to Americans, to children of hard-working \nAmerican people, that we recognize that education is a key to \nopportunity in this country. Our chart demonstrates the difference \nbetween the lifetime earnings of individuals with college degrees and \nthose without them $1 million over a lifetime.\n  A key value in our society is fairness. The reality is, we, as a \ncountry, can well afford--in the richest nation in the world--to offer \na helping hand to those who have limited incomes in the form of Pell \ngrants. So this is an issue of fairness. It is an issue of opportunity.\n  It is also a question of competitiveness. If we do not have a solid \neducational system, we are not going to be a first-rate nation \ncommercially or militarily. At a time when we are feeling the \nincreasing forces of world competition, we see what is happening in \nother countries. Now we are not just exporting blue-collar jobs out of \nthe heartland of our Nation; we are finding, increasingly, that high-\ntech jobs are not only moving out, but that many of our high-tech \nindustries are moving out to take advantage of the training and \neducation in other countries, particularly in India, and other places \nin the world.\n  So it is about fairness. It is about opportunity. It is about \ncompetition.\n  Finally, as I mentioned, it is about national security. We need to \nhave in our military the best-trained, best-led troops. But they also \nneed the best in terms of technology. This requires well-trained and \neducated personnel. Unless we have a talented pool of college \ngraduates, our military, our intelligence community, all of our \nemployers, and our Nation are going to suffer. And we won't have that \ntalented pool unless we provide opportunities for our young people. \nThis amendment takes a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, $200 does not sound like a lot when we are talking \nabout the billions of dollars in this budget. But today we know that a \n$200 increase in student aid would mean that hundreds of thousands of \nstudents would be able to afford college. Two hundred dollars does not \nsound like a lot, but it is a lot to low-income families. It is a lot \nfor millions of working families, as they are looking at their bills \nand trying to make adjustments and trying to make college a priority. \nIt is a lot, and it is something we ought to respond to in this \nparticular appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, in offering an amendment to increase the \nmaximum Pell grant award by $200. If approved, this amendment would \nresult in a $4,250 maximum Pell grant--an amount well below what is \nneeded, but still important in addressing the crisis of lack of college \naffordability.\n  The College Board reports that students in the college class of 2010 \nwill pay more, on average, for their post-secondary education than any \nother class in American history. The average 4-year private school now \ncosts $21,235 each year and the average 4-year public institution costs \n$5,491 a year. And every year college costs are increasing at a rate \nfaster than inflation. Last year the Consumer Price Index increased by \n5.2 percent. But the cost of private 4-year schools went up 5.9 percent \nand public schools went up 7.1 percent.\n  A Pell grant increase is a step in the right direction to make \ncollege more affordable. Over the last few decades, college financial \naid simply hasn't kept up with the rising cost of attendance. Twenty \nyears ago, in the 1985-1986 school year, the maximum Federal Pell grant \ncovered nearly 60 percent of the cost of the tuition, fees, room, and \nboard of a 4-year public university. Today the maximum Pell grant \ncovers less than 40 percent of those costs. More students take out \nloans and more are falling into debt. Fifty percent of today's college \nstudents graduate in debt, owing an average of $15,500. Many students \nowe even more. At Pace University in New York, 55 percent of students \ngraduate owing an average $28,695. At New York University the debtloads \nare alarmingly similar. And at Hartwick College, nestled in the \nfoothills of the Catskills Mountains, 72 percent of students graduate \nowing an average of $31,206, the second heaviest student debt-burden of \nany liberal arts college in the Nation.\n  Over the next 6 months, students in America's high school class of \n2006 will decide whether or not to go to college. We need to make sure \nthat students can afford college, not frighten them with a mountain of \ndebt.\n  More and more, a college degree is essential in our modern economy. \nAnd helping students pay for college pays for itself. According to the \nCollege Board, the average college graduate earns 73 percent more over \nhis or her lifetime than the average high school graduate. College \ngraduates pay 78 percent more in taxes to public coffers, and they are \nless likely to draw on public resources for programs like unemployment \ninsurance, food stamps, and welfare. College graduates are less likely \nto be incarcerated, and more likely to volunteer in their communities, \nmore likely to vote, more likely to raise kids ready for school, and \nmore likely to start businesses that create jobs.\n  We need to make sure every student who wants to go can afford \ncollege. It's good social policy to make higher education affordable, \nit's good economic policy, and it's good budgetary policy. Increasing \nthe maximum Pell grant is an essential part of making college \naffordable. So, again, I want to thank Senator Kennedy for raising this \ncritical issue and working with me to offer this amendment and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nKennedy amendment. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment, which will \nincrease the maximum Pell grant by $200--increasing the current $4,050 \nmaximum award to $4,250. This modest increase is crucial to our efforts \nto ensure equality of access to higher education for all students.\n\n[[Page S11788]]\n\n  The Pell Grant program is the largest need-related post-secondary \nstudent grant program administered by the Department of Education. \nHowever, for three consecutive years the maximum award has remained \nstagnant, accounting for less than 40 percent of the costs of attending \na public, four year institution. Pell grant recipients have a median \nfamily income of only $15,200, so these grants truly target the most \nneedy students. This amendment would provide an additional $10 million \nin need based aid to Wisconsin and give 1,360 new students the \nopportunity to make the dream of higher education a reality. Our \nNation's well-being depends on our ability to provide greater access to \nhigher education, regardless of financial means. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this important amendment and provide the funding that our \nstudents need to succeed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator yields back.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have listened to the presentation by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, and I do not disagree with anything he \nsaid. When he talks about the need for more education funding, I agree \nwith him. When he talks about the importance for the productivity of \nthe United States on the economics sphere, when he talks about the \nimportance of education for military preparedness, he makes very valid \npoints. And when he talks about fairness, those are very important \nconsiderations.\n  I applaud the work he has done in the field of education over his \nvery distinguished career. He served for many years as chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and now he \nis the ranking member. He has addressed these issues of education \nfunding year in and year out with logic and passion.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, the job I have, and \nour subcommittee does, and that of our excellent staff, is to make \nallocations, with a budget of $145 billion, as to where we are going to \nallocate the money.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has asked for an increase of $836 \nmillion, but there is no offset. That means he has not found something \nin a budget of $145 billion which would pay for his amendment which \nwould increase Pell grants by $836 million. I would like to increase \nPell grants by $836 million myself. The fact is, I would like to \nincrease them by more than that, if I could make the allocation. But \nthe subcommittee is limited by what its allocation is and what the \nbudget resolution provides. That is $145 billion to allocate among all \nthe education programs sponsored by the Federal Government, all of the \nhealth programs sponsored by the Federal Government, all of the \nprograms of the Department of Labor, and about $10, $11 billion on \nrelated agencies.\n  It is important to note that this budget contains $812 million over \nlast year's budget. So that in looking at the Pell grants and in coming \nto a total figure of $13.177 billion, a very significant increase of \n$812 million over last year which is hard to find in this budget. But \nthat is as far as we could stretch to provide the money.\n  When you talk about Pell grants, this has been a very high priority \nitem for this Senator. I took over the chairmanship of the subcommittee \nafter Republicans took control of the Senate in 1994. In 1995, the Pell \ngrant awards were $2,340. We have increased them every year: from \n$2,340 in 1995 to $2,470 in 1996; to $2,700 in 1997; to $3,000 in 1998; \nto $3,125 in 1999; to $3,300 in the year 2000; $3,750 in 2001; $4,000 \nin 2002, and $4,050 in 2003. We had to maintain it at the same level in \n2004; in 2005, the same. That is where we stand. We had to allocate \nlast year $4.3 billion to pay off an estimated shortfall in the Pell \ngrants. So we have paid a lot of attention to Pell grants and have put \nthis on a very high priority basis.\n  There are quite a number of other programs in our education budget \nwhich are directed to the same kinds of considerations so eloquently \narticulated by the Senator from Massachusetts. Student loans are a very \nbig point. This is well known. I think it is worth noting that the new \nstudent loan volume for 2006 fiscal year is in excess of $62 billion, \nwhich is $10 billion over the amount which was available in fiscal year \n2004.\n  It is also important to note that there are a number of other \nprograms which are directed to the same beneficiaries who are \nrecipients of the Pell grants. We have, for example, $805 million for \nthe Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant program, which is an \nincrease of $26 million. We have $66 million for loan cancellations. \nThe Perkins loan program supports more than $1 billion in low-interest \nloans to undergraduate students, and there is funding for loan \ncancellations. We have $990 million in the Federal Work-Study Program. \nWe have over $65 million for Leveraging Education Assistant Partnership \nprograms. We have quite a number of programs.\n  Tax credits and deductions in 2006 are valued at a savings of $3.2 \nbillion for students and families through the HOPE Scholarship tax \ncredit; $2.1 billion under the Lifetime Learning Credit; $1.8 billion \nfor the above-the-line deduction on higher education expenses; and $810 \nmillion in deductions for interest paid on student loans.\n  These are a variety of programs which are targeted and directed at \npeople who need help, who have loans, who can't pay their loans. None \nof that is to say that the Pell grants are not vital and that we \nwouldn't be in a preferable position nationally if we had the funds to \nincrease the Pell grants.\n  If the Senator from Massachusetts or anyone has any idea as to how to \nstretch these dollars further, I am interested to hear. If anybody has \nan idea of increasing funding in any particular line as a priority over \nsome of the other $145 billion we have in this bill, I would be \ninterested to hear and weigh that too. But on the basis of this record, \nwe have stretched the dollars as far as we can. As much as I agree with \neverything the Senator from Massachusetts has said, and as much as I \nwould like to raise the Pell grants, the budget resolution does not \ngive me, as chairman, the discretion to do so.\n  For the edification of anybody who may be watching on C-SPAN 2, \nlistening to this debate--and I have at least a few relatives \nlistening--the next movement is to raise a point of order, although \nthis may not be the appropriate time with further debate to take place. \nBut I do think it is in order now to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest which will formalize the informal agreement which Senator \nKennedy and I arrived at earlier for 2:15 vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Kennedy amendment on Pell grants; provided \nfurther, that there be 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to \nthat vote and that no second degree be in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We may consume all the time until 12:30, but there is a \npossibility that we may not. So if any other Senator has an amendment \nto offer, I urge that Senator to come to the floor at this time so that \nwe can utilize all of the floor time for debate on this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from New Hampshire on \nthe floor. As I understand, he wanted to be able to offer amendments.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would not upset the current situation. I am glad to \nyield to him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2214\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, as the Senator from Massachusetts \nindicated, I would like to rise very briefly to offer two amendments \nand then allow the Senator from Massachusetts to continue with the \nremarks on his own amendment. I will offer a few remarks, but hopefully \nwe can work out the issues that might exist on these two amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside that \nI might call up amendment No. 2214.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2214.\n\n\n[[Page S11789]]\n\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the funding of the Low-Vision Rehabilitation \n                    Services Demonstration Project)\n\n       After section 221, insert the following:\n       Sec. 222. For carrying out the Low-Vision Rehabilitation \n     Services Demonstration Project by the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, an additional $5,000,000: Provided, That \n     funds made available for general department management under \n     the heading General Department Management under the heading \n     Office of the Secretary are reduced by $5,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, this amendment calls for $5 million to be \nallocated to a vision rehabilitation therapy demonstration program \nunder Medicare. It is an amendment that is fully offset. This is a \ndemonstration program that was established under report language \ncrafted by Chairman Specter last year. This is an opportunity to give \nseniors additional independence by helping to cover some of the cost of \nvision rehabilitation therapy for those who have vision impairment. It \nhelps them to do the very basic things of getting around their home, \ngetting outside the home, doing errands. By maintaining this \nindependence by dealing with vision problems, we reduce the risk of \ninjury and the costs of injuries associated with vision impairment.\n  As I indicated, it is offset. It is an existing program. This \nadditional $5 million in funding would ensure that the demonstration is \nconducted across a number of States, a number of cities, so that CMS \nhas the data it needs to judge the efficacy of the program.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2215\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendments aside, and I call up amendment No. 2215.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2215.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To increase funding for community health centers)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Amounts appropriated in this title for community \n     health center programs under section 330 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) shall be increased by \n     $198,560,000. Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, amounts appropriated under this Act shall be reduced on \n     a pro rata basis by $198,560,000.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, this second amendment deals with community \nhealth center funding. Community health centers have been supported \nbroadly in Congress and very broadly by the administration. What this \namendment does is bring the appropriate level of funding for community \nhealth centers in this bill up to the level requested by the President. \nLess than 25 percent of the applications for new community health \ncenters were funded last year. That indicates a need for continued \nsignificant levels of funding.\n  Health centers are the first line of defense for those who are served \nby Medicaid, for those without insurance, and for those who are \nunderinsured. Community health centers provide a very strong, \ncompetent, qualified level of service. They are absolutely instrumental \nin today's health care environment.\n  This brings the funding up to the President's requested level. It is \noffset so it is not subject to a point of order. This bill is about \nsetting priorities. I respect the challenges the chairman and the \nmembers of the subcommittee have to deal with in setting priorities. It \nis never easy. I provide a fractional across-the-board reduction to \nsupport this additional $200 million, but I am certainly willing to \nwork with the chairman and members of the subcommittee to find another \nappropriate offset. I hope he and the Members of the Senate will \nsupport my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor coming to the floor to offer these amendments to move the bill \nalong.\n  His amendment for $198.5 million for community health centers is \ncertainly directed to a good program. These are very important health \ncenters which are of great assistance to the American people. In the \nallocations of the funding, we have allocated for the next fiscal year \nin excess of $2 billion, $2,037,871,000. The figure I gave was the \nrequest, but the allocation is $1,839,311,000, which is an increase of \n$105 million over last year. Similar to the considerations on the \namendment by the Senator from Massachusetts, the subcommittee and the \nfull Appropriations Committee have given deliberation to the various \npriorities and believe this is the right figure.\n  It is a customary approach to suggest an across-the-board cut. If you \nfractionalize it, it comes out to a small figure. But still, it is \nimportant. It comes out of the National Institutes of Health. It comes \nout of the Centers for Disease Control. It comes out of many programs \nwhich are, I am at a loss as to whether to say, barely adequately \nfunded or underfunded or not sufficiently funded, but they can't spare \nthe money. This is a matter of priorities. When the Senator from New \nHampshire says he would be glad to consider some other offset, I would \nbe pleased to work with him on another offset. But in order to have \nanother offset from some other allocation, there has to be proof and a \nshowing that adding $198.5 million for community health centers is more \nimportant to America than where we have allocated it. And we have not \npicked these figures with a dartboard, Mr. President. We haven't pulled \nthem out of the air. There has been laborious effort going through the \nhistory of these programs--how many we have, what we can cut, what we \ncan add to. It is balanced off against many factors, including the Pell \ngrants we heard about. So that it is necessary to oppose the amendment, \nas much as I would like to see more money in community health centers \nand many other lines.\n\n  With respect to the effort to add $5 million to the rehabilitation \nvision amendment, that, again, is another good amendment, but, again, \nit is a matter of allocation and where we will get the money. The \nSenator from New Hampshire would like to discuss the matter further. I \nthink that is always useful, and I am prepared to undertake that to see \nif some accommodation can be made short of an outright opposition to \nthe vote. So we will pursue that.\n  I do thank him for coming to the floor early in this debate and \nadvancing ideas to help us move the bill along, and that inspires me to \nask 1 of his 97 colleagues, aside from the 3 of us who are in the \nChamber now, to come to the floor with other amendments so we can keep \nthis bill moving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2213\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing be added as cosponsors of my amendment: Senators Clinton, \nSchumer, Lieberman, Mikulski, Kerry, Reid of Nevada, Lautenberg, \nDayton, Cantwell, Kohl, Bingaman, and Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania. He has worked hard in terms of prioritizing education, \nand certainly it has been a priority of his service in the Senate and \nalso on the Appropriations Committee. I appreciate that kind of \ncommitment, but he tells us that we only have a given amount of \nresources to allocate.\n  The Senate voted to add $5.4 billion to the Budget Act. When we voted \non that issue earlier this year, it was $5.4 billion more for \neducation--for education. That was one of the few amendments that \npassed when we had the debate on the Budget Act--$5.4 billion more for \neducation. And when the\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\nbudget came back, it did not come back with that $5.4 billion. The \nHouse had no increase for this purpose. The conference committee did \nnot split the difference and come back with half. They came back with \nzero. But a majority of the Members of this body voted for that \nincrease. Now we have another chance, and here we are just asking for \n$200 per Pell grant for the neediest students in the country.\n  The Senate, when it had its opportunity on the budget, supported a \nvery enhanced funding level for higher education, but it went over to \nthe Budget Committees behind closed doors and came out with zero. So he \nis right. In this particular budget that he has been allocated there is \nnot the flexibility to very substantially enhance support for \neducation; nonetheless, I think this amendment reflects the priorities \nof the Senate in the earlier part of the year and reflects the \npriorities of the American people.\n  I am reminded that it isn't just the families who are affected. It \nisn't just the education community. The business community also \nstrongly supports increased access to higher education. Business \nleaders agree that education is essential to our competitiveness. \nListen to what the Committee for Economic Development says in a recent \nreport:\n\n       Education has been a major source of productivity growth in \n     the United States during the postwar era. Education increases \n     productive human capital, which in turn contributes to \n     overall increases in economic growth. Increases in a \n     country's average level of educational attainment by 1 year \n     can generate sizable increases in the annual economic growth, \n     as much as 6 to 16 percent.\n\n  Look at what happens, Mr. President. Low income students enroll in \ncollege at less than half the rate of their high-income peers. These \nare students who are qualified for college--who worked hard, took \nrigorous courses and prepared for college. And once they enroll, only 6 \npercent of those low-income students receive a BA compared to 40 \npercent of those in the higher income levels. We are talking about \nchildren with comparable levels of academic achievement. Why is this \nhappening? They are equally qualified students, but they have to leave \ncollege because of financial need. That is what this amendment is \naddressing. It is a question of priorities. We have the vote. If we are \nable to get the votes on the floor of the Senate, this will happen. \nThis must be a priority.\n  It certainly is for Natalie from Turners Falls, MA, a single mother \nenrolled in college for the first time, who always lived below the \nFederal poverty line. She writes that without Pell grants ``I would be \nstuck in this way of life with no `light' to look forward to. . . . \nKnowledge is power and education is key.''\n  It certainly is for Mary Susan from Sacramento, CA, who went to \ncollege and became a teacher. She writes: I would not have been able to \ngo to college to become a teacher if I didn't have a Pell grant. I have \nbeen telling students at the low-income school I work at that they can \ngo to college, too, if they study hard and get good grades. But if the \nPell grants are not available, many will not be able to go to college.\n\n  Sara from Pensacola, FL, received Pell grants when she was a single \nmother enrolled in community college and later a 4-year college. She \nreceived her BA in English and is now employed making four times the \nincome she made before earning her degree.\n  She writes: The Pell grant saw me through college. Without it, there \nwas no way I could afford to go to school. The Pell grant works.\n  Yvonne from Port Richey, FL, served in the Air Force, then held a \ncivilian job which she lost after September 11. She is now a single \nmother back in school. She writes: If it were not for the Pell grants I \nwould not be able to return to school and be retrained for a new \ncareer.\n  Jen from Denver, CO, writes: The only way I was able to attend \ncollege was with grants and loans. Sixty thousand dollars later I have \na college degree. Obviously, with loans this high I was not fortunate \nto have parental help. The $2,000 a year I received from the Pell grant \nwas substantial even though so little. To take this away from students \nis a tragedy. Cutting funding for education of any kind is wrong.\n  That is a person with a very modest Pell grant. You see what a \ndifference a few dollars makes.\n  Scott in Georgia received Pell grants during college, which helped \nhim put himself through college. He writes: Pell grants gave me the \nability to focus more on school and work less part-time hours. I am \nextremely grateful that the Pell grant ensured that I didn't make any \nbrash decisions based on lack of finances.\n  I am sure the Senator from Pennsylvania has had the same experience I \nhave had. You go to so many of these community colleges where these \nPell grants offer the opportunity for students, and during the break \ntime students--instead of talking about their books, instead of talking \nabout lectures--are talking about their next job or where they are \ngoing to get the next job and what it is like to be working in that \nparticular job. That is what is happening increasingly as our young \ngifted, talented people are being constantly squeezed. Our country is \nbecoming more divided between the haves and have-nots. The Pell grant, \nwhich has been the key to opportunity, has always been something that \nhas kept the door constantly open for so many young people.\n  As I say, it is the key to opportunity. It is the key to \ncompetitiveness, the key to national security. And it is the real key \nto fairness. Education ought to have a very special place in our \nnational priorities.\n  I appreciate what the chairman has done in the area of education, but \nit does seem to me that the Senate as a whole should reflect that kind \nof high priority by ensuring expansive opportunities so our young \npeople who have gifts and talents are able to get into school--public \nand private universities, community colleges, and others--and they are \nable to be a part of the American dream.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, just by way of a very brief comment as to \nthe contentions raised by the Senator from Massachusetts, I recall his \namendment on the budget resolution for $5 billion. I recall it very \nwell because I voted for it. As I recollect it--we are checking the \nrecord now--it was a one-vote margin. There was considerable \nconsternation about not having that amendment go to conference. I \nstayed with the Senator from Massachusetts on the $5 billion because I \nshare his concern for education. And then it went to conference, as our \nprocedures moved it through, and it was dropped. So Senator Kennedy's \n$5 billion with which I agreed is not there anymore. And if it were \nthere, we would have a good bit more money to add to the Pell grants. \nIf I could find more money for the Pell grants, I would like to. If we \ncould replay the cards of what happened on the $5 billion, I would like \nto do that, too. But I am confronted with a situation where I have an \nallocation that came through the process of the Senate, and I have to \nwork within that framework. The priorities are established as best we \ncan.\n  I think it is appropriate now for Senators who have the floor--we are \ngoing to vote at 2:15--to raise the point of order so it is on the \nrecord.\n  Mr. President, in anticipation of the vote at 2:15 for purposes of \nthe record, I do raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, as amended, that the amendment provides \nbudget authority and outlays in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation under the fiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution on the \nbudget and therefore is not in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act \nof 1974 I move to waive the applicable section of the Budget Act in \nreference to the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have 33 minutes between now and the \ntime of our policy luncheons when it is our practice to adjourn, so I \nwould encourage my colleagues to come to the\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\nfloor to offer an amendment. In the absence of any other Senator in the \nChamber seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n              Timeframe for U.S. Military Mission in Iraq\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to give three \nspeeches on the floor so far about issues concerning the fight against \nterrorism globally and the relationship of the Iraq war to that \nstruggle and that battle.\n  Today, I come to the floor to talk about why I think we need a \ntimeframe for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. I do not mean a \nrigid timetable, nor do I mean a timetable that is not connected to \nclear and achievable benchmarks. But what we do need is a public, \nflexible, realistic timetable that will tell people when and how we \nexpect to finish the military mission in Iraq.\n  As my colleagues may know, I have suggested a target date of December \n31, 2006, the end of next year, for the completion of our military \nmission. Today, I want to talk a little bit about why a flexible \ntimetable for withdrawal will help make the U.S. stronger and our \nenemies weaker.\n  Some have argued that a timetable is designed to appeal to the \nAmerican public, that it has no relationship to our security or to our \nachieving policy goals in Iraq. Actually, it is just the opposite. I \nproposed a timeframe because I think it has everything to do with \nimproving our national security strategy.\n  Our fundamental national security goal must be to combat the global \nterrorist networks that attacked and continue to threaten the United \nStates. An increasing number of military experts and members of the \npublic have concluded that our military presence in Iraq is not \nconsistent with that goal and that it is, in fact, undermining that \ngoal. I think it has become increasingly clear that we have created a \nbreeding ground for terrorism in Iraq and that the apparent indefinite \npresence of tens of thousands of U.S. troops is often fueling, not \ndampening, the insurgency in that country.\n  Melvin Laird, a former Republican Congressman from my State of \nWisconsin, who was the Defense Secretary under Richard Nixon, said:\n\n       We owe it to the rest of the people back home to let them \n     know there is an exit strategy. And more important, we owe it \n     to the Iraqi people. Our presence is what feeds the \n     insurgency. And our gradual withdrawal would feed the \n     confidence and the ability of average Iraqis to stand up to \n     the insurgents.\n\n  GEN George Casey, the commanding general of the allied forces in \nIraq, made a similar point in testimony to Congress last month. He \ntestified that:\n\n     . . . getting Iraqis into leading the counterinsurgency \n     effort as they are capable will allow us to gradually reduce \n     the visibility of coalition forces across Iraq and, \n     ultimately, as conditions warrant, to begin to reduce our \n     presence in Iraq, taking away an element that fuels the \n     insurgency; that is, the perception of occupation.\n\n  He went on to call reducing the visibility and presence of coalition \nforces a key element of our overall counterinsurgency strategy.\n  Melvin Laird and General Casey know that our presence has fed this \ninsurgence, making it easy for the insurgents to convince new recruits \nthat we are there to stay.\n  Mr. President, I know, you know--we all know--that is not the fault \nof our men and women in uniform who are serving courageously; it is the \nfault of the administration for sending them into battle without a \nclearly defined or well-thought-out mission.\n  In February, I asked one of the top allied commanders in Iraq when I \nwas there in the Green Zone what would happen if we suggested to the \nworld that there is a timeframe for achieving our military \nmission. This is what I asked him. His response to me, which of course \nwas off the record, was that, ``nothing would take the wind out of the \nsails of the insurgents more'' than providing a clear public plan and \ntimeframe for a remaining U.S. mission.\n\n  The President himself in June told the Nation that he did not support \nputting more troops into Iraq because, he said, ``sending more \nAmericans would suggest that we intend to stay forever.''\n  Even the President has acknowledged the problem with feeding the \ninsurgency if it appears our presence there is permanent, or ever \nexpanding. I think that same logic applies to the President's refusal \nto issue a public timetable.\n  To the extent that we do not explain what our military goals in Iraq \nare and when we hope to achieve them, we are playing into the hands of \nthe insurgents. The insurgents are motivated by our presence and they \nfeed off conspiracy theories and suspicions regarding American \nintentions. And, of course, our brave service-members and their \nfamilies deserve some clarity about how long they are likely to remain \nin Iraq.\n\n  The President is one of an ever-narrowing group of people who believe \nthat a timetable works against our goals in Iraq. Military experts, \npeople I talked to in Iraq, and the American people increasingly agree \nthat the administration's refusal to even suggest a timetable for \nmeeting our military goals in Iraq is feeding the insurgency.\n  The lack of a timetable doesn't just feed the insurgency, it also \ndiscourages Iraqi ownership of their own political process. By making \nit clear that the U.S. will not be there indefinitely, we will help the \nIraqis move toward the real political independence they need and dispel \nsome of the cynicism about American intentions that empowers some of \nthe more extreme elements of Iraqi society.\n  Finally, a timetable is important because it enables us to devote \nmore resources to the other national security issues that demand our \nattention. To fight the global terrorist networks that threaten the \nU.S., we need to focus energy and resources on countering emerging \nterrorist tactics, dealing with the threat of ``loose nukes,'' and \nrepairing the damage to our Army, to name just a few urgent priorities. \nDrawing down U.S. troops in Iraq will allow us to focus on these \npriorities. It is time to make sure that our Iraq policy is advancing, \nnot undermining, our national security goals.\n  The administration and its allies have offered various arguments as \nto why they can't or won't come up with a clear plan and timeline for \nmilitary success in Iraq.\n  One argument has been that the U.S. pullouts from Somalia in the \n1990s and Lebanon in the 1980s emboldened terrorists and others who \noppose American interests. To pull out of Iraq without having put down \nthe Iraqi insurgency once and for all would supposedly be another sign \nof American weakness.\n  But our decisions about national security shouldn't be made based on \nconjecture about the ``message'' that some might perceive. No one, \nincluding the Bush administration, can know how the insurgents in Iraq \nmight feel about the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. We do know, \nhowever, that right now we are making the insurgency stronger with our \nindefinite presence in Iraq, and our failure to articulate a timetable \nfor military withdrawal. We also know that our commitment of \nresources--money, troops, time--to Iraq is detracting from our ability \nto focus on our most pressing national security goals and stretching \nour military to the breaking point. Terrorists will not feel \nparticularly emboldened about us putting our Iraq policy on track so \nthat we can focus our attention on eliminating them. The President \nsuggests that if he issues a timetable for how long he expects U.S. \ntroops to remain in Iraq, our enemies will think that we are weak. But \nwithout a plan to finish our military mission, our enemies will know \nthat we have fallen into a trap and we can't figure out how to get out. \nThat is what they will know if we do not apply some common sense to \nthis situation.\n  When I pressed Secretary Rice on the need for a timetable last week, \nshe responded that ``we'd like our discussions of withdrawal and of \nbringing down the numbers of forces to be results-based rather than \ntime-based.'' But of course a timetable should be results-based. As I \nhave said over and over, any timetable needs to be flexible and needs \nto be tied to achievable benchmarks. The point is to have some idea of \nwhen\n\n[[Page S11792]]\n\nthose benchmarks, those results, can be achieved. Without such a \ntimetable, and without clear, realistic benchmarks. we cannot hold \nourselves accountable for meeting our goals. Nor can we give our troops \nand the American people the clarity they deserve about their mission.\n  The Bush administration, with all these arguments, has succeeded in \none thing: in intimidating people into not uttering the words \n``timetable,'' or ``timeframe,'' or ``target date'' for finishing the \nmilitary mission. But with the words of Republicans like Melvin Laird \nand military leaders like General Casey, more and more people \nunderstand that having a flexible timetable will strengthen our \nnational security. This is not a timetable where the objective is troop \nwithdrawal, the objective is to focus on our national security needs \nand the timetable is one step towards that goal. A timetable is not \nabout domestic politics--it's about undercutting insurgency recruiting \nand unity, encouraging more Iraqi ownership and responsibility, and \ncreating space for other important U.S. national security efforts.\n  I again emphasize that the timeframe I have proposed is a flexible \none--not a drop-dead date, not a deadline, not a formula for ``cut and \nrun.'' It is linked with a call for more clarity about what we want the \nU.S. military to achieve in Iraq.\n  Please note that I am only referring to a timeframe for the military \nmission in Iraq, not for our broader political and other missions in \nIraq. We all understand that our engagement in Iraq will not end with \nthe U.S. military mission. We will still have a great deal of tough \ndiplomatic work to do in Iraq well after the bulk of U.S. troops leave, \nand probably some serious security cooperation as well.\n  We will continue to devote resources to Iraq, without a doubt. But as \nit stands today, we have focused on Iraq to the exclusion of critically \nimportant national security priorities. And we have done so at great \ncost to the outstanding men and women of the U.S. military, and to \ntheir families. When I speak to service men and women in Wisconsin and \nin Iraq, and when I speak to their families, their pride in their \nservice is evident and it is well earned. But their frustration with \nthis open-ended commitment, with the stop-loss orders and the multiple \ndeployments, with the extensions and the uncertainties, is equally \nevident, and it is very painful. We can do better by them, by insisting \non clarity, by insisting on accountability, and by assuring them that \nwe have a plan with clear and achievable goals.\n  We must stop feeding the insurgency in Iraq, and focus on the fight \nagainst the terrorist networks that threaten the security of the \nAmerican people. A timetable can make us stronger, and our enemies \nweaker. That is the strategy we must pursue, and I look forward to \nworking with colleagues here in the Senate to move such a proposal \nforward. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 years ago today a chartered plane \ncrashed in northeastern Minnesota killing Minnesota's senior Senator, \nPaul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, and their daughter Marcia. Also on \nboard were Mary McEvoy, our State Democratic Party's associate chair; \nTom Lapic, a long-time Senate staffer; a young aide, Will McLaughlin; \nand two pilots. There were no survivors.\n  They were flying to Minnesota's famed Iron Range to attend a friend's \nfather's funeral when the plane crashed just before landing and before \nSenator Wellstone's reelection just 11 days away.\n  Paul and I were political allies and personal friends for over 20 \nyears, and he was my colleague and mentor during my first 2 years in \nthe Senate. In 1982, Paul was the Democratic Farmer-Labor or DFL \ncandidate for State auditor in Minnesota, while I was its candidate for \nthe Senate. We both lost.\n  Eight years later, we switched. Paul ran for the Senate; I ran for \nauditor. We both won. In between, we officed and worked together on \nenergy and economic development programs for the Governor of Minnesota \nand became good friends. When Paul ran for reelection to the Senate in \n1996, I agreed to be his finance chair. Paul hated fundraising as much \nas I did, so we made quite a team. Fortunately, Paul's great popularity \nin Minnesota and his nationwide reputation as champion for important, \nprogressive causes prevailed, and he won a decisive reelection victory. \nFour years later, Paul helped me win my election to the Senate.\n  Everyone who knew Paul and Sheila Wellstone knows that they were \nextraordinary, unmatchable, and irreplaceable. Marcia, Mary, Tom, and \nWill were very accomplished and special people in their own rights, and \ntheir losses were as searing to their families and friends as Paul's \nand Sheila's.\n  Senator Paul Wellstone was unique. He was the leader, the heart, and \nthe soul of Minnesota's Democratic Party. He had more passionately \ndevoted followers, supporters, and political organizers than anyone \nelse in Minnesota, perhaps more than anyone in our State's political \nhistory, for Paul Wellstone was truly a man of, by, and for the people, \nespecially, as he jokingly referred to himself and to them, the little \nfellers. He stood for, spoke for, and worked for the many against the \npowerful, the wealthy, and the narrow special interests.\n  In 1990, he pulled one of the greatest political upsets ever by \ndefeating a well-entrenched Republican incumbent, despite being \noutspent by 7 to 1 and being 40 percent behind in the polls at Labor \nDay. He came to Washington, immersed himself in the work of the Senate, \nand over his 12 years, won respect and friendships on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Whether they agreed or disagreed with Paul, everyone knew that he \ntruly believed his position was right, that he passionately cared about \nthe people he was trying to help, and that he had the unflinching \ncourage of his convictions. He also had the oratory eloquence to win \nskeptics to his side and the genuine good humor to keep even his \nopponents his friends.\n  He used his skills, his terrific mind always absorbing new ideas, his \nnationwide network of friends and advisers, his growing seniority in \nthe Senate, and his passion and persistence to accomplish much more \nthan time permits me to recount. During his first term, he authored and \npassed the landmark ``gift ban'' legislation that virtually eliminated \nall lobbyist gifts to Members of Congress and staffers. He was an \noriginal cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. \nIn Paul's own words, he said:\n\n       I am proud to be a politician because I believe strongly in \n     democracy. My father, a Jewish immigrant from Russia whose \n     family had to move from town to town because of czarist \n     persecution, taught me to cherish free elections and the idea \n     of ``government of, by, and for the people.'' But I am not \n     proud of the current state of campaigns and politics in our \n     country.\n       The ethical issue in our time is that money has come to \n     dominate politics and the democracy my father so deeply \n     believed in is so severely compromised. Campaigns match \n     image-makers against image-makers, pollsters against \n     pollsters, and millions of dollars against millions of \n     dollars. It is a superficial, trivialized politics of attack \n     ads, manipulated advertising and 9 second sound bites. Most \n     importantly, money corrupts the process. This is a much more \n     serious corruption than the wrongdoing of a single \n     individual. This is the kind of corruption which results in \n     too few people having too much wealth, power, and say and too \n     many people being denied a voice. It is the politics of \n     democracy for the few, not democracy for the many.\n\n  Paul also worked tirelessly for years in partnership with Senator \nDomenici to enact mental health parity, requiring that mental illness \nbe treated similar to any other illness. This important cause pitted \nSenators Wellstone and Domenici against very powerful and profitable \nspecial interests--insurance companies and for-profit health providers, \nwhose profits increased by not providing or not paying for needed \nhealth care services.\n\n[[Page S11793]]\n\n  The two Senators succeeded in winning Senate passage of their \namendment to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance health protection \nbill with 70 votes in favor. Unfortunately, their amendment was \ndefeated in the conference committee.\n  The two Senators continued working together to enact their historic \nlegislation. Tragically, the Senate effort has lagged since Senator \nWellstone's death, despite the present majority leader's pledge in his \nremarks on the Senate floor of October 24, 2003 ``to ensure that mental \nhealth is appropriately addressed in this Congress.'' That legislation \nhas not been voted on in the Senate, either in the last session of \nCongress or in this one.\n\n  It would be the best possible commemoration of Senator Wellstone's \nlife, and the giving of his life in the service of his country, for the \nSenate to pass that legislation and insist that it becomes law.\n  There is so much more that Paul Wellstone achieved, such as \nprotecting women and children from domestic abuse, on which he and his \nwife Sheila worked closely together, and which he wanted to achieve \nbefore his life was tragically ended.\n  His uniqueness recalls the words of Ernest Hemingway:\n\n       Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their \n     fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their \n     society. Moral courage is a rarer quality than bravery in \n     battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, \n     vital quality of those who would seek to change a world which \n     yields most painfully to change.\n\n  Paul Wellstone dedicated his life to change the world for the \nbetterment of people. That is why he and Sheila meant so much to so \nmany people in Minnesota and across the country.\n  All of us--their family, friends, and admirers--still feel their \nloss. They and Marcia, Mary, Tom, and Will all had so much life left to \nlive. We will cherish them forever.\n  I close with a brief passage from Paul Wellstone's political \nautobiography, ``The Conscience of a Liberal.''\n\n       When I am in coffeeshops with people, no one asks, Are you \n     left, right or center? No one cares. What people want is that \n     your politics be about them.\n       Tip O'Neill once declared, ``All politics is local.'' But I \n     would go further. All politics is personal. These are people \n     who more than anything else yearn for a politics they can \n     believe in. They want politicians whom they can trust and who \n     are at least most of the time on their side.\n\n  With Paul Wellstone, people had the very best on their side all of \nthe time. He will always be missed. May his life--all of their lives--\nbe an example and inspiration to us all.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11793-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

These are students who come from families with low incomes. \nPell grants have been a backbone of our education policy and are \nessential to providing these students an opportunity.\n  We initially passed in the budget a $5.4 billion increase in funding \nfor higher education. All of that was eliminated. We have an \nopportunity this afternoon to make a small difference for those who \nreceive Pell grants.\n  This amendment is about education. Education is about opportunity. \nThis amendment is about competitiveness because in today's global \neconomy we need well-educated individuals.\n  This amendment is about national security because education is the \nkey to having a strong national security.\n  Finally, it is about fairness. Americans understand fairness. They \nbelieve in education.\n  I hope this amendment will succeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with everything Senator Kennedy \nhas said about the importance of increasing Pell grants. But the \ndifficulty is, in adding this appropriated fund, in his effort to add \nadditional money, there is no offset. We have a budget of $145 billion. \nWe have made the allocations as best we can.\n  Since I took over the chairmanship of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee, in 1995 we have increased the Pell grants on an annual \nbasis from $2,340 to $4,050. I would like to increase them more, but \nthere simply is not enough money to do so. If the Senator from \nMassachusetts has a suggestion as to some other priority which is of \nlesser importance, I would be glad to listen. This is a carefully \ncrafted bill. Much as I would like to increase the Pell grants, there \nsimply are not the funds to do so.\n  I am constrained to ask my colleagues to support the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the issue before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is to waive the Congressional \nBudget Act in relation to the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further inquiry: An aye vote effectively would be \nrelated to keeping the pending amendment alive?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 268 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Corzine\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their prompt \narrival in the Chamber to vote. We had an 18\\1/2\\-minute vote. I don't \nthink we have had too many under 20 minutes, recently, at least, so we \nare moving right along. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2222\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S11794]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for himself, and Mr. \n     Cochran, proposes an amendment numbered 2222.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To rename certain buildings of the centers within the Centers \n                  for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The Headquarters and Emergency Operations \n     Center Building (Building 21) at the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention is hereby renamed as the Arlen Specter \n     Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center.\n       (b) The Global Communications Center Building (Building 19) \n     at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hereby \n     renamed as the Thomas R. Harkin Global Communications Center.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to two of our \nmost distinguished colleagues, Senator Arlen Specter and Senator Tom \nHarkin. I wish to recognize both for their many outstanding \ncontributions to our country's disease and injury prevention and \nemergency preparedness through their work with the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention.\n  Since 1995, when Senator Specter and Senator Harkin became chair and \nranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, funding for the CDC has tripled, from a \nlittle over $2 billion to more than $6 billion. This funding has been \nused by CDC to achieve its mission of promoting health and quality of \nlife by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability.\n  In 1999, Senators Specter and Harkin visited the CDC main campus in \nAtlanta, GA. They were surprised to find world-class scientists and \nhealth care professionals working in substandard, 50-year-old \nbuildings. They recognized that beyond the aesthetics, the facilities \nwere hindering the ability of the scientists to respond to disease \noutbreaks with the full force of modern technology.\n  They set out to rebuild the infrastructure of the CDC to ensure that \nit was capable of meeting its mission. In 1999, the budget for CDC \nbuildings and facilities was $17 million, barely enough to make \ncritical repairs, such as patching leaky roofs. However, since 2000, \nunder the leadership of Senators Specter and Harkin, over $1.3 billion \nhas been invested in the infrastructure of the CDC.\n  These funds have been used to build laboratories capable of handling \nthe most dangerous pathogens, such as ebola, anthrax, and smallpox. The \nforesight of these two Senators was confirmed by the essential role the \nnew facilities played in responding to the anthrax attack in 2001, the \nMarburg virus outbreaks, and the potential for an influenza pandemic.\n  The latest additions to the CDC campus are now complete and include \ntwo new buildings dedicated to responding to public health emergencies \nand disseminating information to health professionals. The CDC \nHeadquarters and Emergency Operations Center will be the new home to \nthe Office of the Director, Coordinating Officer of Terrorism \nPreparedness and Emergency Response, Office of Security and Emergency \nPreparedness, and the Emergency Operations Center. It will provide \npermanent, secure, and consolidated command and control areas for CDC's \nresponse to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and outbreak \nresponses. It allows for CDC's executive leadership and other critical \nheadquarters functions to relocate to one building to allow for \nincreased coordination and communication.\n  The Global Communications Center will support outreach and worldwide \ncollaborative efforts. The center is a multifunctional, comprehensive \nscientific learning facility encompassing functions key to CDC's \nmission and goals for public health, such as outreach, research, and \nprogrammatic foundations. The Global Communications Center not only \nprovides a physical place to bring the public health community together \nfor training, information exchange, and collaboration, but it is also \nthe technological link for CDC employees around the globe, from Alaska \nto Zimbabwe.\n  It is fitting that these flagship buildings be named for the two \nSenators who have led the Senate in providing funding for public health \nand research. I am pleased to offer this amendment, cosponsored by my \ndear friend from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, to designate the two new \nCDC buildings as the Arlen Specter Headquarters and Emergency \nOperations Center and the Thomas R. Harkin Global Communications \nCenter.\n  Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2222) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2194\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside, and I further ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2194 that is pending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed, for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Stabenow, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Durbin, \n     Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Salazar, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Smith, \n     Mr. Kohl, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. DeWine, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2194.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for appropriations for Low-Income Home Energy \n                          Assistance Program)\n\n       In title II, in the matter under the heading ``low-income \n     home energy assistance'', in the matter under the heading \n     ``Administration for Children and Families'', after the first \n     sentence insert the following:\n       In addition to amounts appropriated under the preceding \n     sentence, for making payments under title XXVI of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), \n     $2,920,000,000, which amount is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Dodd \nand DeWine as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, last week Senator Collins and I came to the \nfloor to offer an amendment on the Transportation-Treasury \nappropriations bill to increase funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, more commonly known as LIHEAP. We would have \nincreased the appropriations to the authorized amount of $5.1 billion. \nWith Senator Collins' support, and with the help of 53 other Senators, \nwe came forward to make a statement that in this cold winter that is \napproaching, with soaring energy prices, Americans needed help and we \ncould do better. Fifty-three Senators, Democrats and Republicans, \nnortherners and southerners, east coasters and west coasters supported \nour amendment when it came to a vote. But it failed to pass because of \na procedural need to acquire 60 votes. We, joined by 30 of our \ncolleagues, are here again today to offer our amendment to the Labor-\nHHS appropriations bill.\n  Our amendment provides $2.92 billion in emergency spending for the \nLIHEAP program. This amount, coupled with the $2.18 billion in the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, will fully fund LIHEAP at the authorized \nlevel of $5.1 billion, a level authorized by this Congress and signed \ninto law by the President just 3 months ago. At this level, LIHEAP will \ncover the full increase in\n\n[[Page S11795]]\n\nrecipients' heating costs so they would not be forced to pay more out \nof their very limited budgets for this winter's heating season. It is \nimperative that this appropriations bill provide additional resources \nto the LIHEAP program so families are safe and warm this winter.\n  As we speak, there is a storm raging in the Northeast in New England. \nWe expect in some parts of the region to have snow this evening. Winter \nis coming. It is coming with a particular ferocity at this moment. But \nsomething else is already happening: Rising energy prices, \nextraordinary increases in energy prices, much of it as a result of \nHurricane Katrina that struck the gulf coast area. As I have said \nbefore, the first surge was high water that overwhelmed low-income \npeople in New Orleans and Mississippi and Alabama and other cities \nalong the gulf coast. The second surge is high energy prices which are \nabout to overwhelm many individuals in the Northeast and the Midwest \nand throughout this country where the temperatures begin to fall as \nthey do this time of year. We have to do more to protect these people \nbecause we know it is coming.\n  One of the lessons from Katrina is that we understand that there are \npeople who are vulnerable, and they have to be protected before the \nstorm hits, not afterwards. This is an opportunity to do that for \npeople throughout this country who are vulnerable this winter to rising \nenergy prices and falling temperatures.\n  I particularly thank Senators Specter and Harkin for their strong \nsupport of the LIHEAP program. I realize the difficult choices they \nfaced this year in determining spending limits for the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. I appreciate their support for this amendment to \nadd emergency spending for LIHEAP.\n  On Saturday, the New York Times printed an editorial titled \n``Washington's Cold Shoulder.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 22, 2005]\n\n                       Washington's Cold Shoulder\n\n       The weather is turning cold, and home heating fuel is \n     increasingly unaffordable. The Energy Department recently \n     reported that households should expect to pay 48 percent more \n     this year for natural gas, on average, and nearly a third \n     more for oil and propane--assuming a ``normal'' winter and no \n     further supply disruptions like Katrina.\n       In and of themselves, those increases will be too much for \n     an estimated seven million low-income Americans, including \n     old people, disabled people and families with children. On \n     top of gasoline prices that are already high and wages that \n     are stagnating, the rising cost of heating fuel is bound to \n     be devastating.\n       Yet Congress is balking at approving an additional $3 \n     billion in federal heating subsidies that would help meet the \n     coming need. (Lawmakers allocated $2 billion to the subsidy \n     program last summer, before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita sent \n     prices soaring.) Earlier this month, and again on Thursday, \n     measures in the Senate to provide the extra funds were \n     defeated, largely by a bloc of Republican lawmakers, though \n     with each vote, a handful of Republicans voted in favor and a \n     few Democrats voted against.\n       At the same time, Republican majorities in Congress are \n     unrelenting in their drive to pass $70 billion in new tax \n     cuts this fall, most of them for wealthy investors, and $35 \n     billion in spending cuts, most in programs that benefit the \n     poor.\n       With Congress's priorities so obviously skewed, the best \n     chance for adequate heating subsidies this winter lies with \n     President Bush. Advocates for the poor are hoping that Mr. \n     Bush will ask for the additional money in a future hurricane-\n     related emergency spending request to Congress. But so far, \n     Mr. Bush has not said whether he will ask for more heating \n     aid, and, if so, when or how much.\n       This sad lack of urgency is seen elsewhere in the \n     administration as well. Asked at a news conference earlier \n     this month whether the administration would support bolstered \n     subsidies for low-income families and the elderly, Secretary \n     of Energy Samuel Bodman suggested that everyone just wait and \n     see. ``I can't respond to that,'' he said, ``other than by \n     saying we're going to do our very best, first, to see what we \n     can accomplish by the reduction in demand for energy.''\n       That's unacceptable. Heating subsidies are not a \n     conservation issue. Vulnerable people need to keep the heat \n     on to keep from getting sick, or worse. Such subsidies help \n     everyone by maintaining public health and safety, ensuring \n     that others don't become ill and spread illness, or resort to \n     hazardous means of heating that can cause fires. Heating aid \n     for the needy is also a matter of common decency, which \n     ordinary Americans are entirely capable of, though not, so \n     far, their elected leaders.\n\n  Mr. REED. The editorial says that our congressional priorities are \nskewed, and I agree. As the editorial points out, Members of Congress \nare continuing an unrelenting drive to pass $70 billion in new cuts \nthis fall in taxes, most of them for wealthy investors, and to cut $35 \nbillion in spending, mostly in programs that benefit the poor. The \nvulnerable people need to keep the heat on to keep from getting sick, \nbecoming homeless, or worse.\n  Because of our budget rules, we are prevented from getting a straight \nup-or-down majority vote on our amendment to provide assistance to \nseniors, low-income working families, and disabled individuals. This \namendment will ensure that they will be protected from the ravages of \nthe cold this winter: aid that will ensure children will not become ill \nor malnourished, aid that will ensure families do not resort to \nhazardous means of heating that can cause fires. Unfortunately and \nregrettably, every heating season there is a terrible incident where \nsome poor person decides their stove can provide them some heat, and \nthey leave it on, causing a fire with tragic consequences. I hope that \nwill not be the case this year. If we don't provide support for these \nfamilies, they have very little choice in many cases, other than to \nimprovised heat, and that often leads to tragedy.\n  As the New York Times editorial states: Heating aid for the needy is \na matter of common decency. Is our memory so short that we have \nforgotten the pledge we made to low-income families after Hurricane \nKatrina to address the economic disparity in our Nation that literally \nleaves many out in the cold or in the dark?\n  Rising energy prices could financially wipe out working-class \nfamilies and seniors this winter. Energy costs for the average family \nusing heating oil are estimated to hit $1,600 this winter, an increase \nof $380 over last winter's heating season. For families using natural \ngas, prices could hit about $1,400, an increase of $500. For families \nusing propane, prices are projected to hit $1,400, an increase of about \n$325. For families living in poverty, energy bills are now over 20 \npercent of their income compared to 5 percent of the income of other \nhouseholds, more affluent households.\n  In America, no one should be forced to choose between heating or \neating. No senior citizen should be forced to choose between buying \nnecessary pharmaceuticals and keeping the heat up. But unfortunately, \nlow-income working Americans are facing these decisions each day, and \nthey will become more dire and more consequential as the winter \napproaches.\n  The heat-or-eat dilemma is a real one for poor families. A study by \nthe RAND Corporation found that low-income households reduce food \nexpenditures by roughly the same amount as their increase in heating \nexpenditures. That is an awful tradeoff, one that I don't think any \nAmerican would like to see take place.\n  The Social Security Administration recently announced its cost-of-\nliving adjustment for 2006 for seniors. The COLA is about a $65-per-\nmonth increase for the average retired couple. But with this winter's \nenergy prices, that increase will be wiped out in an instant. So we \nhave to do better. Even at a funding level of $5.1 billion, LIHEAP \nwould still only serve about one-seventh of the 35 million households \nthat are poor enough to qualify for assistance. So we are just talking \nabout serving the very neediest in our community. This is a program \nthat, frankly, could use many more dollars to serve every qualified \nindividual. We are just reaching the neediest among us. If we don't \npass this appropriations, we won't even reach those individuals.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us to secure $2.9 billion in \nadditional LIHEAP funding and pass this amendment. I urge an up-or-down \nvote on the amendment. As a nation, we must step back and evaluate our \npriorities. American families are facing an energy emergency. If we can \nfind money for tax cuts, then we can find funds for LIHEAP. Now is not \nthe time to sacrifice the health and safety of American families. We \nmust prioritize, and the priorities start with providing affordable \nenergy to low-income and middle-class Americans as they struggle with \nextraordinary increases in\n\n[[Page S11796]]\n\nprices and the looming cold of this winter.\n  I am pleased and proud to be joined in this effort by my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Collins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nand friend from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in offering an amendment \nthat would increase funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, commonly known as LIHEAP, by $2.9 billion. I want to begin my \nremarks by thanking the manager of this bill, Senator Specter, for his \nstrong commitment to the LIHEAP program. Despite difficult budgetary \nconstraints, the chairman has found an additional $200 million in \nLIHEAP funding above the administration's request, bringing the total \nto approximately $2.2 billion. I do recognize and very much appreciate \nthat effort.\n  Unfortunately, even with this additional funding, we are still far \nshort of the amount of funding that is needed for this vital program. \nJust a few months ago, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005. This law, which passed the Senate with an overwhelming \nvote, authorizes $5.1 billion for the LIHEAP program for fiscal year \n2006. The Reed-Collins amendment would increase LIHEAP funding to the \nfully authorized level.\n  Our Nation has now been struck by three extremely powerful hurricanes \nin as many months. While these hurricanes have been devastating to the \npeople of Florida and the gulf coast, they have also had a major impact \non the rest of the Nation. Just as the Nation should be building oil \nsupplies for the winter heating season, these hurricanes have disrupted \nour already strained supplies and sent the cost of both home heating \noil and gasoline, as well as natural gas, to painfully high levels.\n  While high energy prices pose a challenge for almost all Americans, \nthey impose an especially difficult burden on low-income families and \nour elderly citizens who are living on limited incomes. Low-income \nfamilies spend a greater percentage of their incomes on heating their \nhomes, and they have fewer options available as energy prices soar. \nHigh energy prices can even cause families to choose between keeping \nthe heat on, putting food on their table, or buying much-needed \nprescription drugs. In our country, the most prosperous country on \nEarth, surely no family should have to make such terrible choices.\n  I believe our amendment reflects a realistic appraisal of the need \nfor more assistance in this program. Let me briefly describe the \nsituation that we are facing in my State of Maine, a State where snow \nis predicted for later today. While the official start of winter is \nstill 2 months away, temperatures have already fallen below freezing in \nmuch of Maine. In Maine, 78 percent of all households use home heating \noil to heat their homes. Currently, the cost of home heating oil is \napproximately $2.50 per gallon, although I recently paid 20 cents more \nper gallon to fill my tank.\n  That price, the $2.50 price, is some 60 cents above last year's \nalready high prices. These high prices greatly increase the need for \nassistance and at least 3,000 additional Mainers are expected to apply \nfor LIHEAP assistance this year. With more people in need of help, the \nbenefit is expected to fall by roughly 10 percent, to about $440 per \nqualifying household.\n  Unfortunately, at today's high prices, $440 is only enough to \npurchase approximately 173 gallons of oil. That is far below last \nyear's equivalent benefit of 251 gallons and not nearly enough, not \neven close, to what will be needed by these families to get through \nMaine's winter.\n  With rising prices and falling benefits, we have a real problem. To \npurchase the same amount of oil as last year, Maine would need an \nadditional $10.8 million in LIHEAP funding. With winter fast \napproaching and energy prices soaring, home heating bills are set to \npound family budgets mercilessly. For low-income families, LIHEAP funds \ncan be a factor that prevents them from having to choose between \nturning down the heat to the point where they are at risk for \nhypothermia or putting food on the table, paying their bills or buying \nprescription drugs.\n  Surely we can do better to help those who otherwise will truly suffer \nduring the winter months.\n  I call upon all of our colleagues to join us in this amendment or \nsurely it will be too late to help those who are going to be in dire \nstraits this winter. Let us act now to provide the funding that is so \nsorely needed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been around the Senate for a long \ntime, and I have been serving West Virginia for a long time. I have \nseen many seasons in my time in this Senate, and I know that with each \nseason comes its challenges. There is strength and beauty in West \nVirginia winters, but the impacts of recent hurricanes and other energy \nchallenges will test our ability to meet our needs this coming season. \nThese colder temperatures mean that West Virginians and Americans in \nmany regions of this country will be struggling to heat their homes. I \nknow, as winter approaches, many West Virginians will be faced with \ntough choices about whether to use their paychecks to heat their homes, \nto fill their cars with gasoline, or to buy winter clothes for their \nchildren. I sympathize with those who have to make these tough choices, \nand these hard-working Americans deserve some measure of relief.\n\n  I strongly support the Reed/Collins amendment. We need to fully fund \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. This program is \ncritical for those in my State and across the country who will be \nfacing a tough winter. Colder winter months, coupled with the \nsimultaneous challenges of an increase in poverty, a growing elderly \npopulation, and ever-increasing home heating costs, will make this \nprogram crucial. The LIHEAP program fills the gap for the poorest and \nmost vulnerable of our citizens, allowing them the sanctuary of a warm \nhome, something to which each and every American is entitled. More than \n130,000 households benefit from this program in my State. Households, \nincluding many in West Virginia, that heat with natural gas are \nexpected to pay an average of $350, or 48 percent, more for home \nheating this winter than last. This increase will leave many West \nVirginians even more vulnerable and forced to make tough choices.\n  Therefore, I support this amendment, as I have when it has been \npreviously offered on other fiscal year 2006 Appropriations bills. I \ncannot stand by and let the throes of winter leave the most vulnerable \nin my State out in the cold, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, press reports today indicate that the number \nof American troops killed in Iraq has now reached 2,000--2,000. This is \nanother tragic milestone in this costly and unnecessary war in which \ntoo much blood--too much blood, too much blood--has already been \nspilled. And I offer my deepest sympathies to the brave men and women \nwho have given their lives--that is everything. They have given their \nlives. They have given their all, everything, their lives--most of \nthese young lives in their 20s or thereabouts--given their lives in \nselfless dedication to service--2,000--2,000 men and women given their \nlives in dedication to our Nation. See the empty chairs. Two thousand, \n2,000 empty chairs at the table, 2,000. How many hearts have been \nbroken? How many tears have been spilled? I offer to these families my \nprayers that God, almighty God, may comfort them in their grief over \nthe loss of their beloved husbands, wives, sons or daughters, brothers \nor sisters.\n  As we mourn the losses that have already occurred in the war in Iraq, \nAmericans should be mindful that all indications are that there will be \nmany more losses to come--many more losses to come, yes, in the most \ndangerous, the most dangerous country in the world, the most violent \ncountry in the world. How would you like your sons or grandsons or \ngranddaughters to go? And for what? For what? They did not ask to be \nsent to war. They were young. They had life ahead of them. Oh, the \nlofty horizons they had, the great dreams they had--the dreams, the \ndreams, yes, the dreams, of these young men and women--2,000--2,000--\n2,000. They did not ask to be sent to war, I say.\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\n  But each day they carry out their duty. Think of those who are in \nIraq. No, they must not stand still in one place, no. Keep on the move. \nLook all around you. How much they sleep at night and how much their \nmothers and fathers lie on their pillows to cry out to God to save \ntheir sons and daughters, to send them home safely. What a terrible \nthing.\n  It is only reasonable that the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives, like you--like you, yes, and like me--ask more \nquestions, questions, more questions, yes. Why? Oh, why? Why? Why? How \nmuch longer, how long do we have to suffer? How long do our young \npeople have to look forward to this dreadful trap?\n  I was alarmed last week when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was \nasked at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the \nPresident's ability to initiate another war. Specifically, Secretary \nRice was asked whether the President must seek a new congressional \nauthorization if he were to attack Syria or Iran. Secretary Rice \nresponded:\n\n       I don't want to try and circumscribe Presidential war \n     powers.\n\n  How about that.\n\n       I don't want to try and circumscribe Presidential war \n     powers. And I think you'll understand fully that the \n     President retains those powers in the war on terrorism and in \n     the war on Iraq.\n\n  I am astounded, I am flabbergasted, I am astonished by that response. \nThe Secretary of State seems to indicate that she believes this \nPresident or any other President has the power to redefine the war in \nIraq and the war on terrorism--and that power that appears in the \nConstitution of the United States: Congress shall have power to declare \nwar--has the power to redefine the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism \nto include a possible attack on Syria or Iran.\n  Think of it. Mr. President, Congress made a grave mistake, Congress \nmade a grave mistake--what a blot on the escutcheon of the Senate--when \nit voted to pass the resolution which transferred to the President the \npower to declare war against Iraq. What a shame. What a shame. What a \nmistake. Oh, my, what a mistake. What a mistake. What a shame. And this \nSenate for the most part stood mute--mute, mute, silent, speechless.\n  Congress made a grave mistake on October 11, 2002, in passing the \nresolution that transferred to the President, any President, the \npower--how about that, the power--that is not what this Constitution \nsays. This Constitution, which I hold in my hand, says that Congress--\nthat is us, the people's representatives, here and across on the other \nside of the Capitol--Congress shall have power to declare war. But what \ndid Congress do? Congress shifted that power to declare war, tucked its \ntail between its legs, so to speak, and walked off the field, threw its \nsword in the sand and walked off the field, relegated itself then, now, \nand forever more, until that law is changed, rendered itself \nspeechless. We wash our hands, Congress washed its hands. Congress \nwashed its hands and walked away from that field, with its broken sword \nin the sand, transferring to the President the power to declare war \nagainst Iraq. And for what? For what? Why did we go there? Well, there \nare all kinds of reasons now they bring but then it was because there \nwere to be found weapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. Rumsfeld said: Oh, we know where they are; they are in the north, \nthey are in the south, the east and west. We know where they are.\n  Well, where are they, Mr. Secretary? Where are they? Where are they? \nTwo thousand men and women, one for every year that has passed since \nJesus Christ was born--2,000, 2,000. And for what?\n  But that resolution was limited to Iraq alone. It had no mention of \nIran, no mention of Syria. That resolution cannot possibly authorize a \nnew war against Syria or Iran. Our troops are so deeply mired in this \nsectarian conflict in Iraq, what point could there possibly be in \ncontemplating an attack on Syria or Iran? Why did Secretary Rice \ndismiss the notion that the President must first come to Congress if he \nwishes to broaden this war to new countries--unless our country is \nunder the direct threat of an imminent attack. Then a President has the \ninherent constitutional power to move to war.\n  The American people seek an end, they seek an end, they want an end \nto this ongoing bloody war in Iraq, not new conflicts in neighboring \ncountries.\n  For the sake of the Constitution--here it is in my hand--for the sake \nof the Constitution, for the sake of the American people--there they \nare. I see them out there through those electronic lenses. Yes, there \nthey are, out into the mountains, the Appalachians, then the Midwest, \nthen the Rockies, then the west coast. They are all over there, the \nAmerican people--and for the brave members of the U.S. Armed Forces, \nthe President should publicly acknowledge that there will be no \nexpansion of the war in Iraq, none, no expansion, without the \nauthorization of Congress. That is us. That is us, Members of the House \nand Senate. Not one man, not one body. Two bodies, the House and the \nSenate, the Congress of the United States.\n\n  There must be no more mission creep. There must be no more billions \ncommitted. There must be no more lives lost without authorization by \nthe people's representatives in Congress, including an open debate and \nan up-or-down vote. That is what I pleaded for. That is what some of us \npleaded for. That is what some of us pleaded for--debate, time, talk, \nwait, wait until after the election; let's hear what the people have to \nsay and then come back and talk about it. No, it had to be done in a \nhurry; we have to get it behind us.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from New Jersey and \nthe Senator from Rhode Island and others said: Wait a minute, let's \ntalk about it; let's wait until after the election; we don't have to do \nit now; let's wait, wait, wait; let's talk about it. No, we were told, \nget it behind us, get it behind us. I said you will never get it behind \nus. This man down at the White House is not going to let it get behind \nus. He has you right where he wants you.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for addressing the \nSenate on this very grim day that marks the loss of the 2,000th young \nAmerican in Iraq. I welcome my memory being refreshed by the Senator's \nvery eloquent statements about what took place at that time and \nsubsequently about his policy differences, which I share so deeply.\n  While the Senator said we should wait, does the Senator not think it \nmight have been appropriate that we give the inspectors adequate time \nto complete their inspection prior to the time we were going to have \nthe troops begin the invasion?\n  As members of the Armed Services Committee, we were told that we were \ntransferring the information Don Rumsfeld had to the inspectors. Under \nthe excellent questioning of the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, \nSecretary Rumsfeld was asked about the information that would be \ntransferred to the inspectors, and he gave the assurance to the Armed \nServices Committee that this was a continuing, ongoing process in which \nwe were involved. Then we found out subsequently that there was no \ntransfer of information. There was no transfer of information because, \nas the Senator has pointed out, those weapons had not been there. But \nthat information was never shared with the Members of this body. There \nwas never an effort to try to see whether the international inspectors \ncould find what the Secretary of Defense swore to, effectively, about \nthe weapons of mass destruction--and the Senator used the words north, \nsouth, east, and west, which are very much the words the Secretary of \nDefense used. He assured the American people he knew where they were.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We understood they were going to notify the inspectors \nand give assurances to the American people. Doesn't the Senator believe \nit would have been appropriate at least if we had waited until that \nkind of process continued and we find out whether weapons of mass \ndestruction were there or were not there? That is part of the waiting, \nis it not?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely, positively.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for reminding us about that period \nin history. I gather from what the Senator is saying, with all the \nmistakes and blunders that have been made--\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. --what the Senator is asking for is out of respect for \nthe extraordinary heroism of our current men and women in the service, \nthat they deserve something better than the cliches and slogans for \npolicy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And that they need to have a real policy that is going \nto reflect how we can bring those brave American service men and women \nhome with honor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And do it in a way of which we can all be proud.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, yes. I thank the distinguished Senator for his very \nappropriate observations. The U.N. inspectors were doing their job. \nThey were finding certain weapons, and they were disposing of them. \nWith some more time--I believe it was the top inspector, his name was \nBlix--he said: We can do this job; it may take some months. We could \nhave done that and saved 2,000 men and women. Oh, what a shame. The \ninspectors were doing their job.\n  Let me hurry on. Too many lives have already been lost.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield? I don't want to interrupt his \ncomments here, they are so important, but has the Senator, in his \nfollowing of this issue, been able to detect any plan, any strategy \nthat has come from the administration from which he believes the \nAmerican people can gain great satisfaction that we are headed in the \nright direction? Does he know of any plan or program, any strategy that \nwould result in the opportunity to bring those service men and women \nhome with honor?\n  Mr. BYRD. There has been none. There is none. There has been none. I \nsee only a huge black hole. No plan. No plan. No plan. No vision. We \nare there with no vision, and people perish and they perish.\n  Too many lives have already been lost in pursuit of this nefarious \ndoctrine of preemption, unconstitutional on its face--on its face. How \ncan there be a congressional debate if one man may decide when to hit, \nwhere to hit? I urge the administration to turn away from that \ndangerous doctrine of preemptive war and adhere to the requirements of \nthe Constitution of these United States, to which we all swear an oath \nto support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all \nenemies foreign and domestic. Lord, Lord, help us. May God bless these \nmen and women who gave their lives, and God bless their families who \nmourn them every day, every night, and there is no end in sight. May \nGod help this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2194, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment No. 2194. I am told I do not need consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, with its modification, is as follows:\n\n       On page 158, after line 12, insert:\n       In addition to amounts appropriated under the preceding \n     sentence, for making payments under title XXVI of the Omnibus \n     Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), \n     $2,920,000,000, which amount is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Byrd \nto amendment No. 2194.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe the amendment which has been \noffered by the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Maine is \none of necessity. It is regrettable that fuel costs have grown so high, \noccasioned by a great many factors, one of which is what has happened \nwith Hurricane Katrina and the elevation of oil, the elevation of \nnatural gas prices.\n  This issue of low-income home energy assistance, LIHEAP, has been a \ndifficult matter for this subcommittee for the 24 years I have been on \nthe subcommittee because it poses such a drastic alternative for so \nmany people. The comment ``heat or eat'' is a very accurate one. That \nreally is the choice for so many, especially the elderly. I have \nsupported funding for LIHEAP in the past, and I believe it is \naccurately characterized as an emergency.\n  I say that recognizing the very heavy, burdensome obligations the \nFederal Government has and that spending is a very major issue. But \nwhen it comes down to the exigencies of this moment where we have \nappropriated so much money to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, we \nare talking about brothers and sisters of those victims of people who \nlive in Rhode Island or New Hampshire or Maine or Pennsylvania or so \nmany States in the Union. So I will be supporting the amendment Senator \nReed and Senator Collins have offered.\n  I have been advised that there will be an alternative amendment put \nforward to have an across-the-board cut. I do not think that is the \nbetter answer to the issue, but I wanted to put that on the record so \nthat if we move ahead with the yeas and nays, we will hold off on the \nvote perhaps to vote on them side by side, if there is not a second-\ndegree amendment. We will see what we sort out on procedure.\n  I thought it important as manager on this side that I make this \nstatement which I have. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we are going to pause at 3:40 p.m. \nMy friend and colleague from New Jersey has an important statement, but \nhe is letting me proceed.\n  Winter is rapidly closing in on States across America. Yet even after \nHurricane Katrina shocked the Nation about the desperate plight of the \npoor, the administration and the Republican Congress continue to ignore \nour neediest citizens.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, home heating \nbills will soar this winter. Households heating primarily with natural \ngas will pay an average of $350 more this winter for heat--an increase \nof an incredible 48 percent over last year. Those relying primarily on \noil for heat will pay $378 more--an increase of 32 percent.\n  The people most in need of help on this issue are the 37 million \nAmericans living in poverty today--including 13 million children. \nAccording to a recent report by Economic Opportunity Studies, families \nin poverty will owe an average of 25 percent of their entire income for \ntheir energy bills this winter.\n  The Federal poverty guideline is $16,090 for a family of three. That \nmeans that $4,022 will be spent on home energy bills, leaving only \n12,000 or $1,000 a month for expenses the entire year.\n  A family whose rent is $800 a month would have only $200 left. For a \nhousehold of three, that's only $63 per person per month for food, \nclothing, and health care.\n  Mr. President, 46 million Americans lack health insurance in this \ncountry. If such families have a health emergency and no health \ninsurance, their annual income could be further strapped.\n  What if the family owns a car so they can get to and from work? More \nmoney will be needed to pay the high cost of gasoline and to make \nmonthly car and insurance payments.\n  Since many families live below the Federal poverty line, they will \nhave even less money left for other needs after they pay to heat their \nhomes.\n  A recent study by researchers from Stanford University, the \nUniversity of Chicago, the RAND Corporation, and UCLA found that when \npoor families' heating bills go up during cold winter months, they \nreduce their spending on food.\n  LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program, was created \ntwo decades ago to prevent low-income families from being forced to \nmake these impossible tradeoffs. Yet Federal funding for LIHEAP has \nbeen stagnant for over a decade, even as the need for assistance has \nrisen sharply. As a result, the purchasing power of LIHEAP assistance, \nadjusted for inflation, is now only a little over half of what it was \nin 1982.\n  Thirty-three million households are eligible for LIHEAP assistance. \nThese households will spend nearly $55 billion in energy costs. Yet the \nLIHEAP program is funded at only $2 billion.\n  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, \nLIHEAP assistance reached 5 million families this year--the highest \nlevel in\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\nten years, but only 15 percent of the eligible population.\n  In Massachusetts, LIHEAP serves 134,000 families, which is only 15 \npercent of the 867,000 families eligible for assistance.\n  Earlier this month, I visited the Curtis Hall Community Center in \nBoston, MA, with Mayor Menino. I heard first hand about the extreme \nneed for home energy assistance among senior citizens.\n  Last winter, Eileen Duggan, a widow from Jamaica Plain in Boston, \nkept her oven on high and wore several layers of clothing because her \ntime-worn furnace was inadequate to provide enough heat. She started \nbuying less food so that she could use her small monthly budget to pay \nher heating bill. Despite her best efforts, she still couldn't pay that \nbill, and last April, with the New England winter chill still in the \nair, she asked the utility company to stop sending her oil. ``I told \nthe oil man: `Don't give me anymore. I can't afford it,' '' she said.\n  Other low-income families have also been sharing their stories. One \nexample involves a single mother who lives in Haverhill, MA, with her \n18-year-old son who is handicapped, her 19-year-old daughter, and her \ndaughter's child who has a medical condition. Both mother and daughter \nwork as school bus monitors, and they have little or no income over the \nsummer. Their rent is $950 a month. Their last gas bill was $1,729. \nBecause they couldn't pay the bill, their gas was shut off last winter. \nEven if they qualify for $600 in LIHEAP assistance, the gas company may \nstill refuse to reconnect their service, unless the family comes up \nwith another $400 to $800 towards their debt.\n  Millions of low-income Americans set their thermostats at just 60 \ndegrees or even lower--if their heat is still on--while Congress, the \nadministration, and the vast majority of us rest content in warm homes. \nYet the Bush administration and the Republican Congress do nothing year \nafter year.\n  Time and time again I have stood on the Senate floor urging Congress \nto open its eyes to the needs of the poor.\n  It is shameful that after the President and the Republican Congress \nfroze LIHEAP funds through the continuing resolution, they continue to \ntune out the pleas of low-income families who need home heating \nassistance.\n  Last week, the Republican leadership decided to use a procedural \nmaneuver once again to block emergency funding for LIHEAP. Almost every \nDemocratic Senator supported this additional relief, but Republican \nSenators overwhelmingly opposed it, and it was defeated.\n  There is no excuse for the Republican majority to look the other \nway--but they do. They continue to ignore families who lie awake at \nnight worrying how to make ends meet. They refuse to acknowledge the \nparents who worry, day after day, week after week, month after month, \nhow to feed their children and keep the heat on, or the elderly who \nturn down their thermostats, put on extra sweaters, or even turn off \nthe heat in an attempt to save money.\n  It is time to tell low-income families across the country that we \nhear them, that we care about them, and that we don't intend to leave \nthem shivering in the cold again this winter. That is why I strongly \nsupport the Reed-Collins amendment to add $2.9 billion to the LIHEAP \nprogram. We need to increase LIHEAP funding now to avoid real harm to \nreal people this winter, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I urge our colleagues to listen to our colleagues not only from New \nEngland, from the Northeast, but other parts of the country in urging \nfavorable consideration of this amendment. I join them in saying I have \nseen the faces of too many senior citizens, too many elderly people who \nare on fixed incomes. I have seen their fear about what is going to \nhappen in their homes and the hard, difficult choices they are going to \nhave to make this winter unless we provide this assistance. This \nassistance is desperately needed for our region of the country. It is \nKatrina in a very real way. Like Katrina, it is an emergency in terms \nof heating homes. I hope we can get favorable consideration of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a grim moment for America: \n2,000 of our young courageous people have perished in Iraq--2,000. From \nthe years 1961 to 1965--those are the years in Vietnam--we got over \n2,000 death notices sent to homes across the country. There is a lot of \npain across the country, yes, for those who lost loved ones, but across \nthis Nation of ours people are wondering what is it, when do we get to \nsee our people coming back home, because it certainly does not have the \nappearance of a matter resolved.\n  I have often thought that some memorial should be present in this \nbody as these casualty numbers are reported. But as we were denied the \nopportunity to have some reminders of this catastrophe displayed in the \nRotunda or a busier place, I decided to put a memorial to those lost in \nIraq at the front door to my office. I have been overwhelmed by the \ninterest shown by passers-by.\n\n  We have their pictures up there and their names and the communities \nthey come from. There are more numbers coming. We update the list \nregularly, the pictures regularly. Every casualty is a life cut short, \nfamilies torn apart. Outside my office we have this memorial to the \nfallen heroes. You look at those faces and see how young are the people \nwho died.\n  When I started the Senate memorial I hoped major combat would soon be \nover and our casualties would be minimal or eliminated, but major \ncombat has dragged on and the memorial display unfortunately has grown \nand grown. It has gotten to the point where the memorial takes up most \nof the space outside my office. I encourage my colleagues to visit \nthese memorials. There is one in the Longworth House Office Building in \nfront of the office of Representatives Rahm Emanuel and Walter Jones. I \nencourage my colleagues to visit these memorials and pay tribute to \nthese troops.\n  As we reach this grim milestone today, it is critical that we examine \nthe situation we are facing in Iraq. The President made a speech today. \nWe heard it on TV. He basically said let's keep on doing what we are \ndoing. We heard the usual rhetoric about spreading freedom.\n  I do not think we need any more slogans. I remember the President's \nslogan on the aircraft carrier when he said, ``Mission accomplished.'' \nMission accomplished? The President declared that major combat \noperations were over. This was in May 2003. Since then we have lost \n1,855 of our people.\n  As the debacle on the aircraft carrier proved, slogans are only as \ngood as the banners they are written on. But we don't need more \nslogans. We need a plan. We need a plan that will provide relief to our \ntroops so they are not shouldering all of the burdens in Iraq. The \nPresident and his team ignored the wise advice of the State Department \nand alienated our usual allies before the war, and did it with \nincredible arrogance and ineptitude.\n  Last year, President Bush scolded my colleague Senator Kerry, while \ndebating this issue, alleging that Senator Kerry forgot--I put this in \nquotes--``forgot Poland.'' But even Poland is pulling out of Iraq now. \nWith the exception of British troops in Basra, we are essentially going \nit alone across the rest of Iraq. As our troops go it alone, they have \nto live with President Bush's taunt to our enemies when he said: \n``Bring `em on. Bring `em on.''\n  Mr. President, have they sufficiently brought them on? That was said \nin July of 2003.\n  What the troops on the ground need is less talk and more of a plan \nthat defines our specific goals. They want to know exactly how many \nIraqi troops need to be trained before our soldiers can begin to come \nhome. We hear stories about these trained battalions, trained units \nthat are made up of Iraqi soldiers. But when you get the other side, \npeople who have knowledge from the front, they tell us there are far \nfewer Iraqis trained than are presented to us from the administration.\n  What we hear from President Bush over and over again is that we need \nto complete the mission. But we are not told what the mission is.\n  Today, I hope every American will pause and reflect on the price that \nhas been paid by our very brave service people. Their courage is above \nquestion--but the administration's policy in Iraq is not. The American \npeople\n\n[[Page S11800]]\n\nhave a right and a duty to demand answers from our Government. Our \ntroops deserve nothing less. Every flag-draped coffin represents a \nfamily who will never again share a moment with their spouse, with \ntheir child, sibling, friend.\n  It was very telling, early on in this conflict, when the \nadministration banned the photography of flag-draped coffins coming \nback to our shores from Iraq. Imagine banning that demonstration of \nhonor and tribute--a flag-draped coffin, based upon the fact that it \nmight disturb the privacy of the family while they greet the coffin. \nFamilies don't come to Dover, DE, where the coffins are carried off the \nairplanes. There is a mortuary where remains are often identified and \nmoments of privacy provided for the families. But they banned these \ntributes to heroes who served our country. The administration argued \nabout the privacy matter. It is a red herring. Of course the funerals \nare private. But at issue was the return of these caskets to Dover Air \nForce Base.\n  Why do I talk about it? Because it is an attempt to hide the real \npain and sacrifice that is being made in this war in Iraq. They do not \nwant the American people to see flag-draped coffin after flag-draped \ncoffin because it reminds us about what is taking place.\n  Presidents Reagan and Clinton publicly met flag-draped coffins on the \ntarmac at Dover. But under this President we cannot even take pictures \nof them.\n  We should honor, not hide, flag-draped coffins. They are a symbol of \nthe respect, honor, and dignity our fallen heroes deserve. Today we \nhonor the 2,000 heroes who sacrificed their lives for our country.\n  I urge the President to pay tribute to their memory by offering this \ncountry a concise, realistic plan that will allow us finally to \ntransfer power to Iraqis and bring our troops home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know the chairman is eager to make \nfurther progress on the underlying bill, and therefore we will be \nbrief.\n  A number of Senators have come to the floor over the course of today \nto express their thoughts or feelings or emotions or sympathies for the \nfamilies of the over 2,000 military dead in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  At this point, I ask the Senate now proceed to a moment of silence in \nhonor of our fallen soldiers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed to a moment of \nsilence in honor of our fallen soldiers.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today U.S. military deaths in Operation \nIraqi Freedom surpassed 2,000. These brave men and women in uniform \nsacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom and for the security of \ntheir fellow Americans. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude for their \ncourage, for their valor, for their strength, for their commitment to \nour country. They heard the call of duty and they took the fight to the \nenemy so that the enemy would not strike us here at home. These brave \nmen and women join a pantheon of heroes who have fought and died over \nthe years for our country.\n  Because of their determination, Saddam Hussein now faces a trial for \nhis life; because of their resolve, the Iraqi people are exercising \ntheir right to self-rule. And today, because of their bravery, today \nIraq has a new constitution, a historic milestone on the march toward \nfreedom and the fight against terror.\n  Our hearts do go out to all the families who have lost loved ones on \nthe battlefield as well as the thousands of men and women who have been \ninjured. Their valor, their courage are a shining example to all. We \nowe them our deepest respect. We offer our continued support and our \ncontinued prayers. We pledge to stand firm in the war on terror. We \nwill accomplish the mission to secure a free and prosperous Iraq and, \nin turn, secure the freedom and safety of America.\n  We will persevere and we will win--for our heroes in uniform; for the \nUnited States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a solemn occasion, to have the \nSenate stand in silence in respect for the sacrifices made by the \nfighting men and women of this country. Our thoughts go out, not only \nto the lives of these individuals but to their families. This is only a \nsmall token of what we can do to recognize the sacrifices they have \nmade, leaving behind their sons and daughters, the husbands and wives \nand friends. We all have been touched by the deaths of these 2,000 in \none way or the other.\n  It is my prayer that the sacrifices made will prove to have been \nwarranted.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues for being here today on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I am grateful to Senator Frist who has joined in this \nmoment of silence. It is something that I will remember, and I hope we \nall do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as of today, 2,000 American soldiers have \nbeen killed in combat in Iraq.\n  Since last January's election in Iraq, we have lost 565 American \nsoldiers; 74 of those soldiers have been killed in October--an average \nof three a day. An additional 15,220 have been wounded, and more than \n7,000 of whom were unable to return to combat.\n  The youngest of America's fallen soldiers was just 18. The oldest was \n59. Nearly three quarters had not even celebrated their 30th birthday. \nThey came from every State in the Nation. This includes 38 soldiers \nfrom my own State of Massachusetts.\n  They are the best of America, and we are proud of each one. Although \nI disagree with the President about Iraq, I honor the service and \nsacrifice and dedication of each of these brave men and women.\n  Our Armed Forces are serving ably in Iraq under enormously difficult \ncircumstances and the policy of our Government must be worthy of their \nsacrifice. Unfortunately, it is not, and the American people know it.\n  Our soldiers in Iraq need more than happy talk about progress from \nthe President. They need more than a public relations campaign.\n  They need an effective plan to end the violence, and stabilize Iraq, \nso they can come home with dignity and honor.\n  Reality is hard medicine to swallow. Facts are stubborn. As the \nValerie Plame case makes increasingly clear, the administration stopped \nat nothing to cover up its misguided and dishonest decision to go to \nwar, and our servicemen and women, their families, and friends are \npaying an unacceptable price. They deserve better--much better from \ntheir President and so does the Nation.\n  It was wrong for the President to rush to war for such a deeply \nquestionable cause. President Bush once said that the war in Iraq was a \ncatastrophic success. He's half right in one sense. The war has been a \ncatastrophe--for our soldiers and their families, for the war on \nterrorism, and for America's standing in the world. It has made the \nUnited States more hated in the world than at any other time in our \nhistory.\n  Beyond the cost in human lives and to our national security, there \nhas been an enormous financial cost.\n  American taxpayers are spending $195 million each day in Iraq.\n  For the cost of fighting the war in Iraq for one day, we could make \nsignificant improvements in homeland security.\n  We could provide 4 million American households with emergency \nreadiness kits. We could close the crisis communications technology gap \nfor 41 small cities, 36 mid-sized cities, or 6 large cities, so that \nFederal, State and local first responders can talk to one another \nduring an emergency.\n  We could purchase 780 fire trucks for improving local emergency \nresponse capabilities, and we could employ 5,000 fire fighters, 4,000 \npolice patrol officers, or 7,000 paramedics and emergency medical \ntechnicians for one year each.\n  For the cost of fighting the war in Iraq one day, we could double the \nFederal budget for nuclear reactor safety and security inspections to \nensure that these potential terrorist targets are adequately protected.\n  We could pay for 1,100 additional border patrol agents to better \nguard our borders against potential terrorists.\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\n  We could provide 9,700 port container inspection units to detect \nhazardous materials being trafficked into the country.\n  Obviously, the $195 million a day we spend in Iraq could be better \nspent on the all-important areas of jobs, education, and health care, \nwhich the Senate is debating today. Instead of spending those funds in \nIraq, we could spend them on better teachers, better financial aid for \ncollege students, better health care for families, and countless other \npriorities whose budgets are being cut back because of Iraq. I ask \nunanimous consent that a document I've prepared outlining the various \nways $195 million dollars a day could be spent on pressing priorities \nat home be printed in the Record.\n  Instead of covering up mistakes in Iraq, it is time for the President \nto admit them, to adopt an effective strategy to end this war and begin \nto bring our troops home, and to stop ignoring the very real priorities \nfacing the Nation and the many many challenges facing us at home and \nabroad.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The Real Cost of the Iraq War to American Taxpayers--$195 Million per \n                                  Day\n\n       For the cost of fighting the war in Iraq for one day, we \n     could . . .\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n       One day in Iraq could provide 3.97 million households with \n     an emergency readiness kit.\n       One day in Iraq could close the financing gap for \n     interoperable communications in 41 small cities, 36 mid-sized \n     cities, or 6 large cities so that Federal, State and local \n     first responders can talk to one another during an emergency.\n       One day in Iraq could purchase 780 fire trucks for \n     improving local emergency response capabilities.\n       One day in Iraq could employ 4,919 fire fighters, 4,222 \n     police patrol officers, or 7,052 paramedics and emergency \n     medical technicians for one year each.\n       One day in Iraq could double the Federal budget for nuclear \n     reactor safety and security inspections to ensure that these \n     potential terrorist targets are adequately protected.\n       One day in Iraq could pay for 1,101 additional border \n     patrol agents to better guard our borders against potential \n     terrorists.\n       One day in Iraq could provide 9,750 port container \n     inspection units to detect hazardous materials being \n     trafficked into the country.\n       One day in Iraq could provide 1,332 explosive trace \n     detection portals for airport screening of passengers, as \n     recommended by the 9/11 Commission.\n       One day in Iraq could provide 6,290 local law enforcement \n     agencies with a bomb-detecting robot.\n       One day in Iraq could provide 4,875 narcotics vapor and \n     particle detectors.\n\n\n                               education\n\n       One day in Iraq could cover the full cost of attendance for \n     one year at a public college for more than 17,100 students.\n       One day in Iraq could provide more than 79,000 needy \n     college students with a Pell grant.\n       One day in Iraq could enroll 27,000 more children in Head \n     Start.\n       One day in Iraq could employ 4,269 elementary school \n     teachers or 4,027 secondary school teachers for one year.\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n       One day in Iraq could provide health insurance coverage to \n     344,500 working Americans to give them a break from the \n     rising cost of coverage.\n       One day in Iraq could provide health insurance coverage for \n     one year to 380,900 uninsured children in America.\n       One day in Iraq could employ 3,597 additional registered \n     nurses for one year.\n       One day in Iraq could immunize every person over 65 in the \n     U.S. against influenza 4.6 times over.\n       One day in Iraq could immunize every baby born in the U.S. \n     last year against measles, mumps, and rubella 14.2 times.\n\n\n                                 LABOR\n\n       One day in Iraq could provide unemployment benefits for \n     almost 722,000 unemployed Americans for one week.\n       One day in Iraq could fund Social Security retirement \n     benefits for one day for over 6.75 million Americans.\n       One day in Iraq could provide comprehensive safety and \n     health training to 121,875 workers.\n       One day in Iraq could pay for an increase of $3.34 per hour \n     in the wages of every minimum wage worker in the country.\n       One day in Iraq could provide paid sick leave to half a \n     million workers for an entire year.\n\n\n                              BASIC NEEDS\n\n       One day in Iraq could buy 71.55 million gallons of unleaded \n     regular gasoline.\n       One day in Iraq could pay for one year's gasoline \n     consumption for 97,500 Americans, even at today's elevated \n     prices.\n       One day in Iraq could buy 63.1 million gallons of fortified \n     whole milk.\n       One day in Iraq could buy 166.6 million cartons of large \n     Grade A Eggs sold by the dozen.\n\n\n                             INTERNATIONAL\n\n       One day in Iraq is equivalent to half of the Gross Domestic \n

Mr. President, today is a very somber day. The U.S. \nmilitary death toll reached 2,000 in Iraq, a figure that I--and every \nAmerican--hoped we would never reach. Our hearts go out to the families \nand friends of those who have lost loved ones.\n  I pray for these young Americans, may they rest in peace; and I pray \nfor their families, may they heal.\n  Let us honor their lives and their memory.\n  And let us honor the lives of those who continue to serve by \ndeveloping a credible plan for Iraq. It is time for this administration \nto level with the American people and provide a strategy for success.\n  As the current investigation into the leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame \nreminds us, this administration took us to war on false intelligence, \nmisstatements, and exaggerations.\n  This administration told the American people that we had no other \noption but to go to war because the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a \nthreat to the security of the United States. However, no weapons of \nmass destruction have been found, and there was no serious link between \nIraq and al-Qaida.\n  The administration also provided rosy scenarios and false \nexpectations about how the United States would be greeted as liberators \nin Iraq and how the war would be brief. In fact, Secretary of Defense \nDonald Rumsfeld actually said in February 2003 that the war ``could \nlast six days, six weeks. I doubt six months.''\n  Yet here we are, 2\\1/2\\ years later, lamenting the death of the \n2,000th soldier in Iraq. Of those 2,000 soldiers, 464 of these soldiers \nwere either from California or based in California.\n  Even as attacks on American soldiers continue, the administration \nrefuses to level with the American people. In May 2005, Vice President \nCheney proclaimed that: ``I think the level of activity that we see \ntoday in Iraq from a military standpoint, I think will clearly decline. \nI think they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.''\n  Since that day--since Vice President Cheney told us that violence was \ncoming to an end in Iraq--more than 300 Americans have lost their \nlives. And the violence continues to escalate.\n  Today we do not just lament the strategic disaster in Iraq, the loss \nof U.S. credibility around the world, and the overwhelming costs to the \nAmerican taxpayer. Above all, we mourn the tragic deaths of 2,000 young \nAmericans.\n  These men and women voluntarily put their lives on the line to defend \nus when they put on the uniform of the United States Armed Forces. They \nput their trust in the Government that we would only send them to war \nif there was no other recourse.\n  In rushing to war, in twisting and revising the case for war, and in \nfailing to plan for the aftermath of the war, this administration broke \nthe trust with these young men and women at a catastrophic cost.\n  These 2,000 young men and women have sons and daughters, husbands and \nwives, mothers and fathers, friends and extended family, all of whose \nlives have been forever changed by the consequences of this reckless \nwar.\n  Today, let us remember these 2,000 brave Americans. Let us honor \ntheir lives and their memory by bringing this war to an end.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we have reached a milestone in Iraq. Two \nthousand U.S. servicemembers have been killed, including 42 \nMarylanders. We must not talk about this in terms of just numbers and \nstatistics. Each individual has left behind a legacy, a unique life \nstory.\n  Today, I want to pause to remember five young men from Maryland who\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n\ndied in Iraq in the last 10 days: Army SGT Brian R. Conner, Army SPC \nSamuel M. Boswell, Army SPC Bernard L. Ceo, Marine LCpl Norman W. \nAnderson, III, and Army SPC Kendell K. Frederick. Our condolences go \nout to their families, as well as our gratitude and our appreciation \nfor these brave young men. To honor those who have died, we must \nremember the way they lived. Let me tell you about them:\n  SGT Brian R. Conner of Gwynn Oak, MD was just 36 years old. He was a \nmember of the Maryland National Guard's 243rd Engineer Company, in \nBaltimore. Sergeant Conner was one of three Army National Guardsmen \nkilled October 14 in an accident northwest of Baghdad. A tractor \ntrailer struck their humvee, setting it on fire and detonating \nammunition aboard. Sergeant Conner was a lieutenant in Baltimore Fire \nDepartment, having joined in 1993. He had served in the Maryland \nNational Guard since June 1989. Sergeant Conner leaves behind three \ndaughters, ages 10, 15, and 21, and his beloved 3-year-old grandson. He \nis survived by his mother Hortense Connor, his brother Paul Edwards, \nand sister Cherice Conner Davis. He is also mourned by his brothers and \nsisters in the Baltimore Fire Department. One family friend said of \nSergeant Conner: ``Brian was not only a great man who accomplished many \nof his dreams--he was someone loved and cared for. His values will live \non.'' May God bless Brian Conner.\n  SPC Samuel M. Boswell of Elkridge, MD, was 20 years old. He was also \nin the Army National Guard, killed in the same accident that took \nSergeant Conner's life. Specialist Boswell joined the National Guard in \nJune 2003, right after graduating from the technology magnet program at \nRiver Hill High School in Clarksville. He is mourned by his father, \nAnthony L. Boswell, and by his seven brothers and sisters. Describing \nhis youngest brother, Michael Boswell said, ``Sam was probably the \nhappiest person you'll ever meet. He was always walking around with a \nsmile on his face. . . . He always wanted to do things that would help \nother people whether he knew them or not.'' May God bless Sam Boswell.\n  SPC Bernard L. Ceo of Baltimore was 23 years old. He was the third \nmember of Maryland's Army National Guard killed on October 14. \nSpecialist Ceo enlisted in the Army in December 2001, joining the \nmilitary to help pay for college. He dreamed of being a teacher, and \nwhen he wasn't serving with the Guard, he worked with students with \nspecial needs at Kennedy Krieger High School Career and Technology \nCenter. Specialist Ceo was carrying on a proud family tradition of \nmilitary service: his father and several uncles served in Vietnam. He \nleaves behind his parents Rosemarie and Fred Ceo, fiancee Dajae \nOverton, and her two young children, whom he was raising as his own. \nSpecialist Ceo's coworker said, ``He was a thoughtful, introspective \nyoung guy. He would have been an excellent teacher.'' May God bless \nBernie Ceo.\n  Marine LCpl Norman W. Anderson, III, from Parkton, MD, was 21 years \nold. He served with the U.S. Marines' 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division, based at Camp Lejeune, NC. Lance \nCorporal Anderson was killed by a suicide car bomb on October 19 in \nKarabilah, near the Syrian border. He was a 2002 graduate of Hereford \nHigh School, where he was a running back on the football team. He \njoined the Marines in December 2003, and had already served one tour in \nAfghanistan. He is survived by his wife Victoria Anderson, his parents, \nRobyn and Norman, and his sister Brooke. The last time he was home he \ntold his mother that, if he was killed in Iraq, she should know that he \ndied doing what he wanted to do. May God bless Norman Anderson.\n  Army SPC Kendell K. Frederick, from Randallstown, MD, was 21 years \nold. He was an Army reservist, assigned to 983rd Engineer Battalion, in \nMonclova, OH, where he served as a mechanic who worked on power \ngenerators. Specialist Frederick was killed outside Tikrit when a \nroadside bomb detonated near the vehicle he was driving. He was a 2004 \ngraduate of Randallstown High School. Specialist Frederick leaves \nbehind his parents, Michelle Murphy and Peter Ramsahai, his stepfather \nKenmore Murphy, and two sisters and one brother. May God bless our \nKendell.\n  Mr. President, similar stories are being told in every community, \nacross the Nation. Stories about volunteers who left behind friends and \nfamily--in the case of guardsmen and reservists, they also left behind \njobs--to protect our country and help bring freedom to people of Iraq. \nWe honor their service and sacrifice, not just with words, but with \ndeeds.\n  First, we must support our troops, by ensuring they have the \nequipment they need to stay safe and accomplish their mission. Second, \nwe need a workable plan to drawdown our troops. Today, there are \n159,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. Our strategy for Iraq must be worthy of \nsacrifices they have made. We need to involve the international \ncommunity more, getting help to seal Iraq's borders and keep out \nforeign fighters and terrorists. We used to be at war with Iraq, now we \nare at war in Iraq with insurgents.\n  We must also continue to support Iraqi political process. The \nconstitution has been approved by more than 78 percent in an election \nthat included 63 percent of Iraq's registered voters. Iraq can now move \nforward with parliamentary elections. We should continue to support \ntheir progress toward democracy. We need better progress rebuilding \nIraq's military. Iraqis need to fight for Iraq. Our training program \nhas been slow to start. We seem to be making progress, but not fast \nenough. We should let our allies help us in this effort. Finally, let's \nget that Iraqi oil going, so they can start to pay their own bills.\n  We need to see faster progress on all these things. When these things \nhappen, we can begin to withdraw our troops in stages and bring them \nhome. Our military men and women have sacrificed in Iraq. They honored \nour country by volunteering to serve. We must honor them with an \neffective plan to finish their work, and bring our troops home.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMikulski of Maryland be recognized for 10 minutes to speak and that I \nbe allowed to follow her to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today we reach a milestone in Iraq.\n  Two thousand U.S. service members were killed, including four \nMarylanders.\n  A few weeks from now we will be celebrating Thanksgiving. For 2,000 \nfamilies, there will be forever and a day an empty chair.\n  The 2,000 members of our armed services who died, we cannot think \nabout them in numbers and statistics. We in Maryland have lost 42 \nsoldiers, and most recently we have lost 5 in just this last week \nalone. Each individual left behind a legacy, a unique story.\n  Today, as I come to the Senate floor, I wanted to remember the five \nyoung men who died in the last 10 days, tell you their names, and tell \nyou a little bit about them. Army SGT Brian R. Conner, Army SPC Samuel \nM. Boswell, Army SPC Bernard L. Ceo, Marine LCpl Norman W. Anderson, \nIII, Army SPC Kendell K. Frederick.\n  Our condolences go out to their families, as well as our gratitude \nand our appreciation for those who have died. To honor those who have \ndied, we must remember the way they lived.\n  Let me just tell you about them. SGT Brian Connor was only 36, a \nmember of the Maryland National Guard's 243rd Engineer Company. He was \none of three Army National Guardsmen killed on October 14 northwest of \nBaghdad. Their humvee carrying munitions was set on fire and detonated. \nThe ammunition exploded and all three died. Sergeant Conner, Specialist \nBoswell, and Specialist Ceo.\n  Sergeant Conner was a lieutenant in the Baltimore Fire Department. He \njoined in 1993. But he was a real star. He rose quickly through the \nranks to become a lieutenant. The firehouse put his hat and his coat \naside as a perpetual remembrance. He leaves behind three daughters, one \n10, one 15, the other 21, and a grandson he loved so much.\n  A family friend said about Sergeant Conner:\n\n       Brian was not only a great man who accomplished many of the \n     dreams, he was someone who loved and cared for people. His \n     values will live on.\n\n\n[[Page S11803]]\n\n\n  God bless Brian Conner.\n  Then there is SPC Samuel Boswell from Elkridge, MD, another guy from \nthe Army National Guard, killed in that same accident. He joined the \nGuard in 2003. He had just gotten out one of our technology magnet \nschools called River Hill High School in Clarksville. He was one of \neight brothers and sisters. He joined the military because he wanted to \nhave a future. He wanted a long career, and he wanted to follow the \nAmerican dream while protecting the American homeland. Here is what \nMichael Boswell said about his brother:\n\n       Sam was probably the happiest person you'll ever meet. He \n     was always walking around with a smile on his face. He always \n     wanted to do things that would help other people whether he \n     knew them or not.\n\n  God bless you, Samuel Boswell.\n  Then there was Specialist Bernard L. Ceo, from Baltimore. He was just \n23. He enlisted in the Army in December 2001 to help earn money for \ncollege. Specialist Ceo dreamed of being a teacher, and when he wasn't \non duty as Guardsman, he worked with students with special needs at the \nKennedy Krieger High School Career and Technology Center. He was \ncarrying on a proud family tradition of military service--his father \nand several uncles had served in Vietnam. Specialist Ceo leaves behind \nhis parents, Rosemarie and Fred, his fiancee Dajae Overton, and her two \nchildren, whom he was raising as his own. God bless you, Bernie Ceo.\n  Then there was Norman Anderson, III from Parkton, MD. He was a marine \nbased in Camp Lejeune. He was killed on October 19. A suicide bomber \nkilled him. He had just graduated in 2002 from Hereford High School, \nwhere he was a running back on the football team. Under the Friday \nNight Lights this week, they took his helmet and his sweatshirt and put \nthem aside. The team gave him a salute. They really knew that Norman \nAnderson gave one for the Gipper and one for the United States of \nAmerica. He joined the Marines in December 2003. He already served one \ntour in Afghanistan. He came back home and was recently married to a \nwonderful woman named Victoria. But he went back into the field one \nmore time because he felt it was his duty. The last time he was home, \nhe told his mother if he died she should know that he died doing what \nhe wanted to do.\n  God bless Norman Anderson, III.\n  Then we come to Kendell K. Frederick, U.S. Army, only 21 years old, \nfrom Randallstown, MD. He was in an engineering battalion. He was a \nmechanic who worked with power generators. He wanted to do something \nfor his country as wells as for himself. He graduated from one of our \ncommunity high schools called Randallstown High School. He was killed \noutside Tikrit. A roadside bomb detonated near the vehicle he was \ndriving. He leaves behind his parents, a stepfather, and other family \nmembers. He had two sisters and one brother. But he was willing to go \ninto the military in order to be able to earn what he needed to earn to \nbe able to go on to college.\n  All of Randallstown mourns our Kendell. We want to say to Kendell \nFrederick, God bless you.\n  Senators of the U.S. Senate, and to all who are watching, those are \nfive Marylanders. Knowing they will never be back, we can never forget \nthem. The best way for a grateful nation to honor them is to stand up \nfor our troops. We need to make sure they have the right pay, that they \nhave the right benefits, that they have the right equipment to protect \nthemselves. We also need to have a workable plan to draw down our \ntroops. Our strategy for Iraq must be worthy of the sacrifices our \ntroops have made. The U.N. needs to get more involved in international \nburden sharing--in securing Iraq's borders. We need to continue \nsupporting the Iraqi political process, and work with our allies to \nboost training for the Iraqi military. Iraqis want to fight for Iraq, \nand they should. Finally, let's get that Iraqi oil going, so they can \npay their own bills. We need to see faster progress on all these \nthings. When these things happen, we can begin to withdraw our troops \nand bring them home with the honor they have earned.\n  God bless our men and women in the U.S. military and all those who \npassed on. And wherever there is an empty chair, we should always fill \nit with our hearts and our remembrance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Frist and \nSenator Reid for this extraordinary occasion, for this bipartisan \nmoment of silence.\n  Today, we learned that our Nation had crossed a tragic threshold: \n2,000 American service men and women have now been killed in Iraq, and \nmore than 15,000 of our sons and daughters have been injured and have \nsuffered painful and permanent injuries.\n  All are equal in their tragedy. The 2,000th death is no more \nheartbreaking than the first or the 50th. But the enormity of this \nlost--of 2,000 of our best and bravest--breaks America's heart.\n  We have seen their pictures. When you look at the faces of the \nfallen, you are struck by several things.\n  First, you are overwhelmed by how young they are. Three hundred and \nfifty-seven of these men and women never saw their 21st birthday.\n  As a father, I cannot imagine a greater grief than losing a child so \nyoung.\n  When you see the photos of our fallen heroes, you are struck by the \nresolve in their faces. They were young but they had courage, a sense \nof duty and purpose to volunteer and defend America.\n  In a few cases, you are also struck by some of the faces that are \nquite old. The oldest American killed in Iraq was 60 years old. The \nfaces look like America because they are America. Most were born here. \nSome were Americans and soldiers by choice.\n  These 2,000 of our best and bravest came from every State of the \nUnion and from the Territories. Seventy-nine were from my home State of \nIllinois. Almost half of those killed were soldiers in the Army, but \nmembers of this saddest of all rollcalls came from every branch of the \nservice.\n  About one in four of those killed were members of the National Guard \nand Reserve, one more measure of the enormous sacrifice that these \nbranches of our service are making.\n  All of these fine men and women volunteered to serve their country. \nAll 2,000 gave their lives in that service.\n  The great World War II correspondent, Ernie Pyle, wrote a book \nentitled ``Brave Men.'' It is a collection of some of his best writing \nin the European theater. This is what he wrote in the dedication:\n\n       In solemn salute to those thousands of our comrades--great, \n     brave men that they were--for whom there will be no \n     homecoming, ever.\n\n  It is right that we honor the sacrifices of the great, brave men and \nwomen we have lost in Iraq and the sacrifices of their families and \nloved ones.\n  But words alone are not enough. We owe our fallen soldiers and their \nfamilies answers. We owe them accountability. We owe them leadership as \nbrave as their service. America cannot allow our Nation to drift into a \nwar without end in Iraq.\n  GEN John Abizaid, the Commander of U.S. Central Command, said \nrecently that the key to military success in Iraq ``is whether we can \nlearn from our mistakes.''\n  We owe it to those who have fallen, to their loved ones, and to those \nwho are still in harm's way, to change course when needed.\n  Our troops adapt to changing tactical situations on the ground--and \nso, frankly, do our enemies. Political leaders in Washington must do no \nless.\n  Earlier this month, the people of Iraq voted on a constitution. In \nDecember they are scheduled to hold parliamentary elections, and then, \nwe hope, a new government will take over that can lead Iraq forward.\n  These are important milestones. They should be milestones not only \nfor the Iraqis but for our troops as well. Each step the Iraqis take \ntoward the successful establishment of self-governance should bring our \ntroops a step closer to home.\n  Today is not a day to cast blame or question past decisions. Today is \na day to mourn our dead, to honor their service and to extend our most \nheartfelt thoughts and prayers to their families. But we cannot put off \na debate over the best course for the future. Two thousand brave \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have given their lives for \nAmerica. More than 15,000 have suffered devastating, life-changing \nwounds. Over 150,000 still stand in harm's way.\n  The choice we face in Iraq is not a choice between resolve or \nretreat. The\n\n[[Page S11804]]\n\nmen and women in our military and their loved ones deserve a clear path \nto stability in Iraq so they can come home as soon as humanly possible. \nWe do not honor our fallen soldiers simply by adding to their numbers. \nAt some moment today or very soon we will cross that sad threshold and \nbegin the count toward another thousand lives.\n  The American people and every elected leader of both political \nparties owe it to our soldiers and their families to never allow this \nwar in Iraq to drift and stall as lives are lost and bodies are broken. \nOne more soldier's life lost in Iraq is one too many. The 2,000 \nfunerals, 2,000 flag-draped coffins, 2,000 grieving families--America \nmourns the loss of these brave soldiers. America's leaders must \nredouble their efforts 2,000 times over to bring this war to an end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the majority leader to understand how \nmuch I appreciate his breaking up his schedule to come here to offer \nthis unanimous consent request. I appreciate it very much.\n  As I indicated a short time ago, the solemnity of this occasion is \nsignificant. I want the record to reflect that we have reached, as has \nbeen said here several times today, regrettably, a milestone in Iraq; \nthat is these 2,000 killed. Frankly, Mr. President, it is no longer \n2,000. It is now 2,002.\n  There has been--and will continue to be--heated debate about our \ninvolvement in Iraq, about the flawed pre-war intelligence that some \nsay existed, and it appears pretty certain at this time, the selling of \nthe war by administration officials, the poor planning, and the \nideologically driven attempt by the President and others to reshape the \nMiddle East through the force of arms.\n  These debates will go on, and they should. That is what our country \nis all about. But today--right now this minute--I think it is \nappropriate to set the debate aside and reflect on this solemn mark \nthat we have reached so that we can pay tribute to the heroic services \nand the sacrifice that each of these brave Americans made to our \nNation.\n  A few months ago, I was able to travel along with a number of my \ncolleagues to the Middle East where I spent time with scores of \nNevadans serving in Iraq. Any one of us who traveled to the region \nmeets with U.S. troops and comes back so impressed and so proud of the \nmen and women who serve our country. Many are young, as Senator Durbin \nhas so graphically described, just out of high school, and this is \ntheir first time out of the country. Others are more senior, having \nserved in the first Gulf war or in Afghanistan. Most were given short \nnotice, year-long deployment, and were serving away from family, \nchildren, spouses, parents and friends.\n  The Nevada Guard unit that I spent time with was tasked with \ntransporting critical supplies from Kuwait through Iraq and into \nBaghdad to support combat forces. These were dangerous missions, \ncarried out with the real possibility of an attack by Iraqi insurgents.\n  I also met with some young Marines from Nevada who were assigned to \nprotect U.S. facilities in the fortified Green Zone. Eager, \nenthusiastic, and with a great sense of spirit, these young men took \npride in their duties, and we took great pride in them.\n  But there can be no question that the effort in Iraq has taken a huge \ntoll on Americans, and on Nevadans.\n  So far, 13 Nevadans have died in this conflict. But the number 13 \ndoes not tell the whole story.\n  Let me take just a minute. I will be brief. But I would like to, as \nmy dear friend, the junior Senator from Maryland, outlined, tell you \njust a little bit about these 13 Nevadans.\n  Marine LCpl Donald Cline, Jr., of Sparks as the first Nevada soldier \nto die in Iraq. During the initial invasion of Southern Iraq, LCpl \nCline was killed in combat while assisting injured soldiers on March \n23, 2003. He left behind a wife and two sons, Dakota and Dylan.\n  Marine 1LT Frederick Pokorney of Nye was killed in action on March \n23, 2003. He left behind a wife and a 3-year old daughter. Lieutenant \nPokorney was the first Marine from Operation Iraqi Freedom to be buried \nin Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Sgt Eric Morris of Sparks was only six weeks into his tour of duty \nwhen he was killed by a homemade bomb on April 28, 2005. He was awarded \nthe Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his bravery.\n  Marine Cpl William I. Salazar of Las Vegas was killed on October 15, \n2004, in a suicide bomb attack. Corporal Salazar was the first Marine \ncombat photographer to be killed in action in more than 35 years. He \ndied on his father's birthday.\n  Marine PFC John Lukac of Las Vegas was killed on October 30, 2004, \nwhen his convoy was attacked. The son of immigrants who escaped \nCommunist rule in Czechoslovakia, Private Lukac had been interested in \njoining the Marines since the age of 12.\n  LCpl Nicholas Anderson of Las Vegas died on November 12, 2004, when \nhis Humvee crashed. It had only been one year since he graduated from \nBonanza High School.\n  Army PFC Daniel Guastaferro of Las Vegas was determined to join the \nArmy, despite suffering a snowboarding injury that left him with a \nsteel plate in his arm. Private Guastaferro died on January 7, 2005, \nwhen his vehicle ran off the road. He was 27 years old.\n  Marine LCpl Richard A. Perez, Jr. of Las Vegas died in a truck \naccident on February 10, 2005. LCpl Perez enlisted in the Marines \nshortly after his graduation from Coronado High School and volunteered \nto go to Iraq. He died only 10 days before he was supposed to return \nhome.\n  Cpl Stanley Lapinski died on June 11, 2005 from injuries sustained in \na roadside explosion. After college, he worked at several jobs, finally \nwinding up at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. September 11 prompted \nhim to join the Army. The 37-year old was known in his unit as \n``Pops.''\n  Marine Cpl Jesse Jaime of Henderson was killed on June 15, 2005 when \nthe vehicle he was riding in hit an explosive device. The 22-year-old \nhad followed his twin brother's footsteps by enlisting in the Marines.\n  Spc Anthony S. Cometa of Las Vegas was killed on June 16, 2005 when \nhis Humvee flipped over. He was a member of the 1864th Transportation \nCompany, which I met with when I visited Kuwait and Iraq. Specialist \nCometa was the first Nevada Army National Guard soldier to die in Iraq. \nHe died just one day after his 21st birthday.\n  2LT James J. Cathey of Reno was killed by a roadside bomb on August \n21, 2005. After graduating from the University of Colorado in 2004, he \nheaded to Quantico, VA, for officer training. Known as ``Cat,'' Cathey \nand his wife had just found out they were going to have their first \nchild before he left for Iraq.\n  Spc Joseph Martinez of Las Vegas was killed on August 27, 2005. He \nwas killed in combat while serving his second tour of duty in Iraq. His \nmother said he always wanted to be a soldier.\n  To all of these Nevada families--and to the families of all 2,000 \nU.S. troops who have fallen in Iraq--our Nation will forever be in debt \nto you. Your sons and daughters are heroes, and their sacrifice will \nnever be forgotten.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2226\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2226, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2226.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that certain local educational agencies shall be \n eligible to receive a fiscal year 2005 payment under section 8002 or \n      8003 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. APPLICATIONS FOR IMPACT AID PAYMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 8005(d) \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 7705(d)(2) and (3)), the Secretary of Education shall \n     treat as timely filed, and shall process for payment, an \n     application under section\n\n[[Page S11805]]\n\n     8002 or section 8003 of such Act (20 U.S.C. 7702, 7703) for \n     fiscal year 2005 from a local educational agency--\n       (1) that, for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 2004, \n     submitted an application by the date specified by the \n     Secretary of Education under section 8005(c) of such Act for \n     the fiscal year;\n       (2) for which a reduction of more than $1,000,000 was made \n     under section 8005(d)(2) of such Act by the Secretary of \n     Education as a result of the agency's failure to file a \n     timely application under section 8002 or 8003 of such Act for \n     fiscal year 2005; and\n       (3) that submits an application for fiscal year 2005 during \n     the period beginning on February 2, 2004, and ending on the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, Senate amendment No. 2226 will provide \nImpact Aid to the children of the service personnel in Fort Carson, CO. \nIt will restore $1.2 million in needed educational Impact Aid funding \nto the El Paso school district. The money for this amendment has \nalready been appropriated and sits within the Department of Education. \nThe El Paso school district educates thousands, serving our men and \nwomen at the Fort Carson military base. Many loved ones of the students \nand staff of the El Paso school district have been deployed to Iraq as \npart of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In fact, over 11,000 soldiers from \nFort Carson are currently deployed in Iraq today. That is one-half of \nthe fort's total force.\n  Due to a technical error, the Department of Education denied the \nschool district access to $1.2 million set aside for that school \ndistrict's program. The result is the district may have to eliminate as \nmany as 12 teachers and teachers' aides positions. This amendment \nsimply corrects a technical error between the district and the \nDepartment of Education and permits the school to access money already \nset aside for it.\n  I note, too, that I have discussed this issue with the HELP \nCommittee.\n  Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy have graciously consented to \nthe inclusion of this amendment on this bill. I have also been in close \ncontact with Senators from Arizona and New Mexico who face similar \nchallenges. They support this measure as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set this amendment aside to \ncall up amendment No. 2224 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would suggest, if I may, that we \nconclude action on this amendment, with a brief reply by this side, so \nwe can move ahead with the amendment, anticipating its adoption. I \nthink that would be a more orderly process. So technically, I do \nobject--with that suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I said, I think it is preferable, as a \nprocedural matter, to take up the amendments one at a time so we can \nconclude debate on the amendments.\n  I believe this amendment is a good amendment. It would permit the \nSecretary of Education to treat as timely filed applications from El \nPaso, CO, school district and Window Rock, AZ, for impact aid. There is \nno cost involved. There is sound explanation as to why they were not \ntimely filed.\n  In order for the Secretary of Education to make the payments, there \nneeds to be legislative action. The Senator from Colorado has provided \nthe vehicle for doing so. I support the amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I would then ask my friend from \nPennsylvania whether we should move for unanimous consent on the \nadoption of the amendment I just proposed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment on impact aid, I urge its \nadoption, or you can articulate it for unanimous consent to be adopted. \nOne way or another, let's adopt it and move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2226) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I also thank the \nchairman of the committee, my friend from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2224\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2224 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2224.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Education to conduct a study to \n evaluate the effectiveness of violence prevention programs receiving \n   funding under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), add the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. The Secretary of Education shall conduct a study \n     to evaluate the effectiveness of violence prevention programs \n     receiving funding under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \n     Communities Act (20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) based on, among \n     other things, evidence of deterrent effect, strong research \n     design, sustained effects, and multiple site replication. The \n     study shall also include information on what regular \n     assessment mechanisms exist to allow the Department of \n     Education to evaluate the efficacy of such programs on an \n     ongoing basis. Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education shall \n     submit a report to Congress describing the findings of the \n     study.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I am a proponent of evaluating the \neffectiveness of the actions we take and the programs we enact here in \nthis Capitol. That is because I believe that results do matter. At the \nend of the day, we can all say what we tried to do, but Americans will \njudge us by the results we achieve. We all have a responsibility to see \nthat taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and well.\n  Amendment No. 2224 is a ``results matter'' amendment. It will simply \nrequire the Department of Education to conduct an assessment of the \neffectiveness of youth violence prevention programs.\n  These programs are vitally important in my home State of Colorado and \nacross the Nation. During my time as Colorado's attorney general, I \nspent much of my time working on the investigation of the horrific \nmurders involving many young people at Columbine High School, which \nremains today the bloodiest school shooting in American history.\n  As we worked to learn the lessons from that terrible tragedy in \nColorado, we also attempted to implement programs in our schools to \ncreate safer schools and safer school communities. As I went through \nthe process of assembling information about how we create the safest \nschool environments possible, it became obvious to me that though we \nspend literally hundreds of millions of dollars on programs intended to \ndeal with the issue of youth violence prevention, we do not know \nwhether many of those programs work. Indeed, when we look at the facts \nand we look at what the science tells us, many of those programs \nactually harm our children more than they actually help our children.\n  So it is important we measure the effectiveness of these programs. \nThis amendment will ask the Department of Education to do exactly that. \nI believe our violence prevention programs should actually work and \nthat we should be able to measure them with the results we intend them \nto have. We owe it to the next generation to ensure that these programs \nare as effective as possible in preventing youth violence. This \namendment will do this by providing an assessment of the programs.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of amendment No. 2224.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the amendment calls for the Secretary of \nEducation to undertake a study to evaluate the effectiveness of \nviolence prevention under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program. I \nthink it is a good idea.\n  So frequently we make appropriations for certain purposes and never \nhave any concrete idea as to how well the programs are working. One \narea analogous to this is the money we spent on literacy training and \njob training, so-called rehabilitation in our correctional system. It \nis not enough we spend the funding, never having an idea as to really \nwhat works and what\n\n[[Page S11806]]\n\ndoes not work in terms of stopping recidivism.\n  I believe the Senator from Colorado has struck a good idea. I support \nthe amendment and join with the Senator from Colorado in urging its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2224) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2225\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2225 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2225.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a study of national service programs in the \n                          rural United States)\n\n       On page 196, strike line 14 and insert the following:\n     tional poverty level: Provided further, That the Corporation \n     shall use a portion of the funds made available under this \n     heading to conduct an evaluation, after consultation with \n     experts on national service programs and rural community \n     leaders, of programs carried out under the national service \n     laws (consisting of that Act and the National and Community \n     Service Act of 1990) in rural areas, to determine utilization \n     of the programs and to develop new and innovative strategies \n     that would prioritize geographic diversity of the programs \n     carried out under the national service laws to increase the \n     presence of the programs in rural areas.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, amendment No. 2225 also makes sure that \nour national service programs effectively serve all of our citizens. \nThis amendment calls on the Corporation for National and Community \nService to report on efforts to bring its programs to rural \ncommunities.\n  These programs include, first, the AmeriCorps program, which has done \nwonders, which was created in 1994 and provides opportunities for more \nthan 70,000 Americans to work in 3,000 public agencies, faith-based and \nother community organizations. Through the various AmeriCorps programs, \nvolunteers tutor and mentor youth, build affordable housing, teach \ncomputer skills, take care of our environment, and help communities \nrespond to disasters. In exchange, they are given an opportunity to \nbuild career skills, to invest in a community, and are provided a small \neducational stipend.\n  The programs also include Senior Corps, which recognizes that seniors \nare one of America's most vital resources.\n  The programs also include Learn and Serve America. Learn and Serve \nAmerica supports schools, higher education institutions, and community-\nbased organizations that engage students, their teachers, and others in \nservice-learning. Through Learn and Serve, students get their hands \ndirty. Service-learning connects teaching in the classroom with \ncommunities. Nearly 1 million students participated in Learn and Serve \nprograms last year.\n  The resources marshaled by these service programs--students, elders, \nand energized and committed people--can help unlock the door to rural \ndevelopment in America. It is my hope that the corporation will come up \nwith new and innovative strategies for increasing rural participation \nin national service programs. This amendment will not cost additional \nmoney and has the potential to benefit rural communities throughout the \nNation. We owe it to our rural communities to make sure our national \nprograms are serving them. We must not allow rural America to be left \nbehind by these very important national service programs.\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 2225 would direct the Corporation of \nNational and Community Service, CNCS, to conduct an evaluation of the \npresence of their programs in rural America. The study would include \nprograms funded by the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 and the \nNational and Community Service Act of 1990, presence in Rural America. \nIn addition, CNCS, in consultation with national service experts and \nrural community leaders, is directed to develop new and innovative \nstrategies to prioritize increasing rural communities' participation in \nCNCS programs. The amendment does not require additional funding.\n  As per Jane Oates at 4-8460, Senator Kennedy has no objections to the \namendment.\n  As per Beth Beuhlmann at 4-6770, Senator Enzi is reviewing the \namendment language, but appears to have no objections since the \namendment is cost neutral.\n  As per Brandon Avila at 606-6728, Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service, Office of Legislation and Government Affairs, they \nare reviewing but are supporting of conducting evaluations that help \nincrease CNCS programs in rural areas.\n  In addition, we have touched base with Voices for National Service, a \nnational service non-profit coalition. They are very supporting of the \namendment's intent.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of amendment No. 2225.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before the amendment is adopted, I would \nlike to have an opportunity to speak on this side of the aisle.\n  This amendment would use a portion of the funds for the Corporation \nfor National and Community Service to do a study of national service \nprograms in rural areas. I think, again, this is a good idea which the \nSenator from Colorado is offering. Rural areas are too often \nunderserved and underfocused. Pennsylvania has more people living in \nrural areas than any other State in the Union. It might be surprising, \nbut we do.\n  I think it is a good amendment, and I will now defer to the Senator \nfrom Colorado for urging its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2225) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2223\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, finally, I call up amendment No. 2223 and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2223.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the safe and drug-free schools and \n                          communities program)\n\n       At the end of title III (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __. In addition to amounts otherwise appropriated \n     under this Act, there is appropriated, out of any money in \n     the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, an additional \n     $15,000,000 to carry out subpart 1 of part A of title IV of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7111 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, amendment No. 2223 addresses a serious \nand growing problem that we face in our urban and rural communities. As \nattorney general of Colorado, I saw firsthand the growth of \nmethamphetamine problems in communities throughout my State. Meth usage \nhas increased in rural towns and communities across our Nation.\n  Some of the facts are startling.\n  According to the National Association of Counties, meth use is the \nNation's most serious local drug problem today.\n  Secondly, 58 out of 500 county law enforcement officials have said \nmethamphetamine use is, in fact, their largest problem.\n  Third, 87 percent of county law enforcement officials reported \nincreases\n\n[[Page S11807]]\n\nin meth arrests in just the last 3 years. In the West, methamphetamine \nuse is a growing problem. Between 67 and 75 percent of the western \ncounties rated meth as their No. 1 drug problem.\n  The labs for meth production are rising in rural areas. Because meth \ncan be made in the home and has harsh effects on the environment, it is \neasier to hide from authorities in rural areas. Three of our most rural \nStates--Missouri, Iowa, and Tennessee--have the highest number of meth \nlabs, with over 5,000 meth labs in those three States alone. Meth labs \nin Colorado have been on the rise, with over 225 meth labs this last \nyear in my State.\n  In a report by Congressional Quarterly, the Drug Enforcement Agency \nsaid that meth use is the No. 1 drug threat in rural America. The \nproduction of meth has spiked, from 327 labs nationwide being busted in \n1995 to over 17,000 meth labs busted in 2005; that is, in a period of \n10 years, we have gone from busting 327 meth labs to over 17,000 meth \nlabs.\n  Our health infrastructure has dealt with the meth use increase as \nwell, with emergency room visits due to meth use doubling in 7 years.\n  This amendment I have proposed will restore $15 million in funding to \nthe Safe and Drug-Free Schools State grant program, which funds \nvirtually all of the drug prevention programs in our Nation, to ensure \nthat our schools and communities are as safe and drug-free as we can \nmake them. We need to help our young people understand the dangers of \ndrugs, including meth, and this amendment takes an important step \ntoward making this issue the Federal priority it should be.\n  Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would add $15 million to a \nprogram. While it is a very good program, regrettably, this would \nexceed the allocation which has been given to the subcommittee. I, \ntherefore, have to oppose it. It is subject to a point of order.\n  For the record, I raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, as amended, that the amendment provides \nbudget authority and outlays in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation under the fiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution on the \nbudget and, therefore, is not in order.\n  As I had discussed with the Senator from Colorado, this will require \n60 votes for the Senator from Colorado to prevail. So the choice is his \nas to whether we move ahead to vote on it at some point during the \nconsideration of the bill. I ask how the Senator from Colorado would \nlike to proceed.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the act for purposes of the pending amendment. I ask that \nwe dispense with a rollcall vote and that we just do a voice vote on \nthis amendment at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is acceptable, provided those on the floor can \nmuster a no which either exceeds the ayes or is so recognized by the \nChair to be the predominant voice vote. I call for the question on a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act in relation to amendment No. 2223.\n  In the opinion of the Chair, the motion has failed and the Senate has \nnot obtained the three-fifths majority necessary for passage. The point \nof order is sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Colorado for coming forward at \nthis early stage with these four amendments to help move processing of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania \nfor his leadership, not only on this bill but also on so many other \nimportant issues that we are working on in the Senate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2194\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Reed-Collins LIHEAP \namendment. I want to speak to all of my colleagues, but mostly I want \nto address my comments to my colleagues from the South and the West. I \nthank Senator Jack Reed and Senator Susan Collins for their \ncosponsorship of amendment No. 2194, bringing forward the issue of \nLIHEAP funding. We all know that LIHEAP funding has decreased in real \ndollars for over a decade now. Senators Reed and Collins have shown \ntrue leadership in offering their amendment. Hopefully, we will vote on \nit today. They have shown national leadership with what they are trying \nto accomplish.\n  In the face of rising energy prices, the poorest among us have been \nhit the hardest. They are paying about $3 at the pump right now. We \nhave had a record hot summer in many parts of the country. Their \nutility bills have been going up and up. Low-income families need our \nhelp. I believe we can do better. We can think of ways to help our low-\nincome constituents and low-income Americans. The Reed-Collins \namendment can do that. It adds $3.1 billion to the core LIHEAP program. \nThis is what Southern and Western Senators need to understand. I don't \nwant any of my colleagues to be surprised when the amendment comes to \nthe floor for a vote today. I hope that all their staff who are \nlistening will please advise their bosses accordingly. This money will \ngo to LIHEAP's core program.\n  When I say ``core program,'' that means it will not be designated as \nemergency funding for the Department of Health and Human Services. Why \nis that significant? It is significant for this basic reason. By giving \nthe money to the core program instead of HHS, the amendment helps put \nlow-income heating applicants in Southern and Western States on better \nfooting.\n  Let me explain. In the past, Health and Human Services has had \ndiscretion. When we put emergency funding there, they have had \ndiscretion on how they spend it. Their track record has been very \nclear. They seem to prioritize areas of the country that are heated \nwith home heating oil. What we are trying to do is put the money into \nthe core program, which means it goes into the formula that has been \nlong established in Federal law, which means in States all across \nAmerica--States such as Arkansas in the South and the West--people who \nare going to be facing record high prices for natural gas this winter \nwill receive some relief.\n  Unfortunately, when we get emergency funding, many of the States are \nnot helped as much as the formula would help them. I am not disputing \nat all that the Northeast and the Midwest face very harsh winters, more \nso than the South and some parts of the West. But we have low-income \ncitizens in our States, too, who need to heat their homes this winter. \nI believe it is a more effective and better way to put money into the \ncore LIHEAP program, sending it through the formula, rather than \nleaving it to the discretion of HHS.\n  I am happy to join Senators Reed and Collins in this effort. It is a \nbipartisan effort. I want my colleagues to understand that. In my view, \nit is better than past proposals. It is better because it is more \nequitable in its distribution. It is bipartisan. Southern and Western \nSenators have a chance to help the people in their States with this \nvote. It will help people all across America. This amendment also \nrecognizes the high cost of natural gas this winter. All the experts \nwho have looked at this say natural gas is going to be at a record high \nprice for consumers this winter. It acknowledges the high cost of other \nforms of energy to heat our homes.\n  I don't want my colleagues to be surprised when this comes to the \nfloor for a vote at some point this afternoon or tonight. I would hate \nfor any Senator to vote against this and then later learn that this is \ntheir best opportunity to help their constituents during this very cold \nand expensive winter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been proceeding reasonably well \non handling amendments. We had a short period between 12 and 12:30 \nwhere we did not have amendments pending. I understand we will have an \namendment presented at about 6 o'clock this evening. But that leaves us \nwith an hour and 22 minutes. The distinguished\n\n[[Page S11808]]\n\nSenator from Texas wishes to speak for 10 or 15 minutes. We can \naccommodate his schedule. We have quite a number of amendments which \nhave been filed and others where there has been an indication that \nthere will be amendments. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor. \nFloor time is hard to find. When this bill moves ahead tomorrow or the \nday after or Friday, the bill is going to be finished this week, \nhowever long it takes us. We are anxious to conclude the work of the \nSenate. Now is the time.\n  I yield to my distinguished colleague from Texas 10 to 15 minutes, as \nhe chooses, and ask unanimous consent for his recognition to speak for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nmanager of the bill, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I am honored to serve, for his accommodation. I certainly do not \nwant to detract from the efforts to complete this important \nappropriations bill. I do thank the Senator for yielding to me so I may \naddress some of the historic events occurring today in Iraq. This has \nbeen the subject of other speakers. I thought it was important that \nwhile this is on the minds of a lot of people, that we talk about some \nof our successes in Iraq and what the facts are with regard to what \nreality is like there on the ground.\n  I am disappointed to hear some Members, primarily on the other side \nof the aisle, this morning blaming America for the insurgency and \nclaiming that our military does not have a plan for victory. That is \nnot true as a factual matter, and they know it. As recently as a couple \nof weeks ago, we had the commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, \nGeneral George Casey, and the CENTCOM commander, General John Abizaid \nhere, along with Secretary Rumsfeld and others, to talk precisely about \nwhat conditions were like on the ground in Iraq, how our plan was \ngoing, and what the future looked like. We do have a plan, and I wanted \nto talk about it for a minute.\n  I want to note my concern that to use Iraq as a convenient political \nfootball only undercuts the brave young men and women who are fighting \nthere, not only on behalf of the beleaguered Iraqi people but on behalf \nof us here. We know that the central front in the war on terror today \nis in Iraq. We know that foreign fighters and other jihadists who \nadhere to an extremist ideology, who believe that they can use force to \nkill innocent Americans because they simply hate who we are and our way \nof life, that Iraq is where they are being drawn. If we leave \nprematurely, if we fail to finish the job that we have undertaken \nthere, then it will simply leave a haven available for those who want \nto train, recruit, and finance international terrorism and who will \nthen threaten us on our own shores, as we were hit dramatically on \nSeptember 11.\n  In reality, it is the critics of our military that have no plan. They \nsimply want to cut and run. They believe in retreat. The most \ndisturbing of all, their proposals serve merely to divide the American \npeople.\n  I am particularly concerned when I hear people make the argument, as \nI have heard on the floor of the Senate, that Iraq was not a threat to \nthe United States and the rest of the world. Perhaps these critics need \nto be reminded of the statement of President Clinton in 1998 which \nclearly lays out the threat that Iraq posed at that time. President \nClinton said, talking about Saddam:\n\n       What if he fails to comply, and we fail to act, or we take \n     some ambiguous third route which gives him yet more \n     opportunities to develop this program of weapons of mass \n     destruction . . . He will then conclude he can go right on \n     and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction. \n     And some day, some way, I guarantee you, he'll use the \n     arsenal.\n\n  This was on February 17, 1998, President Bill Clinton.\n  Then, on December 16, 1998, President Clinton said:\n\n       The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, \n     he threatens the well-being of this people, the peace of the \n     region, and the security of the world. The best way to end \n     that threat once and for all is with a new Iraqi government, \n     a government ready to live in peace with its neighbors, a \n     government that respects the rights of its people.\n\n  That was President Clinton on December 16, 1998. I am pleased that \nthis body passed that same year the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which \nstated:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic \n     government to replace that regime.\n\n  The Congress passed that legislation because, indeed, Saddam Hussein \nwas a threat in 1998 and remained a threat. Fortunately, today, he is \nno longer a threat. But we must stay the course.\n  Complaints without solutions are simply not productive. What are the \nproposals coming from those who criticize our current efforts in Iraq? \nSome complain that we don't have enough troops in Iraq to finish the \njob, but at the same time all they talk about is creating an arbitrary \ntimetable for cutting and running and bringing those troops home before \nthey finish the job, before we finish the job. Then others say our \npresence in Iraq actually creates additional terrorism. But what they \ndon't explain is what we would leave the Iraqis with if we were to \nleave prematurely. Again, complaints are not solutions.\n  GEN George Casey, whom I mentioned a moment ago, who is the leader of \nthe coalition forces in Iraq, said when he testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee:\n\n       We're in a tough fight but we've been in tough fights \n     before to advance the cause of democracy and to protect our \n     way of life. We should not be afraid of this fight. We and \n     the Iraqi people will prevail in this battle of wills if we \n     don't lose ours.\n\n  Again:\n\n       We and the Iraqi people will prevail in this battle of \n     wills if we don't lose ours.\n\n  Just this morning, we heard that the Independent Electoral Commission \nof Iraq has announced an overwhelming majority of Iraqis has approved \nthe country's constitution; that is, 78 percent of those who voted yes \nto approve that constitution which has now been cleared. You know what. \nTheir voter turnout was 63 percent, better than most elections we hold \nhere in the United States, given our long tradition of constitutional \ndemocracy.\n  Soon the Iraqi people will have a chance to elect their elected \nrepresentatives in parliamentary elections on December 15 which will \nprovide the final step in their march to democracy and self-\ndetermination.\n  Yes, the Nation of Iraq has made remarkable political progress in the \nlast 2 years, but they still have a way to go to achieve a fully \nfunctioning democracy. Last week, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and in her \neloquent remarks she clearly outlined the political and military \nstrategy in Iraq: Clear, hold, build. Clear, hold, build. That is to \nclear areas from insurgent control, to hold them securely, and to build \ndurable national Iraqi institutions.\n  I could not agree more with Secretary Rice. This is a strategy that \nhas been articulated for quite some time now by the President of the \nUnited States. This strategy is the only way we will see the blossoming \nof a democratic Iraq.\n  In 2003, not that long ago, the brutal reign of Saddam Hussein was \nbrought to an end. The Iraqi people were liberated and a provisional \ngovernment established. In 2004, a five-step plan was announced to end \noccupation in Iraq and to bring our troops home, and in 2005 that \ntransition is well underway.\n  Our strategy is working. The Iraqi people will vote in elections in \nDecember and soon will select a government that will serve them for the \nnext 4 years.\n  As I mentioned, Iraqi participation in these recent elections was \nvery strong, including among Sunnis who boycotted the earlier election \nlast January. These elections were also much more peaceful than the \nprevious elections. A clear path is being charted to implement the rule \nof law and we must continue our support for the Iraqi people to achieve \nsuccess.\n  It is clear that the implementation of the rule of law is the next \nstep, a necessary next step to achieve stability in Iraq. It is in the \nabsence of democracy, it is in the vacuum created by the absence of the \nrule of law, that there is no forum, no mechanism for justice to\n\n[[Page S11809]]\n\naddress grievances in which extremism will rear again its ugly head.\n  Only 2 short years ago the people of Iraq were oppressed by a brutal \ndictator. Those who privately yearned for freedom held their silence \nout of fear for their lives. No more. As it has been said before, \nfreedom is on the march.\n  Part of implementing law and justice, not to mention providing a \nmeasure of closure for the people of Iraq, is the trial of Saddam \nHussein which began on October 19. Unfortunately, this trial has been \npostponed because--and it comes as perhaps no surprise--the defense \nlawyers representing him said they needed more time to prepare.\n  Well, I for one do not begrudge them additional time, but it is not \nso much for them, because I doubt any level of preparation, any amount \nof investigation will absolve Saddam Hussein of the blood that is on \nhis hands, but I do believe that perception is important, and it is \nimportant that the public perception, the international perspective be \nthat this is, indeed, a fair proceeding and that Saddam Hussein, even \nthe most brutal of tyrants and dictators, is, indeed, entitled to the \nprotection of the rule of law and entitled to a fair process.\n  Of course, this trial is one of the first formal acts in the path to \nrestoring the rule of law, and it is important Iraq demonstrate to the \nworld that it can conduct this trial in a fair manner, as it is a \nfoundational and deeply symbolic proceeding.\n  A series of declassified U.S. intelligence documents and other U.S. \nagency reports provides a wealth of evidence substantiating Saddam \nHussein's human rights abuses and more evidence of Saddam's brutality \nis provided by the people of Iraq who had suffered under his boot heel \nfor years. A portion of these documents concerned Saddam's \nresponsibility, along with other members of his regime, for the \nmassacre in 1982 of Shiites in a town 35 miles north of Baghdad after \nan unsuccessful coup d'etat, including an attempt on the dictator's \nlife. It is said he may be tried at least a dozen times for crimes he \ncommitted during his regime, to include gassing of Kurds and \nsuppression of a Shiite uprising in the south. However, the Iraqi \nGovernment is reportedly considering foregoing additional trials if \nSaddam is convicted as expected and such conviction results in the \ndeath penalty under the laws of the sovereign nation of Iraq.\n  In remarks before the United Nations, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar \nZebari said that under the rule of Saddam Hussein, Iraq was ``a \nmurderous tyranny that lasted 35 years and today we are unearthing \nthousands of victims in horrifying testament.'' In a report entitled \n``Mass Graves: Iraq's Legacy of Terror,'' compiled by the United States \nAgency for International Development, it is estimated that nearly \n400,000 Iraqis lie buried in mass graves--Kurds, Shiites, Sunnis, \nEgyptians, Kuwaitis, Iranians, all killed because neither Saddam \nHussein nor his regime valued life in the least.\n\n  I am confident that some day in the not too distant future an \nappropriate measure of justice will be meted out to Saddam Hussein for \nthe atrocities he committed against his own people, the people of Iraq. \nAnd that is as it should be. I am sure that the symbolism of this first \ntribunal being held in Iraq to try their former dictator is not lost on \nthe people of Iraq. This restoration of the rule of law, this process \nwhich is designed to administer justice, is commensurate with the rule \nof law.\n  We must continue working with the Iraqi people to ensure that \ndemocracy, freedom, progress, free markets, self-governance, and the \nrule of law are allowed to flourish. It is the only way to promote \nstability in that country and throughout the greater Middle East.\n  There is no enemy on the face of the Earth that can defeat the people \nof the United States of America unless, of course, it is the American \npeople ourselves, by losing our resolve to stay the course, to finish a \njob that was just in its initiation and which is just in its goals. We \nmust stay the course. We must maintain our resolve. To hear the \ncomments of those here in this body and elsewhere who would attempt to \nhijack this just cause in the interest of political gamesmanship does \nnothing but harm our efforts, the resolve of the American people, and \nundermine the heroic and noble efforts being carried out on a daily \nbasis by our young men and women who are fighting in freedom's cause, \nnot just for us but for the people of Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the regular order is that we are back on \nthe bill, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2194\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, obviously, the amendment that is now \npending of the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Maine is \nan amendment I am sympathetic to. Those of us who come from the \nnorthern States, whether they be in the Midwest or New England, \nrecognize that winter can be a beautiful time. Snow is wonderful, \nlovely, and certainly brings skiers to our region, and we very much \nencourage that. But it can also be an extraordinarily difficult time, \ndifficult for people who are living on a fixed income, a set income, \ndifficult for folks who have to find ways to heat their home and also \nmeet the expenses of everyday life. Certainly keeping home heating is \nabout as important an expense as you can have in everyday life. It is \nespecially hard on senior citizens, seniors who have obviously fixed \nincomes in most instances. When the price of their fuel oil jumps \nsignificantly, they do not have a whole lot of opportunity to adjust \ntheir income because they are no longer earning a salary, usually, in \nmost instances in order to meet that increase in cost. We have \nobviously seen a dramatic rise in the cost of energy prices, especially \nhome heating oil and in the gas area for homes. So the issue becomes \nhow do we help these people who, through no action of their own, find \nthemselves in a dire financial situation and facing a very stark \nsituation this winter, should they not have the dollars necessary to \npay for their home heating oil.\n  We are talking about people of very low incomes, people who are on \nfixed incomes, in most instances people who are senior citizens, and \nthe Low-Income Heating Assistance Program which has been in place for a \nnumber of years has been a way of helping these people bridge this \nperiod, and it has always been focused on the neediest of the needy. It \nhas been a well-administered program, at least in the State of New \nHampshire where people who were clearly in distress, who have \nsituations where they simply are unable to afford the cost of keeping \ntheir home heated in the middle of an extremely cold winter, had a \nplace to go to get some assistance.\n  It is a good program for that reason. It has been strongly supported \nover the years in a bipartisan way. The administration has consistently \nfunded this program and has, to its credit, always released money early \nwhen it was necessary due to cold weather hitting us sooner than might \nhave been originally anticipated under the traditional weather \npatterns, which is what happened last year. But this year we do face \nthe unique situation of these huge runups in the cost of home heating \noil in New England specifically and, of course, the gas across the \nMidwest and into parts of New England, and this runup is a function of \na lot of different events. The Katrina situation is a big part of it. \nIt has disrupted the refining capacity of our Nation rather \nsignificantly. Obviously, the instability of the Middle East is another \npart of it. The demand which is now being created in parts of Asia, \nespecially China and India, as those economies expand, is part of it.\n  But whatever the reason, we are seeing a dramatic jump in the cost of \nhome heating oil specifically and therefore we know a lot of people, as \nwe head into winter--and believe me, it is getting cold in New \nHampshire. In fact, today there was a fair amount of snow in many parts \nof our State--we know these people are going to need some help, people \nof very low income, people who are living on very fixed and tight \nbudgets.\n  So it is appropriate that we expand the LIHEAP program to meet this \nunanticipated cost which is no fault of anybody's, certainly not those \nwho are receiving the benefit of this program.\n  The question is how do we expand this program? Over the last few \nweeks, we have had a number of attempts to expand this program. It \nreally was not\n\n[[Page S11810]]\n\nin a manner we call fiscally prudent or responsible, and we simply said \nwe are going to put a lot of money in this program, money not budgeted, \nmoney outside the budget, and do it in a manner which would have \nviolated the budget. So points of order were made against those \nproposals, and those points of order have all been sustained, and \nappropriately so.\n  We do have a budget under which we must live. The issue is how do we \nset priorities within that budget. Right now I believe one of our \nactions should be to set a priority to put more money into the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. We should absolutely do that, \nbut we should do it in a way that is responsible so we do not end up \npassing the bills for today's energy costs on to our children by \ncreating more debt.\n  I don't think senior citizens who benefit from the low-income energy \nprogram want us to go into debt to pay for their energy costs and end \nup with our children paying the cost of their energy today, when their \nchildren might need the same type of support and would be less able to \nget it if they had to pay for not only their energy costs but also pay \nfor the low-income energy costs of the last generation, the generation \nof today.\n  The proper way to do this is to increase the LIHEAP program in a way \nthat is fiscally responsible. The best way to do that is to look at \nwhat the need is, to begin with. The program costs or additional costs \nof the program, which we know will probably be generated as they can \nbest be projected, on top of the money already being spent on the \nprogram, which is about $2.4 billion, is about $1.276 billion.\n  This number of the additional cost increase, which is a fairly \nsignificant number--it is a lot of money--that was essentially reached \nby calculating the increase in energy cost as a result of a runup in \nenergy prices and finding out how much oil and gas was used last year \nby this program and then basically converting that to the increase in \nthe cost of the program.\n  So the number that has been generally agreed to around here as being \nthe correct number and the reasonable number and the number that would \nbe consistent with the historic needs of the program is $1.276 billion.\n  It is not me saying this, by the way. I didn't come to that number. \nActually, 41 Members of the Senate signed a letter saying that. They \nwrote the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee on September 20--not that long ago--and asked for an increase \nin the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program by $1.27 billion. \nSigning that letter were Senator Collins and Senator Reed, who are the \nauthors of the pending amendment, along with, as I mentioned, 41 other \nMembers, which is a fairly large number of the membership of the \nSenate, many of whom are from the Northeast. They reached that number \nthrough the calculations I just said. So that number is a reasonable \nnumber.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, signed by 41 Senators, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2005.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd: Hurricane \n     Katrina upset the lives of millions, displacing families from \n     their homes and inflicting severe economic damage. Without \n     question, the people of the Gulf region deserve our support, \n     and we stand ready to help. As the Appropriations Committee \n     considers an urgently needed comprehensive supplemental \n     appropriations bill to address Hurricane Katrina's \n     devastation as well as its economic and energy impacts on the \n     nation, we urge you to include $1.276 billion in emergency \n     Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds. \n     With this additional funding, the LIHEAP program will be able \n     to provide the same level of purchasing power as last year. \n     This funding is critical to avoid a looming, but preventable, \n     crisis for millions of additional Americans caused by the \n     soaring cost and diminishing affordability of home heating \n     fuel as winter approaches.\n       The effects of Hurricane Katrina are being felt by \n     Americans outside of the Gulf Region as gasoline, heating \n     oil, and natural gas prices rise in the wake of this \n     disaster. Indeed, there is an imminent emergency confronting \n     millions of low-income Americans unable to afford the cost of \n     rising energy prices. The current skyrocketing in energy \n     prices coupled with energy debt remaining from last winter \n     and this summer are leading to increased disconnections and \n     arrears among consumers as the winter heating season begins--\n     threatening the well-being of low-income families and \n     seniors. This situation warrants the provision of emergency \n     LIHEAP funding in the comprehensive supplemental request.\n       Prior to Hurricane Katrina's devastation in the Gulf \n     region, Americans were facing record prices for oil, natural \n     gas, and propane. Hurricane Katrina damaged platforms and \n     ports and curtailed production at refineries in the Gulf of \n     Mexico, the source of almost a third of U.S. oil output. \n     Crude oil for October delivery stands at over $66 a barrel on \n     the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil prices \n     increased dramatically after Hurricane Katrina. Prices \n     averaged $1.70 per gallon in July, but now stand over $2 per \n     gallon. Before Hurricane Katrina struck, the Energy \n     Information Administration (EIA) predicted a 16 percent \n     increase in heating oil costs. This increase comes on top of \n     the 34 percent increase during the 2003-2004 winter. Natural \n     gas prices also rose dramatically after Hurricane Katrina, \n     and now stand over $12, more than 140 percent increase \n     compared to last year at this time. EIA's Short-term Energy \n     Outlook reports, ``The ranges for expected heating fuel \n     expenditure increases this winter are 69 percent to 77 \n     percent for natural gas in the Midwest; 17 percent to 18 \n     percent for electricity in the South; 29 percent to 33 \n     percent for heating oil in the Northeast; and 39 percent to \n     43 percent for propane in the Midwest.'' Heating costs for \n     the average family using heating oil are projected to hit \n     $1,666 during the upcoming winter. This represents an \n     increase of $403 over last winter's prices and $714 over the \n     winter heating season of 2003-04. For families using natural \n     gas, prices are projected to hit $1,568, representing an \n     increase of $611 over last year's prices and $643 over 2003-\n     04. States need additional funding immediately to help \n     low-income families and seniors to ensure they can afford \n     to heat their homes. States are bracing for potentially \n     crisis conditions caused by the lack of affordable heating \n     sources, particularly for seniors and the disabled.\n       Almost daily, newspapers are reporting on the impacts of \n     higher energy costs for consumers. Hurricane Katrina's impact \n     on energy markets comes on top of soaring energy prices over \n     the past several years. Utilities from New England to Florida \n     to Oregon are seeking rate increases. In addition to rising \n     energy prices, the economic devastation in the Gulf region is \n     likely to impact the national economy. Many more Americans \n     will need LIHEAP assistance than the 5 million households \n     that received aid during FY 2005. State LIHEAP programs are \n     expecting a major increase in applications due to the rapid \n     increase in home energy prices and this additional funding \n     will allow them to address the need for assistance.\n       Residents and business affected by Hurricane Katrina \n     deserve the nation's full support and financial assistance, \n     and we stand ready and willing to do everything we can to \n     help. We recognize that the Committee is still working to \n     assess the needs wrought by Hurricane Katrina and will face \n     difficult priorities in determining emergency funding. We \n     feel that preventing hardship for millions of Americans by \n     acting to provide LIHEAP emergency funds before we have \n     another crisis on our hands is an important priority. Thank \n     you for your serious consideration of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Susan M. Collins, Jeff Bingaman, Olympia Snowe, Jack \n           Reed, Joe Biden, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Frank R. \n           Lautenberg, Debbie Stabenow, Carl Levin, Dick Lugar, \n           Chris Dodd, Evan Bayh, Patrick Leahy, Mike DeWine, Mark \n           Dayton, Jay Rockefeller, Barack Obama, Edward M. \n           Kennedy, Jon S.

Domenici, Tim Johnson, Ron Wyden, Norm Coleman, Jim \n           Talent.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think that establishes pretty \ndefinitively what the number is. In fact, I drafted an amendment, which \nI intend to offer at this time, which would increase the funding for \nlow-income energy assistance by an amount of $1.276 billion. The $1.276 \nbillion which is, I believe, the agreed-to number about which 41 \nMembers of this Senate, all of whom I believe are probably supporting \nvarious amendments in this area, signed a letter asking the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee to put in place an \nincrease in the LIHEAP program--is going to be the amount by which my \namendment increases the LIHEAP program.\n\n[[Page S11811]]\n\n  That is a significant increase, a rather dramatic increase, in fact, \nand it represents, as a percentage, probably about a 50-percent \nincrease in the program or well over a 50-percent increase; in fact, a \n58-percent increase in funding and, in fact, hits the target we need to \naim at in order to make sure that people of low incomes, living on \nfixed incomes, will have the necessary support they need to fund the \ncost of their energy this winter during the coldest months so they do \nnot have to be put in a situation where they choose between food and \nwarmth, something that would be inexcusable and inappropriate.\n  There is a further thing that my amendment does because I do believe \nin a fiscally responsible approach, and I believe Congress has an \nobligation to set priorities. There is no question in my mind that an \nimmediate priority for us is that we make sure that the low-income \nenergy assistance program is adequately funded heading into what will \nobviously be a difficult winter in light of the high energy costs. That \nshould be a priority of our Government. But in setting that priority, \nwe should not pass the debt, as I said earlier, of funding that program \non to our children. We should decide what we are going to cut or how we \nare going to reduce the rate of growth in spending at the Federal level \nto pay for this program.\n  So my amendment, in addition to adding this fairly significant, \nrather dramatic increase in funding to the LIHEAP program, and a number \nwhich was originally supported by the 41 signatories of the letter to \nthe Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, also \nputs in place an offset to pay for this.\n  The offset represents an across-the-board cut under this bill of all \naccounts. It comes out to be less than a 1-percent cut, a nine-tenths-\nof-1-percent reduction in spending across other accounts to pay for \nthis LIHEAP spending. That is the proper way to approach an issue such \nas this.\n  Let's determine whether or not it is a priority. If it is a \npriority--and I believe it is a priority--to fund LIHEAP, then let's \nfund it and not pass it on to our children.\n  That is what I do in this amendment. Rather than sending it up as a \nsecond degree, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Reed and Collins to the Fiscal Year 2006 Labor, HHS \nappropriations bill to appropriate $2.92 billion emergency funding for \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, (LIHEAP).\n  LIHEAP provides much needed assistance to Americans who might \notherwise be forced to choose between heating their home during the \nwinter months and putting food on the table for their family. In \nIllinois, 311,000 households received LIHEAP assistance last winter, \nout of 600,000 that applied. Clearly there is much more need than there \nare available funds.\n  If you have never experienced an Illinois winter, I can tell you that \nit can be bitterly cold. In January, the wind coming off of Lake \nMichigan near my house in Chicago will chill you to the bone. This \nyear, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association is projecting an \neven colder than average winter. As a result of colder temperatures and \nrising energy prices, the Department of Energy's Energy Information \nAdministration is predicting that families will be faced with \nsignificantly higher heating costs than last year. Those families whose \nhomes are heated primarily by natural gas will pay about $350 more this \nwinter, families in homes heated primarily by propane will pay an \naverage of $325 more, and families in homes heated primarily by heating \noil will pay, on average, as much as $378 more than last year.\n  With the expected increase in heating costs, there will be an \nincreased demand for LIHEAP assistance. Already this year, 100,000 \nIllinois households have applied for help with their heating bills for \nthe coming winter, a higher than average number for this point in the \nyear. The $2.92 billion in emergency funding proposed in this amendment \nwill supplement the $2.18 billion already contained in the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill to fully fund LIHEAP at a total of $5.1 billion.\n  Livable shelter is a basic human necessity. Without authorizing these \nemergency funds: we put the elderly, the disabled and the low-income \nfamilies that depend on this aid at risk. If we have learned anything \nfrom the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina, it is that we cannot afford to \nshortchange programs that provide assistance for the most vulnerable in \nour society.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2253\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2253.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase appropriations for the Low-Income Home Energy \n    Assistance Program by $1,276,000,000, with an across-the-board \n                               reduction)\n\n       On page 158, strike lines 12 through 21 and insert the \n     following:\n     bus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, $3,159,000,000.\n       For making payments under title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1981, $300,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended: Provided, That these funds are for the \n     unanticipated home energy assistance needs of one or more \n     States, as authorized by section 2604(e) of the Act: Provided \n     further, That the entire amount is designated as an emergency \n     requirement pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th \n     Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     year 2006.\n\n\n              general provision--reduction and rescission\n\n       Sec. __. (a) Amounts made available in this Act, not \n     otherwise required by law, are reduced by 0.92 percent.\n       (b) The reduction described in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to amounts made available under this Act--\n       (1) for the account under the heading ``low-income home \n     energy assistance''; or\n       (2) for the account under the heading ``Refugee and Entrant \n     Assistance'' (with respect to amounts designated as emergency \n     requirements).\n       Sec. __. (a) There is rescinded an amount equal to 0.92 of \n     the budget authority provided in any prior appropriation Act \n     for fiscal year 2006, for any discretionary account described \n     in this Act.\n       (b) Any rescission made by subsection (a) shall be applied \n     proportionately--\n       (1) to each discretionary account described in subsection \n     (a) to the extent that it relates to budget authority \n     described in subsection (a), and to each item of budget \n     authority described in subsection (a); and\n       (2) within each such account or item, to each program, \n     project, and activity (as delineated in the appropriation Act \n     or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering \n     such account or item).\n       (c) The rescission described in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to budget authority provided as described in subsection \n     (a)--\n       (1) for the account under the heading ``low-income home \n     energy assistance''; or\n       (2) for the account under the heading ``Refugee and Entrant \n     Assistance (with respect to amounts designated as emergency \n     requirements)''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the reason I sent this amendment up as a \nfirst-degree amendment is that I believe we have an understanding with \nSenator Reed and Senator Collins as to the voting sequence, and that is \nimportant, and that is why I originally asked to be protected with a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The amendment is now pending. Once again, to summarize what the \namendment does, it increases the funding for LIHEAP by $1.276 billion, \nwhich is the number which was asked originally of the administration \nabout a month ago by 41 Senators, including Senator Collins and Senator \nReed, in a letter sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nAppropriations Committee. It is a significant number. The number is \nreached by determining what the projected costs of the increased cost \nof energy will be to our citizens who are living on a fixed income.\n  Second, it is an amendment which is paid for where we recognize we \nhave a priority as a Government to participate in assisting these \nindividuals who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in dire \nstraits if the energy costs, with their significant jump in price, make \nit impossible for them to buy adequate heating oil to heat their\n\n[[Page S11812]]\n\nhomes, and in recognizing that priority, we pursue a policy of making \nsure that the moneys will be put into the LIHEAP program, but at the \nsame time it will be paid for by a reasonable, across-the-board cut, \nrelative to other programs within this bill, on the theory it would be \ninappropriate to simply raise this spending without doing an across-\nthe-board cut or without some adequate offset because that means we \nwould be deficit financing this number and thus passing this cost on to \nour children to pay, rather than absorbing the cost, as it should be \nabsorbed, by our generation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Grassley be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the thrust of the argument \nbeing advanced by the Senator from New Hampshire in terms of \nexpenditures. There is no doubt that the deficit is excessive. There is \nno doubt that the national debt is an enormous burden on our society. \nWhen we deal with the issue of energy assistance for the poor, there \nhas been a generalized agreement, as evidenced by the amendment offered \nby the Senator from New Hampshire, agreeing that there ought to be \nLIHEAP assistance.\n  He approaches it differently than the Reed-Collins amendment, which \ntreats the issue as an emergency, and instead has an across-the-board \ncut of almost 1 percent on all funding under this bill.\n  The bill is not cut to the bone. The bill, in its present shape, goes \ninto the bone. It does not have an increase for inflation. It has a \nvery marked shortfall on many programs. We heard one this morning on \neducation in the caption of Pell grants where there simply is not \nenough money to take care of the basic needs of these three \ndepartments.\n  Education and health care are our two major capital assets. Without \ngood health, people cannot function. Without a decent education, people \ncannot progress. This allocation of $145 billion is right to the bone.\n  We find ourselves in what I think is a genuine emergency situation \nwith respect to fuel assistance. It is as much an emergency as Katrina \nis to the people who are victims of that hurricane. That incident has \nmarkedly raised the cost of fuel oil and natural gas where people need \nit for heating.\n  Where we can appropriate the kind of dollars which we have for \nKatrina--and I am not questioning that--this is right in the same boat, \nto use an overused metaphor.\n  Much as we have problems with the deficit, much as we have problems \nwith the national debt, this is, I think, a genuine emergency, and the \naccounts on this bill simply cannot tolerate further cuts. Therefore, I \nam constrained to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition--I was about to suggest the absence of a quorum--but let me \nurge my colleagues to come to the floor, instead, and offer amendments. \nWe have an indication that there will be an amendment offered at 6 \no'clock. We may be in a position to vote on some amendments at that \ntime, if no other amendments are to be offered. But we have 47 minutes \nbetween now and 6 o'clock where there is ample time for someone to come \nto the floor a few minutes and offer an amendment.\n  It may be the offerer of the next amendment will be here at 5:30. I \nam advised there may be a change. That still leaves us 16 minutes. We \ncan get a lot done in 16 minutes, if somebody comes to the floor and \noffers an amendment. We don't like to waste any time, Mr. President. We \nhave a complicated bill here. Wait and see, tomorrow, the day after \ntomorrow, Friday, or whoever knows when this week we will finish this \nbill--and the majority leader and the managers are determined to finish \nthe bill--16 minutes will look like a lot of time.\n  I remind my colleagues about the argument over a unanimous-consent \nrequest for 1 extra minute last Thursday. We have those arguments from \ntime to time, sometimes made by experienced Senators who know that if \nyou object to a 1-minute unanimous consent request, it will take at \nleast 5 minutes to straighten it out. Eventually they got the \nminute. Mr. President, 15 or 16 minutes is a lot of time, so I urge my \ncolleagues to come to the floor.\n\n  In the interim, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed for up \nto 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, my understanding is we are on the \nappropriations bill. I will speak for 5 minutes or so on a subject \nunrelated to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Senator's right.\n\n\n                  Pentagon Clearance for Judith Miller\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of information around \nthis town about a New York Times reporter named Judith Miller. She has \nbeen central to a case that Mr. Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor, is \nlooking into. There is a lot of anticipation here about what or what \nmight not happen with respect to charges that might be filed. It has to \ndo with the disclosure of a covert CIA agent and who might have \ndisclosed her name and why. Judith Miller was a reporter for the New \nYork Times and Judith Miller spent some 80-plus days in jail because \nshe decided not to testify about that subject before a grand jury when \nrequested by the special prosecutor. She was subsequently released and \ndid testify.\n  I share the common interest in what has happened, what did the \nspecial prosecutor find, were there people in Washington, DC, who were \n``outing,'' as it were, a covert agent of the CIA, and if so, did they \nlie about it, did they obstruct justice. I don't know the answer and I \ndon't pretend to know the answer to any of that. As one colleague \nsuggested on television this weekend, these are not ``technical'' \nissues. There is no such thing as technical perjury. In any event, this \nis very important. But that is now why I am here now.\n  The reason I come to the Senate for a moment to mention Judith Miller \nis she wrote something in her own hand that appeared in the New York \nTimes in recent days describing her situation. She said something that \nwas of interest to me and alerted my curiosity. I have since made a \nnumber of calls related to that.\n  Judith Miller was embedded in a military unit and she said the \nfollowing in her piece:\n\n       The Pentagon had given me clearance to see secret \n     information as a part of my assignment ``embedded'' with a \n     special military unit hunting for unconventional weapons [or \n     weapons of mass destruction.]\n\n  We all understand in the Senate what it means to see secret or top \nsecret material. We frequently are provided briefings by the CIA, by \nthe Defense Department, by other intelligence units, briefings that are \nclassified as either ``secret,'' or ``top secret.'' We understand what \nthat means. We understand, for example, if a member of our staff is to \nbe made available to have those clearances, clearances come only when \nthere is a background check and people are evaluated for receiving a \nclearance to possess secret or top secret information.\n  So I had a question when I read this article from a New York Times \nreporter embedded with a military unit:\n\n       The Pentagon had given me clearance to see secret \n     information . . .\n\n  My question is, What kind of clearance would that be, that a \nreporter, traveling with a military unit in Iraq, searching for weapons \nof mass destruction, what kind of clearance would that reporter have to \nsee classified or secret information?\n  I called the Pentagon to find out what kind of clearance would exist, \nperhaps not just with respect to this reporter. My interest would be on \na broader basis. We had many reporters embedded with military units in \nIraq during the invasion and during the subsequent activities, looking \nfor weapons of mass destruction.\n  Based on what I can learn from the Pentagon--although it was not all \nthat clear from the response I received--based on what I could learn \nfrom the Pentagon, it seems there was no ``secret'' or ``top secret'' \nclearance given this reporter.\n  Now, last evening I talked to a soldier in Germany, a man who was a \npart of the unit in which this reporter was embedded. He was very \nwilling and interested in talking about the entire experience. The \nfellow from Germany, who is a sergeant in that special unit Judith \nMiller was embedded in, spoke at some length about what happened there. \nI told him of the quote Judith Miller had in the New York Times. He \nsaid he would have understood that she would have likely seen secret or \neven top secret information. The way the reporter is embedded in that \ncircumstance, they have access to a substantial amount of information, \ncould not help but have access. So the question I asked the Pentagon \nis, on what basis would a reporter have access to these clearances to \nreceive secret or top secret information?\n  Further, it is my understanding, at least from the sergeant whom I \nspoke with in Germany last evening, all that was transmitted from this \nreporter, embedded with a military unit, was approved by the colonel \ninvolved in that military unit and material was not to be published \nwithout the colonel's approval. Well, of course, that is the censoring \nof the material. It is also the case as reported not only by the \nsergeant in the conversation I had last evening but also in previous \npublications, that this reporter, Judith Miller, described often her \nacquaintance with Donald Rumsfeld and Mr. Feith and others in the \nPentagon at high levels, including generals. And she expressed freely \nher either agreement or disagreement with the military activities of \nthe unit she was in, and talked about complaining back to Rumsfeld, and \nso on and so forth.\n  I don't know the voracity of all of that. All I am reporting is what \nI was told by someone in that unit. That is, perhaps, for another \ndiscussion. I intend to visit about this a bit more fully tomorrow.\n\n  The first question I have is not just with respect to Judith Miller, \nbut generally under what conditions were reporters approved to be \nembedded with military units and given opportunity to see secret or top \nsecret material? Did they have security clearances or not? The Pentagon \nsays not. This reporter said she did. If they had clearances, what \nkinds of clearances were they? The Pentagon said they have \nnondisclosure forms. How can you give a nondisclosure form to a \nreporter and then show them secret or top secret material? Take a look \nat the law, which I will read tomorrow in the Senate. That is not what \nis allowed.\n  The classification of material that is secret or top secret dealing \nwith intelligence or military operations is not a classification that \nis done lightly. It is not a classification that can be overcome by \nsomeone in the Pentagon who says, Okay, put on a military shirt or a \npair of military trousers and go embed yourself with that unit, and, by \nthe way, you sign a form that says ``nondisclosure.'' That is not the \nway we decide how to disperse information that is considered secret or \ntop secret.\n  Those who are in our Senate community, on our staffs and so on, those \nwho are permitted to see classified secret and top secret material, \nmust have a clearance. That clearance must come after an investigation \nto determine whether that person is qualified to have classified \ninformation. I am asking the Pentagon, did they provide a clearance? \nThe short answer says no, they did not. The writer says they did. The \nPentagon says a ``nondisclosure form.'' What on Earth is that? How many \nnondisclosure forms exist when they are embedding men and women in the \nnews media with military units engaged in activities that often are \nsecret and top secret?\n  I will be asking the inspector general at the Pentagon to take a look \nat this to evaluate for the Congress. All Members should understand \nthis. What are the circumstances by which a reporter describes her \naccess to see secret information because she had a ``clearance'' from \nthe Pentagon when the Pentagon said she did not have a clearance? We \nunderstand what secret clearances are around here. All of us understand \nthat. We deal with that classification every day. What are the \ncircumstances by which a reporter is allowed to see secret or top \nsecret information because they have a clearance, when the Pentagon \nsays no such clearance exists?\n  If, in fact, it is not a clearance and the reporter has simply \nmisspoken, if it is instead a nondisclosure form, then I would like to \nsee the provision in law by which the Pentagon has decided to provide \nnondisclosure releases to journalists who join military units whose \nunits then censor the material that comes from the journalist. And is \nthere\n\n[[Page S11814]]\n\nin any way any implied quid pro quo, saying: Give me a clearance, embed \nme, let me see secret material; and by the way, I won't report on the \nthings that are secret and you can review all things I write and take \nout the things you do not like?\n  I do not know the circumstance. What I have read in recent days \nraised questions for me beyond what has been raised in recent days \nwhich is the issue of the special prosecutor and his potential action \nbefore the grand jury expires. I don't know about all of that. I am as \ninterested as others about what may or may not happen.\n  I am a member of the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations. We spend \na fair amount of time evaluating weapons programs and other issues that \nare secret and top secret. But I don't understand this, a self-\ndescription by a New York Times reporter about her clearance to see \nsecret information as part of being embedded with the military unit.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this tomorrow. In the \nmeantime, I intend to try to find additional answers. They have not \nbeen forthcoming in the last couple of days. But I think all of the \nCongress, all of the Senate, should be asking these questions as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been sitting in the Chamber \nwithout accomplishing much for more than 45 minutes now. We had, in my \nview, more quorum calls and more time which was not spent on the bill \nthan we should have. We have a great many amendments pending, and we \nare going to be pushing ahead.\n  We are filing cloture today, and we are going to be pushing ahead to \ntry to get this bill finished at the earliest time. Whether it is \nThursday, Friday, or when this week, I do not know. We have been \nawaiting for more than 30 minutes the arrival of a Senator to offer \nanother amendment. And very candidly, I am tired of waiting.\n  So that concludes the action on this bill today. We will begin \ntomorrow morning with a series of amendments. We had wanted to vote on \na number of amendments which were pending, but we cannot because too \nmany Senators have other commitments. That is something that is hard to \nunderstand sometimes: why we are notified midafternoon that Senators \nare too busy to attend to the business of the Senate and to vote.\n  I say in gest that I am going to run for majority leader on a \nplatform to have a 4-day workweek, from Monday noon until Friday noon. \nThat would double the workweek of the Senate. The second plank of my \nplatform--I notice the two Senators from Georgia are amused; anybody \nwould be amused--to hold down these votes to 15 minutes and 5 more \nminutes, we did pretty well on that. We had an 18\\1/2\\-minute vote. So \nthat is a little progress. The junior Senator from Georgia is nodding \nin the affirmative.\n  But we have to do better. And to advocate a 4-day workweek, which \nwould double the work of the Senate, is said only facetiously. I would \nhave only one vote, my own. I would have maybe two or three if I didn't \nrun on that kind of a platform.\n  Seriously, we need to get on with this bill. But it is now past 6 \no'clock, and that concludes our activity on the bill. I think the \ncustom of the Senate is to move to morning business at this point.\n  I am advised we have not yet filed cloture, Mr. President, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum so we technically stay on the bill \nuntil the final signature is added so that the cloture motion can be \nfiled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as though in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Levin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I note that S. Res. 287, which is a \nresolution I introduced on behalf of Senator Stabenow, Senator Reid, \nSenator Frist, and I believe a majority of this body now, has been \ncleared for passage later on this evening. I very much welcome that \ndevelopment. It is fitting, indeed, that on the day after the passing \nof Rosa Parks the majority of this body sees it important to adopt a \nbipartisan resolution honoring her life.\n  I thank the Chair. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have been moving forward with the \nunderlying bill, and Chairman Specter has indicated that he has a \nlineup of amendments ready for tomorrow. I know that tomorrow will be a \nbusy day with votes in relation to those amendments. We need this final \nappropriations bill this week, as I have said again and again--this \nweek and last week--and, therefore, in order to facilitate passage, I \nnow send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 3010: The \n     Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n         Bill Frist, Arlen Specter, Thad Cochran, Michael Enzi, \n           Wayne Allard, Jon Kyl, Rick Santorum, Richard Lugar, \n           Mike DeWine, Craig Thomas, Mel Martinez, Sam Brownback, \n           Kay Bailey Hutchison, John Thune, Orrin Hatch, Robert \n           Bennett, Mike Crapo.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. This cloture vote will occur Thursday morning. We will \nannounce the exact time sometime during tomorrow's session, hopefully \nThursday morning.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to support an important cause, \nat a critical time, increasing the representation of students from \nunderrepresented backgrounds in law school and the legal profession.\n  Senator Durbin and I have introduced an amendment to the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill that would \nrestore funding for a program which seeks to do just that the Thurgood \nMarshall Legal Educational Opportunity Program. The Marshall Program \nprovides technical assistance, training, coaching, and financial \nassistance to prospective law students who might otherwise experience \nacademic or financial obstacles to law school success. It also runs 6-\nweek Summer Institutes that serve as a bridge between college and law \nschool, and helps law students prepare for the bar exam. Since its \ninception, over 7,000 students have received their law degrees with \nhelp from the Marshall Program. I am proud to say that some of the \nProgram's valuable initiatives are held at Illinois' own Northern \nIllinois University and DePaul University.\n  Judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and other legal professionals \nare the faces of our justice system. It is important that these \nindividuals come from a variety of experiences, and bring to their jobs \na diverse range of perspectives. According to a national study \ncommissioned in 2000, however, half of those polled believed that the \njustice system treated people differently because of their background. \nOne important way to address this problem is to make sure that working-\nclass people and students from different cultural backgrounds have the \nopportunity to go to law school and successfully enter the legal \nprofession.\n  Equally important is the effect these students will have on their \nfamilies and their communities. The Marshall Program's benefits extend \nnot only to\n\n[[Page S11815]]\n\nprogram participants but also to the generations that follow behind \nthem. Every person who rises from limited means to become a doctor or \nlawyer in this country is also a mother, father, sister or brother who \nwill help bring resources to their families, leadership to their \nneighborhoods, and hope to their communities. The Marshall Progam helps \nto expand opportunities, for this generation of Americans and the next.\n  I am proud to support the cause of increasing the representation of \nstudents from less advantaged backgrounds in the legal profession. I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11815-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On September, 19, 1998, two men and two women pulled up to Peter \nJohnson's car in Chicago, IL, and asked him if he was gay. When he \nreplied that he was, the four people exited the vehicle and beat the \nman. He was then taken to a local hospital and treated for injuries \nthat he had sustained during the attack.\n  I believe that our Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nin all circumstances, from threats to them at home.

Mr. President, the people of Kashmir are no strangers to \nhardship. Their beautiful, tragic land has been the arena of full-scale \nwarfare between India and Pakistan, a long-running insurgency marked by \nexceptional brutality and penetration by terrorist groups in league \nwith al-Qaida.\n  On October 8, the people of Kashmir suffered the most devastating \nblow yet: A massive earthquake killed about as many Kashmiris in just a \nfew minutes as all the bullets and bombs of massed armies were able to \nkill there over the previous half-century. And unless we act now, the \ncasualty count will climb even higher.\n  At latest count, the quake's death toll is somewhere between 55,000 \nand 80,000. An estimated 3 million people are now homeless. As the \nsurvivors spend day after miserable day with little food or water, \nlittle medical care, little protection from the bitterly cold winter \ntemperatures that have already hampered relief efforts, the number of \nthe dead will certainly rise.\n  Residents of the Indian-administered portion of Kashmir were hit \nhard: 1,400 have died, a number greater than the death toll of Katrina. \nBut the worst devastation has been felt in the area administered by \nPakistan, which has borne the brunt of the disaster.\n  For Pakistan, the earthquake was at least 40 Katrinas, all rolled \ninto one.\n  The capitol of Pakistani Kashmir has been largely destroyed. Relief \nefforts will cost billions of dollars, and repairs to the very most \nbasic infrastructure will cost billions more.\n  American helicopter pilots and other military personnel have \nperformed heroically in the rescue operation. The first 72 hours after \na disaster of this magnitude are vital, since this is the window in \nwhich trapped survivors have a realistic chance of being brought out \nalive. As of last week, October 17, 442 U.S. personnel and 11 \nhelicopters were involved in the effort, and the U.S. military had \nevacuated 2,500 survivors. I am proud of our service men and women, and \nI wholeheartedly support President Bush's decision to deploy our \nmilitary assets to this mission of mercy.\n  I would like to see far more of our choppers devoted to this vital \neffort: With only 30 percent of the affected villages reachable by \nroad, the single greatest need is for every utility helicopter that can \nbe rushed to the scene; we've got Chinooks, Blackhawks, and other \nsuitable craft right across the border in Afghanistan, and I hope the \nadministration will immediately shift more of these assets to the \nshort-term mission of saving lives.\n  I also support the President's pledge of financial aid for the \nreconstruction effort--indeed, I rise today to urge President Bush to \nsend more aid. This is no time for half-measures.\n  If there is one thing we all should have learned from Katrina and the \nSoutheast Asian tsunami, it is that an effective, rapid, well-funded \nresponse is necessary to prevent a terrible tragedy from spiraling into \nan uncontrolled disaster.\n  As of today, October 24, the total amount of earthquake aid committed \nby the administration has been about $27 million. President Bush has \npledged ``up to'' $50 million, and Secretary Rice has hinted that the \ntotal figure might be higher than this, but so far--2 weeks after the \ntragedy--these are still vague abstractions. The costs for tsunami \nrelief proved far higher than the initial estimates--or the initial \nU.S. pledge. It is a safe bet that the needs for this tragedy will also \nprove much greater than initial estimates. It is far too early to cap \nour contribution.\n  The U.N. has sought $312 million to meet immediate needs but has \nfound the world community willing to pledge barely a quarter of this \namount--and the White House's response has been to promise less than 4 \npercent of this modest sum, per USAID fact-sheet of 10/21: $10.8 \nmillion to U.N. flash appeal. Mr. President, we need to do much more, \nto do it much faster--and we need the administration to start telling \nus some answers:\n  How much money will we actually spend? And where will it come from? \nDoes the administration plan to shift funds from existing accounts for \nPakistan, in which case the President's pledge would look like a bait-\nand-switch? Would the funds come from existing disaster accounts, in \nwhich case every dollar sent to Kashmir would potentially be a dollar \ntaken from Darfur, Guatemala, or Niger?\n  With so many pressing needs here in the United States, some may ask \nwhy send any aid overseas. Let's take care of our own people, some may \nsay, leave other nations to take care of themselves.\n  But this is a false choice. We can take care of our own people and \nfulfill our moral duty to our fellow human beings elsewhere in the \nworld.\n  When we were struck by the tragedy of Katrina, 90 nations offered us \nassistance--including a pledge of $1 million from Pakistan. Aiding the \nvictims of the Kashmiri earthquake is the right thing to do, and it is \nalso in our vital national interest. As we have seen in the aftermath \nof the Asian tsunami this year, disaster relief is one of the most \neffective--and cost-effective--tools in our diplomatic or political \narsenal.\n  Other nations recognize the twinned moral and political need for \ngenerous humanitarian response. Some 30 countries have sent relief aid \nto Pakistan, countries including Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, \nFrance, Spain, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Iran, Jordan, Syria and \nAfghanistan. Several, including Britain and Turkey, sent specialized \nsearch-and-rescue teams to pull survivors out of the rubble.\n  Others have already established mobile field hospitals that are \nsaving hundreds--maybe thousands--of lives on a daily basis. Even \nPakistan's longtime rival India sent planeloads of tents, medicine, and \nother supplies.\n  The U.S. has been generous, but so too have other countries. If the \nadministration does indeed follow through on President Bush's $50 \nmillion promise, that would be half the amount pledged by Kuwait, half \nthe amount pledged by the United Arab Emirates. Last weekend, Saudi \nArabia announced an aid package of $133 million. We are not the\n\n[[Page S11816]]\n\nonly country involved in this relief effort and our contribution should \nreflect our Nation's true generosity of spirit.\n  It is not just nations that are joining the effort: private \nindividuals and groups have opened their hearts and wallets. Here in \nthis country, NGOs like Mercy Corps, CARE, the International Rescue \nCommittee, Save the Children and the Red Cross have collected many \nthousands of dollars.\n  In one development that builds upon an encouraging warming of ties \nbetween Pakistan and Israel, President Musharraf has specifically \nwelcomed the contributions of American Jewish charities.\n  But there are other organizations whose support is more troubling: \nextremist groups have been in the forefront of disaster relief. There \nis a desperate need for more assistance--and that void is being filled \nby groups hostile to American interests.\n  Jamaat ul-Dawa, an affiliate of the terrorist group Lashkar-e Taiba, \nhas been operating a major field hospital complete with x-ray \nfacilities and an operating theater--a facility so capable that it has \nbeen treating casualties of the Pakistani military itself.\n  More than a week after the earthquake, the U.S. had still not set up \na mobile field hospital, despite the proximity of resources in \nAfghanistan and the Middle East; I hope that by now such a facility is \nin operation. We have the finest military medical personnel in the \nworld, and they are eager to save as many lives as they can.\n  Why has the administration been unable to accomplish a vital \nhumanitarian task that is currently being carried out by a terrorist \naffiliate?\n  And Jamaat ul-Dawa isn't the only extremist group filling this need. \nThe AI-Khidmat Foundation, the charity branch of hardline Islamist \nparty Jamaat-e Islami, has organized relief convoys, medical facilities \nand camps sheltering survivors.\n  The Al-Rasheed trust, a group whose U.S. assets have been frozen on \nthe suspicion that it channeled funds to al-Qaida is highly visible in \na variety of relief efforts.\n  There's nothing new about extremist groups performing social \nservices. Hezbollah, Hamas, the Tamil Tigers, and a variety of other \ngroups on the Foreign Terrorist Organization list have long bolstered \ntheir base of support by providing social welfare programs--especially \nwhere the government has been either unable or unwilling to meet its \ncitizens' most basic needs.\n  The extremists know that such programs build goodwill among the \npopulace. They have learned a lesson already known to every U.S. \nmilitary officer: You can't win a war with bombs alone, you have to win \nhearts and minds.\n  Our military professionals know this, but it sometimes seems as if \nthe civilian leadership in the White House has forgotten the lesson. We \nhad an opportunity to demonstrate our friendship to the Pakistani \npeople, to the Kashmiris on both sides of the line of control, to \nMuslims throughout the globe, and instead we have failed to match our \ncommitment with our superpower status. Every day we let the extremists \nfill the void is another opportunity wasted.\n  The Asian tsunami provides a shining example of the need for rapid \naction, and what we can accomplish when we do things right.\n  The initial response from the White House was disappointing: for the \nfirst week after the tragedy, the administration lagged behind other \nnations, including small countries with far inferior resources than we \npossess.\n  But once the administration decided to match America's contribution \nwith our superpower status, we leapt to the forefront of the relief \neffort. When the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group and other naval \nassets arrived on the scene, they immediately established us the leader \nof the global response.\n  The sailors, marines and other service members did an absolutely \nsuperb job: They performed an act of public diplomacy more powerful \nthan any dollars-and-sense reckoning could calculate.\n  They showed that the U.S. military is not merely a fearsome adversary \nbut also a powerful friend.\n  This effort had an immediate impact: In Indonesia, the world's most \npopulous Muslim nation, popular attitudes towards the United States \nprofoundly improved, almost overnight. Before George Bush took office, \n75 percent of Indonesians had a favorable impression of the United \nStates; by 2003, that number had fallen to 15 percent.\n  But in the aftermath of the tsunami, Indonesians saw Americans as \nfriends rather than foes. In a survey sponsored by the nonpartisan \ngroup Terror Free Tomorrow, 65 percent of respondents had a more \nfavorable view of the United States after the arrival of the USS \nAbraham Lincoln.\n  This public attitude is directly reflected in Indonesian views of the \nwar on terror. In the same poll, support for Osama bin Laden dropped \nfrom 58 percent prior to the tsunami to 23 percent afterward. For the \nfirst time in any major poll, a plurality, 40 percent, supported the \nU.S.-led fight against terrorism.\n  And this isn't merely a matter of poll numbers: Indonesian-based \nextremist groups tried to use their relief operations in the tsunami-\nravaged province of Aceh as a tool for recruitment, and due in large \npart to the strong U.S. response these groups utterly failed to make \nheadway. When they tried to preach anti-American sentiments, the people \nof Aceh shut them down cold: The survivors of the tsunami knew better \nbecause they had seen American sailors and marines saving lives.\n  The lesson is clear: Our humanitarian duty and our national security \ninterests here are in complete accord. When we use our military and \nfinancial strength to save lives, we help drain the swamp of terrorism.\n  We accomplished a tremendous feat in the tsunami recovery effort. For \nthe price of just a few days' operating expenses in Iraq, we bought an \nincalculable amount of goodwill among the 210 million Muslims in \nIndonesia, and improved our standing among many other Muslims \nworldwide.\n  Today, we have the chance to replicate our success. We can do in \nPakistan what we did in Indonesia: prove that America is not engaged in \na crusade against Islam.\n  We can demonstrate--with deeds, not empty words--that we are allies \nrather than adversaries. We can show that we, and not the extremists or \nthe terrorists, are the best friends that the people of Muslim nations \ncould want to have.\n  We can do this, but we can't do it on the cheap. We can't do it with \njust a dozen helicopters and $27 million and a promise that eventually \nwe may contribute half as much as Kuwait.\n  Mr. President, I urge this Chamber to do more. And I urge the \nadministration to immediately match our contribution with the vital \nneed at hand: With Pakistan reeling from the worst natural disaster in \nits history, we can't afford to let our response be too little and too \nlate.\n  Today, Mr. President, our moral duty and our national security \ninterest are one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11816-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11816-S11817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING THE SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I recognize and pay tribute to the United \nNations on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary.\n  During this week in 1945, fifty countries came together to found the \nUnited Nations, a body created to advance two momentous goals: a world \nfree from war, and one in which the basic rights of citizens are \nrespected in all countries. Over the last 6 decades, with the help of \nthe UN, we have at least avoided the scourge of another world war. And \nwe have seen the advancement of democracy and human rights around the \nworld, as well as the provision of shelter, basic education, and \ncritical healthcare to millions that would otherwise have gone without.\n  Today, while the broad goals of the UN remain the same, global \nthreats and challenges are drastically different. Internal conflict, \nterrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, religious \nhatreds, natural disasters, and disease pose great hardships and risks \nto all people, regardless of country of origin, and require, more than \never, coordinated international responses. By harnessing the resources \nand collective expertise of its 191 member states, the United Nations \nhas the ability to address these concerns in ways that no single nation \ncan on its own.\n\n[[Page S11817]]\n\n  We in the United States owe the UN our profound gratitude for the \nassistance that has been provided to victims of Hurricane Katrina on \nour gulf coast. Within days of the disaster, the United Nations \nlaunched a campaign to coordinate relief assistance with federal \nefforts. UN agencies have distributed life-saving supplies, are \nsupporting the surveillance work of the Centers for Disease Control, \nand are assisting in evacuee registration and tracking of missing \nchildren.\n  Day in and day out, we see evidence of the critical work that the \nUnited Nations undertakes around the world. The organization continues \nto lead humanitarian relief efforts in the wake of last year's tsunami \ndisaster in Southeast Asia and has launched an emergency response to \nthe devastating earthquake in Pakistan. Through UNAIDS, the \norganization coordinates a comprehensive global response to the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS, working to halt and reverse the epidemic by 2015. The \nUN women's fund, UNIFEM, supports women's empowerment and gender \nequality, in particular through supporting local initiatives to end \nviolence against women. The UN Development Program is supporting \ndemocratic governance projects in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone, \nHaiti and over 150 countries worldwide. Inspections by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency have uncovered violations by Iran \nand North Korea, and the agency's safeguards have assured the world \nthat other countries are not diverting nuclear material from their \npeaceful nuclear power programs.\n  Finally, the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, extends protection and life \nsaving assistance to some 19 million refugees and other vulnerable \npersons. In May 2005, I had the opportunity to visit the Oure Cassoni \nrefugee camp along the Chad-Sudan border, and was incredibly impressed \nwith UNHCR's work in providing direly needed food, shelter, and \neducation services for nearly 25,000 refugees. The agency's aid staff \nis working tirelessly to serve this large population, and I witnessed \nextraordinary dedication and professionalism.\n\n  For 60 years, the United Nations has been on the front lines leading \nhumanitarian stabilization efforts under conditions and in situations \nthat are the worst of the worst. Now the organization is focused on \nanother critical task: reforming itself. Many, including Secretary \nGeneral Annan, have recognized that the UN must change the way it does \nbusiness if it is to maintain the support of its members and \neffectively address the challenges that the global community will face \nin the future.\n  This reordering and restructuring is needed, significant, and moving \nforward. To highlight a few items, as a result of the support \ndemonstrated at the UN Summit last month, member states are working to \ncreate a Human Rights Council to replace the defunct Human Rights \nCommission, in order to more effectively advance the rights and \nfreedoms that continue to be denied to far too many. The establishment \nof a Peace Building Commission will make the UN, and the world, better \nequipped to prevent post-conflict countries from relapsing into \nviolence, reducing the conditions that breed terrorism. And the dozens \nof personnel, management and budget reforms that have been proposed and \nendorsed by member states will make the organization more efficient in \nthe important work it does.\n  Now, as the United Nations moves into the next chapter of its \nhistory, it is imperative that this momentum for change continues. \nImplementing these reforms is the responsibility of the member states. \nThe United States can playa critical leadership role in securing their \nsupport, and their action. The future effectiveness of the United \nNations lies in the balance, and I have every expectation that the \nmember states can and will deliver. I encourage the Members of this \nchamber to fully support the efforts that are underway at the United \nNations.\n  Article One of the United Nations Charter states that the purposes of \nthe organization are to maintain international peace and security; \naddress international social, economic and cultural problems; and to \npromote fundamental human rights and freedoms. Today, although \ntremendous progress has been made, we still need the UN to advance \nthese goals. Therefore, I congratulate and thank the United Nations, \nits current personnel and staff, as well as those who have served in \nthe past, for all that it has done to advance peace, security and \nfreedom around the world, and for all that it must do in the years \nahead to realize the vision of its founders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11817-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Paul and Sheila \nWellstone. It is hard to believe that on this date 3 years ago, the \nlives of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, and others, were taken in a plane \ncrash in Minnesota. On that day, I lost a good friend, the Senate lost \na leader, and the American people lost an advocate who was never afraid \nto stand up and speak for those who had no voice.\n  Today I honor my friend and colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone, who \ninspired so many people to speak up and to serve. Even as I stand here \ntoday, I cannot imagine that when I turn around I won't see Paul \nstanding at his desk, his arms flailing in the air, making his point \nwith great passion.\n  Paul inspired me to run for the U.S. Senate. His brilliant example \nreminded me that you don't need to be powerful or rich to make a \ndifference. You just need to have an honest concern for others, an \noptimistic spirit, and the courage to act. Paul embodied these traits.\n  I am grateful for the time we had with Paul. He and I worked on \neverything from domestic violence and education to providing health \ncare to veterans and protecting families from asbestos.\n  As the month of October, which is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, \ndraws to a close, there is much the Senate has accomplished on this \nissue. The Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which contains \nmany improvements to the current law, has\n\n[[Page S11818]]\n\npassed the Senate. But the absence of the Wellstones has truly been \nfelt. Paul and Sheila were such champions for victims of domestic \nviolence, especially in the area of economic security.\n  Paul knew that it is important to address the economic barriers that \ntrap women in violent homes or relationships. That is why he and I \nworked together to introduce bills to provide economic protections for \nvictims. I am proud to carry on the legacy of Paul and Sheila \nWellstone, and in their honor I have introduced the Security and \nFinancial Empowerment, SAFE Act, which will protect and even save the \nlives of victims of domestic or sexual violence and their families.\n  We are all poorer for the loss of Paul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, \nhis daughter Marcia, the members of his staff, and the pilots who were \ntaken from us on this day 3 years ago. But I continue to hope that each \none of us who are here will take on part of Paul's legacy--for example, \nthe spirit to speak out for the underprivileged or for the woman on \nwelfare because of domestic violence who is trying to get back on her \nfeet.\n  If we can remember to fight for all Americans no matter what \nchallenges they face, and do so with respect and dignity, then Paul's \nlegacy will live on in the Senate, as it lives on in our hearts and \nminds. In the name of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, I pledge to carry on \ntheir legacy throughout my time in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11818-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National Breast \nCancer Awareness Month, and call for quick passage of the Breast Cancer \nEnvironmental Research Act. Breast Cancer is a disease that has \nimpacted virtually every American's life, including my own. My two \nsisters both had breast cancer and died of the disease. Sadly, they \ncontracted breast cancer at a time when regular mammograms and improved \ntreatment methods were not widely available. More than 3 million women \nare currently living with breast cancer, and each year, tens of \nthousands of women die from this disease.\n  In 1992, I offered an amendment to dedicate $210 million in the \nDefense Department budget to begin the Breast Cancer Research Program, \na partnership between the military, medical, and breast cancer survivor \ncommunities to develop and implement innovative research towards the \ngoal of curing and eliminating breast cancer. This funding was in \naddition to the funding for breast cancer research conducted at the \nNational Institutes of Health. My amendment passed and overnight it \ndoubled Federal funding for breast cancer. Since then, funding for \nbreast cancer research has been included in the Defense Department \nbudget every year.\n  Almost a decade ago, when I looked into the issue of breast cancer \nresearch, I discovered that barely $90 million was spent on breast \ncancer research. Today, I am proud to say that between the Department \nof Defense, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, nearly a billion dollars annually is \nbeing spent on finding a cure for breast cancer. Scientific researchers \nare making exciting discoveries about the causes of breast cancer and \nits prevention, detection, diagnosis, treatment and control, leading to \nreal progress in our war against this devastating disease. We know \nbetter than ever before how a healthy cell can become cancerous, how \nbreast cancer spreads, why some tumors are more aggressive than others \nand why some women suffer more severely and are more likely to die of \nthe disease.\n  However, our work is not done. While important advances have been \nmade, we still do not know what causes this disease, or how to prevent \nit. Today, I call upon my Senate colleagues to cosponsor the Breast \nCancer Environmental Research Act, legislation modeled after the \nDefense Department's Breast Cancer Research Program. The Breast Cancer \nEnvironmental Research Act would establish eight centers to conduct \nresearch on environmental factors that may contribute to breast cancer \nand, importantly, would require collaboration with community \norganizations in the areas where the centers are established. I \nstrongly believe any breast cancer research must include the \nperspectives of breast cancer survivors, and this legislation does so \nby including consumer advocates in the peer review and programmatic \nreview process. In addition, the legislation is structured to ensure \nthe kind of efficiency and public accountability that has made an \noverwhelming number of Senate colleagues, as well as scientists and \nconsumers, so supportive of the Department of Defense Breast Cancer \nResearch Program. I urge my colleagues to support the Breast Cancer \nEnvironmental Research Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11818-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF PENN KEMBLE\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President. On October 16, our Nation lost one of \nits finest defenders of freedom, Richard Penn Kemble.\n  The central theme of Penn Kemble's activist youth and professional \nlife was the promotion and strengthening of democracy. In the 1970s, he \nserved on the Senate staff of my predecessor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, \nand in the Clinton administration, he served as Deputy and Acting \nDirector of the United States Information Agency, USIA. At USIA, Penn \nKemble initiated Civitas, a multinational educational program. Under \nhis leadership, USIA made educational reform, to strengthen both \ncitizenship and the culture of democracy, one of its central interests. \nThrough its partnership with the Center for Civic Education, it \nnurtured a worldwide civic education movement that began at its first \nmeeting in Prague in June of 1995. I had the honor of addressing the \nthird annual Civitas World Conference in 1999 in Palermo, Italy, which \nbrought together political leaders and more than 350 civic educators \nfrom around the world.\n  This international civic education movement continues today in no \nsmall measure because of the important work Penn Kemble began in 1995. \nHe knew that even though the institutional machinery of democracy might \nbe in place, it could not be sustained unless a culture of democracy \nwas to take root. He knew that people could only become citizens when \nthey understood and exercised the rights and responsibilities of self-\ngovernment. He knew that it was in our Nation's best interest to \nsupport emerging democracies through citizen education and he used his \nintellect, boundless energy, and creativity to achieve that end.\n  I am grateful for the work Penn Kemble began during my husband's \nPresidency, and I join his family and friends from all over the world \nin mourning his loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11818-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11818-S11819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE AVIAN INFLUENZA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to express my concern about \navian influenza and America's preparedness for a global pandemic. While \nI do not want to add to people's fears about this issue, reports of the \nlethality of the H5N1 strain must be taken seriously and we need to \nmake sure that we are taking appropriate measures to prepare for a \npossible pandemic.\n  As we all well know, migratory birds are steadily carrying the avian \nflu virus from throughout Southeast Asia and Siberia to Romania, \nTurkey, and now Greece. International health officials predicted that \nthis spread could happen, and it should be no surprise that this \ndisease is taking this course. In the 20th century alone, three \ninfluenza pandemics swept throughout the world, most notably the 1918 \nflu pandemic, which took 500,000 lives. Our knowledge of disease and \nhygiene has improved dramatically since then, and our ability to ready \nourselves has subsequently advanced, but our risk for a pandemic \nremains a danger.\n  Scientists and public health officials throughout the world have \nwarned that a flu pandemic will take place, have alerted governments to \nthe possibility of pandemic through the avian flu, and have watched as \nlittle has been done to prepare for the occurrence. Despite the \nwarnings of the inevitability of pandemic, research into influenza \nvaccine and therapy has been continually underfunded, as have our \nprograms that would provide emergency health care relief in a time of \ncrisis. Hurricane Katrina illustrated our lack of preparedness for a \ntrue disaster, and the Government's failure to quickly bring relief to \nour friends along the gulf coast should send a resounding message that \nwe must better prepare for an\n\n[[Page S11819]]\n\nemergency in the future. That emergency could well be the avian flu \npandemic. Let us not be caught unaware. While there is no guarantee \nthat this will occur this winter, next winter, or even the year after \nthat, scientists tell us that it is only a matter of time, and we \nshould use that time to build our stockpiles of vaccines and medicines, \nand to support global initiatives to help prevent the spread of the \ndisease through containment strategies and alerts.\n  Although the avian flu does not yet transmit from human to human, \nthis type of virus is capable of rapidly mutating and becoming highly \ninfectious among people. With the seasonal flu season approaching, the \nrisk of a human strain emerging increases, as the opportunity for the \nvirus to drift among species and mutate is augmented. If a pandemic \nensued, the threat would obviously not be distributed evenly across the \npopulation. The young and elderly would be at most risk, as would \nimmunocompromised people and people suffering from malnutrition and \ninadequate basic health services. We know this, we are aware of the \nproblems, and we must take action to ensure the health and safety of \nthe most vulnerable. Guaranteeing safety means taking responsibility \nfor all of our communities' responses and plans.\n  I am pleased that I was able to join many of my colleagues in sending \na letter to President Bush on October 4, 2005, that urged the \nadministration to release a finalized Pandemic Influenza Response and \nPreparedness Plan, which the World Health Organization has deemed \nessential to planning a strategy in the case of a global pandemic. I am \neagerly waiting for this plan to be released, as I believe it is of \nextreme importance to the American people. I am also pleased that the \nSenate approved a measure to add $3.9 billion to the Defense \nDepartment's budget for the purchase of vaccines and medicines to treat \navian flu, and I hope to see the House agree to this in conference. \nThis was an important measure to help prepare Americans, particularly \nthose most vulnerable, against the ravages of a fatal disease.\n  While we do not know when or where this pandemic may develop, we must \nwork to prepare now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11819-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11819-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11819-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED \n IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12938 WITH RESPECT TO THE PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS \n                       OF MASS DESTRUCTION--PM 28\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Horse Protection Act to prohibit \nshipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, \npurchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be \nslaughtered for human consumption, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleagues, Senators \nLandrieu, Byrd, Specter, Lott, Lieberman, Inouye, Levin, and DeMint, in \norder to introduce the Virgie S. Arden American Horse Slaughter \nPrevention Act.\n  As a veterinarian, I am well aware of the love that Americans have \nfor their horses. Much of our Nation's early history and culture is \nassociated with these animals. We think of George Washington's horses \nand the legend of Paul Revere's ride and the Pony Express. More \nrecently, we were reminded of how the Depression Era race between \nSeabiscuit and War Admiral\n\n[[Page S11825]]\n\nraised the spirit of our Nation during desperate times.\n  While horses in the United States are not raised for food, last year \nalone more than 65,000 horses were slaughtered in the United States for \nhuman consumption abroad. Tens of thousands more were transported to \nCanada and Mexico for slaughter there. Work horses, race horses, and \neven pet horses, many of them young and healthy, are slaughtered for \nhuman consumption in Europe and Asia, where the meat is sold as a high-\nend delicacy. Polls show that Americans overwhelmingly support an end \nto this practice. This sentiment was reflected in the Senate's recent \n69-28 vote to prohibit the use of Federal funds to facilitate horse \nslaughter. The House of Representatives passed identical legislation by \na similarly bipartisan vote in June.\n  Often, owners who sell their horses at auction are unaware that their \nhorses may well be on their way to one of the three remaining \nslaughterhouses in America where horses are killed for human \nconsumption. These slaughterhouses are foreign-owned and the product is \nshipped abroad, as are the profits.\n  While several States are attempting to address the concerns of \ncitizens regarding the tens of thousands of horses going to slaughter \neach year, the absence of Federal law creates a loophole through which \nthe slaughter can continue. Some States have prohibited the use of \ndouble-deck cattle trailers to move horses to slaughter. Texas, which \nis home to two of the three slaughter plants, has had a law in place \nsince 1949 to effectively prohibit horse slaughter for human \nconsumption. Yet the district attorneys with jurisdiction over the \nplants have been unable to prosecute these foreign companies, and \nhorses continue to be slaughtered. To end this situation, we must have \na Federal law that prohibits sending horses within States, across State \nlines, or over our domestic borders for the purpose of slaughtering \nthem for human consumption. We can effectively achieve this goal by \npassing the Virgie S. Arden American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act.\n  Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate the horse \nslaughter trade--including intrastate shipment--because such trade has \na substantial impact on interstate and international commerce. Horses \nare regularly moved across State lines to be slaughtered in the three \nremaining horse slaughter plants--one in Illinois--and the other two in \nTexas. Others are exported across the U.S. border to Canada and Mexico \nfor slaughter there. Even the meat of slaughtered horses is eventually \nmoved across State lines or our domestic borders for sale outside of \nthe United States. Our bill will end this practice.\n  I know that some people have expressed concerns about what will \nhappen to horses if their slaughter is ended. Many of these horses will \nbe sold to a new owner, kept longer by their original owner, or \neuthanized by a licensed veterinarian. Others will be cared for by the \nhorse rescue community, and efforts are now underway to standardize \npractices in this ever-growing sector. Guidelines for these rescue \norganizations have been developed by the animal protection community \nand embraced by sanctuaries across the country.\n  Some people have questioned whether this law will result in the abuse \nand neglect of unwanted horses. Thankfully, statistics do not support \nthis claim at all. Recently released figures show that the number of \nabuse cases dropped significantly in Illinois from 2002 to 2004, the \nperiod in which the State's only horse slaughtering facility was closed \ndue to fire. Also, since California passed a law banning the slaughter \nof horses for human consumption, there has been no discernible increase \nin cruelty and neglect cases in the state.\n  Furthermore, it is currently illegal to ``turn out,'' neglect, or \nstarve a horse, so this bill will not result in an increased number of \norphaned horses in the United States. If a person attempts to turn his \nor her horses out, under current law, animal control agents will be \nable to enforce humane laws. As I stated before, this bill seeks only \nto end the slaughter of horses for human consumption. If a person \nwishes to put an animal down, it costs about $225 to have the horse \neuthanized by a licensed veterinarian and disposed of--a fraction of \nwhat it costs to keep a horse as a companion or a work animal. That \ncost is not too big a burden to bear when no other options are \navailable.\n  The time for a strong federal law ending this slaughter is now. This \nbill does not target other forms of slaughter, rendering, or \neuthanasia, rather it focuses solely on the slaughter of American \nhorses for human consumption. The House version of this bill, H.R. \n5031, currently has more than 120 cosponsors. Please join Senator \nLandrieu and me in cosponsoring the Virgie S. Arden American Horse \nSlaughter Prevention Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mr. HAGEL:\n  S. 1916.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act in order \nto reunify families, to provide for earned adjustment of status, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my comprehensive \nimmigration reform legislation. This legislative package consists of \nfour bills that deal with national security, employment security, \nAmerica's workforce, and bringing accountability to those living here \nillegally. This package is an enhanced version of immigration reform \nlegislation I introduced in 2004 with former Senate Minority Leader Tom \nDaschle.\n  Immigration reform is an urgent national security priority. We cannot \ncontinue to defer making tough choices about our nation's immigration \npolicy. It is not in our interest to have 8 to 12 million people \nundocumented and unaccounted for in our country. The American people \nwon't accept immigration reform until they are convinced we are \ncontrolling our borders. Congress must reform the patchwork of \nimmigration laws that have created an underground, black market labor \nforce.\n  The first bill is the Strengthening America's Security Act of 2005. \nThe bill strengthens national security and U.S. borders by assisting \nlaw enforcement in their efforts to secure our borders. It will \nincrease the number of Customs and Border Protection officers; require \nDHS to use updated technology at the border; increase criminal \npenalties for alien smuggling, document fraud, misuse of social \nsecurity numbers, gang violence, and drug trafficking at the border; \nauthorize continued funds to reimburse states for the costs of \ndetaining undocumented aliens; and give DHS additional tools to detain \nand deport undocumented aliens.\n  The second bill, the Employment Verification Act of 2005, requires \nemployers to verify the employment eligibility of their employees. The \nbill will assist all employers in their effort to hire legal workers by \nestablishing a mandatory electronic worker verification system. The \nsystem would be managed by DHS in conjunction with the Social Security \nAdministration. The system will allow employers to immediately verify \nwhether an individual is authorized to work in the U.S. This system is \nalready being used by the federal government and by certain employers \nacross the country, including some in Nebraska. The system will be \nphased-in over a 5 year period, starting with large employers. The \nlegislation includes protections to ensure that the system will not \nresult in hiring discrimination based on race or national origin, nor \nwill it interfere with the regular hiring process. Employers who use \nthe system will receive a ``safe-harbor'' from prosecution for hiring \nunauthorized workers.\n  The Strengthening America's Workforce Act of 2005 will amend the \nImmigration and Nationality Act to address\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\nthe demand for foreign workers. The bill will provide foreign workers \nfor low-skilled jobs that would otherwise go unfilled by admitting a \nlimited number of workers annually through a new temporary worker \nprogram. Employers seeking to hire foreign workers through this program \nmust first demonstrate that no qualified U.S. worker exists and that \nthey will provide the same wage levels and working conditions as U.S. \nworkers. Workers will be admitted for a limited period of time and will \nbe allowed to change employers. Visas are good for 2 years and can be \nrenewed. Qualified workers and their families would be provided an \nopportunity to adjust their immigration status over time.\n  In order to address the need for high-tech workers and to reduce the \nexisting worker visa backlog, this legislation would allow foreign \nstudents who have earned an advanced degree in science, technology, \nengineering or math from U.S. universities to receive a H-1B work visa \nwithout leaving the country and without regard to the annual cap of \n65,000. In addition, high-tech workers who have worked in the U.S. for \nthree years may be allowed to adjust to permanent resident status \nwithout regard to the annual cap of 140,000. The spouses and children \nof immigrant workers would also be allowed to adjust status without \nregard to this cap.\n  In order to encourage more foreign students to study in the U.S., \nthis legislation would give full-time foreign college and graduate \nstudents the opportunity to work part-time while studying at U.S. \nuniversities.\n  The fourth bill, the Immigrant Accountability Act of 2005, will amend \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act in order to encourage those in the \nU.S. illegally to apply for legal status. The legislation would create \nan earned adjustment program for long-term undocumented Immigrants and \nprovide an opportunity for illegal aliens and their families to become \ninvested stakeholders in the country if they can demonstrate that they \nhave met all of the following requirements:\n  Passed national security and criminal background checks;\n  Resided in the U.S. for at least 5 years preceding the date of \nintroduction;\n  Worked a minimum of 3 years in the U.S. preceding the date of \nintroduction, and 6 years after introduction;\n  Paid all Federal and State taxes;\n  Registered for Military Selective Service;\n  Demonstrated knowledge of English language and American civics \nrequirements;\n  Paid a $2,000 fine, in addition to required application fees. Fines \nassessed from this program could total as much as $12 billion.\n  The legislation would create a program for short-term undocumented \nimmigrants who cannot meet the work or residence requirements. They \nwill register with DHS and will be allowed to apply for a visa. \nHowever, these undocumented immigrants must return to their home \ncountry to obtain the visa and be readmitted through the legal process. \nThese undocumented immigrants will have three years to complete the \napplication process and will be authorized to work during that time.\n  There is a backlog reduction provision in the bill that would exempt \ncertain individuals, living outside the U.S., from existing caps on \nfamily-based immigrant visas. This section was originally included in \nthe 2004 Hagel/Daschle Immigration Reform bill.\n  The new fines and fees created by this legislation will fund the new \nand expanded programs created in it. Fines assessed by this legislation \ncould total as much as $12 billion. A majority of the funds will come \nfrom the $2000 fine illegal aliens would pay under the Earned \nAdjustment Program.\n  This legislation is the product of years of discussions with law \nenforcement, business, labor, and advocacy communities. The bills are a \nserious effort to meet the President's principles for reform with \ncommonsense legislation. In March, I visited the Mariposa Nogales Port \nof Entry in Arizona at the U.S.-Mexico border and saw first-hand border \npatrol operations with U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents.\n  I understand that immigration reform is a complex and difficult \nissue. In addition to the legislation I have introduced today, there \nare other proposals on the table. The American people won't accept any \nmore excuses. Now is the time for us to stop deferring tough decisions \nand take action on this urgent national priority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 1920. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish a renewable \ndiesel standard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the House of Representatives has passed, \nand the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is considering, \nlegislation to increase petroleum refinery capacity in the United \nStates. The argument is that the shortage of domestic refining capacity \nis contributing to the rising price of gasoline which, in turn, is \nsqueezing families' pocketbooks and complicating our Nation's economic \nfuture. The theory is that relaxing environmental regulations will \nunlock long dormant investment in new domestic refining capacity.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S11826, October 25, 2005, the following sentence \nappeared: Mr. President, the House of Representatives has passed, \nand the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is \nconsidering, legislation to increase petroleum refinery capacity \nin the United States.\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. OBAMA. Mr. \nPresident, the House of Representatives has passed, and the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee is considering, legislation \nto increase petroleum refinery capacity in the United States.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  It is incumbent upon industry and the congressional supporters of \nthis bill to document that environmental regulation has in fact blocked \nsuch investment. Testimony has been provided on both sides of that \nproposition.\n  What seems to me to be less debatable is that any legislative effort \nto address deficient refining capacity should include the encouragement \nof domestic nonpetroleum refinery infrastructure. If we are serious \nabout reducing our country's dependence on imported petroleum and \ninsulating our economy from future supply disruption shocks--whether \nfrom the volatile Middle East or natural disasters such as Katrina--\nencouraging the construction of more alternative fuel refineries should \nbe part of that strategy. After all, even if we have more petroleum \nrefineries, we won't have any more crude oil to process through them, \nunless we import more. That is not what I would define as ``progress.''\n  This past summer, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act. As my \ncolleagues know, that law includes a bold, bipartisan initiative to \nhelp wean our Nation from its petroleum dependency: the Renewable Fuels \nStandard, RFS.\n  The RFS establishes that the national gasoline supply will consist of \nat least 7.5 billion gallons of homegrown ethanol by the year 2012. The \nRFS also commits the country to the greater use of biodiesel in our \nfuel supply.\n  As Congress looks to expand domestic gasoline supply, a far stronger \nsignal should be sent that the U.S. Government is serious about growing \nour 40 billion gallons-a-year domestic diesel industry. That's why \ntoday I am introducing legislation to create a Renewable Diesel \nStandard, with the goal of 2 billion gallons annually of alternative \nand renewable diesels by 2015.\n  Petrodiesel is used in a wide variety of transportation modes: \ntransit buses; semi trucks; ships; heavy duty construction, farming and \nmining equipment; military vehicles; locomotives; barges; large scale \ngenerators; farm and mining equipment; and in many people's individual \ncars and trucks. While not as large of a market as gasoline, \npetrodiesel is enormously significant.\n  A Renewable Diesel Standard would focus alternative fuel production \nstrongly on the world of diesel engine vehicles. And engines that use \npetrodiesel can also use other types of diesel fuels, like biodiesel, \nor Fischer Tropsch diesel, with little or no engine modification.\n  This interchangeability helps in time of diesel shortages. It helps \nkeep diesel prices competitive. And, as diesel is made from domestic \nfeedstocks, it reduces our reliance on foreign crude oil. That is good \nfor national security--especially when diesel is the fuel for workhorse \nvehicles like buses, bulldozers, or military equipment that are so \nimportant in times of emergency.\n  In recent months, Illinois farmers have raised concerns with me \nregarding the high cost of diesel fuel. Imagine how biodiesel and \ndiesel alternatives could help mitigate fuel costs for farmers who now \nmostly rely on diesel fuel made from foreign oil. Imagine how \nbiodiesels or coal diesels could help truckers and other small business \nowners, whose profit margins are so seriously affected by unforeseen \nprice spikes in petrodiesel for semi trucks.\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\n  For my colleagues who have staked out opposing positions in the CAFE \ndebate, a Renewable Diesel Standard would, like the RFS, lay the \ngroundwork for increasing ``miles per gallon'' per vehicle in terms of \npetroleum usage. And wasn't that the underlying intent of CAFE in the \nfirst place when it was enacted in 1975--to reduce our use of \npetroleum, especially imported oil and petroleum products?\n  This bill does not propose that 10 percent of the national \npetrodiesel pool be strengthened with diesel alternatives. It proposes \nonly 1 percent of the national supply.\n  That is hardly painful for the petroleum industry. This initiative \nwould not in any way dent the oil industry's record-shattering profits. \nIt is, however, a bold initiative for those entrepreneurs who know that \nnew diesels work and are willing to prove it by investing on a \ncommercial scale. They know we can make diesel from soybeans, from \nsunflower seeds, from coal, and even from garbage. Let's give them \nstronger assurance that the United States intends to capitalize on \ntheir vision, ingenuity, and expertise in the cause of energy \nindependence.\n  Right now, there is an estimated 180 million gallons of biodiesel \nproduction capacity in the United States. Fifty-four companies have \nreported their plans to construct dedicated biodiesel plants in the \nnear future, but those plans are dependent upon regional and national \ndemand prospects.\n  Current domestic petroleum demand is estimated to be high enough in \nthe coming years that the United States would need to construct a \n400,000 barrel per day petroleum refinery each year to meet market \nprojections. Yet no new petroleum refineries have been built in the \nUnited States in a quarter century. During the same period, however, \nmore than 120 refineries have been built for ethanol and biodiesel, \nwith more in the works. And the good news is: unlike petroleum \nrefineries, our ethanol and biodiesel refineries do not require \nimported oil as raw material to make the finished product.\n  Mr. President, hundreds of millions of gallons of diesel are possible \nwithin the timeline proposed in my legislation, making another small \nbut bold step to create jobs in rural America, strengthen our economic \nsecurity, and improve air quality. A Renewable Diesel Standard is the \nright course for the Nation's future. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin cosponsoring this legislation, and I ask their support for swift \nenactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11827-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 286--COMMENDING THE GRAND OLE OPRY ON THE OCCASION OF \n ITS 80TH ANNIVERSARY FOR ITS IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE POPULARIZATION OF \nCOUNTRY MUSIC AND FOR ITS 8 DECADES OF MUSICAL AND BROADCAST EXCELLENCE\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 287\n\n       Whereas Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913, as Rosa \n     Louise McCauley, to James and Leona McCauley in Tuskegee, \n     Alabama;\n       Whereas her moral clarity and quiet dignity shaped and \n     inspired the Civil Rights Movement in the United States over \n     the last half-century;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks was educated in Pine Level, Alabama, \n     until the age of 11, when she enrolled in the Montgomery \n     Industrial School for Girls and then went on to attend the \n     Alabama State Teachers College High School;\n       Whereas on December 18, 1932, Rosa McCauley married Raymond \n     Parks and settled in Montgomery, Alabama;\n       Whereas, together, Raymond and Rosa Parks worked in the \n     Montgomery, Alabama branch of the National Association for \n     the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where Raymond \n     Parks served as an active member and Rosa Parks served as a \n     secretary and youth leader;\n       Whereas on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for \n     refusing to give up her seat in the ``colored'' section of \n     the bus to a white man on the orders of the bus driver \n     because the ``white'' section was full;\n       Whereas the arrest of Rosa Parks led African Americans and \n     others to boycott the Montgomery city bus line until the \n     buses in Montgomery were desegregated;\n       Whereas the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott encouraged other \n     courageous people across the United States to organize in \n     protest and demand equal rights for all;\n       Whereas most historians date the beginning of the modern-\n     day Civil Rights Movement in the United States to December 1, \n     1955;\n       Whereas the fearless acts of civil disobedience displayed \n     by Rosa Parks and others resulted in a legal action \n     challenging Montgomery's segregated public transportation \n     system, which subsequently led to the United States Supreme \n     Court, on November 13, 1956, affirming a district court \n     decision that held that Montgomery segregation codes deny and \n     deprive African Americans of the equal protection of the laws \n     (352 U.S. 903);\n       Whereas in 1957, Rosa Parks moved to Detroit, Michigan;\n\n[[Page S11828]]\n\n       Whereas in 1965, Representative John Conyers hired Rosa \n     Parks as a member of his staff, where she worked in various \n     administrative jobs for 23 years and retired in 1988 at age \n     75;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks continued her civil rights work by \n     starting the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self \n     Development in 1987, a nonprofit organization that motivates \n     young people to reach their highest potential;\n       Whereas the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self \n     Development offers educational programs for young people, \n     including two signature programs: first, Pathways to Freedom, \n     a 21-day program that introduces students to the Underground \n     Railroad and the civil rights movement with a freedom ride \n     across the United States and Canada, tracing the underground \n     railroad into civil rights, and second, Learning Centers and \n     Senior Citizens, a program that partners young people with \n     senior citizens where the young help the senior citizens \n     develop their computer skills and senior citizens mentor the \n     young;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks has been commended for her work in the \n     realm of civil rights with such recognitions as the NAACP's \n     Spingarn Medal, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Nonviolent Peace \n     Prize, the Presidential medal of Freedom, and the \n     Congressional Gold Medal;\n       Whereas Time magazine named Rosa Parks one of the ``100 \n     most influential people of the 20th century'', The Henry Ford \n     Museum in Michigan bought and exhibited the bus on which she \n     was arrested, and The Rosa Parks Library and Museum opened in \n     Montgomery in 2000;\n       Whereas in 2005, the year marking the 50th anniversary of \n     Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on the bus, we \n     recognize the courage, dignity, and determination displayed \n     by Rosa Parks as she confronted injustice and inequality; and\n       Whereas in 1988 Rosa Parks said: ``I am leaving this legacy \n     to all of you . . . to bring peace, justice, equality, love \n     and a fulfillment of what our lives should be. Without \n     vision, the people will perish, and without courage and \n     inspiration, dreams will die--the dream of freedom and \n     peace'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the life and \n     accomplishments of Rosa Parks and expresses its condolences \n     on her passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11828-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 60--DESIGNATING THE NEGRO LEAGUES BASEBALL \n MUSEUM IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, AS AMERICA'S NATIONAL NEGRO LEAGUES \n                            BASEBALL MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. TALENT submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was \nreferred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n                            S.

RESPONSIBLE FATHERHOOD PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Responsible Fatherhood Program.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Nearly 24,000,000 children in the United States, or 34 \n     percent of all such children, live apart from their \n     biological father.\n       (B) Sixty percent of couples who divorce have at least 1 \n     child.\n       (C) The number of children living with only a mother \n     increased from just over 5,000,000 in 1960 to 17,000,000 in \n     1999, and between 1981 and 1991 the percentage of children \n     living with only 1 parent increased from 19 percent to 25 \n     percent.\n       (D) Forty percent of children who live in households \n     without a father have not seen their father in at least 1 \n     year and 50 percent of such children have never visited their \n     father's home.\n       (E) The most important factor in a child's upbringing is \n     whether the child is brought up in a loving, healthy, \n     supportive environment.\n       (F) Children who live without contact with their biological \n     father are, in comparison to children who have such contact--\n       (i) 5 times more likely to live in poverty;\n       (ii) more likely to bring weapons and drugs into the \n     classroom;\n       (iii) twice as likely to commit crime;\n       (iv) twice as likely to drop out of school;\n       (v) more likely to commit suicide;\n       (vi) more than twice as likely to abuse alcohol or drugs; \n     and\n       (vii) more likely to become pregnant as teenagers.\n       (G) Violent criminals are overwhelmingly males who grew up \n     without fathers.\n       (H) Between 20 and 30 percent of families in poverty are \n     headed by women who have suffered domestic violence during \n     the past year, and between 40 and 60 percent of women with \n     children receiving welfare were abused sometime during their \n     life.\n       (I) Responsible fatherhood includes active participation in \n     financial support and child care, as well as the formation \n     and maintenance of a positive, healthy, and nonviolent \n     relationship between father and child and a cooperative \n     relationship between parents.\n       (J) States should be encouraged to implement programs that \n     provide support for responsible fatherhood, promote marriage, \n     and increase the incidence of marriage, and should not be \n     restricted from implementing such programs.\n       (K) Fatherhood programs should promote and provide support \n     services for--\n       (i) loving and healthy relationships between parents and \n     children; and\n       (ii) cooperative parenting.\n       (L) There is a social need to reconnect children and \n     fathers.\n       (M) The promotion of responsible fatherhood and \n     encouragement of healthy 2-parent married families should \n     not--\n       (i) denigrate the standing or parenting efforts of single \n     mothers or other caregivers;\n       (ii) lessen the protection of children from abusive \n     parents; or\n       (iii) compromise the safety or health of the custodial \n     parent;\n     but should increase the chance that children will have 2 \n     caring parents to help them grow up healthy and secure.\n       (N) The promotion of responsible fatherhood must always \n     recognize and promote the values of nonviolence.\n       (O) For the future of the United States and the future of \n     our children, Congress, States, and local communities should \n     assist parents to become more actively involved in their \n     children's lives.\n       (P) Child support is an important means by which a parent \n     can take financial responsibility for a child and emotional \n     support is an important means by which a parent can take \n     social responsibility for a child.\n       (2) Fatherhood program.--Title I of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104-193) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 117.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 287, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 287) honoring the life of and \n     expressing the condolences of the Senate on the passing of \n     Rosa Parks.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last evening, we lost Rosa Parks. She died \nat the age of 92. Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice have shaped \nthis Nation's history and she is remembered with reverence and respect \nby us all.\n  A half century ago, Rosa Parks, the black seamstress whose refusal to \ngive up her seat on a Montgomery, AL bus to a white man sparked a \nrevolution in American race relations. Rosa Parks decided that she \nwould no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial \nsegregation on a bus. In her own words, Rosa Parks said, ``People \nalways say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that \nisn't true. I was not tired physically, or no more tired than I usually \nwas at the end of a working day. I was not old, although some people \nhave an image of me as being old then. I was forty-two. No, the only \ntired I was, was tired of giving in.''\n  The strength and spirit of this courageous woman captured the \nconsciousness of not only the American people but the entire world. \nRosa Parks's arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the \ncatalyst for the Montgomery bus, boycott. Her stand on that December \nday in 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of \nstruggle for equality and justice. Twelve years earlier, in 1943, Rosa \nParks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's bus \nrelated segregation laws requiring blacks to pay their fares at the \nfront of the bus, then get off of the bus and reboard from the rear of \nthe bus. The driver of that bus, was the same driver with whom she \nwould have her confrontation years later.\n  The rest is history; the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the \nbeginning of an American revolution that elevated that status of \nAfrican Americans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader \nwho would one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  For her personal bravery and self-sacrifice, in 1999, we honored Rosa \nParks with the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  My home State of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as one of our \nown. Rosa Parks and her husband Raymond made the journey to Detroit in \n1957 where Rosa Parks's brother resided. In the years since, she \ncontinued to dedicate her life to advancing equal opportunity and to \neducating our youth about the past struggles for freedom, from slavery \nup to the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\n  In 1987, the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development \nwas established. Its primary focus has been working with young people \nfrom across the country and the world as part of the ``Pathways to \nFreedom'' program. The pathways program traces history from the days of \nthe underground railroad to the civil rights movement of the 1960s and \nbeyond. Through this institute, young people, ages 11 to 17, meet with \nnational leaders and participate in a variety of educational and \nresearch projects. During the summer months, they have the opportunity \nto travel across the country visiting historical sites.\n  The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development has \nexpanded to include an intergenerational mentoring and computer skills \npartnership program, which teams young people with elderly Americans. \nGenerational and age barriers break down as young people help the \nelderly develop computer skills, while the elderly provide their unique \nand personalized recollections of their lives in American history. To \ndate, over 10,000 youth from around the world have participated in this \nprogram.\n  With the work of her institute, we can truly say that in addition to \nhaving played a major role in shaping America's past and present, Rosa \nParks is continuing to help shape America's future.\n  Mr. President, I close with the profound, instructive words of Rosa \nParks, which she spoke in 1988. She said: ``I am leaving this legacy to \nall of you . . . to bring peace, justice, equality, love and a \nfulfillment of what our lives should be. Without vision, the people \nwill perish, and without courage and inspiration, dreams will die--the \ndream of freedom and peace.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the honors and duties of serving \nin the United States Senate is to note the passing of great Americans \nand to recognize their greatness. Last night, Rosa Parks died in her \nhome in Detroit. She was 92 years old.\n  Rosa Parks did not set out to become a hero on the evening of \nDecember 1, 1955. She was, like millions of other Americans, merely on \nher way home after a long day's work.\n  She was a seamstress in Montgomery, AL, but her simple, profound act \nof civil disobedience was the spark that ignited the modern civil \nrights movement. For far too many African Americans at that time \nAmerica did not live up to its promise that ``all men are created \nequal.'' Thanks to Rosa Parks, America was forced to look at itself in \nthe mirror, admit its failing, and recommit itself to its founding \nideals.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King once wrote that ``human progress never rolls \nin on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of \nmen.'' This is the story of one such effort.\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\n  Rosa Parks was heading home that winter night on the Montgomery city \nbus system, which was segregated. Front row seats were reserved for \nWhite passengers. Blacks were restricted to the back of the bus and \nsometimes the middle of the bus. But if a White passenger demanded a \nBlack person give up his or her seat, that Black person was required to \ndo so.\n  On that first day in December, the White bus driver demanded that \nfour African Americans give up their seats so a single White man could \nsit down. Three of them complied.\n  Rosa didn't.\n  ``If you don't stand up I'm going to call the police and have you \narrested,'' said the driver.\n  But Rosa Parks had had enough of the evil divisions of segregation, \nand she replied to the driver, ``You may do that.''\n  With this simple refusal, Rosa Parks set into motion a crusade that \nwould eventually awaken the conscience of our country. Perhaps the time \nwas right for a nation like America to erase the stain of segregation. \nBut it was not inevitable that the struggle would start on that day in \nthat town, lit by one woman's courage and conviction.\n  Nor was it inevitable that Mrs. Parks took her stand in a town that \ncounted among its residents a 26-year-old preacher named Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. In response, Dr. King became the leader of the local bus \nboycott. Over time, as we all know, he led America's civil rights \nmovement to overcome the injustices that robbed millions of our fellow \ncitizens of their full rights as Americans.\n  Rosa Parks' life proved that one American with courage can make a \nmajority. We note her passing with sadness but also with deep gratitude \nfor the gift she left all of us.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, our Nation lost one of our \nheroes, Rosa Parks--the mother of the modern civil rights movement. The \nmovement that she helped launch changed not only our country but the \nentire world, as her actions gave hope to every individual fighting for \ncivil and human rights.\n  While history proudly remembers December 1, 1955, as Rosa Parks' \nbravest moment, her fight against oppression and segregation began long \nbefore that day. Mrs. Parks was active in the Montgomery NAACP, serving \nas secretary and as an adviser to the NAACP's Youth Council. She also \nworked to register African Americans to vote and was active in many \nother civil rights causes. While it was her act of defiance in 1955 \nthat garnered national attention, she had been thrown off a bus 12 \nyears earlier--by the same driver--for refusing to move. Why was she \nthrown off the bus? Even then, she refused to give up her seat.\n  Rosa Parks' bravery triggered the Montgomery bus boycott. The boycott \ngained national attention, ushered in an atmosphere of change, and was \nthe precursor to landmark legislation--most importantly, the Civil \nRights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Eventually, the issue of \nsegregation and Montgomery's bus policy ended up in the Supreme Court--\nanother reminder of how important the institution is in protecting the \nrights of every American.\n  And we should not forget something else. The boycott introduced the \nNation to a young minister, a Baptist preacher named Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.\n  While the Nation will miss Rosa Parks, we take heart in the fact that \nher legacy will be felt by generations to come. As Senators, all of us \nhave a special responsibility when it comes to the legacy of Rosa \nParks. It is not enough for us to celebrate her life with words. As \nleaders of this country, we must honor it with deeds, deeds that \ncontinue the fight Rosa Parks began almost 50 years ago.\n  Specifically, we must reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, which has \nopened the doors of political participation to countless Americans. We \nmust work to increase educational opportunities so that all young \npeople have a chance for a better life. We must ensure that our \npolicies build a better America for the meek and vulnerable, not only \nthe powerful and strong. This work is how we will truly celebrate the \nlife of Rosa Parks. All of us in this Chamber have it in our power to \nfurther the fight she began, and we owe it to every American to ensure \nher legacy endures.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today the Nation mourns a genuine American \nhero. Rosa Parks died yesterday in her home in Detroit. Through her \ncourage and by her example, Rosa Parks helped lay the foundation for a \ncountry that could begin to live up to its creed.\n  Her life, and her brave actions, reminded each and every one of us of \nour personal responsibilities to stand up for what is right and the \ncentral truth of the American experience that our greatness as a nation \nderives from seemingly ordinary people doing extraordinary things.\n  Rosa Parks' life was a lesson in perseverance. As a child, she grew \nup listening to the Ku Klux Klan ride by her house, fearing that her \nhouse would be burned down. In her small hometown in Alabama, she \nattended a one-room school for African American children that only went \nthrough the sixth grade. When she moved to Montgomery, AL, to continue \nher schooling, she was forced to clean classrooms after school to pay \nher tuition. Although she attended Alabama State Teachers College, Rosa \nParks would later make her living as a seamstress and housekeeper.\n  But she didn't accept that her opportunities were limited to sewing \nclothes or cleaning houses. In her 40s, Rosa Parks was appointed \nsecretary of the Montgomery branch of the NAACP and was active in voter \nregistration drives with the Montgomery Voters League. In the summer of \n1955, she attended the Highlander Folk School, where she took classes \nin workers' rights and racial equality. Well before she made headlines \nacross the country, she was a highly respected member of the Montgomery \ncommunity and a committed member of the civil rights effort.\n  Of course, her name became permanently etched in American history on \nDecember 1, 1955, when she was arrested for refusing to give up her \nseat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus. It wasn't the first time \nRosa Parks refused to acquiesce to the Jim Crow system. The same bus \ndriver who had her arrested had thrown her off a bus the year before \nfor refusing to give up her seat.\n  Some schoolchildren are taught that Rosa Parks refused to give up her \nseat because her feet were tired. But our Nation's schoolbooks are only \ngetting it half right. She once said:\n\n       The only tired I was, was tired of giving in.\n\n  This solitary act of civil disobedience became a call to action. Her \narrest led a then relatively unknown pastor, Martin Luther King, Jr., \nto organize a boycott of the Montgomery bus system. That boycott lasted \n381 days and culminated in a landmark Supreme Court decision finding \nthat the city's segregation policy was unconstitutional.\n  This solitary act of civil disobedience was also the spark that \nignited the beginning of the end for segregation and inspired millions \naround the country and ultimately around the world to get involved in \nthe fight for racial equality.\n  Rosa Parks' persistence and determination did not end that day in \nMontgomery, nor did it end with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and \nVoting Rights Act years later. She stayed active in the NAACP and other \ncivil rights groups for years. From 1965 to 1988, Ms. Parks continued \nher public service by working for my good friend Congressman John \nConyers. And in an example of her low-key demeanor, her job in \nCongressman Conyers' office did not involve appearances as a figurehead \nor celebrity; she helped homeless folks find housing.\n  At the age of 74, she opened the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for \nSelf-Development, which offers education and job training programs for \ndisadvantaged youth. And even into her 80s, Rosa Parks gave lectures \nand attended meetings with civil rights groups.\n  At the age of 86, Rosa Parks' courage and fortitude was recognized by \nPresident Bill Clinton, who awarded her the Nation's highest honor for \na civilian the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  As we honor the life of Rosa Parks, we should not limit our \ncommemorations to lofty eulogies.\n  Instead, let us commit ourselves to carrying on her fight, one \nsolitary act at a time, and ensure that her passion continues to \ninspire as it did a half-century ago. That, in my view, is how we can \nbest thank her for her immense contributions to our country.\n  Rosa Parks once said:\n\n\n[[Page S11848]]\n\n\n       As long as there is unemployment, war, crime and all things \n     that go to the infliction of man's inhumanity to man, \n     regardless--there is much to be done, and people need to work \n     together.\n\n  Now that she has passed, it is up to us to make sure that her message \nis shared. While we will miss her cherished spirit, let's make sure \nthat her legacy lives on in the heart of a nation.\n\n  As a personal note, I think it is fair to say were it not for that \nquiet moment of courage by Mrs. Parks, I would not be standing here \ntoday. I owe her a great thanks, as does the Nation. She will be sorely \nmissed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with the passing of Rosa Parks, the \nNation has lost a courageous woman, a true American heroine, and an \nicon of the civil rights movement. All of us mourn her loss. Half a \ncentury ago, Rosa Parks stood up not only for herself but for all \nfuture generations of Americans. Her quiet resoluteness in the face of \nsegregation inspired America, transformed the civil rights movement, \nand roused the moral conscience of the Nation from its long slumber on \ncivil rights. We will never forget her, and our hearts and prayers \ntoday are with her loved ones.\n  On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was a seamstress in Montgomery, AL, \non her way home by bus from her work. Under the law at that time in \nMontgomery, and in many other places in the South, Rosa Parks, as an \nAfrican American, was ordered to give up her seat for a white passenger \nwhen the bus became crowded. She refused, was arrested, and lost her \njob as a result. But her courageous act prompted the African American \ncommunity to begin a boycott of the Montgomery bus system, which \neventually broke the back of the Jim Crow rules in the system, and \nMontgomery buses were desegregated the following year.\n  Her later life continued to demonstrate her quiet moral resolve and \nher extraordinary commitment to doing what is right. She continued her \ncivil rights work after moving to Detroit in 1957, working with the \noffice of Congressman John Conyers for over 20 years, and later \nstarting the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, a \nnonprofit organization that motivates youths to reach their highest \npotential.\n  In 1996, Rosa Parks was honored by President Clinton with the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom and she received the Congressional Gold \nMedal in 1999.\n  I join my colleagues from Michigan, Senators Levin and Stabenow, in \nsupport of a resolution honoring the life and accomplishments of Rosa \nParks. Her courage, dignity, and determination symbolize the best of \nAmerica, the spirit of patriotism that challenges us whenever we fail \nto live up to the highest ideals of our society.\n  Today, as we mourn the passing of Rosa Parks, we are reminded how \nmuch has been accomplished because of her sacrifice, and how much work \nAmerica still has to do to fully live up to her ideals of equality. We \nare grateful for her example, and proud to carry on her mission of \nhope, opportunity, and equal justice for all.\n  As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote about her courageous step \ntowards equality, ``[N]o one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks \nunless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and \nthe human personality cries out, `I can take it no longer' ''. Let \nthose words in honor of Rosa Parks be our guide today.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, we learned last night of the passing of one \nof this Nation's greatest Civil Rights heroes who will always be \nremembered for her steadfast leadership for equal justice. When Rosa \nParks peacefully refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery public bus \nin 1955, her solitary act of courage for the cause of equality became a \ndefining moment in American history.\n  It was Mrs. Parks' steady courage and unflinching character that \nhelped set in motion changes that moved the hearts and minds of the \nAmerican people. She clearly demonstrated the need for our country to \nlive up to one of our founding principles, that all men are created \nequal. America is a much better place today because of the strength of \nthis quiet seamstress from Tuskegee. My thoughts and prayers are with \nMrs. Parks' family during these days of sadness.\n  I would encourage young Americans to visit the Rosa Parks Library and \nMuseum in Montgomery to learn about her life. It is my hope that the \nspirit of Rosa Parks continues to live on in America and that this \nNation and its leaders never forget the important lessons about decency \nand equality of opportunity for all. I know that her spirit will live \non in my life.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, America mourns the passing of a quiet hero, \nRosa Parks, who died yesterday in Detroit at the age of 92.\n  On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, AL, a seamstress named Rosa Parks \nrefused to move from her seat near the front of a city bus so a White \nperson could sit there. Like a shot heard round the world, her act of \ncivil disobedience spurred the movement to gain social and political \nequality for Black people in this country.\n  It is almost hard to recover, half a century later, a sense of how \nmuch courage it took for her to do what she did. By remaining seated, \nshe violated a local segregation law that consigned African Americans \nto second-class citizenship. She was arrested for disorderly conduct, \nand the incident galvanized the Montgomery bus boycott, propelling \nMartin Luther King, Jr., the boycott's leader, to a national role in \nthe civil rights movement.\n  As the ancient poet once said, ``A good reputation is more valuable \nthan money.'' Rosa Parks' sterling reputation was what civil rights \nleaders banked on in putting her in the spotlight for the cause that \nday--and they were never disappointed. Throughout her long life she \nexemplified honesty, integrity, and dignity, and articulated the all-\nimportant principle that political and social equality is every \nAmerican's due.\n  Mrs. Parks, along with Dr. King, A. Philip Randolph, Medgar Evers, \nFannie Lou Hamer, Bob Moses, and the other campaigners for civil rights \nduring the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s, had faith in the legal \nprocess. They had faith, too, in the moral conscience of America. They \nknew time had come. Their patience, their discipline, and their \nunderstanding that these two qualities would win the White majority to \ntheir cause, were admirable. Mrs. Parks deserves a share of the credit \nfor accomplishments in the decade following the famous bus boycott: \npassage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act \nof 1965.\n  These laws made illegal racial segregation in public accommodations, \nin housing, in education, and in the workforce. These and other civil \nrights laws have not eradicated bigotry. They have not gotten us all \nthe way to a colorblind society yet. But they were huge strides toward \nmaking America live up to its founding doctrine that ``All men are \ncreated equal.''\n  Mrs. Parks took risks to vindicate ideas that transcend race, color, \nand religious creed. She said: ``To this day I believe we are here on \nthe planet Earth to live, grow up and do what we can to make this world \na better place for all people to enjoy freedom.''\n  She stood for what is universal. That is why interest in one \nseamstress' act on a December day long ago in Alabama has never \nflagged. There are books, songs, and television shows about the bus \nboycott and its humble heroine, proving that unassuming people can do \ngreat things when they are animated by the highest ideals.\n  Rosa Parks, Godspeed.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness and heavy \nhearts that my wife Julianne and I learned of the passing of Mrs. Rosa \nParks. Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Parks family at \nthis sorrowful time.\n  Mrs. Rosa Parks, ``The Mother of the Civil Rights Movement,'' is an \ninternational symbol of freedom. She stood for what she believed in, \nand changed our Nation's history. Her act of courage inspired so many \nduring the civil rights movement and continues to inspire people today.\n  Rosa Parks sat quietly on a bus in Montgomery, AL 50 years ago, and \nrefused to give up her seat to a white passenger. Because of the \nnonviolent protest that Mrs. Parks displayed on December 1, 1955 our \nentire Nation turned its attention to the gross indecencies that were \naffecting the black community.\n  Her solitary action set into play the revolutionary 381-day bus \nboycott that\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\nwas organized by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. At the time not many \nAmericans had heard of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. His protest and \nmonumental following brought about the November 1956 Supreme Court \nRuling that segregation on transportation is illegal, and in 1964 the \nCivil Rights Act, which outlawed racial discrimination in the U.S.\n  Rosa Parks attended Alabama State College, and upon graduation worked \nas a seamstress and housekeeper. She and her husband, Raymond Parks, \nwere active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, NAACP. In 1943 Mrs. Parks was elected Secretary of the \nMontgomery Chapter of the NAACP, and later became its youth leader. She \nwas also involved in the Montgomery Voters League, an organization that \nhelped black citizens become registered to vote.\n  Rosa Parks continued to set an example for our Nation in 1987 when \nshe founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development. \nThe Institute teaches young people the history of the civil rights \nmovement through an annual summer program called ``Pathways to \nFreedom.''\n  Rosa Parks was one of the most significant figures in the 20th \ncentury, and appropriately received hundreds of awards and honors, \nincluding the Medal of Freedom Award, presented by President Clinton in \n1996. Mrs. Parks will be deeply missed, and her legacy will forever be \nremembered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise tonight to honor the life of Rosa \nParks.\n  Let's ask an impossible question: Who was Rosa Parks?\n  Rosa Parks was a seamstress. She was a community organizer. She was \nan activist and a leader. Rosa Parks was a carpenter's daughter and a \nbarber's wife. She was a hero of the civil rights movement. She was a \ntrusted Congressional aide and a respected youth development expert.\n  And of course, Rosa Parks was the inspiring protagonist of a stirring \nAmerican tale. Protest, reform, and reinvention marked the early pages \nof her great human story. On December 1, 1955, on a bus in Montgomery, \nAL, Rosa Parks, a black woman, refused to stand up and give her seat to \na white man. She was arrested, tried, convicted, and fined for her act \nof civil disobedience in less than a week. The citywide boycott \ninspired by her actions would last more than a year. The full impact of \nthose events would change a nation, last a lifetime, and reach far \nbeyond.\n  Rosa Parks has played a guiding role not only in the lives of \ncountless individuals but, over the last half-century, in the shape of \nour ever-evolving Nation. Throughout it all, she has been a great \nAmerican teacher.\n  From Rosa Parks, we learned what it takes to be courageous in the \nface of oppression and hate. From Rosa Parks, we learned that sometimes \nto be strong is to say ``No.''\n  From Rosa Parks we learned that freedom without equality is no \nfreedom at all. And from Rosa Parks we learned that fighting the bonds \nof orthodoxy and confronting the sources of ignorances is a noble and \nurgent cause.\n  Rosa Parks' legacy reminds us that a lone person can effect great \nchange; many people working together with united purpose can achieve \neven more.\n  Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the young Montgomery preacher who helped \nto transform Rosa Parks' act of resistance into a powerful movement, \nwould later say the ``arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends \ntowards justice.''\n  If we are to honor the legacy of Rosa Parks, we must never rest in \nour pursuit of that justice.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to express my thoughts \non the passing of a true civil rights pioneer. Rosa Parks' actions \nalmost 50 years ago in Montgomery, AL, ignited a movement that \ndramatically changed the face of America and the world.\n  Even before her refusal to give up her seat on December 1, 1955, Mrs. \nParks was already actively involved in the civil rights movement as the \nsecretary of the local chapter of the NAACP. But her actions that day \nlaid the groundwork for the civil rights movement in the years to \nfollow. As a result of her actions, a local public bus boycott ensued \nthat garnered national attention and resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court \nruling prohibiting bus segregation, mass demonstrations throughout the \nSouth ensued, and Martin Luther King, Jr. becoming a national civil \nrights leader.\n  Mrs. Parks' refusal to give up her seat on December 1, 1955, was a \nsimple but dangerous action that highlighted the inequalities faced by \nmillions of Americans living under segregation. Former U.S. poet \nlaureate, Rita Dove, wrote, ``How she sat there, the time right inside \na place so wrong it was ready.'' America was ready for change and that \nchange continues today.\n  As the world grieves, let us remember her courage and work to ensure \nthat her legacy continues.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 287) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 287\n\n       Whereas Rosa Parks was born on February 4, 1913, as Rosa \n     Louise McCauley, to James and Leona McCauley in Tuskegee, \n     Alabama;\n       Whereas her moral clarity and quiet dignity shaped and \n     inspired the Civil Rights Movement in the United States over \n     the last half-century;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks was educated in Pine Level, Alabama, \n     until the age of 11, when she enrolled in the Montgomery \n     Industrial School for Girls and then went on to attend the \n     Alabama State Teachers College High School;\n       Whereas on December 18, 1932, Rosa McCauley married Raymond \n     Parks and settled in Montgomery, Alabama;\n       Whereas, together, Raymond and Rosa Parks worked in the \n     Montgomery, Alabama branch of the National Association for \n     the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where Raymond \n     Parks served as an active member and Rosa Parks served as a \n     secretary and youth leader;\n       Whereas on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for \n     refusing to give up her seat in the ``colored'' section of \n     the bus to a white man on the orders of the bus driver \n     because the ``white'' section was full;\n       Whereas the arrest of Rosa Parks led African Americans and \n     others to boycott the Montgomery city bus line until the \n     buses in Montgomery were desegregated;\n       Whereas the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott encouraged other \n     courageous people across the United States to organize in \n     protest and demand equal rights for all;\n       Whereas most historians date the beginning of the modern-\n     day Civil Rights Movement in the United States to December 1, \n     1955;\n       Whereas the fearless acts of civil disobedience displayed \n     by Rosa Parks and others resulted in a legal action \n     challenging Montgomery's segregated public transportation \n     system, which subsequently led to the United States Supreme \n     Court, on November 13, 1956, affirming a district court \n     decision that held that Montgomery segregation codes deny and \n     deprive African Americans of the equal protection of the laws \n     (352 U.S. 903);\n       Whereas in 1957, Rosa Parks moved to Detroit, Michigan;\n       Whereas in 1965, Representative John Conyers hired Rosa \n     Parks as a member of his staff, where she worked in various \n     administrative jobs for 23 years and retired in 1988 at age \n     75;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks continued her civil rights work by \n     starting the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self \n     Development in 1987, a nonprofit organization that motivates \n     young people to reach their highest potential;\n       Whereas the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self \n     Development offers educational programs for young people, \n     including two signature programs: first, Pathways to Freedom, \n     a 21-day program that introduces students to the Underground \n     Railroad and the civil rights movement with a freedom ride \n     across the United States and Canada, tracing the underground \n     railroad into civil rights, and second, Learning Centers and \n     Senior Citizens, a program that partners young people with \n     senior citizens where the young help the senior citizens \n     develop their computer skills and senior citizens mentor the \n     young;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks has been commended for her work in the \n     realm of civil rights with such recognitions as the NAACP's \n     Spingarn Medal, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Nonviolent Peace \n     Prize, the Presidential medal of Freedom, and the \n     Congressional Gold Medal;\n       Whereas Time magazine named Rosa Parks one of the ``100 \n     most influential people of the 20th century'', The Henry Ford \n     Museum in Michigan bought and exhibited the bus on which she \n     was arrested, and The Rosa Parks Library and Museum opened in \n     Montgomery in 2000;\n       Whereas in 2005, the year marking the 50th anniversary of \n     Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on the bus, we \n     recognize the courage, dignity, and determination displayed \n     by\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\n     Rosa Parks as she confronted injustice and inequality; and\n       Whereas in 1988 Rosa Parks said: ``I am leaving this legacy \n     to all of you . . . to bring peace, justice, equality, love \n     and a fulfillment of what our lives should be. Without \n     vision, the people will perish, and without courage `and \n     inspiration, dreams will die--the dream of freedom and \n     peace'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate That the Senate honors the life and \n     accomplishments of Rosa Parks and expresses its condolences \n     on her passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11850-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ANTITRUST CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 250, S. 443.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 443) to improve the investigation of criminal \n     antitrust offenses.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Antitrust \nInvestigative Improvements Act of 2005, a bill I am cosponsoring with \nSenators DeWine and Leahy. This important measure will give the \nantitrust criminal enforcers at the Department of Justice a vital tool \nto investigate, detect, and prevent antitrust conspiracies. It will \nallow the Justice Department, upon a showing of probable cause to a \nFederal judge, authority to obtain a wiretap order for a limited time \nperiod to monitor communications between those suspected of engaging in \nillegal antitrust conspiracies.\n  The current Federal criminal code lists over 150 predicate offenses \nfor which the Justice Department may obtain a wiretap during the course \nof a criminal investigation. These offenses include basic white collar \ncrimes such as mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud. However, under \ncurrent law, if the Government is investigating a criminal antitrust \nconspiracy, such as a scheme to fix prices to consumers, the Government \ncannot obtain a wiretap of the suspected conspirators. This inability \nto obtain wiretaps unquestionably severely handicaps the detection and \nprevention of such conspiracies. Only with the consent of a member of \nthe conspiracy who has already agreed to cooperate with the Government \nmay the Government surreptitiously record the meetings of the \nconspirators.\n  There is no logical basis to exclude criminal antitrust violations \nfrom the list of predicate offenses for a wiretap. A criminal antitrust \noffense, such as price fixing, is every bit as serious--and causes \nevery bit as much financial loss to its victims--as other white collar \ncrimes, such as mail fraud or wire fraud. A price-fixing conspiracy \nraises prices to consumers, stealing hard earned dollars from citizens \nas surely as does a salesman promoting a bogus investment from a \n``boiler room'' or, indeed, a thief with a gun. Moreover, by its secret \nnature as an agreement among competitors, such a conspiracy is likely \nharder to detect than a fraudulent offering over the phone or through \nthe mail. A properly issued wiretap, therefore, is even more necessary \nto detect criminal antitrust conspiracies than other white collar \noffenses.\n  Detecting, preventing, and punishing criminal antitrust offenses are \none of the principal missions of the Justice Department's Antitrust \nDivision. Such offenses are punished severely with corporations facing \nfines of up to $100 million and individuals subject to jail terms of up \nto 10 years for each offense. Indeed, last year we passed legislation \nraising criminal penalties to these new levels. Yet, despite the damage \nthese conspiracies do to the economy and individual consumers, our law \nenforcement agencies lack the one vital tool essential to uncover these \nsecret conspiracies--the ability to obtain a wiretap to monitor \ncommunications between the suspected conspirators upon a showing of \nprobable cause. This legislation will remedy this defect by granting to \nour law enforcement officials the necessary means to protect consumers \nand end illegal antitrust conspiracies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year I was pleased to join the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee \non Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, Senators DeWine \nand Kohl, on the introduction of the ``Antitrust Criminal Investigative \nImprovements Act of 2005, ACIIA. Today, I am even more pleased to see \nthe Senate pass this bill. This is important legislation, and I hope \nthat it will receive the speedy vote in the House of Representatives \nthat it deserves. Once the President signs it into law, the Department \nof Justice will finally have another vital tool to enforce antitrust \nlaws--wiretap authority to investigate and prosecute criminal antitrust \nviolations.\n  America's antitrust laws play a critical role in protecting consumers \nand ensuring a fair and competitive marketplace for business. \nCongress's first antitrust law, the Sherman Antitrust Law, was enacted \nin 1890 to prohibit abusive monopolies and restraints of trade. Since \nthat time, enforcement of the antitrust laws has benefited consumers \nthrough lower prices, greater variety, and higher quality products and \nservices. But antitrust criminal offenses have been somewhat anomalous \nin the law, for they have not qualified for judicially approved \nwiretaps. The ACIIA will add criminal price fixing and bid rigging to \nthe many crimes that are already ``predicate offenses'' for wiretap \npurposes. There are over 150 offenses that currently qualify for \njudicial approved wiretaps. These ``predicate offenses'' under Title \nIII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, include crimes \nof lesser impact and significance than criminal antitrust violations. \nThe ACIIA will ensure that the Department of Justice has the tools \ncommensurate with the seriousness of the violations.\n  Under current law, the Department of Justice must often rely on the \nFBI or other investigative agencies to obtain evidence. While the \nJustice Department may engage in court-authorized searches of business \nrecords, it may only monitor phone calls of informants or the \nconversations of consenting parties. In light of the seriousness of \neconomic harms caused by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the \ninability of the Department of Justice to obtain wiretaps when \ninvestigating criminal antitrust violations makes little sense. The \nevidence that can be acquired through wiretaps is precisely the type of \nevidence that is essential for the successful prosecution and \nprevention of serious antitrust violations. This bill equips the \nDepartment of Justice investigators and prosecutors the opportunity to \nzealously enforce the criminal antitrust laws of the United States.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will resume \nconsideration of that Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Just a few moments \nago I filed cloture on that bill. Senators who are serious about \noffering germane amendments should work with the bill managers to \nschedule floor consideration just as quickly as possible. We are on \ntrack, the track that we set out last week, to finish the bill this \nweek. I encourage Senators to vote for cloture in order to speed \npassage of this, the very last, the final appropriations bill for this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/25/senate-section/article/S11851-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
