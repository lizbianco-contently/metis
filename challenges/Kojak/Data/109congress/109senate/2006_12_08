Mr. President, I wish to briefly comment on health care \npolicy which we have been able to accomplish over the last several \nyears.\n  As most people know, for 20 years before I entered politics, I \ndevoted my life to healing and to helping people one-on-one through \nmedicine, and now for 12 years in the Senate I have tried to focus on \nhealing and helping people using public policy.\n  From the outset, I have worked hard to place medicine and health care \nat the center of our national agenda.\n  I had a meeting at the White House earlier this morning. I restated \nhow important it is that we address what is a coming tsunami as our \naging population incessantly is coming toward us similar to a big tidal \nwave. It will be here in a few years.\n  Health care affects our global competitiveness. It affects our $8.5 \ntrillion debt, our deficit, and our State budgets. It is intensely \npersonal. It affects all of us in a very direct way because we are all \nsick at one time or another.\n  I am very proud of the work we have been able to accomplish on the \nfloor in this body on health care policy. Thanks to a new Medicare Part \nD drug benefit, millions of seniors today are receiving access to drugs \nthey didn't have before--drugs that can prevent heart attack or can \nprevent a stroke or can prevent various kinds of maladies from which \npeople suffer. People today who have this affordable access to drugs no \nlonger have to worry about having an illness or serious illness hit \nthem and being able to buy those drugs which they need to treat that \nillness.\n  In that prescription drug coverage legislation which we passed, all \nAmericans gained better access to health care through what we put in as \nHealth Savings Accounts, accounts that you own, that you can control, \nthat you can take with you.\n  Over a 5-year period in this body, we had an initiative which was \ncompleted to double the NIH budget. That leads\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\nto new cures today and new therapies tomorrow.\n  I am also particularly proud of this body passing the United States \nLeadership Against Global HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act. As \nmy colleagues know, respectively, 3 million people die of the first, 2 \nmillion of the second, and 1 million of the third of the disease I \nmentioned. Move than 5 million people die a year. These are three \ndeadly infectious diseases that can be controlled.\n\n  We took a major step forward with that $15 billion commitment. There \nis a lot more to do to address our health care system today. I am a \ngreat advocate of aligning our values and our incentives on results and \noutcomes. I believe in that vision of a health care system that is \ncentered around a patient, or ``the patient,'' that is provider \nfriendly, that is driven by three things: 21st century information; \nsecond, by choice; and third, driven by some element of control. A \nconsumer-driven system is that vision, that model, to which we should \nall strive.\n  We need to change the way we think about health care, we need to \nreign in those frivolous lawsuits. We tried again and again to do so in \nthe Senate the last 4 years and have been unsuccessful. The frivolous \nlawsuits drive up the cost of your health care, my colleagues' health \ncare, and the cost of health care of everyone in this country.\n  We also need to address quality of health care to make sure those \nmedical errors are eliminated, those needless medical errors that are \nmade in our health care system today.\n  I am proud of the contributions Congress has made. We have much more \nto do.\n  Mr. President, when I placed my hand on the Bible and took my oath of \noffice on a cold morning in 1995, I did not know many things I know \ntoday. But I knew with certainty that medicine would play a major role \nin my career in the Senate.\n  I kept the letters M.D. beside my name in my Senate office. I kept a \nstethoscope on my desk. And I kept my mind on the work of healing--of \nhelping.\n  For 20 years before I entered politics, I devoted my life to helping \npeople one-on-one. I performed 150 major transplants and, I hope, did a \nlittle to advance the science of transplantation. For 12 years in the \nSenate, I focused on the needs and interests of the people of \nTennessee, the nation and, and around the world.\n  And, throughout it, I have done my best to remember where I came \nfrom: medicine. At the onset of my Senate career, I began working to \nplace medicine at the center of our national agenda and promote its \nrole around the world. Health care, after all, affects all of us, at \nevery stage of our lives. I've spent enormous time on health and I hope \nit has made a difference.\n  I am proud of the work I have done to improve Medicare and preserve \nits promise to America's seniors. Thanks to the new Medicare Part D \ndrug benefit, millions of American seniors will no longer have to worry \nabout how they will pay for their prescriptions. Just as importantly, \nthe new Part D benefit serves as a template for the future of Medicare: \nit empowers consumers and lets them choose the plan that fits their \nneeds best. Most seniors have more than 20 choices, satisfaction is \nhigh, and costs to consumers have been less than we projected. The plan \nis a success. And we did it without having to impose price controls or \ncaps that would stifle innovation and dry up the supply of new \nmedicines.\n  The changes we created with the historic Medicare Modernization Act \nof 2003 do not end with the drug benefit. Medicare has begun to change \nits focus as well: it includes a first-ever ``welcome to Medicare'' \nexam and new coverage for tests that will help us prevent and treat \ndiseases before they become major problems. Under the same legislation, \nnearly all Americans also gained much broader access to a new type of \nhealth coverage--Health Savings Accounts that they own, control, and \ncarry with them from job to job.\n  I believe my efforts with regard to the National Institutes of Health \nembody the same forward-looking spirit that led to improvements in \nMedicare. For years, NIH's budget grew only about as fast as our \noverall economy even though medicine became an increasingly important \neconomic activity. My medical colleagues told me that necessary \nresearch could not always find funding--and the American people made it \nclear they wanted a stronger federal commitment to medical research.\n  Over a 5-year period, I helped lead a bipartisan effort to double \nNIH's budget. And it's paying off. Among other things, NIH research has \ndiscovered new triggers for childhood asthma, innovative new ways to \nprevent diabetes, treatments to reduce mother-to-child HIV/AIDS \ntransmission, new treatments for stroke, and dozens of other innovative \nmedical techniques. Thanks to NIH research, the miracle medicines of \ntomorrow have begun to arrive more quickly. NIH research has saved \nthousands of lives.\n  Our efforts to improve medicine have not stopped at America's shores. \nHealth care can as a currency of peace. It can provide hope. It can \ngive relief. And I'm proud of the way I have worked to improve it \naround the world.\n  I am particularly proud of the leadership role I played in the United \nStates Leadership Against Global HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria \nAct of 2003. These three deadly infectious diseases kill over a million \npeople each year in the underdeveloped world. These infectious diseases \ndo the most damage to the world's health. AIDS, the World Health \nOrganization reports, steals more years of healthy life than any other \ndisease. TB and Malaria--although usually not fatal--do enormous damage \nto health throughout the underdeveloped world and cost some of the \npoorest countries billions of dollars. It's vital that we attack them, \nfight them, and win. And we're making progress. Water has improved, \nreducing malaria. More and more people in the underdeveloped world are \ngetting anti-retrovirals to fight HIV/AIDS. Widespread education on the \nAbstain/Be Faithful/Use Condom ABC model has proven effective in \nlimiting the spread of AIDS. In my own missionary work In Africa-\ntrips--I've taken every couple years--I have seen what these diseases \ncan do--and the devastation that they can cause. The result: we've \nslowed the progress of these diseases, and we've saved millions of \nlives.\n  We still have much work ahead of us. Enormous numbers of Americans \nstill lack insurance. Through the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram SCHIP and HSAs we have made it easier for some Americans to get \nhealth insurance. But we haven't done enough. Over the next several \nyears, I hope Congress will work to change our health care system so \nall Americans have affordable, reliable health coverage.\n  But simply expanding insurance coverage isn't enough. We need to \nchange the way we think about health care so we focus on results and \nvalue for patients. Getting there isn't going to be easy. To do it, we \nneed national, interoperable, privacy protected electronic medical \nrecords for all Americans who want them. We need to rethink the way we \nstructure medical practices, and we need to do a better job monitoring \nquality.\n  We also need to reign in predatory trial lawyers who stand in the way \nof the doctor-patient relationship by encouraging doctors to care more \nabout avoiding liability and less about providing high quality medical \ncare. Medicare and Medicaid, too, need additional and sustained reforms \nto ensure our federal programs are in line with ever-changing \nrealities.\n  American health care still faces enormous problems. We have \ntremendous work ahead of us. I am proud to have played a role in the \nhealth care reforms of the past 12 years, and I will continue to speak, \nthink, and write about the vital importance of health care to our \nfuture as a nation. I entered this body as a physician and I will leave \nas one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11553-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11553-S11555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REASSIGNING THE HENRY CLAY DESK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 6\\1/2\\ years ago the Senate acted to \nensure that the desk of Henry Clay would forever stay in the family of \nKentucky Senators.\n  Henry Clay, the greatest statesman that my home State ever produced, \nserved the people as speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives, \nSpeaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Secretary of State under\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\nPresident John Quincy Adams, and of course as one of the greatest \nSenators to ever walk through the Capitol.\n  He was also honored to receive his party's nomination for President \nthree times, in 1824, 1832 and 1844.\n  The essence of legislating in the Senate, as 100 viewpoints are \nbrought together to create one law, is compromise. Henry Clay became \nknown as the Great Compromiser by forging the compromise that would \nkeep his precious Union together.\n  Clay did not compromise in the sense of forsaking his principles. \nRather, his skill was to bring together disparate ideas and forge a \nconsensus among his colleagues. That is a skill we could certainly use \nmore of now.\n  We recognize his dedication and service to our Nation by displaying \nhis portrait just off the Senate floor as one of history's most \noutstanding Senators.\n  In the 106th Congress, the Senate unanimously resolved that the \nSenate desk once used by Henry Clay would be assigned to the senior \nSenator from Kentucky, to maintain the Clay legacy.\n  Only two other desks are so honored. In the 94th Congress, the Senate \nassigned the desk of Daniel Webster to the senior Senator from New \nHampshire. And in the 104th Congress, the Senate assigned the desk of \nJefferson Davis to the senior Senator from Mississippi.\n  Since 1999 I have been honored to use the Clay desk, and would have \nbeen honored to do so for the remainder of my Senate career. However, \nin January I will begin service as the 15th Republican leader.\n  With the Republican leader's position comes the Republican leader's \ndesk--a desk equally steeped in tradition. First used by Republican \nLeader Charles McNary of Oregon in 1937, it has been passed to nearly \nevery Republican leader since.\n  Leaders such as Robert Taft, William Knowland, and Everett Dirksen \nhave sat behind it. So have leaders I have been fortunate to know and \nwork with, men like Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Trent Lott and, currently, \nBill Frist.\n  In fact, Senator Lott spoke on the floor on behalf of my resolution \nof 1999, and he also had some very kind words for me that I have not \nforgotten. I want to thank my good friend, the Senator from \nMississippi, for that kindness.\n  So I was faced with a decision, the same decision that faced Senator \nStyles Bridges of New Hampshire when he was elected Republican leader \nin 1952.\n  At that time, Senator Bridges was using the famed Daniel Webster \ndesk. Rather than give up that desk, he chose to have it moved to the \nfront row of the Chamber, and he became the only Republican leader \nsince Senator McNary to not use the Republican leader's desk. In fact, \nthe Congressional Directory lists the desk as unassigned during 1952.\n  I can understand Senator Bridges's decision to keep the Webster desk \nin the family of New Hampshire Senators.\n  And yet it would be a shame not to follow the custom set by the \nRepublican leaders I have just named, as well. So today, I come to the \nfloor to offer a resolution to keep both of these venerable traditions \nalive.\n  This resolution will amend the resolution of 1999 by adding that, if \nthe senior Senator from Kentucky is also a floor leader, then the Henry \nClay desk will go to the junior Senator from Kentucky. That way, we can \nensure the Bluegrass State will maintain its link to a tradition \nsymbolized by this mahogany desk.\n  I am sure my colleague and friend Senator Bunning will honor and keep \nthe legacy of the Henry Clay desk--a legacy I have been proud to help \ncontinue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of every \nRepublican leader to have used the Republican leader's desk be printed \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nList of Senate Republican Leaders Who Have Used the Republican Leader's \n                                  Desk\n\n       The first Senate Republican Leader to use the Leader's desk \n     was Senator Charles L. McNary of Oregon, who began serving as \n     Leader in 1933 and began using the Leader's desk in 1937. \n     Since 1937, 11 Republican Leaders have been assigned the \n     desk:\n\n     Charles L. McNary (Oregon), 1937-1944\n     Wallace H. White Jr. (Maine), 1945-1949\n     Kenneth S. Wherry (Nebraska), 1949-1951\n       (Note: Sen. Wherry died on November 29, 1951. During 1952 \n     the Congressional Directory lists the Republican Leader's \n     desk as unassigned.)\n     Robert A. Taft (Ohio), 1953\n     William F. Knowland (California), 1953-1959\n     Everett M. Dirksen (Illinois), 1959-1969\n     Hugh D. Scott Jr. (Pennsylvania), 1969-1977\n     Howard H. Baker Jr. (Tennessee), 1977-1985\n     Robert J. Dole (Kansas), 1985-1996\n     Trent Lott (Mississippi), 1996-2003\n     William H. Frist (Tennessee), 2003-2007\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 630 which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 630) allowing the senior Senator from \n     Kentucky to reassign the Henry Clay desk when serving as \n     party leader.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 630) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 630\n\n       Resolved, That S. Res. 89 (106th Congress) is amended by--\n       (1) inserting ``(a)'' after ``That''; and\n       (2) adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) If, in any Congress, the senior Senator from the \n     State of Kentucky is serving as party leader, the desk \n     referred to in subsection (a) may be assigned to the junior \n     Senator from Kentucky upon the request of the senior \n     Senator.''.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have passed the baton, if you will, \nof the Henry Clay desk to my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, \nwho is also here.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to hearing his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, first, I thank my senior colleague--not \nsenior colleague but senior Senator from Kentucky for this wonderful \ngesture.\n  Every young student in Kentucky knows the legend of Henry Clay. My \nwife Mary and our children all learned about Henry Clay in Kentucky \nschools. Many of my grandchildren in Kentucky have also heard the \nstories of Henry Clay's time spent as a member of the Kentucky House of \nRepresentatives where he became speaker, Speaker of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Secretary of State in the United States, and U.S. \nSenator.\n  Henry Clay served the people of Kentucky for nearly one-half a \ncentury. He also is called and should be called one of the greatest \nSenators in the history of the Senate for the compromises he brokered \nduring the divisive war years before the Civil War.\n  Henry Clay's legends remains with all Kentuckians today. His home in \nLexington is a revered site in Kentucky. A statue and portrait of Henry \nClay stands just off the Senate floor, and the desk of Henry Clay used \nwhen he served in this great body remains with us today, as well. As my \ncolleague Senator McConnell said, he has used that desk since it was \nassigned to the senior Senator from Kentucky.\n  Senator McConnell is a student of Kentucky history and a student also \nof the history of the Senate. Like Henry Clay, Senator McConnell has \nbecome a respected leader in this Senate. Now with Senator McConnell's \nnew role as the Republican leader in the 110th Congress comes a new \ndesk and with it, its own special history. He has been gracious to \nintroduce and pass a resolution to allow Henry Clay's desk to remain \nforever in the family of Kentucky Senators.\n  As the junior Senator from Kentucky, it would be an honor to serve in \nthis Senate with the same desk that Henry Clay once called his own. It \nis with deep gratitude and thanks to my senior Senator from Kentucky \nfor his work on this resolution that I have cosponsored, and I hope my \ncolleagues are as excited as I am about what has just happened, the \nfact that my time in the Senate will at least be spent, partially, at \nthe desk of Henry Clay, the great compromiser from Kentucky.\n  I thank my senior Senator for all the work he has done in his entire \nSenate career and particularly today on passing Henry Clay's desk on to \nthe junior Senator.\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11555-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALEC GIFFORD\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I pay tribute this morning to a great \nAmerican journalist from New Orleans, LA. Alec Gifford will be formally \nretiring from WDSU in New Orleans this December after an \nextraordinarily lengthy, fulfilling, and energetic career covering \npolitics and a whole range of issues over decades, including \nhurricanes, storms and other disasters. He even hosted, believe it or \nnot, a cooking show.\n  Alec came from a family of journalists. His father covered Governor \nHuey Long for the Times-Picayune, and his grandfather published one of \nthe first local French language newspapers. So his family tradition has \ndeep roots in Louisiana and in New Orleans. After serving in the U.S. \nNavy, Alec came to WDSU in 1955. He introduced the people of Louisiana \nto a very young Senator at the time, John F. Kennedy, as he sought to \nbecome--and ultimately did--the President of the United States. Just as \nwe have spent many hours on this floor in recent months and years \ndiscussing the share of royalties that Louisiana should get from energy \nproduction off of our coast--and I believed I was the first on the \nstory--I was corrected by my staff that Alec Gifford was one of the \nfirst on the story four decades ago.\n\n  He asked Senator Kennedy his position on how these royalties would be \nhandled when he came in to campaign for the Presidency back then. And \nhe also pressed him on the Nation's path toward an equal education for \nall of our children during that extraordinary historic interview.\n  Louisiana later gave all of its electoral votes to Senator Kennedy, \nwho became our 35th President. We then, of course, passed major \nlegislation for equal opportunity, and today or tomorrow we will be \npassing a historic piece of legislation on royalty sharing after all \nthese many years.\n  Alec was a journalist who always knew the important stories and \nmanaged to explain them to the people at home in a way they could grasp \nand understand the impact on their daily, everyday lives, and their \nfuture.\n  But Alec really made a name for himself in 1965, demonstrating his \ndedication to the story when Hurricane Betsy struck Louisiana. While \nevery other station had lost their ability to broadcast back in 1965--\nthe city and region were basically dark and shut down, and the winds \nwere howling, and the waters were almost as high as during Katrina--\nAlec stood in the path of the hurricane and brought images of the storm \ninto every home that could receive a television signal.\n  Forty years later, he was there again for us with Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita. He evacuated himself to Jackson, MS, but stayed on the story, \nas many brave journalists did. But Alec has been doing this for so \nlong. His accomplishments throughout this were singular. Working his \nway--scratching, crawling his way--back to New Orleans, like many of \nour journalists did, he continued to stay on the story.\n  The hurricanes could not stop him. The flooding could not stop him. \nAnd in a few simple sentences, Alec Gifford illustrated the magnitude \nof the impact that Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have had on Louisiana, \nwhen he said:\n\n       This is nothing like Betsy. . . . Betsy was a horrible \n     storm. Betsy was a walk in the park. I cannot believe how \n     Katrina and Rita have turned our world upside down and \n     backward. Isn't it amazing how everything changes?\n\n  But Alec has not changed at all over these decades. He has stayed \nresolute, committed to his craft, energetic, and absolutely consistent \nin his work ethic. He is almost 80 years young, and he has never slowed \ndown. His colleague, Travers Mackel, can attest to that. He said:\n\n       I'm 31 years old, and I have a tough time keeping up with \n     him. He's the first one in to work [in the morning] and the \n     last one out the door.\n\n  His news director, Anzio Williams, said: ``I don't ever want to hear \nanybody complain,'' he says to his staff, ``about being overworked and \noverstressed. This guy, [referring to Alec], outworks everybody.''\n  But after a half a century on the air, at WDSU, WVUE, and for NBC \nNews, Alec has decided to retire. He has certainly left his mark on the \nnews in New Orleans, hiring the next generation of WDSU in anchor Norm \nRobinson and reporter Richard Angelico--who both have done an \noutstanding job for our community--but he will now be able to spend \nmore time with the people he cares about most, his wife Delores, his \nfive children, and his eight grandchildren.\n  He is truly part of the soul of our city, and a shining example of \nthe best in his craft--a reporter to the core, a man willing to stay on \nthe job, no matter what, to tell the story, to tell it right, to tell \nit clearly. Alec Gifford may be leaving the studio, but he is not \nleaving our hearts and our memories. I for one would not be surprised \nto see him on television again. I am sure he will come back in a \ndifferent capacity, in a different way, but this Senator would like to \nsay how much I have personally appreciated his service to our community \nand wanted to pay tribute to Alec Gifford today on the eve of his \nretirement from WDSU.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11555-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11555-S11556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have a few more minutes before the \n10:30 vote, and I take this time to say a few words about some of my \ncolleagues who are retiring. We had a good bit of time yesterday \ndevoted to their tremendous contributions, and as each of us, the 100 \nof us, do know each other pretty well, I have come to the floor to say \na few things about several of the colleagues I have had the distinct \npleasure of working with very closely.\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  Mr. President, one is, of course, Senator Bill Frist, our retiring \nmajority leader. I had the wonderful opportunity to be invited to \ntravel with Senator Frist. I guess you could say it was clearly an \nopportunity. It was not necessarily a pleasurable trip in the sense \nthat the first trip I took with him was to tour the devastation of the \ntsunami. Soon after he assumed the role of leader, the tsunami hit the \nIndian coastline. It was one of the largest disasters in the recent \nhistory of the world.\n  I had a chance to go to that region with Senator Frist. I actually \nsaw him firsthand don his doctor's coat and take off, if you will, his \nhat as Senator and put on his coat as doctor and operate. I agreed to \ngo on that trip with him under one condition, that I myself would not \nhave to go with him into the operating rooms. So I stayed outside and \ntalked with people while he went in and actually did the hard work of \nsaving people's lives and bringing them back to health.\n  But what I will most remember about that trip--and there were about \nsix of us on it--is that he was the first one awake in the morning, the \nlast one to go to bed at night, constantly working until the point \nwhere those of us said we are unlikely to ever travel with him again \nbecause we could not get any rest through the entire week and were so \nexhausted when we got back. We said: If he calls again to ask us to \ntravel, tell him I am doing something else. I am kidding, of course. \nBut I say that with the greatest admiration for a man who has an \nextraordinary work ethic. And through so many ups and downs, literally, \nof these helicopters and trips, I remember him staying so steady and so \ncalm, even when we saw some of the most horrific sights you can \nimagine.\n\n  But he has led this Chamber and brought his own style of leadership \nand his own gifts that God has given him to this Chamber. I am a \nSenator who truly admires that particular aspect of his service and \nwanted to put that into the Record in a small way this morning.\n\n\n                              Jim Jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to remember for a minute the good work of \nSenator Jeffords. Senator Jeffords tends to be one of the quiet Members \nof the Senate. Some of us talk a lot more than others. He does not do \nmuch talking, but he sure gets a lot done. I will never forget, and the \npeople of Louisiana are so grateful to Senator Jeffords, as he chaired \nthe EPW Committee, for being one of the first Senators in this Chamber \nto recognize the extraordinary loss of our wetlands and what it would \nmean to south Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. And ultimately, of \ncourse, we saw the tragedy\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\nunfold before our eyes. Had we listened to Senator Jeffords, and the \nother few voices who were calling out years ago, perhaps some of that \nloss of life and billions of dollars of loss of property could have \nbeen averted.\n  Senator Jeffords came down to Louisiana on several occasions. One I \nwill never forget is standing with him in this very southern part of \nthe State in Lafourche Parish, literally almost into the gulf waters, \nwe were so far down south. I was explaining to him--and this is far out \nfrom New Orleans. You have to try a little hard to get there. You fly \ninto the big airport, and then you have to go by either bus or \nhelicopter, and it is difficult. And, of course, Senator Jeffords' \nhealth has not been great lately. But he was a real trooper, and he \nsaid: No, Mary. I want to go, and I want to see it.\n  So we flew him way down to the wetlands, and he and I were standing \nthere, and I was explaining to him how his work in the Senate was \naffecting the lives of my constituents down in the bayou and was \nsaying: Senator, almost once a week or so some fishing vessel or shrimp \ntrawler runs into this bridge. And when the bridge shuts down, we \nliterally not only keep schoolchildren from getting to school and \nparents from getting to their children, but we literally shut down the \nwhole offshore oil and gas industry or a big part of it, because when a \nbridge shuts down, none of the trucks can move, no supplies can get out \nto the rigs. Don't you think this country, which spends trillions of \ndollars every year, can spend a few million dollars to fix this bridge?\n  The words had not gotten out of my mouth when a shrimp trawler hit \nthe bridge, and the bridge moved slightly. The big wings of the shrimp \ntrawler collapsed, and Senator Jeffords looked at me and said: Now, \nMary, you have gotten way too dramatic on this point. You did not have \nto set that stage for that boat to hit that bridge. He said: I get the \nmessage. So we, of course, had a laugh about that.\n  But his sense of humor, his commitment, and his passion for the \nenvironment and the people who live on the land, the people who live in \nthis natural environment, is what has always made me a real fan of his. \nI want him to know I am going to miss him and his staff who have also \nbeen extremely kind to me and my staff in the Senate.\n\n\n                              Mike De Wine\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about Senator DeWine, my distinguished \ncolleague from Ohio, and a good friend, and a man whom I have worked \nvery closely with in our capacity as appropriators. Also, we share a \npassion for the child welfare system in this Nation, trying to improve \nit--of course, promoting adoption, the notion that there is no such \nthing as unwanted children, just unfound families.\n  I could not but come to the floor and say that Mike DeWine is \nliterally one of the most compassionate men I have ever known. That \ncompassion is obvious to anyone who works closely with him day in and \nday out. It is not fake. It is very real. And the spiritual depths of \nwhich he and his wife Fran and their children live their faith--not \njust talk about it, not just use it as a shield to protect them, but as \na way to serve others--is quite extraordinary.\n  This Senator has seen that in him and his work, side by side with \nhim. I want my other colleagues to know that if it were not for Senator \nMike DeWine, the District of Columbia would not have their family \ncourt, the country would not have the stable families legislation he \nand Senator Rockefeller pushed through this Chamber at a time when not \nthat many people understood the consequence of a foster care system in \ndisrepair and what happens to children when they get stuck in a system \nthat does not appreciate their dignity or respect their right to a \nfamily.\n  Senator DeWine, a family man himself, most certainly understands that \nand pushed that legislation through, and dozens of other pieces of \nlegislation that I had the privilege to help him with, and to assist \nhim with, and to watch him lead on. So I am certainly going to miss his \nleadership. But I will commit to him my focus on Haiti. I will never be \nable to fill the shoes he has laid out with the work he has done, but \nseveral of us intend to continue his work with Haiti, the poorest \nnation on the Earth, and continue his great passion, as much as we can, \nin our time here in the Senate.\n\n\n                             lincoln chafee\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island has been an \nindependent voice for his State and the issues he believes in, \nregardless of partisan consideration. He will be missed by all of us.\n\n\n                              conrad burns\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Conrad Burns has represented his State of \nMontana for three terms. He has been a stalwart on behalf of his \nconstituents and his philosophy of government. We thank him for his \npublic service.\n\n\n                              george allen\n\n  Mr. President, finally, I want to recognize the Senator from \nVirginia, George Allen, for his service as Senator and as Governor of \nhis State. We have worked together on a range of issues on the Energy \nand Small Business Committees as well as on the historic antilynching \nbill.\n  To all of our retiring Members, I say thank you. Thank you for your \nefforts on behalf of my State when you were needed and thank you for \nyour service to America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In 2002, he was nominated and \n     confirmed as a District Judge for the District of Delaware.\n       Judge Jordan is also a scholar who teaches as an adjunct \n     professor at three law schools: the University of \n     Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt University, and Widener University. \n     Judge Jordan has spoken and published articles on \n     intellectual property, civil procedure, advocacy, and \n     professional responsibility. He has also contributed chapters \n     to several legal titles, including two manuals used in the \n     Third Circuit: Federal Appellate Procedure and Federal Civil \n     Procedure Before Trial.\n       Judge Jordan has received a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \n     rating from the American Bar Association. He enjoys the \n     strong support of both Delaware Senators.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the 30 seconds remaining, I urge my \ncolleagues to proceed to vote on the nomination of Judge Jordan and \nalso on the pending nominations of some 13 district court judges, all \nof whom have been reported out favorably by the Judiciary Committee. \nRegrettably, the Senate does not focus as much attention on these \njudgeships as I think it should. The distinguished Presiding Officer \nhas a judge on the docket from the State of Georgia. And with the \nenormous business pressures we have--on Iraq and on taxes and on \nappropriations--there is too little attention on judges. When a judge \nis not present on the Third Circuit, and currently there are four \nvacancies on that circuit, they have a judicial emergency situation. \nTheir docket is clogged and people have to wait a long time to have \ntheir cases heard.\n  Similarly, if there is not a judge sitting in Georgia or in Ohio, \nwhere Senator DeWine and Senator Voinovich want a nominee confirmed, \npeople are prejudiced and disadvantaged. And from the Western District \nof Michigan, a Congressman was over yesterday, urging Senators to move \nahead on the three pending nominations in that district. I ask that \nevery step be taken at every level of the Senate to confirm these \njudges.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11557-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Will the Senator \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Without losing my right to the floor, yes.\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if the Senator will allow us to set up a \nsequence of speakers after the Senator speaks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will do anything to accommodate my neighbor from New \nHampshire, as he knows.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nstatement of the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from North Dakota be \nrecognized for 5 minutes and then that I be recognized for 15 minutes. \nDoes the Senator from Ohio seek recognition, also?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I do, but not on this topic.\n  Mr. GREGG. It doesn't matter. Then the Senator from Ohio be \nrecognized after I complete my remarks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator would amend that to add the \nSenator from Delaware. The judge is from Delaware. I ask that Senator \nCarper be recognized for up to 10 minutes following that.\n  Mr. GREGG. At the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Following the Senator from Vermont, the \nSenator from North Dakota be recognized for 5 minutes, then the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for 15 minutes, then the Senator from Ohio for 15 \nminutes, and the Senator from Delaware for 10 minutes. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate finally has an \nopportunity to consider the nomination of Kent Jordan of Delaware for a \nlifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit. Judge Jordan is a well-qualified nominee with the support of \nboth home State Democratic Senators, as well as that of the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, whose State is within the Third Circuit. I \nsupport this nomination, and I will vote to confirm him.\n  I regret that the Republican leadership chose to eschew bipartisan \ndiscussion of nominations and unilaterally filed an unnecessary cloture \nvote on Judge Jordan's nomination, especially after we worked so hard \nto expedite it in September. We could very easily have voted on this in \nSeptember instead of having this folderol of urgency now. Most of us \nwanted to vote on this weeks ago, and I am not sure what political last \ngasp is involved in saying we have to have cloture. That was never \nnecessary.\n  I wish, instead, the leadership had followed the customary practice \nin the Senate of the Republican and Democratic leaders to have sat down \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and \nworked out a process to conclude the consideration of judicial \nnominations for this session. Had they done so, we could have \ncapitalized on the hard work done by the chairman and the Judiciary \nDemocrats to report consensus nominations. Instead--and I mention this \nto those from States such as Georgia and elsewhere--this is the only \njudicial nomination the Republican leadership has scheduled for \nconsideration in months.\n  I mention this for my colleagues who might be from States that have \nsome of these judicial nominees--apparently those from those States do \nnot particularly care. I mention it in case anybody is reading the \nRecord later on. I was going to suggest a way to get some of them, but \nthere does not seem to be an interest in it, so I will not.\n  What they have left unexplained is why they refuse to go forward with \nthe President's nomination of Judge Janet Neff from Michigan. The \nFederal court serving the Western District of Michigan has three \nFederal trial court vacancies that are judicial emergency vacancies \nthree in one district. The Senators from Michigan have worked with the \nWhite House on the President's nomination of three nominees to fill \nthese emergency vacancies. The Judiciary Committee has proceeded \nunanimously on all three.\n  Working with Chairman Specter, the Democratic members of the \ncommittee cooperated to expedite their consideration.\n  On September 16 we held a confirmation hearing for those three \nnominees on an expedited basis. Regrettably, the President waited until \nJuly to make these nominations. Had he acted sooner, as some of us \nsuggested earlier this year, we would not be in this situation. From \nthe beginning I have urged the President to work with us on consensus \nnominations, and I have worked hard to proceed. I continue to do so \neven at this late date in the session, in spite of the pocket \nfilibusters employed by Republicans to stall and block more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's qualified judicial nominees.\n  Democrats cooperated to expedite consideration of a number of matters \nand reported the three judicial nominees to fill the emergency \nvacancies in the Western District of Michigan on September 29. \nRegrettably the White House, Republican leadership, and objections by \nRepublican Senators continued to undermine this process. Instead of \nfocusing on consensus nominees, the President sent back to the Senate \nin September and, again, following the November election, highly \ncontroversial nominees who had been returned to the White House in the \nhope that the President would work with us on a bipartisan basis.\n  We have been accommodating, and we will continue to be. I urge all \nDemocrats to vote for confirmation of Judge Jordan, as I will. But \nneither the Judiciary Committee nor the Senate should be a rubberstamp \nfor this President or any President. We should be taking our \nconstitutional responsibility to advise and consent seriously. These \nare the only lifetime appointments in the Federal Government, and they \nwill have an enormous impact on the lives, the rights, and future of \nAmericans.\n  We were accommodating when Judge Jordan was pending before the \nJudiciary Committee. I knew this nomination was from Chairman Specter's \ncircuit, and I cooperated with his request for a special executive \nbusiness meeting. We came to the meeting and made sure we had a quorum, \neven though the meeting was out of the normal course.\n  The chairman said that the meeting would be held to expedite \nconsideration of noncontroversial nominees. I agreed to let the \nmajority meet to hold over the nomination of Judge Jordan in order to \nexpedite its consideration at our next meeting. In order to be more \naccommodating, I went further and continued to meet so that nominees of \ninterest to Senator Grassley and Senator DeWine could be moved forward \nin the process as well.\n  The Democratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee and our staffs \nworked especially hard as time ran down in this Congress to be \naccommodating on judicial nominations. The chairman held four \nnomination hearings in September. Three of these hearings were for four \nnominees, an extraordinary number in one hearing, and the fourth was an \nunprecedented hearing for two nominees who had received ``not \nqualified'' ratings from the American Bar Association. This was a \nfaster pace than is traditional for the committee so late in the \nsession, particularly in an election year. It was a much faster pace \nthan is ideal for careful consideration of lifetime appointments to the \nNation's courts. But we nonetheless cleared nominees at this pace to be \naccommodating and to keep the nominations moving forward.\n  Sadly, rather than meet to work out a process to conclude the \nconsideration of judicial nominations for this session, the Republican \nleadership has apparently made the unilateral decision to stall certain \nof these nominations, including those for the judicial emergencies in \nthe Western District of Michigan, and particularly the President's \nnomination of Judge Janet Neff.\n  This fall, an editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch entitled ``No \nVacancies,'' highlighted the administration's counterproductive \napproach to judicial nominations. The editorial criticized the \nadministration before the November elections and before the President \nrenominated those controversial choices, for failing to turn vacancies \ninto judges and instead pursuing political fights. According to the \nRichmond Times-Dispatch:\n\n       The president erred by renominating . . . [Haynes] and may \n     be squandering his opportunity to fill numerous other \n     vacancies with judges of right reason.\n\n  The Richmond Times-Dispatch focused on the renomination of William \nJames Haynes II to the Fourth Circuit. Of course Mr. Haynes has yet to \nfulfill the pledge he made to me under oath\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\n at his hearing to supply the materials he discussed in his opening \nstatement regarding his role in developing the legal justifications and \npolicies having to do with torture, detention and other matters.\n  The Richmond Times-Dispatch editorial could just as easily have been \nwritten about Judge Terrence Boyle, whom the President also renominated \nagain to a seat on the Fourth Circuit. He did so despite the fact that \nas a sitting U.S. district judge and while a circuit court nominee, the \nPresident's nominee, Judge Boyle, ruled on multiple cases involving \ncorporations in which he held investments. The President should have \nheeded the call of the North Carolina Police Benevolent Association or \nthe North Carolina Troopers Association or the Police Benevolent \nAssociations themselves from South Carolina and Virginia or the \nNational Association of Police Organizations or the Professional \nFirefighters and Paramedics of North Carolina, as well as the advice of \nour former colleague, Senator John Edwards, to withdraw this ill-\nadvised nomination and not renominate him. Law enforcement officers \nfrom North Carolina and across the country oppose the nomination. Civil \nrights groups oppose the nomination. Those knowledgeable and respectful \nof judicial ethics oppose this nomination. This nomination has been \npending on the floor calendar in a Republican-controlled Senate for \nmore than a year after being forced out of the committee on a solid \nparty-line vote. The Senate actually did the President a favor by \nreturning this nomination to the White House before the summer recess \nand again before the election. Republican Senators tell me they don't \nwant to vote on this nomination, but the White House keeps sending it \nback up.\n  The President also squandered an opportunity to fill Idaho's vacancy \nin the Ninth Circuit by renominating William Gerry Myers III for that \nseat again in September and again after the November elections. This is \nanother administration insider and lobbyist whose record has raised \nvery serious questions about his ability to be a fair and impartial \njudge. I opposed this nomination when it was before the Judiciary \nCommittee in March 2005. Actually, this was a nomination which the so-\ncalled Gang of 14 expressly listed as someone for whom they made no \ncommitment to vote for cloture, and with good reason.\n  Mr. Myers' record as Solicitor General for the Department of the \nInterior suggests that he was part of a culture of corruption \ndocumented in the testimony of the Interior Department's inspector \ngeneral, Earl Devaney, at a hearing of the House Government Reform \nSubcommittee on Energy. Listen to what the Inspector General in the \nBush administration says about this Bush nominee. Mr. Devaney testified \nabout a ``culture of managerial irresponsibility and lack of \naccountability'' at the upper levels of the Interior Department in \nwhich, ``[s]imply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the \nhighest levels of the Department of the Interior.'' He also testified, \n``I have observed one instance after another when the good work of my \noffice has been disregarded by the Department. Ethics failures on the \npart of senior Department officials--taking the form of the appearances \nof impropriety, favoritism and bias--have been routinely dismissed with \na promise `not to do it again.''' Apparently, reading this record, it \nwas done again and again.\n  While Mr. Myers' anti-environmental record is reason enough to oppose \nhis confirmation, his connection to the ``culture of managerial \nirresponsibility and lack of accountability'' raises further concerns. \nBut these are the kinds of judges who keep getting sent back to the \nWhite House when even a Republican-controlled Senate won't bring them \nup for a vote. You would think somebody at the White House would be \nlistening when they say: We are trying to send you a signal. Don't keep \nsending them back.\n  In particular, questions remain about his role in authorizing a \nlawyer who worked for him, Bob Comer, to arrange a sweetheart \nsettlement agreement for a politically well-connected rancher, Frank \nRobbins. Mr. Comer was found, in an investigation by the Department of \nthe Interior's inspector general, to have been responsible for \narranging the deal. Documents have come to light recently showing that \nMr. Myers had been given materials about the deal, which certainly \nundermine his assertions made under oath that he was merely misled by \nMr. Comer. If anyone sought to proceed to this nomination, then we \nwould want to know a lot more about these new documents, and we would \nneed to explore any connections to the lobbying scandals associated \nwith the Interior Department and Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff. \nRecent reports in the Denver Post raise additional questions about the \nthoroughness of what Mr. Myers told us since the report that Mr. Myers \nand Mr. Abramoff attended at least one party together has gone \nunrefuted and unexplained.\n  So it is particularly troubling to see Mr. Myers be nominated because \nthe President squandered yet another opportunity to fill a vacancy. I \nhad suggested he renominate Norman Randy Smith, a Republican nominee, \nfor the vacancy created by the retirement of Judge Thomas Nelson from \nIdaho. Instead, the President has again nominated Judge Smith, but not \nto this seat. He has nominated him to a California seat of the Ninth \nCircuit, effectively stealing California's seat. That is wrong. I \nsupport the California Senators in their opposition to this. I had \nurged President Bush to resolve this impasse and turn Idaho's vacancy \ninto a judge by withdrawing the controversial and tainted Myers \nnomination--tainted Myers nomination--and instead nominate Judge Smith \nfor the Idaho vacancy to which he could be easily confirmed. \nAlternatively, he could have renominated them both but merely switched \nthe vacancies for which they were nominated, thereby allowing the Smith \nnomination an opportunity to proceed.\n  In addition, the President has renominated, again, Michael Wallace to \nthe vacant seat on the Fifth Circuit even though he received the first \nABA rating of unanimously ``not qualified'' that I have seen for a \ncircuit court nominee in a quarter of a century, from Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. That in itself should have been enough of \nan embarrassment not to send the name back, especially when a \nRepublican-controlled Senate did not bring it forth. Committee \nproceedings on this nomination detailed the significant concern raised \nby numerous jurists around the country regarding Mr. Wallace's judicial \ntemperament, his lack of commitment to equal justice to the poor and \nminorities, his lack of tolerance, and his closemindedness. It detailed \nconcerns from judges and lawyers that Mr. Wallace may not follow the \nlaw and is driven by his ``personal agenda.''\n  Of course, the troubling issues raised in the ABA's testimony echo \nsignificant concerns about Mr. Wallace's record on civil rights, his \nopposition to the Voting Rights Act, his support for tax exemptions for \nBob Jones University, his opposition to prison safety regulations, and \nhis attempt, as President Reagan's director of the board of the Legal \nServices Corporation, to undermine efforts to provide legal services to \nlow-income clients. Don't they understand that even a rubberstamp \nRepublican Senate which has gone along with just about everything this \nBush administration has done had something in mind when they sent this \nnomination back to the White House? Instead, the White House sent it \nback.\n  Months ago--months--ago before the last recess, I was urging Senate \naction on nominees such as the Michigan District Court nominees and \nJudge Jordan, whom we have before us now. What little progress we might \nhave made has been undone by some on the Republican side. I have been \nhere 32 years. I have never seen anything with either Republican \nleadership or Democratic leadership with a judge like this who could \nhave been easily passed--Democrats and Republicans supported him--\nmonths ago, and here we are stalled because nobody can figure out what \nto do the last few days of a session. Suddenly, it is like, My God, we \nhave to have a cloture vote on him. We could have had 30 hours of \ndebate afterwards, which I said let's not do, and we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement that we would not. But to have gotten to a cloture \nvote on somebody who would have passed on a bed check vote months ago--\nwell, if this is theater, it is theater of the absurd. If this is \ntheater, it would close after opening night on Broadway or anywhere \nelse.\n\n[[Page S11560]]\n\n  This goes beyond a farce. And it is particularly ironic that after \nmonths of Republicans repeating a new mantra that every one of the \nPresident's nominees, whether qualified or not, whether engaged in \nconflicts of interest or not, whether found by their own peers to be \nnot qualified or not, whether they are supported by home State senators \nor not, is entitled to a swift up-or-down vote, after we heard this \nover and over--guess what--it was Republican objections that stalled \nmore than a dozen judicial nominees.\n  After the last working session in October, I learned that several \nRepublicans were objecting to Senate votes on some of President Bush's \nown judicial nominees. This is theater of the absurd. You had \nRepublicans on the campaign trail saying: Oh, my, God, those Democrats \nare holding up President Bush's poor nominees for these highly paid \nlifetime appointments. They are holding them up. And guess what \nhappened. All these nominees of President Bush, we said: Fine, let's \njust pass them. We were told: Oh, can't do it. Can't do it because we \nhave Republicans who put holds on them. Talk about having it both ways. \nRepublicans hold up the judges so they can go on the campaign trail and \nsay: Oh these terrible Democrats. They are holding up our judges. Oh, \nmy heart cries for them.\n  In fact, according to press accounts, Senator Brownback had placed a \nhold on Judge Neff's nomination even though he raised no objection to \nthe nomination when she was unanimously reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Later, without going through the committee, Senator \nBrownback sent questions to Judge Neff about her attendance at a \ncommitment ceremony held by some family friends several years ago in \nMassachusetts. Senator Brownback spoke of these matters and his \nconcerns on one of the Sunday morning talk shows.\n  So where is the consultation about this with the leaders of the \ncommittee? Where is the cooperation? Where is the working together? \nWhere is the attempt to be uniters and not dividers? Where is the \nwonderful statement by the President, after he got shellacked in the \nlast election, saying: We are going to work together. Where is the \nexplanation why the Republican leadership has chosen not to proceed \nwith the Neff nomination to a judicial emergency vacancy? Can it really \nbe that her attendance at a commitment ceremony of a family friend \nfailed some Republican litmus test of ideological purity, that her \nlifetime of achievement and qualifications are to be ignored and that \nher nomination is to be pocket-filibustered by Republicans like the 60 \nthey pocket-filibustered of President Clinton's? Oh, goodness gracious.\n  The Republican approach to nominations, of using nominations to score \npolitical points rather than filling vacancies and administering \njustice, has led to a dire situation in the Western District of \nMichigan. Judge Robert Holmes Bell, Chief Judge of the Western \nDistrict, wrote to me and to others about the situation in that \ndistrict where several judges on senior status--one is over 90 years \nold--continue to carry heavy caseloads to ensure justice is \nadministered in that district. In fact, Judge Bell is the only active \njudge. If it had not been for Republicans blocking President Bush's \nnominations, those vacancies would be filled.\n\n  Of course, this is not the first time Republicans objected to an up-\nor-down vote on judicial nominees. They objected and stopped up-or-down \nvotes on more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. Last \nyear, the President's nomination of Harriet Miers to a vacancy on the \nSupreme Court was stalled and withdrawn, not because a single Democrat \nin this body objected but because Republicans objected. Republicans \nquestioned her qualifications, demanded answers about her work in the \nWhite House and her legal philosophy and, although Democrats said go \nahead and give her a hearing, they then defeated her nomination without \nallowing a hearing.\n  With regard to judicial nominations, I do want to acknowledge the \nkind words of the majority leader, who noted before the October recess \nthat we made ``tremendous progress'' in confirming qualified judicial \nnominees. By Senator Frist's count, the Senate ``has confirmed 88 \npercent of President Bush's judicial nominees, giving him the highest \nconfirmation rate since President Reagan.'' He calculates that ``95 \npercent of all judgeships are filled, including more than 92 percent of \nall circuit court judgeships and more than 95 percent of all district \ncourt judgeships.'' He notes that the Senate has confirmed ``[n]early \n160 nominees'' for judgeships under the 46 months of his leadership--\n160 in just 46 months. He leaves out the fact that 100 of the \nPresident's judicial nominees were confirmed during 17 months when the \nDemocrats were in charge. Senator Daschle was leader, I was chairman of \nthe committee, and ironically--I guess it is something that got \noverlooked because it doesn't fit in the campaign slogans--President \nBush's judges moved much faster under Democratic leadership than they \nhave under Republican leadership.\n  Likewise, Chairman Specter acknowledged before the recess that \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee in the Senate have been extremely \naccommodating. I hope he doesn't get in trouble for that because his \nstatements sharply diverged from the vitriolic attack the Republican \nNational Committee made on me, personally. It went way beyond campaign \nrhetoric to flatout lies.\n  This year we have confirmed 31 judicial nominees so far. That far \nsurpasses the total number of judges confirmed in the 1996 \nCongressional session, when Republicans controlled the Senate and \npocket filibustered President Clinton's nominees. In that session, \nRepublicans would not confirm a single appellate court judge--not one--\nand moved forward on only 17 district court judges all session. That \nwas the only session of the Senate I can remember, in my 32 years, in \nwhich the Senate simply refused to consider appellate court \nnominations. That was part of their pocket filibuster strategy to stall \nand maintain vacancies so that a Republican President could pack the \ncourts and tilt them decidedly to the right. In confirming eight \ncircuit court judges so far this year, we have already confirmed more \ncircuit judges than in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000.\n  We could have accomplished a lot more this year if the White House \nhad sent over consensus nominations earlier in the year. Regrettably \nthe administration concentrated on a few highly controversial nominees \nand delayed until recently sending other nominations and thereby \nprevented us from having the time to do any meaningful review. As I \nsaid before, we could have done the Jordan nomination before us now \nback in September instead of having this high drama.\n  If I were at all cynical--and we Vermonters are not, by nature--I \nwould almost think this vote had been set up to distract the people \nfrom the fact that the Senate and House leadership have failed to \nfigure out a way to get us out of this morass, after they failed to \nfollow the law and pass a budget this year. They broke the law, didn't \nfollow it, to pass a budget this year, even though they control both \nbodies of the Congress. Then they failed to pass our appropriations \nbills by the end of September, even though they are required to do so. \nCould it be that this nomination, this high drama of something that is \ngoing to pass unanimously, was brought up so maybe the press would be \nfooled into thinking that this was so important it might distract them \nfrom the fiasco from the fiscal train wreck they have got us into?\n  Even though this Republican controlled Congress has sent back a few \nof the most controversial nominations, the administration keeps sending \nthem back. By contrast, there are six judicial emergencies still that \nhave no nominee at all. Nor has President Bush fulfilled his solemn \npledge to make a nomination for every vacancy within 180 days. Of the \nvacancies currently without a nominee, seven have been vacant for more \nthan 180 days. An additional 14 of the pending nominees were nominated \nonly after their vacancies had occurred for more than 180 days.\n  I want to note, again, so nobody will think that we even had to be \ntaking the time here now: I support the confirmation of Judge Jordan. I \nhelped expedite his consideration by the committee so we could vote on \nhim nearly 3 months ago, in September. But we didn't in September. Of \ncourse, we didn't in October. We didn't in November. Here we are in \nDecember. But even\n\n[[Page S11561]]\n\nwith his confirmation, only 32 judicial nominees will have been \nconfirmed in the last 12 months. Contrast that to the 17 months when \nDemocrats were in charge of this body and I was chairman when we \nconfirmed 100 judges. In the last two years of Republican control, with \na Republican President and Republican Senate, we confirmed half of \nthat, just 53 nominees. Think how much higher it could have been with \nsome cooperation.\n  We have been accommodating, and we will continue to be, as we vote \nfor confirmation of Judge Jordan today. But neither the Judiciary \nCommittee nor the Senate should be a rubberstamp for the President. In \ncase anybody is wondering, the Senate Judiciary Committee will not be a \nrubberstamp for this President or any President. Our success in this \nprocess depends on the White House sending consensus nominees, as \nopposed to the highly controversial nominees it sent the Senate \nrepeatedly. I was encouraged by President Bush's pledge after the \nelection to work with Congress in a bipartisan and cooperative way. But \nI was disappointed barely a week later when he broke that pledge and \nrenominated a slate of his most controversial nominees who had failed \nto win confirmation, even under a Republican-controlled Senate. If they \ncould not win confirmation when the Republicans were in control, my \nguess--I can't speak for other Senators--but my guess, with a \nDemocratic chairman and Democratic-controlled Senate, they probably \nwill not win confirmation there either. If they weren't good enough for \nthe Republicans, they probably won't be good enough for the Democrats.\n\n  I am hopeful we can find a better approach in the 110th Congress. It \nstarts with the President. If the President would consult with us and \nwork with us to send consensus picks instead of failed controversial \nnominations for important lifetime appointments, we can make good \nprogress filling vacancies.\n  We owe it to the American people. The American people do not want \nnominations to be about partisan politics but about Government \nresponsibility to provide justice. The American people expect the \nFederal courts to be fair forums, where justice is dispensed without \nfavor to anybody based on their political philosophy.\n  These are the only lifetime appointments in our entire Government. \nThey matter a great deal to our future. Most of them will serve long \nafter most of us in the Senate have left office; certainly after the \nPresident who nominates them has left office. I said over and over \nagain, the Federal judiciary should not be an arm of the Democratic \nParty nor the Republican Party. Otherwise we lose all faith in the \nindependence of the judiciary. Just as I have opposed those who call \nfor the impeachment of judges when they disagree with a particular \nopinion or give speeches seemingly condoning violence against judges \nand their families, I, also, do not want to see a Federal judiciary \npoliticized. I will continue, in the 110th Congress, to work with \nSenators from both sides of the aisle to ensure that the Federal \njudiciary remains independent and able to provide justice to all \nAmericans.\n  I congratulate Judge Jordan and his family because I know he will be \nconfirmed today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                      Honoring Senatorial Service\n\n                             Paul Sarbanes\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the \nSenate's finest Members, Senator Paul Sarbanes, who is retiring after \n30 years of service in this Chamber. Senator Sarbanes has served this \nSenate, his State, and our country with dignity, wit, and uncommon \nwisdom. He is simply one of the smartest, most principled people I have \never known. He is, quite simply, a class act.\n  Paul Sarbanes has focused his energies on governance and effective \nlegislating. This thoughtful approach has served him well, served his \nState well, and served this Chamber well. Paul Sarbanes never lost an \nelection, and he is the longest serving Senator in the history of the \nState of Maryland.\n  In the Senate, Paul Sarbanes served with great distinction as \nchairman and ranking member of the Banking and Joint Economic \nCommittees and has long provided wise counsel on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  At the Banking Committee, he has been relentless in protecting \nconsumers from unscrupulous financial acts. When the country was hit by \nscandals in the Enron and WorldCom cases, Paul Sarbanes acted to \nprotect against further abuse and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the result. \nThat is an act that has stopped further abuse.\n  Paul Sarbanes also fought for affordable housing, for adequate public \ntransportation, for transparency at the Federal Reserve. In debating \nformer Fed Chairmen and the current one, he has never let central \nbankers forget that they must pursue a dual mandate, with jobs for \nAmericans on an equal footing with fighting inflation.\n  It has been my honor and my privilege to serve with Senator Sarbanes \non the Budget Committee. Few can match his understanding of economics \nand the interaction between the budget and the economy. His insightful \nand tenacious questioning, his even temper, and his humor have made \nbeing his colleague on the Budget Committee both rewarding and a \npleasure.\n  My favorite story about Paul Sarbanes is from his youth. Paul \nSarbanes was an outstanding athlete. He was a great baseball player and \na great basketball player. In fact, he was so good in baseball that he \nwas chosen as a Maryland All Star. He was chosen to play shortstop on \nthat team. When he showed up for the first practice, the manager \ndirected him to second base. Paul Sarbarnes was a little surprised by \nthat because he had been chosen to play shortstop. But he went out and \nplayed second base. He thought there might be some mistake. The next \nday, he came to the next practice and was again directed by the manager \nto play second base. At this point, Senator Sarbanes thought he should \ngo to the manager and inquire why--since he had been chosen to play \nshortstop--he was playing second base. The manager looked him in the \neye and said, ``Sarbanes, Kaline will be playing shortstop.'' Of \ncourse, the Kaline was Al Kaline, who became a Hall of Fame baseball \nplayer.\n  That is some measure of the extraordinary athletic talent that Paul \nSarbarnes had. It was not his athletic talent that so distinguished him \nin this body; it was his remarkable academic talent, his remarkable \nability to deal with others.\n  I think in my time in the Senate I have never dealt with a person of \ngreater wisdom than Paul Sarbarnes.\n  I wish Senator Sarbanes the very best in his retirement and whatever \nendeavors he will pursue. His wife, too, has become a special favorite \nto our family--so bright, so talented, and such a good partner with \nPaul Sarbarnes. I know they are deeply proud that their son has been \nelected to the Congress of the United States to represent a district in \nMaryland.\n  Paul Sarbarnes has been a great colleague and a very dear friend to \nme. I will miss him and his service on the Budget Committee and in the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                               Extenders\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss what is the last pending \nmajor piece of business relative to this Congress and is headed toward \nthe Senate from the House, something called the extenders bill.\n  To put this in the proper context, there are a number of tax \ninitiatives which are going to lapse this year and need to be \nextended--things such as the R tax credit, such as the deduction \nwhich teachers can take when they buy materials for their classrooms. \nTeachers--especially elementary teachers--seem to do a lot of that. \nThey deserve that recognition; also, things such as tuition tax credit. \nThese are all extenders which should occur. Were they to occur in the \nproper order, they might cost as much as $12 billion. However, the bill \nthat is headed toward us doesn't cost $12 billion; it is going to cost \n$39.5 billion. At least that is what we think it is going to cost. We \nhaven't had it finally scored. But that is what we believe is a \nreasonable number to put on that.\n  That will be added to the deficit. It will be at least $17 billion \nover what is\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\nknown as pay-go, which is a mechanism that disciplines tax cuts. It \ndoesn't discipline spending, regrettably. I hope we can restructure it, \nand then I might be a supporter of it. But it is $17 billion over what \nis known as the pay-go baseline. This represents $39 billion of funding \nwhich will be added to the debt. That is incredible as the last act of \nCongress. It will actually be, arguably--depending on how you define \nthe Part D premium exercise, which added trillions of dollars in the \noutyear debt--either the largest or the second largest budget buster \npassed by this Congress, $39 billion. It has in it a large amount of \nitems which have nothing to do with extending taxes and has a lot to do \nwith personal interests of various special interest groups around this \ncountry who have the capacity to get things put in bills.\n  Probably the most significant one is conversion of a program called \nthe Abandoned Mine Land Program which basically will create a new $4 \nbillion cost to the American taxpayer to pay for health insurance of \nmine workers and former mine workers which should have been paid for by \nthe coal companies. In other words, it is a direct transfer of payment \nfrom the corporate coal companies' obligations to support the health \ncare of these miners to the American taxpayer. And it is a directed \nprogram, a mandatory program, not a discretionary program. So it \nbasically cannot be reviewed or adjusted in the outyears.\n  It is probably one of the most egregious things we will do in this \nCongress in the area of abandoning fiscal discipline and raiding the \ntaxpayers' pocketbooks for the benefit of a small group of people and \ncorporations.\n  It, also, includes something called the doctors' fix. It is \nappropriate that we correct the amount of money that doctors are \nreimbursed for under the Medicare Act. There is a 5-percent doctor \nreimbursement. It is not fair to doctors to be asked to bear the burden \nof the expansion of Medicare costs, and it should be corrected.\n  But the understanding always was--at least I thought it was--I guess \nI am naive--that it was going to be paid for with real dollars. That \nwasn't exactly what was said here. There are some real dollars being \nused, but there are real dollars that do not have anything to do with \nthe issue. They are taking something called the stabilization fund and \napplying it to doctors. That pays for some of it. That arguably is real \ndollars which should be used in this event, but as a matter of policy, \nyou can't fight it from a budget standpoint. It is real dollars and bad \npolicy.\n\n  But there is another group of dollars being used that does not even \nexist and is being claimed as part of the payment. They are going to \ncorrect a hole in next year's doctors' fix which will double next \nyear's fix; take that money that doesn't exist and claim they are \ntaking that money to pay off the doctors' fix this year. It is an \naccounting gimmick of extraordinary brazenness, which if you did it in \nthe corporate world, you would go to jail. There wouldn't be any \nquestion about it. There would be a clear-cut jail sentence tied to \nthis one if this were a corporate gimmick used by a corporation and put \non the shareholders or the investors in your company as something that \nwas appropriate. It is an outrage of the first order on the American \ntaxpayer and our children, because who pays for this? Our children pay \nfor it. That is what happens.\n  The bill is laden with earmarks, where this group or that group or \nthat one--the District of Columbia gets $150 million, the State of \nTennessee gets $35 million, and the State of Nevada gets $4 million. I \ndon't know how this one got in here: The Music Writers of America are \ngoing to get $3 million. The music writers will get $3 million from the \ntaxpayers and put on the debt. By our standards around here, it \nwouldn't even make an asterisk. But it is what this represents that is \nso outrageous.\n  The rum excise revenue sharing with Puerto Rico, $184 million; \nspecial depreciation for ethanol plants.\n  I don't think there has ever been a financial bill which has come \nthrough this body that didn't have something for ethanol. Ethanol is a \ngreat idea. I am for it now. I used to be suspect about it. But it is \nsuch a vertical, integrated subsidy. Why do we have to keep throwing \nsubsidy after subsidy into it? In fact, not happy enough with that \nlittle exercise, they also had to extend the tariff on ethanol that \ncomes into the country from international producers so that the \nNortheast, which can't get the ethanol from the Midwest because it \ncan't be shipped through the pipelines because ethanol can't be shipped \nthrough the pipelines because it bonds with water and the pipelines \nwill not work--the Northeast, which can only get it shipped efficiently \nand cost effectively, say, from Brazil and have it shipped in by boat, \nhas to pay a huge tariff on that--54 cents a gallon, which makes it \neconomically unfeasible, even though it is an alternative fuel source \nthat should be used throughout our country. And granted, we would like \nto have it produced in America, but I would rather be buying ethanol \nfrom Brazil than oil from some of our friends in the Middle East, such \nas Iran. Yet this makes it virtually impossible to do that. It is good \npolicy, I say with great irony and sarcasm. Of course, it has nothing \ndo with tax extenders.\n  Then there are serious policy implications. For example, it extends \nthe sales tax deduction, which is a policy of essentially saying to \nhigh-tax States: You should increase your taxes on your people at the \nexpense of the Federal Treasury. The sales tax deduction is nothing \nmore than a revenue sharing for the Federal Government, where the \nFederal government says to a State: We will give you a deduction for \nincreasing your taxes and the Federal taxes will then go up for \neverybody else to pay for that deduction. There are a lot of States \nthat don't have a sales tax. There is no reason they should be \npenalized in this way. There is no reason people in New Hampshire \nshould have to pay sales tax to subsidize a high sales tax in the \nStates of New York or Texas or California. It doesn't make any sense, \nfrom a policy standpoint.\n  This is not distributed in a very equitable way. The only people who \ncan take advantage of this are the itemizers. Itemizers, by definition, \nusually earn more than $60,000, at about the breaking point where you \nstart to itemize your tax deductions. Basically, low-income people who \npay a sales tax will see their sales taxes go up because States will \nwant to raise them in order to claim their deduction, and low-income \npeople will now have to pay more in sales tax and not be able to deduct \nit; whereas, high-income people in those States deduct it. It doesn't \nmake any sense policywise or from a tax standpoint. It is just one \nimportant effort by one group of States that want to get this deduction \nput in place to take advantage of a bill coming through here.\n  The bill, as I said, is arguably the biggest budget buster ever \nbrought forward by the Republican Congress. That is ironic in and of \nitself, isn't it? That is pretty ironic.\n  The way it is being brought forward is interesting. It is being \nbrought forward in a manner which will make it extraordinarily \ndifficult. This is being done by the Republican leadership for the \nRepublican membership in a way that makes it extraordinarily difficult \nfor anyone to attack the bill at any point and raise any of the issues \nwhich I just raised. In other words, if I wanted to address this \ndeduction of $35 million for Tennessee or if I wanted to address the \nmusic writers item, I will not be able to do that. That option is not \ngoing to be allowed to me on a traditional vote nor on a motion to \nstrike. I probably would lose those motions, but that is not going to \nbe available to knock those earmarks out.\n  If I wanted to raise the policy arguments on the doctors' fix, the \nfact that you have this unbelievable accounting mechanism used to pay \nfor it, I am not going to be able to do that as Budget chairman. That \nwill be denied. The Republican leadership is denying Republican \nmembership the capacity to address these serious fiscal issues in this \nbill, including the fact it is $39 billion added to the Federal debt. \nIt is going to be brought over in a manner which I have never seen \nhappen before, probably because it is the biggest budget buster in the \nhistory of our country passed by the Republican Congress. They do not \nwant to have anybody highlighting it but are sending it over as a \nmessage from the House--not as a bill but as a message from the House, \nwhich dramatically limits the ability\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\nto attack it or raise issues by it. ``Tax'' maybe is the wrong term. \nThen they are going to fill the tree so no amendments can be made. Then \nthey are going to have the final vote with motions to concur with the \nHouse message. It is obvious they have the votes to do this. This bill \nhas so much in it for so many different little folks and issues around \nhere that they have racked up the vote count to the point where they \ncan accomplish it. Well over 60 votes would be for this bill. The votes \nare there. They can do it. That is the way the majority works.\n\n  But we have to ask this question. The American people took the reins \nof government away from the Republican Party, the Republican Congress, \nin this last election. They did so in large part because they were \ntired of our hypocrisy as a party on the issue of fiscal \nresponsibility. It would appear their concerns are justified. It is \ntrue that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will probably \nbe worse at fiscal management than we are. We have shown it to be in \nour nature to spend money. If you add up all the things they talk about \nin their campaigns, they will spend a lot, but at least they will not \nbe hypocritical, going to the American people and saying: We are the \nparty of fiscal responsibility.\n  We have to ask how we as a party got to this point where we have a \nleadership which is going to ram down the throats of our party the \nbiggest budget buster in the history of the Congress under Republican \nleadership.\n  Anyway, the American people figured it out. I am sorry we haven't \nfigured it out yet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11563-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11563-S11564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     First Sergeant Charles M.king\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated \nand decorated Ohio soldier, Army 1SG Charles Monroe King from \nCleveland. 1SG King was killed in Iraq by a roadside bomb on October \n14, 2006, during a convoy mission to send supplies to Baghdad. He was \n48 years old at the time of his death.\n  1SG King's last mission captures the essential character and \nselflessness of this man. A 19-year veteran of the Army, Charles was \nthe senior officer on a resupply mission near Baghdad. According to \nothers, Charles did not have to accompany the convoy, but, true to \nform, Charles went to offer his experience to the younger soldiers on \nthe mission.\n  His friend and fellow soldier, Captain Jon Schaeffer, said this about \nwhat happened:\n\n       He did not have to go on that resupply mission, but \n     Sergeant King loved his soldiers. He would not let them do \n     anything that he would not do, so he was right there with \n     them.\n\n  His heartbroken fiancee, Dana Canedy, added:\n\n       He said he could not, in good faith, send his soldiers on a \n     mission unless he did it himself. He made sure that each one \n     of his soldiers took leave before he would take his leave.\n\n  That selflessness--that willingness to always put his men first--is a \nmeasure of Charles' leadership and courage. That Saturday in October, \nAmerica lost a true hero.\n  A career soldier, Charles was scheduled to return home last month. He \nwas a member of a unit from Fort Hood, TX, that was deployed to Iraq \nlast November. As a veteran of the first Gulf War and one of the Army's \nvery best soldiers, Charles was highly decorated. His numerous awards \ninclude the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army \nCommendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Army Valorous \nUnit Award. This list of awards, impressive as it is, tells only part \nof the story of this remarkable man.\n  As his sister Gail said, ``My brother was very humble about his \nmilitary experience and all the things he had accomplished.'' Charles \nwas born and raised in the Cleveland neighborhood of Lee-Miles, where \nhis parents Charlie and Gladys still live.\n  Friends and family remember Charles as a soft-spoken, helpful little \nboy, who could be counted on to do more than his share of the work.\n  His former church Pastor, Vern Miller, recalled the day he asked for \nvolunteers to build a three-foot concrete block wall for a needy \nneighbor. Charles was only a child, but he already had that natural \nimpulse to help and to serve. Pastor Miller said that ``Chuckie was the \nfirst to arrive. He was ready to work. Of course, he was too little to \ncarry the heavy blocks, but he brought the workers water all day.'' In \nthat giving little boy, we can see clearly the loving man he would \nbecome.\n  Charles was also a person with wide-ranging interests and passions. \nHe was especially interested in art. When Charles was about 13, his \nmother enrolled him and his sister in an art class at a nearby \ncommunity college. Gail said that, while she ``failed miserably,'' \nCharles fell in love with art.\n  Upon finishing high school, Charles attended the heralded Art \nInstitute of Chicago. Upon graduation in 1983, he worked as a fashion \nad illustrator in Alabama. Known as a hard worker with a meticulous eye \nfor detail, Charles created illustrations for advertisements, as well \nas for news stories.\n  His artistic talent continued to play a significant role in Charles' \nlife long after he traded in a civilian career in art for a life of \nmilitary service. While serving in the military, Charles became \nfascinated with the history of the 761st Tank Battalion, an African \nAmerican unit that served in World War II. Ultimately Charles was so \ninspired that he drew a collection of illustrations of the unit in \nbattle. His collection was put on display at the Pentagon in 1998, as \npart of the Black History Month celebration. More of his work is now on \nexhibit at military museums at Fort Lewis, WA, and Fort Knox, TN.\n  Charles King could have lived comfortably as a professional artist, \nbut his strong sense of duty led him to enlist in the Army. ``My \nbrother was very much into service and serving others, and that was the \ndriving force [for joining the military],'' Gail said.\n  Charles joined the Army in 1987 and married shortly after. He soon \nbecame a dad, when daughter Christina was born. She was the light of \nher father's life.\n  While in the military, Charles served honorably in Iraq from 1990 to \n1991, as part of Operation Desert Storm. Later, he was able to continue \nhis education, attending Cuyahoga Community College and receiving an \nassociates degree from Chamberlain Junior College in Boston.\n  Charles was remembered by his fellow soldiers as the consummate \nprofessional. Captain Schaeffer remembers how the normally soft spoken \nand gentle man was also a very capable leader, able to guide his troops \nin times of chaos. He said that ``we all learned one thing: When \nSergeant King yelled, you moved. He only yelled when there was good \nreason.''\n  Before his last deployment to Iraq, Charles became engaged to Dana \nCanedy, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist who worked for the \nCleveland Plain Dealer and now serves as an editor at the New York \nTimes. While Charles was in Iraq this last year, Dana gave birth to \ntheir son, Jordan. Charles was ecstatic.\n  During a 2 week leave in September, he got to see his 6 month-old son \nfor what would, tragically, be the first and the last time. He could \nhardly put his baby boy down.\n  Although it was terribly difficult to be separated from his family, \nCharles came up with a unique and heartwarming way to communicate to \nhis infant son Jordan. Miles away, Charles began keeping a journal \naddressed to Jordan. The journal, which reached 200 pages, was a \ncollection of everything from short stories from his childhood to \nexcerpts of his time as an artist. Mostly though, the journal laid out \ndetailed guidelines and fatherly advice about what Jordan would need to \nknow growing up.\n  Dana said this about that journal:\n\n       It was therapy for [Charles]. He wanted his son to know \n     everything he could tell him. Everything from his favorite \n     Bible verses, why he wanted to have a baby, why he wanted to \n     be a soldier, and how to treat women.\n\n  Leafing through the pages, there are instructions for everything from \nhow to deal with disappointment to letting his son know it was OK for \nboys to cry. As Dana said, ``Charles was this big, muscular guy, but he \nwas like a big pussycat.'' Charles ended his journal to\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\nhis young son, saying, ``I will do my best to make you and your mother \nproud.''\n  Indeed, Charles King made everyone who had the privilege to know him \nvery proud.\n  News of Charles' death was devastating to his family, friends, and \ncommunity. Since his death, phone calls have poured in to his family's \nhome. ``God is just continuing to work miracles in our lives,'' said \nGail.\n  In a funeral service held in Cleveland at Lee Heights Community \nChurch on October 23, friends eulogized Charles. They told stories \nabout him that prompted a sea of smiles and nods from the friends and \nfamily packed into the tiny church, whose walls were covered with \nCharles' paintings.\n  Those in attendance remembered the boy who had grown up to be such an \naccomplished man. They remembered the brave soldier, the talented \nartist, and the loving son, brother, father, and friend. They \nremembered an American hero.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep all of Charles' family--his \nparents Gladys and Charlie, his sister Gail, his fiancee Dana, his son \nJordan, and his daughter Christina--in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11564-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11564-S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LANCE CORPORAL THOMAS KEELING\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marine LCpl Thomas \nKeeling from Strongsville, OH.

He was assigned to the Marine Reserve's 3rd \nBattalion, 25th Regiment, 4th Marine Division based out of Akron, OH. \nHe was 29 years old.\n  LCpl Keeling leaves his mother and step-father, Sharon and Robert \nBerry, his father Tom Keeling; his sister Erin Keeling, and his twin \nsister Kristen Keeling.\n  Thomas--Tom to his family and friends--graduated from Strongsville \nHigh School in 2000 and then attended Kent State University, graduating \nin 2004 with a Criminal Justice degree. Matthew Kichinka from \nStrongsville knew Tom as ``Tommy Boy.'' He reminisced about his high \nschool friend:\n\n       I still remember the first time we met in home room 10th \n     grade year. You were my best friend in high school. I will \n     never forget the great times we've shared, the mischief we \n     caused in gym class, and the nights we closed at the kitchen \n     at Giant Eagle. Thank you friend, for being there for me \n     during those difficult times in high school and being the \n     best friend a person could have.\n\n  Dave Murphy of Middleburg Heights, OH, moved to Strongsville not \nknowing a soul--that is until he met Tom. As Dave put it:\n\n       I moved to Strongsville when I was young. I was concerned I \n     wouldn't find any friends, I was blessed enough to move in \n     across the street from the Keelings. Before the moving trucks \n     even drove away, Tom was in my yard inviting me into his. \n     This is a perfect example of the person Tom was. He was truly \n     compassionate for others and a great friend.\n\n  Mary Jo Webster from Berea, OH, was Tom's 6th grade teacher. She \nremembers him as ``a lively, happy child.'' Friends knew him as always \nhaving fun and doing things he enjoyed. Whether he was playing hockey \nin Parma Heights, in his softball league, or shooting hoops with \nfriends in his neighborhood, he was always active. Teammates took pride \nin their skillful forward. He had outstanding agility and tremendous \nspeed. But his interests were not just in the sports that he was \nplaying, he was interested in the people and the relationships it takes \nto build a team.\n  When Tom was at Kent State, he worked in housekeeping to earn extra \nmoney. Paula Hill described her custodial co-worker by saying that ``he \nwas one of the nicest young gentlemen I've ever met. I called him my \nnumber three son because he was as close to me as my own children.''\n  When Tom graduated from college, he was considering a career in the \nFBI. His mother Sharon said that ``Tom's dream was to become an FBI \nagent, and he chose going to the Marine Corps because he thought he \nwould get some experience that would help him along his career.''\n  Tom had been a Reservist for 4 years, and his stepfather and \ngrandfather were both marines. He looked up to his grandfather, who was \na World War II veteran and had been awarded two Purple Hearts. When Tom \ndied, he was buried next to him.\n  Tom once told his stepfather that he was proud of the job that the \nU.S. troops were doing in Iraq and that he could see things improving. \nTom had been in Iraq since February 2005, and was assigned to a mobile \nstrike force seeking insurgents in the Anbar province near the Syrian \nborder. ``Sometimes they go out seven days at a time. They'd patrol \ncities during the day and go out in the desert at night,'' his step-\nfather said.\n  But Tom's work in Iraq didn't stop on the field of battle. In weekly \ncare packages, his family made sure to send him candy and Beanie Babies \nto hand out to Iraqi children. Tom's ability to connect with the \nchildren of the country he was trying to protect was a testament to the \nkind, gentle soul that Tom Keeling was.\n  Nate Ickes from Akron, OH, honored his brother-in-arms by saying:\n\n       I was honored to have served with Tom. He brought joy and \n     laughter to everyone in our unit. There was never a day that \n     went by that he did not have a smile on his face.\n\n  Close friends, like Emily Laurie of Charleston, SC, understand the \nimpact Tom had on the people he touched. She wrote words of comfort in \na posting on an Internet tribute website. This is what she wrote:\n\n       Remember Tom with a smile. Remember the good things, the \n     good times, and the laughter. He is a hero, endowed with \n     great courage and strength and has sacrificed his life for \n     the freedom of others. He will be missed, but not forgotten.\n\n  Close family friend Mark Nutter from Brunswick, OH, also paid tribute \nto Tom's memory in an online website by saying the following:\n\n       I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be a part of \n     your family for a few years. I got the chance to know the man \n     that later became the closest thing I have ever had to a \n     little brother. Tom not only quickly became my friend. He \n     became my family. He became my brother. Tom was one of the \n     greatest people that I will ever know and have ever known in \n     my whole life. I will miss him dearly.\n\n  Mark went on to write:\n\n       I am posting this because I came through on a small promise \n     I made to Tom when he passed away. Tom played softball with \n     my friends and me for a few years. The friends Tommy made on \n     the team, including me, made a promise to win our league \n     championship for him.\n       Well Tom, we did it, and we did it for you. I had your old \n     jersey hanging proudly in our dugout all year for you and as \n     long as we play, we always will. I had a picture of Tom and a \n     simple quote below him before our championship games. It \n     read, `Win 2 for Tommy.' Tom, we won two for you that night \n     and our first league title.\n       I will miss Tom dearly and hope his family knows what he \n     meant to me. Thanks for the good times. They will always be \n     in my heart. Thank you, again, Tom. It was a pleasure to have \n     known you.\n\n  Marine LCpl Thomas Keeling had a zest for life, a love of family and \nfriends, and a deep understanding of what it means to serve. My wife \nFran and I continue to keep his family and friends in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Richard Pummill\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to honor a courageous Ohioan from Cincinnati--\nMarine SSgt Richard Pummill, who was killed in Iraq by a roadside bomb \non October 20, 2005, after serving there for 3 months as a weapons \nofficer. He was 27 years of age at the time.\n  Staff Sergeant Pummill leaves his wife, Chantal; their son Donald \nRichard--known as Cliff--his mother Lynn, and his grandparents Donald \nand Ann.\n  Richard--known as Rick--graduated from Anderson High School in 1996, \nwhere he excelled in football and wrestling. Eileen Arnold, a counselor \nat Anderson High School, first met Rick when he was a freshman. ``He \nstood out in my mind because he was fun-loving, outgoing, and \nenergetic,'' she recalled. ``I had the sense he wanted to do something \nspecial with his life. He was never afraid to speak his mind and was \nnever hesitant. He didn't go along just to go along.''\n  Indeed, Rick did want to do something special with his life, and he \njoined the Marine Corps immediately after high school. Patsy Hager, \nmother of Rick's childhood friend Wally, said:\n\n       The Marines gave him a purpose. He was always driven. He \n     was always about something.\n\n  This passion and drive served Rick well in his Marine Corps weapons \nofficer training. As Rick's friend Matt Fugate recalled:\n\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\n\n       Rick was a fun guy, but he was a Marine through and \n     through. That was his calling.\n\n  John Morgan, Jr., and Rick played on the same soccer team when the \nboys were 4 years old, and the two have remained friends. Rick gave \nJohn his spare dog tag the day he joined the military, and John has \ncarried it around on his keychain ever since. He described Rick as \n``fearless.''\n  But, Rick was also a caring and compassionate individual. For \nportions of his childhood, he and his mother lived with his \ngrandparents, Ann and Don Lesher. When Rick was stationed with the \nmarines in North Carolina, he would buy wood, haul it home to Ohio, and \nchop it for his grandparents so they could use it to heat their home. \n``He adored his grandparents,'' his mom said.\n  After completing his Marine Corps training, Rick served as a military \nrecruiter. His charisma and enthusiasm for the job was apparent to all \nhis colleagues. SSgt James Morgan was a fellow recruiter and left the \nfollowing message for Rick's family on an Internet tribute Web site:\n\n       Rick and I worked together on recruiting duty in a two-man \n     station--just him and me. Recruiting duty will test a Marine, \n     but [Rick], my friend, always kept me laughing. We spent many \n     days lost on backwoods Danville roads. [He] always went the \n     extra mile--always volunteered to get the job done. I will \n     never forget him. I am a Staff Sergeant today because of \n     Rick's hard work.\n\n  When the war began in Iraq, however, Rick was eager to give up the \nsafety of his recruiter's job for a combat position. After preparing so \nmany young marines to make the journey to Iraq, he felt compelled to go \nover, himself, and serve beside them. He only had the chance to serve 3 \nmonths before he was killed by a roadside bomb during combat \noperations. Although his time in Iraq was short, he left a lasting \nimpression on those with whom he served. Fellow marine and friend Josh \nWilliams wrote the following after Rick's death:\n\n       It's not like when your parent dies of sickness or a friend \n     dies in an accident. Losing a comrade in a war is very \n     different. There's a bond there that doesn't have a name.\n\n  Rick was a selfless individual, who was always looking to ease \nothers' hardships. A wife of a fellow marine who served under Rick \nwrote the following in tribute to him:\n\n       I met Staff Sergeant Pummill the day our men left for Iraq. \n     He was so friendly and even gave me some advice about getting \n     through the deployment. `Just look at it in terms of paycheck \n     to paycheck,' he said. `That's what my wife will do.' My \n     husband is very privileged to have worked under him.\n\n  In his civilian life, Rick enjoyed painting his own cars and thought \nabout going to culinary school after he finished his service in the \nmilitary. But, there was one passion in his life that far outweighed \nall the rest--and that was his family--his wife and son Cliff. Rick's \nmother Lynn recalled that ``he was a fantastic father. He was dedicated \nand adored his son. Cliff looks just like him.''\n  There is no doubt that all those who loved Rick will make sure Cliff \nknows what a courageous and remarkable man his father was.\n  Rick's wife Chantal describes her husband as ``the most dedicated \nMarine that I knew. He was a loving husband and a devoted father.''\n  Rick's mother Lynn added:\n\n       My son loved our country. He loved the Marine Corps. He \n     lived to be a Marine.\n\n  This is how Rick will be remembered, Mr. President: as a loving \nfather, devoted husband, loyal son, caring grandson, and brave marine. \nMy wife Fran and I continue to keep his family in our thoughts and in \nour prayers.\n\n\n                     MASTER SERGEANT DAVID A. SCOTT\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor and remember a man who \ndedicated his life to the service of our Nation. On July 20, 2003, Air \nForce MSgt David A. Scott, from Union, OH, died while serving our \ncountry in Doha, Qatar. He was 51 years of age.\n  ``Scotty''--as family and friends called him--spent his career in \nmilitary service. He was serving as an Air Force Reservist in the U.S. \nEmbassy in Qatar when he died of a brain aneurysm. He is survived by \nhis wife of 25 years Deborah and daughter Christine.\n  Born in Toledo, Scotty graduated from Erie Mason High School in 1971 \nin Erie, MI. The following year, he served in the Vietnam war. \nAfterward, he returned to his hometown of Toledo, where he began work \nin an automotive factory.\n  When the automobile factory closed in the mid-1970s, Scotty decided \nto enlist in the Marines. He served as a marine for 17 years before \njoining the Air Force Reserves in 1993 and moving to Union.\n  Though he served our Nation well in the Air Force Reserves, Scotty \nalways thought of himself as a marine first and foremost. ``The Marine \nCorps was his life,'' his wife Deborah said.\n  ``He was in the Marines for 17 years and worked at testing new \nrecruits. Even when he went into the Air Force Reserves, they called \nhim their token Marine. He always said, `Once a Marine, always a \nMarine.' ''\n  But, whether he was serving with the Marines or the Air Force, there \nwas one thing that Scotty always was--a dedicated and selfless \nserviceman, who was proud to serve his country in any capacity asked of \nhim. At the Embassy in Qatar, he served as the assistant chief of \ninformation systems for the 445th Communications Squadron, based out of \nWright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH. His job there was to \ncoordinate and assist in obtaining diplomatic clearances for Coalition \naircraft and personnel, as well as to help plan equipment shipments for \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n  While serving overseas, Scotty would call and e-mail his wife Deborah \noften and share with her how proud he was of the meaningful work he was \ndoing. As Deborah recalls:\n\n       He said it was very important and that he'd met a lot of \n     great people. He was so proud to be serving his country.\n\n  An avid sportsman, Scotty enjoyed watching football and would make \nbets with family members on NFL games. He also enjoyed hunting and \nfishing.\n  Scotty was an admirable marine and Reservist--a model for what every \nserviceman and woman strives to be. But, even more importantly, he was \na loving and devoted husband and father. Scotty and Deborah celebrated \ntheir 25th anniversary in October 2002. ``We had such a nice time,'' \nDeborah remembers. ``We took a long weekend and went down to Tennessee \nto Pigeon Forge.''\n  Scotty's death has been felt deeply by all who knew him. In Deborah's \nwords, he was simply a ``real nice guy. Everybody loved him.''\n  Scotty was so well respected by those he worked with in the military. \nOne of his comrades, MSgt T. Kirkman, left his friend the following \nmessage on an Internet tribute website. This is what he wrote:\n\n       Scotty, you are missed, but never forgotten. I am proud to \n     have worked with you at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. You \n     were one of my best and brightest memories of the 445 AW! To \n     Scotty's family--may the Lord continue to bless and keep you \n     until you see him again.\n\n  It takes courage and self-sacrifice to serve one's country. Scotty \ndedicated his life to serving this country. And, he did so in not one, \nnot two, but three branches of the military: the Army, the Marine \nCorps, and the Air Force. And so today, we honor MSgt David Scott in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, my wife Fran and I will keep his family and friends in \nour thoughts and in our prayers. We will keep his wife Deborah and his \ndaughter Christine in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                  Sergeant First Class Daniel J. Pratt\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army National Guard SFC \nDaniel J. Pratt from Newark, OH, who died on November 3, 2005, when he \nsuffered a heart attack, while serving in Iraq. He was assigned to the \nArmy National Guard's 211th Maintenance Company, based out of Newark \nand had served with the Guard for about 16 years. He was 48 years old. \nHe leaves his wife Linda, his daughter Lindsay, his son Daniel, and his \nthree sisters and two brothers.\n  Originally from Camden, NJ, Daniel was raised in Williamstown, OH, \nwith his five siblings. He was also a member of Youngstown's St. \nChristine Catholic Church. At Williamstown High School, he lettered in \ncross country and indoor and outdoor track.\n  His former track coach, James Greczek, recalled Daniel's high school \ndays by saying that ``he always had a smile. He was a super, super \nkid.''\n  Daniel's dedication was seen in the type of relationships and \nfriendships he had. Tim Leyden ran cross-country with Daniel at \nWilliamstown, roomed\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\nwith him in college, and lives 15 minutes away from his home in Ohio. \nJust a couple years older than Daniel, Tim reminisced on his best \nfriend by saying this: ``He introduced me to my wife. He was godfather \nto my son. He was . . . outgoing, a good salesman, and fun-loving.''\n  After high school, Daniel attended junior college in Alabama and then \nSoutheastern Lousina College. Daniel became a foreman for a truck \ndealership in Austintown, OH. He met his future wife Linda at Lake \nTahoe. Daniel and Linda were married for almost 20 years.\n  In 1989, Daniel joined the National Guard. Since his deployment to \nIraq on December 30, 2004, Linda and Daniel emailed each other \nregularly and talked by phone on Sundays. It was not easy for Daniel to \nbe apart from his family. But Daniel knew that he was proudly serving \nour Nation. His dedication to service and the safety of his homeland \nearned him the Meritorious Service Medal on August 31, 2005.\n  Tim and many of Daniel's family members last saw him in June 2005, \nwhen he returned home briefly for his son's high school graduation. Tim \nrecalled, ``Everything was fine. He was looking forward to getting \nhome, but the biggest concern was getting all his people home.'' Daniel \nwas due to return home on December 9, 2005.\n  The day after Linda received the news of her husband's death, she \nreceived flowers from him for their 20th anniversary. ``I was just \noverwhelmed and touched. And I just felt his goodness come through \nagain,'' she said. To Linda, her husband was not just a patriotic \nmilitary man and a caring father. He was so much more.\n  Lorraine Boyer, one of Daniel's siblings, said she wasn't surprised \nwhen she heard he had sent anniversary gifts from Iraq. ``He had a \nheart of gold. He was an exceptional human being,'' she said. \n``Everybody he came in contact with--he just touched their lives.''\n  Daniel had no previous health problems, but there was a history of \nheart disease in his family and his father died of heart problems when \nhe was in his 40s.\n  Teri Gove, Daniel's cousin, said the following in tribute to him:\n\n       I am so proud of you, Danny, and so sad for your family. I \n     can still remember Thanksgiving at the camp in Delaware . . . \n     your dad taking us all for a ride in his new big truck out \n     through the woods at midnight to show my dad that his truck \n     could go through anything--and then, the long, dark walk home \n     when [the truck] did get stuck! You and my brother kept \n     hiding and jumping out of the dark to scare us girls! That's \n     the picture I see when I think of you. And now you are a \n     hero!\n\n  Jason Chalky from Youngstown also paid tribute to Daniel. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       We will miss you, forever. I knew you for a couple of \n     years, and you never led me in the wrong direction. You were \n     a good leader, a good soldier, and a good friend. . . . \n     Thanks for all you gave and that your family gave.\n\n  Rick McKinney of Rexburg, ID, served with Daniel in the 237th. He \nsaid that Daniel ``would stand up for his soldiers like no one that \nyou've ever seen. It was six years that I knew him and served with him. \nI thank him and his family for all they've done to ensure our \nfreedom.''\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with the words of SFC David \nGarlits, who said the following in a message to Daniel after his death:\n\n       Dan, it was great to know you, buddy. You were one of my \n     best friends in Iraq. Even though we were the same rank, I \n     always looked up to you. You did so much for the Army with so \n     little in return except for knowing you did your best. You \n     will live on because of all that you shared with others.\n\n  SFC Daniel Pratt will never be forgotten. My wife Fran and I continue \nto keep his family in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent to be granted an additional 5 \nminutes from the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Mike Dewine\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator DeWine leaves the floor, he \nwas speaking of a loss that he and his family and others are mourning, \nI presume in Ohio, where I spent a number of years as an undergraduate \nat Ohio State University. I would associate myself with his remarks in \nextending our sympathies from Delaware. We received some devastating \nnews of our own in Delaware a day or two ago with the news that Army \nSGT Keith Fiscus had been killed in action in Iraq at the age of 26. \nOur hearts go out to him. I will be talking more about him later.\n  There is a loss that we mourn as well, not the loss of a life here in \nthe Senate, but the loss of Senator DeWine who will be returning to \nOhio and to other challenges in the days ahead. Senator DeWine and I \nwere elected to the House of Representatives in 1982. We came here \ntogether with people such as John McCain, Tom Ridge, John Kasich, Harry \nReid, Barbara Boxer, Dick Durbin, and John Spratt, a remarkable \nfreshman class in the House of Representatives. It was the year we \nelected a lot of Democrats and not nearly as many Republicans. Somehow, \nthen, Congressman DeWine managed to swim against the tide and to be \nelected against those odds in Ohio.\n  He served as a Congressman of distinction, later as the State's \nLieutenant Governor where he trained George Voinovich, who served as \nGovernor, and then to be elected to the Senate. It was my privilege to \nserve with him in the House of Representatives and it has been a \nprivilege to serve with him in the Senate.\n  On a personal level, I will miss him. I want to say how much it has \nbeen a privilege to serve with my friend from Ohio, who has a good mind \nand a good heart, wonderful family, and is deeply devoted to them and \nthe people of Ohio, whom we both revere.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. CARPER. I do.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague, who has pointed out to my \ncolleagues in the Senate that he and I came here together in the \nelection of 1982 and came to the House in 1983. We have been dear \nfriends ever since. I will miss working with him. He is someone who I \nbelieve exemplifies what this institution is all about, and that is \ngetting things done, working in a bipartisan way, making a difference. \nHe has done that and will continue to do that.\n  I wish him well.\n  Mr. CARPER. I appreciate very much those words and the chance to be a \nfriend of Senator Mike DeWine.\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about a couple of things, if I may. In \nabout 15 or 20 minutes, the Senate will vote on the confirmation of a \njudge. The President has seen fit to nominate District Court Judge Kent \nJordan, who serves in Delaware, to succeed Judge Jane Roth who has \nserved for more than a dozen years as a judge on the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Judge Roth announced early this year that she was \ngoing to take senior status, and she has done that. I will talk a \nlittle bit about her, and then I will talk about Judge Kent Jordan.\n  Judge Roth, whom I have been privileged to know for almost as long as \nI have been in Delaware, whose husband served here in the Senate for \nsome 30 years and was my predecessor, typifies everything a judge ought \nto be--smart, knows the law, adheres to the law, uncommonly fairminded, \ntreats those who come before her, whether they are on either side of an \nargument, with respect, has a reputation for providing judicial \ntemperament, a forum where justice can occur. She is somebody who works \nhard, somebody who has a wonderful sense of humor. Sometimes when \npeople don those black robes, they turn in their sense of humor, but \nshe has never lost hers.\n  Along the way, in addition to being a district court judge and then a \ncircuit court judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, she was a \nlawyer and partner in a major law firm in my State, Richards, Layton & \nFinger. She played a prominent role there for about 20 years.\n  Prior to that, she served in the foreign service for our country. I \nbelieve she served in places such as Iran, and we could probably use \nher expertise and counsel these days. She served in Rhodesia and in the \nRepublic of the Congo. She married Bill Roth along the way, raised two \nchildren, and somehow managed to do it all with grace and aplomb. She \ncontinues to serve us as the senior judge of the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals. We are lucky she does, and we are grateful to her for that \nservice and to her family for sharing with all the people of the \ncountry,\n\n[[Page S11567]]\n\nnot just of Delaware, a remarkable human being.\n  We are grateful for her service and think of her today as we consider \nthe nomination of her successor Kent Jordan.\n  I have known Kent Jordan not for as long as Judge Roth, but I have \nknown him. He served on the district court in Delaware for some time. \nDelaware is a little State. You know almost everybody, if you want to. \nI have had a chance to get to know him and his family. I think he has \nearned very high marks as our district court judge, much as Judge Roth \ndid when she was our district court judge.\n  When I was privileged to be Governor of the State for some 8 years, I \nnominated a lot of people to serve on the bench. Among the qualities I \nlooked for was people who knew the law, who had good judgment, who were \nable to make decisions. Sometimes people, frankly, find it hard to make \na decision. As a judge, that is not a good thing. You want somebody who \nknows the law and somebody who has good judgment, who is able to make \ndecisions and follows the golden rule in the way the people treat who \ncome before them, who provides good judicial temperament and a forum, a \ncourtroom, where justice will more likely than not be served.\n  Judge Jordan in his service on the district court has always shown \nthat those are the qualities he is all about.\n  He, as Judge Roth, has been a parent, raised a family. I am not sure \nif I have the right number, but I think he and his wife have raised \nfive or six, maybe seven children. So they have had a lot going on at \nhome, with schools and all kinds of extracurricular activities.\n  He served before that in a number of other challenging situations. We \nhad a little debate today and there was a cloture vote on whether we \nwere going to vote on Judge Jordan's nomination. Nobody should somehow \ninterpret that vote and the fact that we had to vote on cloture as any \nquestion about his integrity, competence, ability, and willingness to \nserve. He will be a great addition to the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  We will vote in about 15 minutes on Kent Jordan's nomination. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me--and I know I speak for Senator Biden in \nurging our support--unanimous support for this nomination. He has not \ndisappointed us in anything he has ever done, and I am sure he will not \ndisappoint any of us in this regard either. He has received, by the \nway, from the American Bar Association--every now and then we talk \nabout the ratings they hand out with respect to nominees. His unanimous \nrating was ``well qualified,'' which is the highest possible grade. It \nwas a unanimous rating. I think that speaks for itself.\n  In addition to having served as a district court judge for the last 4 \nyears, he also clerked for a legend in our part of the country, \nDistrict Court Judge James Latchum. Once he graduated from law school, \nhe became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Delaware District. He has \ndone great things with his life. He has a lot of integrity and great \nenergy. I hope he will be rewarded for those things later today. We \nwill be voting in a very short while.\n\n\n       Independent Regulator For Government-Sponsored Enterprises\n\n  As we come down the home stretch on our year's business, there are \nsome things we are going to complete today, or maybe tomorrow--\nhopefully, not Sunday--and there are some things we may not complete. I \nwas looking in the local paper in our State, the News Journal, on \nThursday when I was coming down on the train. I saw an article that was \nheadlined ``Fannie Mae Restates Earnings, With $6.3 Billion in Profits \nSlashed.''\n  I think what the auditors and the Fannie Mae accountants have done is \nlooked at earnings over a 4-year period of time, from 2001 through \n2004, and they concluded that Fannie Mae--a huge enterprise, a large \nGovernment-sponsored enterprise, like Freddie Mac--overstated their \nprofits by some $6.3 billion.\n  The reason I bring that up is that I am disappointed that we are \ngoing to finish business this year and not provide for a strong, \nindependent regulator for Government-sponsored enterprises such as \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. That has \nnot been questioned--with respect to the way they operate, the accuracy \nof the financial reporting. Great questions have been raised over \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and as we have seen in yesterday's \nnewspaper, there was a huge restatement of earnings.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we are not going to be able to \nconclude with a vote on legislation that some people have spent a lot \nof time working on in the last year or two. The House of \nRepresentatives has passed--not unanimously but by a wide margin--\nlegislation that would provide for a strong, independent regulator for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Senate ended up breaking down along \nparty lines in the Senate Banking Committee on similar kinds of \nlegislation. We passed out a bill on party lines. It never came up on \nthe floor. In the last month or two, there has been an encouraging \ndiscussion and negotiation between Congressmen Barney Frank and Mike \nOxley, his staff, and the folks at the Treasury Department, under the \ndirection of Secretary Hank Paulson, to try to narrow the differences \nbetween the bill reported out by our committee with only Republican \nsupport and the bill that passed with bipartisan support in the House. \nWe have not been able to resolve all of our differences, but progress \nhas been made in the last month. I want to say to both Congressman \nFrank and Congressman Oxley--who is leaving, as well, at the end of \nthis year, so he will not have a chance to push this ball into the end \nzone next year but certainly Congressman Frank will be in a position to \ndo that. He will chair the relevant committee in the House. I think \ngreat work has been done and good progress has been made.\n  It is unfortunate that we are not going to complete the job this \nweek. I think we teed the ball up for next month. I hope one of the \nfirst things we will do in the Senate Banking Committee is hold \nhearings and look at the negotiations that have taken place between the \nHouse and the Treasury Department and see if we cannot build on those \nand pass legislation--find common cause with the House of \nRepresentatives and the administration and pass the legislation.\n  Until we do that, there are a couple things that are going to be \noccurring. One, we are going to have uncertainty for the enterprises, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and those who are thinking about selling \ntheir stock. There will be an impact on the housing market as well. We \ndon't need that. The regulator for these entities will not have bank-\nregulator-like powers. This regulator needs that. These entities need a \nregulator that has bank-regulator-like powers. The regulator will not \nbe independent, and we need legislation which would create a strong, \nindependent regulator. Mission and new product authority will continue \nto be separate; they should not be. Capital requirements will not be \nflexible; they should be. Growth of these two enterprises will go \nlargely unconstrained.\n\n  None of those things are desirable. I hope we can address them all \nwhen we come back and resolve them satisfactorily in a very few months.\n  Having said that, there is a lot of progress that has been made. If \nwe go back a year or so, we had large differences where folks in the \nSenate were on a path forward with respect to a strong, independent \nregulator for Government-sponsored enterprises. We agree on combining \nthe regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the Federal Finance \nBoard, which regulates the Federal Home Loan Banks. We agree on that \nnow.\n  The question of the independent regulator from the appropriations \nprocess, we agree on that--that the regulator should be independent of \nthe appropriations process. We also agree that the independent \nlitigation authority for the regulator should be provided. Currently, \nthey have to go through the Department of Justice, and I think we have \nall come to agree that is not the best course, and the regulator ought \nto have independent litigation authority. We decided the regulator has \nto have the power to put them into receivership if, God forbid, the \nworst should occur. We agree on that today. We have agreed on combined \nmission oversight and new product authority under one world class \nregulator, something that a month or a year or so ago we didn't have \ncommon cause on. We agree today that the regulator ought to have \nflexibility for setting capital standards--\n\n[[Page S11568]]\n\nthe Congress setting standards for risk or minimum capital standards. \nWe should invest in the regulator's authority.\n  We agree that there ought to be restrictions on the size of the \nportfolios of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We are talking about hundreds \nof billions of dollars, literally, portfolios that exceed a trillion \ndollars. That is a lot of money. Enterprises of this size, because of \nthe effect they can have on financial markets here and around the \nworld, deserve a world-class regulator. We want to make sure they get \nthat. That should be an early item of business next January.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in \nenthusiastic support of Kent Jordan, a fellow Delawarean, who has been \nnominated by President Bush to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit.\n  If Kent is confirmed by the Senate, he will have completed a meteoric \nrise to a seat on the Federal court of appeals, and no one is more \ndeserving.\n  But before I talk about Judge Jordan, allow me to say a few words \nabout the Judge whom Judge Jordan is nominated to replace. This spring, \nJudge Jane Roth informed the President that she would be taking senior \nstatus. Judge Roth has been a stellar presence on the Federal bench; \nshe has served her country with dignity, wisdom and distinction. She is \ndedicated to the rule of law, and her representation of our State on \nthe court of appeals has brought nothing but distinction to Delaware.\n  Like many of you, I have known Judge Roth for several years, and I \nlook forward to her continued brilliant service as a senior judge of \nthe circuit.\n  As I told the Judiciary Committee at his hearing, Kent Jordan has \nvery large shoes to fill, but I am confident that he is up to the task.\n  Judge Jordan began his legal career with a clerkship in the chambers \nof Judge Latchum, a pillar of the bar in Wimington. He went on to serve \nas an assistant U.S. attorney, working on some highly publicized cases \nand bringing some really bad characters to justice.\n  He then became a partner at one of Delaware's top law firms, Morris \nJames Hitchens & Williams, before becoming general counsel to the 102-\nyear-old Corporation Services Company and finally, 4 years ago, being \nconfirmed by this Senate to serve on the bench of the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Delaware.\n  Mr. Chairman, the past 4 years have demonstrated what those of us \nfamiliar with Judge Jordan already knew. He possesses the sterling \nacademic and professional skills, as well as the vital judgment and \ntemperament, to be an outstanding Federal district judge.\n  Lawyers who have appeared before Judge Jordan--even those he has \nruled against--have described him as openminded and fair. His \ncolleagues on the bench have come to value his intellect, integrity and \nhis friendship.\n  If confirmed, Judge Kent will be an asset to the appellate bench and \na model of responsible jurisprudence for years to come. I have full \nconfidence that he will bring to the appellate bench all of the assets \nhe has so clearly demonstrated in the district court.\n  I highly commend Judge Jordan to my colleagues and ask that they vote \nto confirm his nomination.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Kent A. Jordan, of Delaware, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Third Circuit?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from South Carolina \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter), the \nSenator from Missouri (Mr. Talent), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. \nWarner).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) and \nthe Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 1245, Johanna's Law, which was received from the \nHouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1245) to provide for programs to increase the \n     awareness and knowledge of women and health care providers \n     with respect to gynecologic cancers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as a physician and a two-time cancer \nsurvivor, I believe that eliminating cancer should be among our \nNation's highest priorities.\n  During my two decades practicing medicine, I have treated countless \npatients of all ages and backgrounds who were diagnosed with various \nforms of cancers. Many were successfully treated and are alive and \nhealthy today. Others were not as fortunate. Sadly, most of these cases \ncould have been treated if detected earlier. Nearly all could have been \nprevented.\n  As a physician, I know firsthand that both patients and health care \nproviders are not properly informed about many symptoms and causes of \ncancer. I have long been disappointed that the U.S. Surgeon General and \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, have failed to \ntake an effective leadership role to educate the American people with \nlifesaving information about the various forms of cancer and how to \nprotect themselves. As a result, the American Cancer Society estimates \nthat 1,399,790 men and women--720,280 men and 679,510 women--will be \ndiagnosed with and 564,830 men and women will die of cancer of all \nsites in 2006. Countless others will require invasive treatment that \nwill forever affect their lives.\n  Each of these individual lives represents a failure to protect the \nhealth of one of our sisters, daughters, brothers, sons, parents, \nneighbors, and friends.\n  One recent patient of mine, an 18-year-old girl, is an example. She \nwas diagnosed with human papillomavirus, HPV, infection. HPV is the \ncause of over 99 percent of all cervical cancers and is a sexually \ntransmitted disease.\n  To prevent the onset of invasive cervical cancer, a large portion of \nthis young girl's cervix had to be removed. As a result she is less \nlikely to be able to become pregnant in the future and more likely to \nhave a premature infant if she does become pregnant. And despite \nalready undergoing invasive treatment, she remains at risk for future \ncomplications and additional surgeries.\n  This girl and the others that I am caring for in my medical practice \nare the real faces of those affected by HPV and cervical cancer. What \nwe are confronting is not an isolated epidemic.\n  About 24 million Americans are currently infected with HPV according \nto the National Cancer Institute and an estimated 5.5 million Americans \nbecome infected with HPV every year. With 4.6 million of these HPV \ninfections acquired by those aged 15 to 24, HPV accounts for over half \nof all new sexually transmitted diseases among young Americans. On \nMarch 8, 2004, researchers from the Colorado Health Sciences Center \nreported that more than 30 percent of women in a recent study were \nfound to be infected with a strain of HPV linked to cervical and anal \ncancer. In comparison, 18.7 percent of men carried HPV-16, one of 10 \nhigh-risk strains of the virus.\n  Over 1,350,000 women will have invasive procedures each year just to \nassess the status of their abnormal pap smears secondary to HPV. \nAccording to the American Cancer Society, every year over 12,000 new \ncases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed and more than 4,000 \nwomen die of the disease. And noninvasive cervical cancer is estimated \nto be four times as widespread as the invasive type. HPV is also \nassociated with other forms of cancer and more than 1 million \nprecancerous lesions that affect both women and men.\n  Few of my patients with HPV had ever heard of the virus and were \nunaware of its health risks including its\n\n[[Page S11571]]\n\nlink to cancer. Many of my fellow physicians were not even aware of HPV \nand its symptoms.\n  In 2000, I authored legislation directing the CDC and the Food and \nDrug Administration--FDA--to take actions to educate the public with \n``medically accurate information'' about HPV and cervical cancer. I was \ndisappointed when groups that claimed to advocate for women's health, \nsuch as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--ACOG--\nopposed my proposal and fought to keep the public in the dark about \nHPV.\n  The HPV law was approved by Congress as a component of the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 and became Public Law 106-554 \nwith the signature of President Bill Clinton on December 21, 2000. In a \nStatement of Administration policy, President Clinton stated:\n\n       The Administration supports the goal of better informing \n     the public about HPV and the fact that the use of condoms may \n     not fully prevent HPV transmission.\n\n  The law directed CDC to develop a report outlining the ``best \nstrategies to prevent future infections, based on the available \nscience.'' After the repeated urging of Congress, CDC finally issued a \nreport in 2004 that concluded:\n\n       Because genital HPV infection is most common in men and \n     women who have had multiple sex partners, abstaining from \n     sexual activity (i.e. refraining from any genital contact \n     with another individual) is the surest way to prevent \n     infection. For those who choose to be sexually active, a \n     monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner is the \n     strategy most likely to prevent future genital HPV \n     infections. For those who choose to be sexually active but \n     who are not in a monogamous relationship, reducing the number \n     of sexual partners and choosing a partner less likely to \n     be infected may reduce the risk of genital HPV infection. \n     . . .\n       The available scientific evidence is not sufficient to \n     recommend condoms as a primary prevention strategy for the \n     prevention of genital HPV infection. . . .\n       Regarding other possible prevention approaches, no data \n     indicate that treatment of clinical lesions or use of \n     microbicides will prevent transmission of infection, although \n     HPV vaccines are likely to become available in the next few \n     years and may become an effective prevention tool.\n\n  The CDC's conclusions reflected what has become the scientific \nconsensus.\n  In a February 1999 letter to the U.S. House Commerce Committee, Dr. \nRichard D. Klausner, then-Director of the National Cancer Institute, \nstated:\n\n       Condoms are ineffective against HPV because the virus is \n     prevalent not only in the mucosal tissue (genitalia) but also \n     on dry skin of the surrounding abdomen and groin, and it can \n     migrate from those areas into the vagina and the cervix. \n     Additional research efforts by NCI on the effectiveness of \n     condoms in preventing HPV transmission are not warranted.\n\n  In 2001, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases \nalong with FDA, CDC and the U.S. Agency for International Development \nissued a consensus report regarding condom effectiveness that concluded \n``there was no epidemiologic evidence that condom use reduced the risk \nof HPV infection.''\n  In November 2002, a meta-analysis of ``the best available data \ndescribing the relationship between condoms and HPV-related \nconditions'' from the previous two decades was published in the journal \nSexually Transmitted Diseases. The meta-analysis concluded: ``There was \nno consistent evidence of a protective effect of condom use on HPV DNA \ndetection, and in some studies, condom use was associated with a \nslightly increased risk for these lesions.''\n  Based upon these findings, the law directs CDC to ``prepare and \ndistribute educational materials for health care providers and the \npublic that include information on HPV. Such materials shall address \nmodes of transmission, consequences of infection, including the link \nbetween HPV and cervical cancer, the available scientific evidence on \nthe effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of condoms in preventing \ninfection with HPV, and the importance of regular Pap smears, and other \ndiagnostics for early intervention and prevention of cervical cancer.'' \nThe CDC has not complied with this requirement.\n  The law further requires that ``all other relevant educational and \nprevention materials prepared and printed from this date forward for \nthe public and health care providers by the Secretary--including \nmaterials prepared through the Food and Drug Administration, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Health Resources \nand Services Administration--or by contractors, grantees, or \nsubgrantees thereof, that are specifically designed to address STDs \nincluding HPV shall contain medically accurate information regarding \nthe effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of condoms in preventing the \nSTD the materials are designed to address.'' Again, Federal agencies \nhave not complied with this provision of law.\n  The law directed the FDA ``to determine whether the labels are \nmedically accurate regarding the overall effectiveness or lack of \neffectiveness of condoms in preventing sexually transmitted diseases, \nincluding HPV.'' Six years after this law was signed, the FDA is still \nin the beginning stages of crafting a new medically accurate \ninformational label for condom packages. By way of comparison, it took \n410 days to build the Empire State Building and 2 years, 2 months and 5 \ndays to construct the Eiffle Tower.\n  Congress approved the HPV law precisely because Federal health \nagencies had failed to educate the American public about the health \nrisks of HPV and how it can be prevented and these same agencies are \ncontinuing their cover-up of the HPV epidemic, now in violation of \nfederal law.\n  In 1999, when this law was first offered in Congress, a study \npublished by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in June 1999, \nfound that ``only 37 percent of respondents had ever heard of HPV,'' \nmeaning knowledge of HPV has not increased in almost a decade. The 1999 \nstudy concluded ``implementing HPV education programs and measuring \ntheir effectiveness should be a priority.''\n  According to a 2005 Health Information National Trends Survey, only \n40 percent of women have ever heard about HPV. Of those that have heard \nof HPV, less than 20 percent knew that HPV could sometimes lead to \ncervical cancer, meaning that only about 8 percent of American women \nare aware that HPV can cause cervical cancer. The only factors \nassociated with having accurate knowledge--knowing that it could lead \nto cervical cancer--was an abnormal Pap test or testing positive on an \nHPV test. This suggests that most women are finding out about HPV only \nafter experiencing a negative consequence.\n  As these numbers show, the failure of CDC and FDA to enact the HPV/\ncervical cancer education and prevention law has had real \nconsequences--a hidden epidemic that claims thousands of lives every \nyear and affects tens of millions of others.\n  It is unacceptable that federal health agencies have abdicated their \nresponsibility and missions and intentionally ignored the law and, in \nso doing, placed the health and lives of millions in jeopardy.\n  Today the Senate has passed another bill, the Gynecologic Cancer \nEducation and Awareness Act, or ``Johanna's Law,'' which will again \ndirect CDC and FDA to educate the public about cervical cancer as well \nas other forms of gynecological cancer.\n  I would like to recognize Senator Arlen Specter, Congressman Darrell \nIssa, cancer survivor Fran Drescher, and the countless other activists \nwho are cancer survivors themselves or have a loved one who has been \ndiagnosed with gynecological cancer who have championed this bill \nthrough Congress.\n  It is an unfortunate statement that this bill is even necessary. It \nis a recognition that federal health agencies have failed to \neffectively carry out their missions.\n  It was my concern that the same agencies entrusted with enacting this \nbill would ignore it in the same manner that the law Congress passed in \n2000 has been ignored. That would mean that the dedication and hard \nwork of the activists and survivors who supported this bill was for \nnothing.\n  When I voiced these concerns, Senator Specter agreed to amend the \nbill language to include a date certain that the cancer education \nactivities that both this bill and the current law require. This \nassures that the law and the epidemic of gynecological and cervical \ncancer can no longer be ignored by federal agencies.\n  If the CDC and the FDA do not enact the provisions of this bill and \nthe existing law--317P of the Public Health Service Act--by March 1, \n2008, the Department of Health and Human Services is required to submit \nto Congress a ``a detailed description of all actions\n\n[[Page S11572]]\n\ntaken'' to bring the Department into compliance every three months \nuntil the law has been fully enacted.\n  I fully expect that these requirements will compel CDC and FDA to \nenact these important laws and the Department will not deliver ``the \ndog ate my homework'' excuses. Laws, after all, are not optional for \ncitizens, for members of Congress or even for government agencies and \nbureaucrats.\n  Again, I am pleased that the Senate is directing federal health \nagencies to do their part to help educate and prevent gynecological and \ncervical cancer and that this time we will hold them accountable to \nensure that not another one of our sisters, daughters, mothers, or \nfriends falls victim to this silent epidemic.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be \nagreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be \nprinted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 3248, which was received from the House. I ask \nunanimous consent there now be up to 60 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between Senators Enzi and Coburn or their designees with no \namendments in order, and that following the use or yielding back of the \ntime the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3248) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to establish a program to assist family caregivers in \n     accessing affordable and high-quality respite care, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief comments. \nThen there will be others who will join me and Senator Coburn as well.\n  Currently there are over 40 million caregivers in the United States \nproviding informal care or support to a disabled elderly relative. This \nrepresents about one out of every five homes in the United States. The \nLifespan Respite Care Act would help these caregivers by authorizing \ncompetitive grants to aging and disability resource centers in \ncollaboration with State respite coalitions and organizations. That \nwould make quality respite care accessible to family caregivers \nregardless of age or disability.\n  Respite care provides family caregivers with the time to maintain \ntheir own health, bolster family stability, and keep marriages intact. \nIt also allows family caregivers to avoid or delay police intervention \nand nursing home or foster care placements.\n  Over 180 national and State organizations have endorsed this \nimportant legislation, including the Alzheimer's Association, the MS \nSociety, Easter Seals, Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, the ALS \nAssociation, and the National Patient Advocate Foundation, to mention \nbut a few.\n  The House of Representatives passed the Lifespan Respite Act by voice \nvote without objection on December 5, 2006. In the Senate, a similar \nversion passed unanimously in 2003 and has twice passed the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee in previous Congresses. The \nbill has strong bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  I thank my good colleague, Senator Warner, for his leadership and \nwork on this important legislation during this Congress and previous \nCongresses. It was his bill that we moved through the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee. Without his perseverance we \nwould not be here today to pass this bill and send it to the President \nfor his signature.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Clinton, the cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation, who has worked diligently on it.\n  I respectfully ask my Senate colleagues to approve this legislation \nand send it to the President to be signed into law.\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Lifespan \nRespite Care Act.\n  I have long been a major supporter of providing community-based \nrespite care services for family caregivers of children and adults with \nspecial needs. In fact, as the lead Republican sponsor of the Senate \nbill for several years, I am pleased that in previous years the bill \nhas been approved by the HELP Committee twice and by the full Senate \nonce.\n  This legislation was first brought to my attention by a number of \nVirginians suffering from ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, and \nby their family caregivers. The Lifespan Respite Care bill is important \nbecause diseases such as ALS, MS, Alzheimer's, cancer, and others \nafflict far too many Americans.\n  While substantial investments have been made to help find cures for \nthese diseases, we all know that until cured, these diseases will \ncontinue to have a substantial effect on far more people than the \nindividuals who are diagnosed with them. ALS, MS, Alzheimers, and other \ndiseases all have a tremendous impact on the family and particularly on \nfamily members who, out of love and compassion, take care of their \nloved ones who are terminally ill.\n  Serving as a family caregiver, though, often results in substantial \nemotional, physical, and financial hardship. It can take a tremendous \ntoll on the family. Respite care services can provide assistance.\n  Currently, the Federal Government does provide some respite care \nassistance to some family caregivers. However, these programs are \ndirected primarily at lower-income populations and at family caregivers \nof older Americans. Thus, existing programs of respite care are \ninsufficient to meet the need. This legislation is intended to fill the \ngap.\n  This important legislation will authorize competitive grants to Aging \nand Disability Resource Centers in collaboration with a public or \nprivate nonprofit State respite coalition to make quality respite \navailable and accessible to family caregivers, regardless of age or \ndisability.\n  In so doing, this bill will be a win-win-win for everybody involved. \nPatients will be able to receive care in the home from loving, caring \nfamily members rather than in a nursing home. Family members will be \neven further encouraged to serve as a family caregiver knowing that \nservices will be available to assist them. And, finally, the Federal \nGovernment and our health care system will recognize fiscal savings \nas--more care will be given in the home by a family member rather than \nin the more costly nursing home setting. As we all know, given the \naging baby boomer generation, the cost of Medicaid nursing home care is \nexpected to be a primary reason of increased healthcare costs in the \nyears to come. The Lifespan Respite Care bill is one step in the right \ndirection towards controlling these costs.\n  I would like to thank Republican Congressman Mike Ferguson of New \nJersey for his work and dedication to this cause. He has been a \nchampion on this issue for years and recognizes its importance based on \nhis very personal experience, as he witnessed his father serve as a \nfamily caregiver. I would also like to thank the National Respite Care \nCoalition and its Chair, Jill Kagan, who has worked tirelessly on \nbehalf of the Nation's family caregivers on this issue.\n  I also thank Senator Snowe, Senator Enzi, and Senator Gregg for their \nsupport. Finally, I thank Senator Clinton and her professional staff \nfor partnering with me and my staff for the past 5 years on this \nimportant legislation.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1245, \nthe Gynecologic Cancer Education and Awareness Act, better known as \nJohanna's Law. This bill needs to be signed into law as quickly as \npossible.\n  Johanna's Law creates a national public awareness campaign to \nincrease the knowledge of both women and their health care providers \nconcerning gynecologic cancers. This national campaign will include \nwritten materials for the public on gynecologic cancers and public \nservice announcements to encourage women to discuss with their \nphysicians their risks of\n\n[[Page S11574]]\n\ngynecologic cancers. In addition, women will be directed on where to \nget additional information on the early warning signs and risk factors \nassociated with gynecologic cancers.\n  The legislation also requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, to submit a report to Congress on the past and present \nactivities of the agency to increase awareness on all cancers, \nincluding gynecologic cancers. The report also would include \ninformation on what HHS is doing to educate health care professionals \non these cancers. Once this report is submitted to Congress, the \nSecretary of HHS is required to develop and submit a strategy for \nimproving efforts to increase awareness and public knowledge on \ngynecologic cancers. When developing this strategy, the Secretary is \nencouraged to consult with qualified public sector groups, including \nnon-profit organizations.\n  Finally, this legislation authorizes $16.5 million to be appropriated \nfor this program from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2009.\n  I am extremely supportive of this legislation, and have worked to see \nits enactment this week.\n  Why is this bill important?\n  The stories of two very special women will answer that question. They \nhave, I believe, made a huge difference in passing this legislation.\n  The first person is Grace Warren, who handled health care issues with \ngreat skill for Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas for many years. Ms. \nWarren is one of those Hill staffers who is well known for her \ninstitutional knowledge and her professionalism. She is widely \nrespected and loved on both sides of the aisle.\n  Unfortunately, Grace's career on Capitol Hill was cut short in \nNovember 2003, when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She retired \nfrom the House of Representatives last year, and passing this \nlegislation became her passion.\n  Ms. Warren made a compelling case to both my office and the Senate \nHELP Committee on why this legislation needs to be signed into law this \nyear. While Ms. Warren believes that this bill won't do anything for \nthose women who have already been diagnosed with gynecologic cancers, \nshe recognizes that it will make a huge difference for other women \nbecause it will help educate them on the early warning signs of \ngynecological cancers, such as abdominal swelling, gastrointestinal \ndisturbances, lower back pain and abnormal bleeding.\n  The second person whom I would like to acknowledge is Ms. Fran \nDrescher who also must deserve great credit for getting this \nlegislation through the Congress. Her commitment to having this bill \nsigned into law has been very impressive to me.\n  Ms. Drescher has tirelessly visited with Members of Congress this \nentire week and will be staying in town until this legislation is \npassed by both Houses of Congress.\n  While I have known Fran for many years, it was gratifying to be \nreminded of her tremendous enthusiasm and her commitment to women's \nhealth. Ms. Drescher is extremely articulate when she is advocating for \nJohanna's law. And that is because as a cancer survivor herself, she is \nstrongly committed to educating women about awareness and early \ndetection of gynecologic cancers.\n  It was painful for me to hear her story. Over a period of 2 years, \nMs. Drescher tried to get a diagnosis for her symptoms. She saw eight \ndoctors before being told that she had uterine cancer.\n  This should never happen.\n  Ms. Drescher recognizes that women must know the early warning signs \nof all gynecologic cancers and which tests are available because women \ncannot assume that these tests will be offered to them.\n  In addition, she is the author of the book Cancer Schmancer which \ndiscusses how she beat uterine cancer. Her dedication and commitment \nhave made a tremendous difference and we all greatly appreciate her \nefforts.\n  Both Ms. Warren and Ms. Drescher are truly amazing women who have \nshown a selfless dedication to making a difference in the lives of \nothers.\n  It is for Grace Warren, and Fran Drescher, and the many, many other \nwomen who will be challenged by gynecological cancers that we must pass \nthis legislation.\n  I strongly support this bill because I want women and their health \ncare providers all to be educated about the early warning signs of \nthese cancers.\n  I want a screening test to be developed so that it will be easier to \ndiagnose gynecological cancers in the early stages of the disease.\n  I am tired of women having limited health care options because of \nlate stage diagnosis. This must change.\n  But, I am hopeful that we can start to make a difference in the lives \nof all women the minute that this bill is signed into law. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Johanna's Law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud that we are finally sending \nthe Lifespan Respite Care Act to the President for his signature. After \n4 years of bipartisan efforts, we are delivering a great victory for \nmillions of American families providing care to a parent, child, or \nloved one.\n  Thank you to Senator Snowe who was the first lead Republican on the \nlegislation and has been a champion for this bill and family \ncaregivers.\n  Thank you to Senator Warner for his efforts on the bill. Your \nleadership will make a difference in the lives of so many American \nfamilies.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Representatives Mike Ferguson as \nthe primary sponsor of the House bill as well as Congressman Langevin. \nWe would not be on the verge of enacting this bill without their work.\n  Deep appreciation and thanks to the Lifespan Respite Task Force, a \ncoalition of 180 national, state, and local organizations under the \ndirection of the National Respite Coalition. A special thank you to \nJill Kagan of the National Respite Coalition for her leadership and \ninvaluable assistance.\n  Today's passage represents a tremendous win: for ailing seniors, \nchildren, and loved ones being cared for at home; for family members \nproviding a time-consuming, emotionally exhausting, and physically \ndemanding labor of love; for our health care system; for our values; \nand for decisions based on evidence, not ideology.\n  Each year, 44 million Americans care for an adult family member who \nhas a chronic illness or disability. Almost 4 million Americans with \ndevelopmental disabilities, of all ages, live at home with their \nfamilies.\n  These are our friends, neighbors, coworkers, loved ones; their work \nrepresents real struggle and hardship; extraordinary acts of love and \ngenerosity that we have a duty to honor and support.\n  This legislation will expand and enhance access to respite care \nservices to provide support and relief to these families providing \ncare; to help ailing loved ones stay in their homes longer; and to \ncontrol health care costs as respite care allows families to postpone \nor prevent expensive hospitalization and nursing care.\n  Today, the fastest growing illnesses in our country are chronic \nillnesses. And our health care system--already burdened by rising \ncosts, aging infrastructure, a growing population of elderly, and \nupside-down incentives--is struggling to adapt systems designed to \nprovide acute and immediate care.\n  Families have stepped into this breach. Family caregivers provide 80 \npercent of all long-term care in the U.S.--work that is virtually \nalways unpaid but valued at more than $300 billion annually. That is \nmore than the entire amount we spent on Medicare in 2004.\n  Today, we are sending a message to family caregivers: through \nextraordinary sacrifice, in a system plagued by problems, you are part \nof the solution--and today, finally, Congress is part of the solution, \ntoo.\n  Because of their responsibilities at home, studies have shown us that \nit is much more difficult for caregivers to find and maintain jobs. \nMany caregiving families are struggling to stay afloat. The cost to \nbusinesses is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, including \nthe cost for employees who leave jobs due to overwhelming \nresponsibilities at home.\n  This labor of love often results in substantial physical and \npsychological hardship. Research suggests that caregivers often put \ntheir own health and well-being at risk while assisting loved ones. \nMany caregivers are exhausted and are more prone to illness themselves. \nOne study found that caregivers\n\n[[Page S11575]]\n\nare 51 percent more likely to experience sleeplessness and 61 percent \nmore likely to experience depression.\n  Caregiving stress can even lead to marital discord and divorce.\n  Often, this incredible struggle--with little support despite the \nheroic efforts of the organizations advocating for and providing \nrespite care--leads to more costly out-of-home placements as a family's \nonly alternative.\n  Across our country quality respite care remains hard to find. Where \ncommunity respite care services do exist, there are often long waiting \nlists. And until the Lifespan Respite Care Act, no Federal plan has \nfocused on respite care to coordinate among disparate and fragmented \nservices.\n  Now, after years of work on both sides of the aisle and between the \nSenate and House, we are finally going to begin meeting the growing \nneeds of family caregivers.\n  Respite care provides some much needed relief--for a few hours or a \nfew days--from the daily demands of caregiving, which are vast. And we \nknow respite care works.\n  In one study, 88 percent of caregivers said that respite care allowed \nloved ones to remain at home.\n  Nearly 100 percent believed respite care made them better caregivers \nand helped them manage the stress of this incredible responsibility and \n80 percent even said respite care helped their marriages.\n  This act is about real family values and it is exactly what we should \nbe doing in this chamber--no partisanship; understanding hardships and \ntaking steps to help; common sense solutions that put families in \ncharge, that provide the tools to improve their own lives and honor \ntheir loved ones, that serve our health care system and our values.\n  Families have stepped into the breach--and now with the Lifespan \nRespite Care Act, Congress is sending these families a lifeline.\n  This legislation will expand access to respite care; improve local \ncoordination of services; and help families find out about what is \navailable and how to get the care they need.\n  This legislation will make respite services equally available to all \nage groups and prioritize those with special needs who do not qualify \nfor any other respite services or who cannot find appropriate quality \nrespite care in their communities.\n  It is critical that HHS ensures that the funds provided by this act \nare used by State agencies and ADRCs--which to date have primarily \nserved the aging population--to serve all age groups and disability \ncategories equally and without preference and without waiting periods \nor a phase in of age specific groups.\n  This legislation will also facilitate a coordinated approach at the \nFederal level. To ensure this critical component and maximize our \ninvestment, the grantees selected to implement Lifespan programs must \nbe able to demonstrate unequivocally that they are working \ncollaboratively at every level--with agencies in HHS that have respite \nresources, including the Administration on Aging, the Maternal and \nChild Health Bureau, other public health programs in the Health \nResources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Administration, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, the \nAdministration on Developmental Disabilities, and the Administration on \nChildren and Families.\n  But improving the services at the local, State, and Federal levels is \nnot enough. All family caregivers, regardless of the age, disability, \nor chronic condition of their loved ones, should be able to access \ninformation on how and where to find a respite provider that meets \ntheir needs and on how to pay for services. The lifespan respite \nprogram grantees will identify all the current respite funding streams \nin the State and assist a family in determining, their eligibility for \nany existing private, State or federally funded respite program. If \nthat family does not qualify for any existing services, the lifespan \nrespite program may use its funds to help families pay for respite. No \nfamily should struggle to obtain information on how or where to find or \npay for respite care.\n  I thank chairman Senator Enzi for his leadership on the HELP \nCommittee. It has been a privilege serving under him over these last \nseveral years, and I am very grateful to him for pushing forward a very \npositive agenda for the people of our country.\n  I am very proud that we are finally able to reach agreement on the \nLifespan Respite Care Act and send it to the President for his \nsignature. This has been a bipartisan effort from the very beginning. I \nam grateful to Senator Warner who has made a real difference in his \nleadership on behalf of this bill. I am grateful to Senator Snowe who \nwas the first lead Republican on this legislation and has been a \nchampion. I want to express my appreciation to Representative Mike \nFerguson as the primary sponsor of the House bill, as well as \nCongressman Jim Langevin. We would not be here on the verge of enacting \nthis bill without their work.\n  Deep appreciation and thanks is due to the Lifespan Respite Task \nForce, a coalition of 180 national, State, and local organizations \nunder the leadership and direction of the National Respite Coalition. A \nspecial thanks to Jill Kagan of the National Respite Coalition for her \nleadership and invaluable assistance.\n  As Senator Enzi said, this bill represents a tremendous \nacknowledgment of the families who are caring for their loved ones--for \nfailing seniors, for children with disabilities, for a spouse who has \nbeen incapacitated by accident or chronic condition. Family members \nprovide most of the support and the time-consuming physical labor and \nthe emotionally exhausting input that really makes it possible to keep \npeople at home.\n  You know, each year 44 million Americans care for an adult family \nmember who has a chronic illness or disability. Almost 4 million \nAmericans with developmental disabilities of all ages live at home with \ntheir families. Senator Coburn and I were talking earlier today--this \nis such a human issue that affects the lives and the fortunes and the \nfeelings of so many of our fellow Americans.\n  What this legislation does is to expand and enhance access to respite \ncare services. What are those for? Those are to give that wife who is \ncaring for her ailing husband a few hours off a week. Those are for \nthat father who devotes himself to his child with a disability, to have \nsomeplace to go to get a little bit of respite while his child is still \nwell cared for.\n  Family caregivers provide 80 percent of all long-term care in the \nUnited States. But as Senator Coburn and I were discussing, you don't \nget real financial help unless you put your loved one in a nursing \nhome. There is something wrong with that. That doesn't reflect our \ndeepest values. The work that our loved ones do for all of us is unpaid \nbut valued at more than $300 billion a year. That is more than the \nentire amount of money we spent on Medicare in 2004.\n  Today our Congress is sending a message to family caregivers: We \nrecognize and we honor your commitment and in many instances your \nsacrifice. We know that because of this care many caregivers cannot \nkeep their jobs.\n  It becomes too much of a burden. They struggle to stay afloat. They \nstart selling off assets. This is a labor of love that often undermines \nthe health of the very people who are providing it.\n  We found that many caregivers suffer physical symptoms, \nsleeplessness, depression. They feel like they are all alone.\n  This incredible struggle is one that we will see more and more of in \nour country because of our aging population. I am grateful that we are \ngoing to be passing this legislation and giving some assistance to \nthese courageous men and women, these parents, these children, these \ngrandparents, these spouses.\n  I hope, also, that in the new Congress we will address something else \nI talked to Senator Coburn about--that we can address this issue of \ncaregiving, and particularly how to rearrange the incentives within our \nhealth care system, particularly through Medicaid, where 80 percent of \nthe money is spent on 20 percent of the recipients; and that is mostly \nfor long-term nursing care at the end of life. Many people would rather \nbe home or rather be in a less-restrictive setting. If this is a \nstatement of our concern, we need to follow that up.\n\n[[Page S11576]]\n\n  This will provide what has been missing, improved coordination at the \nlocal level of services, helping families understand more about how to \nshoulder these burdens.\n  It is critical that Health and Human Services ensure that we serve \nall age groups, all disability categories, without preference, and that \nwe begin to not just honor the love that we see and the sacrifices that \nare too often accompanying it but really provide some support.\n  I am deeply appreciative of all who have worked over the last year to \nmake this legislation possible. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to address these \nlong-term needs and address how to help people stay at home, how to \nsupport their families who are doing the most important work there is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi for the opportunity \nto speak today on this critical piece of legislation, as well as to \ncommend the Senator from New York, Senator Clinton, for her advocacy \nand leadership on this most critical issue which is paramount to \nmillions of families across this country, and to Senator Warner, who \nhas also been a leading advocate and champion of this legislation. I \ncertainly want to commend them both for making sure this legislation is \ncoming to the forefront of the Congress in the final days and which, \nultimately, will lead to its passage.\n  I, also, want to express my commendations to the sponsor in the House \nof Representatives, Congressman Mike Ferguson, because this is clearly \na very critical issue. He understands firsthand, personally, from his \nown family circumstances, how important care giving and respite \nservices are for caregivers and how it is so essential and vital to our \nNation's families.\n  I know how important this is. In fact, I introduced the first \nlegislation recognizing National Family Caregivers Week back in 1986. \nIt is more than 20 years that I have been involved in such endeavors. \nThere is no question--and it has been irrefutable across this country--\nabout the necessity of providing more support to those who provide \nsupport to families, to ailing family members. The fact is the need is \nmore than $300 billion a year. We, also, know that it takes a \ntremendous toll on families to provide that care day in and day out.\n  That is why I think we do have a Federal responsibility and \nobligation to ensure that we can coalesce those resources that can make \nit easier and to mitigate the impact on those family members who are \nproviding around-the-clock care.\n  When I first became involved in this issue in the House more than 20 \nyears ago, I took it upon myself to visit homes throughout my \ncongressional district in the State of Maine. What I saw was \nincredible. I saw 80-year-olds taking care of 80-year-olds, doing the \nmost incredible things, medically and otherwise, to provide round-the-\nclock care to their ailing family members. It was clear to me then that \nwe needed to do more to provide the respite support for family members \nso they can have the ability to have support outside the family which \nis critical for them, so they can continue to keep their ailing family \nmember at home but at the same time having the kind of care which is so \nessential to help them get better.\n  That is what this is all about. It is helping those who need our \nhelp. Certainly, to have the support of the type of facilities and \nservices that exist in a particular community which can address their \nneeds and who they can turn to for advice is absolutely instrumental. \nIt, also, leads to a higher quality of life for many because they can \nbe at home, where they can be provided home care. They can be at home \nand get the kind of support that otherwise would be necessary if they \nhad been institutionalized or hospitalized.\n  In addition, such care can also result in substantial cost savings to \nthe family, to the Government, and to the community, in fact.\n  I think it is in our national interest to provide these benefits. I \nthink, frankly, the support of such care has been all too limited. This \nis long overdue. That is why I commend Senator Clinton and Senator \nWarner and some others who have given their support to this type of \ninitiative.\n\n  We, clearly, have a Federal obligation and responsibility to focus on \nthe kind of respite care that is so essential for allowing people to \ntake care of their ailing family members in a home setting. It \ncertainly eases and mitigates the impact on the Federal costs, whether \nit is on Medicaid or Medicare. It can save families thousands of \ndollars a year.\n  This is something that is in our national interest. I think it is \nalso crucial that we ease the burden of this responsibility which is \nplaced on caregivers as well. It is critical that they have access to \nbetter information on services and be able to provide it. They are \nheroes in every sense of the word.\n  We think about life expectancy today and how many years caregiving \nwill be provided by the American family. It can be 17 years, at the \nminimum, for an elderly parent. I think it gives a dimension to the \nissue and the problems that are at stake if we fail to provide the kind \nof support which is necessary.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation, the Refundable Dependent \nCare Tax Credit. For example, I think we should provide the type of \nincentives and support to families that enables them to take care of \ntheir loved ones at home.\n  When I first visited homes where people were providing this kind of \ncare, I was absolutely astonished at the level of care these \nindividuals were providing their family members. It occurred to me \nthen, and it is one that has remained with me ever since, that we have \nto do everything conceivably possible to amass the resources and the \nsupport for these family caregivers.\n  When you think of the dimensions of the problem, when you think about \nthe demographics in America and the life expectancy, it is all the more \ncrucial that the Federal Government play a role. That is exactly what \nthis legislation is all about. It will provide the kind of resources \nthat are going to be important, it will provide grant support, it will \nincrease the availability of appropriately trained respite care \nproviders and volunteers--again, another aspect to the entire spectrum \nof resources I think we need to provide these families who are \nproviding the caregiving support.\n  Frankly, we need to have more respite care providers. It eases the \nburden on these family members so they can do other things in the day, \nwhat is required in daily living, that they have the ability to know \nthey can fall back on the type of support which will provide the \ncontinuity of care and the level of care their family members certainly \ndeserve. I think this legislation goes a long way in providing that \nkind of support and eases the burden on those family members who are so \ndevoted to their loved ones.\n  I think, frankly, we will have to do more. That is why, as we are \nlooking at a tax incentive in the overall tax package, we have to give \nsome review to the notion of having a tax credit that is refundable for \nproviding this kind of dependent care. I think it is going to be a wave \nof the future, frankly, given the dimensions of this problem which is \ncertainly lurking on the horizon.\n  I want to, again, commend Senator Clinton for her leadership in \nmaking this possible and to Senator Warner and, of course, Congressman \nFerguson, in the House, and all those who supported it--and Chairman \nEnzi, as well, for his leadership in making sure that the passage of \nthis legislation will become a reality when you consider I think the \nenormity and the magnitude of the care and support that it will give to \nfamilies who most deserve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I was asked to allow this bill to come up \nat this late hour in the Congress. This bill is going to pass. The \ngoals of this bill are very worthy. As a practicing physician, and \nknowing the families whom I take care of and the family members they \nhave, I know the burden that is placed on multitudes of people. When \nthey do the better thing of keeping their loved ones in their own \nhomes, in terms of quality of life, I have no argument with the intent \nand background of what is trying to be accomplished. But I want to make \nthree points.\n\n[[Page S11577]]\n\n  One is how this place operates. What we do at the end of the session \nis we try to run hundreds of bills through that very few people have \nthoroughly looked at, that drives all sorts of new spending, that does \nnot get the privilege of the debate that the American people deserve on \nthe priorities of how we spend their money. That needs to change. It is \na terrible way to govern. It is inappropriate in the way we do it. It \nhas more to do with the rules that we operate the Senate under than \nanything else. That ought to be changed. There is no question I am \nknown for my desire to try to get our fiscal house in order. For \nexample, this bill is great, but what the American people are never \ngoing to ask out of the almost $350 million that this bill authorizes, \nwhere is the money going to come from to pay for it? What priority is \ngoing to be decreased so that priority can be increased?\n  We have in the Social Security account a surplus this year. We have a \n$344 billion deficit. A lot of my friends would say that reflects the \nfact that we need to have pay-go and increase taxes. But during the \nlast 2 years, I have held 49 hearings in the Federal Financial \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, where we have \nidentified a pure $100 billion worth of waste, fraud or duplication in \nthis Government, and no one wants to change that. It is easy for us to \ncome out here and spend $300 million on a new program. But it is very \nhard for us to get together and do the hard work of eliminating the \nfraud, waste, and duplication.\n  There are two other programs that have money in them available for \nthis, not the correct way, and not done as good as this bill does it. \nWe haven't done anything in this bill to change those programs to \nredirect any of that money through. So now we are going to have three \nprograms that have an impact in this area. Representative Ferguson has \ndone a great job of bringing this up. But unless we change the culture \nof how we operate, we are going to enhance what we call the birth tax. \nWhen you are born today in this country, counting the unfunded \nliabilities for Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, you are born \nhaving liabilities of $435,000 on you the day you are born. We are \nadding a little bit to that. We are adding a little bit more and a \nlittle bit more.\n  Until we get together and say we are going to review this Government \nand get rid of the waste, fraud, and abuse, we are going to care as \nmuch about the person who is born today as we care about those who need \nsome respite care, legitimate rest from the care of parents of those \npeople they love, we will do a great disservice. We are doing a great \ndisservice in this country.\n  Two weekends ago, I delivered a 9 pound 4 ounce baby to a woman whom \nI had delivered a baby to before. I had very well controlled her \ngestational diabetes. She had delivered a 9-pound baby before that. I \nthought about the 2\\1/2\\ minutes it took me, from the time I decided I \ncouldn't deliver a baby in a normal way for her. It took me 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes from the time of that crunch when there was no way to get a \nbaby out, with a heartbeat of 50 beats per minute--which is about 40 \npercent of what it should be--we have a baby in trouble; it took me \nabout 2\\1/2\\ minutes to go around and get that baby out of that momma. \nWe saved that baby's life.\n\n  Now, the corollary is, I had warning signals. I had indications that \nsaid things aren't going right. And this body, this Congress, this \nGovernment is not paying attention to the warning signals. The baby is \ngoing to die. Our country is going to drown in debt.\n  The processes by which we operate include not paying attention to the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse and not making the hard choices on priorities, \nnot offsetting, not deauthorizing something else that is not working \nwhere there are billions of things that are not working, and adding \nanother problem. We are adding to that.\n  As a Senate, we are not ill-intentioned; we just are not paying \nattention to the warning signs. We are not paying attention to the \nfetal monitor of our country and the future for the next generations. \nIt is just as laudable to care as much about the next two or three \ngenerations that come down the road as we care for those who need our \nhelp today, except this bill doesn't do that.\n  This bill is going to go by voice vote--and I have allowed it; I will \nnot even vote against it--but I wanted this time to make this \nstatement.\n  What will follow this bill today is a tragedy. We are going to spend \nanother $17.5 billion on the tax-extender package that is getting ready \nto come through this place. We are going to pick up the bills mining \ncompanies owe and we are going to charge that to the rest of the people \nin this country. We are going to overspend on lots of things. We are \nnot going to cut doctor's fees--and I am a doctor--but we are not going \nto pay for it. We are going to pay for it through gimmicks, and we are \ngoing to tell everybody that we are doing great things. In fact, we are \nbeing dishonest.\n  There are two cultural problems that have to change: We have to quit \nauthorizing new programs unless we deauthorize other programs, and we \nhave to reach across the aisle and say that we need to review \neverything we have, and whatever is duplicative, let's get rid of it \nand save these costs. If one does not work as well, put the money in \nthe other and save the money.\n  Let's get rid of the fraud. We are paying out $38 billion a year to \nthings we should not be paying for right now, and that is an \nunderestimate because we have only looked at 60 percent of the \nGovernment in terms of improper payments. We still have a law that is \nnot being followed by 40 percent of the agencies. They are not \nreporting their improper payments. We had a Pentagon that paid $6 \nbillion in the last 5 years for contractors for performance bonuses, \nand they did not come close to reaching the performance basis for the \nbonus. That is our fault. That is us. We are charged with the \nresponsibility of doing what is necessary.\n  The final point I wish to make is that if we keep nibbling around the \nedges on health care, we are going to find ourself in the biggest jam \nin the world. We have two choices: We are going to either have \ngovernment-run health care or we are going to control the costs by \nbasically allocating it at end of life and telling people what they \ncannot have. That is how most other countries do it. Or we will fix \nhealth care. We spend 16.3 percent of our GDP on health care, and $2.2 \ntrillion is what we will have spent at the end of this year. That is 16 \npercent of our GDP. The closest country in the world spends 11 percent \nof GDP on their health care, and they don't have a government-run \nhealth care program.\n  Fully $1 out of every $3 we spend on health care today does not go to \nhelp somebody get well or keep them healthy. Our prevention programs, \nwhich is the key to our success in solving our health care problems, \nare abysmal. They are wasteful. They are not effective. We talk about \ndiabetes, we talk about obesity, but we are inept in any type of \nconsensus as to where we can make a difference in prevention. We have \nto address that issue, and I believe this is a fix around the edge. We \nneed a comprehensive fix and a look at health care in America. We need \nto do it knowing the motivation.\n  Most people are surprised to learn that out of that $2.2 billion we \nspend on health care every year, $152 million is spent on things that \nnobody needs except providers to protect themselves from lawsuits. Now, \nwe need a good trial bar. We need to be held accountable. But it has \ngotten so far out of hand that we are adding to the birth tax.\n  I beg my colleagues and the American people who are listening to \nthis, let's get our act together. Let's start not just authorizing, \nlet's deauthorize before we authorize. Let's fix health care. Let's do \noversight in a way that saves money for the future. If we have \neliminated the waste, we have eliminated the fraud, we have eliminated \nthe duplication in this Government, we have to go to the American \npeople and say: Shouldn't we pay a little more taxes now rather than \nask for this birth tax?\n  Remember, the birth tax is over $400,000 per baby right now. Every \nbaby I deliver, the first thing I see is a beautiful young child, and \nthen in the back of my mind I wonder, how are you ever going to get out \nof this mess we have left you?\n  I appreciate the concern and the intent of those supporting this \nbill. This bill has come to the Senate in the\n\n[[Page S11578]]\n\nwrong way. This bill should have had its authorization offset. This \nbill does address a very real need, but there are a lot of very real \nneeds out there that we need to do that we cannot do and we cannot fund \nbecause we are not doing our job.\n  Our country is at a crossroad. The fetal monitoring alarm is on. The \nbaby's heartbeat is low. It is time to do what is necessary. The debt \nburden cannot be swallowed, the unfunded liabilities cannot be handled. \nIt is up to us to change that. Let's lower that birth tax. Let's get \nrid of that. Let's work together to do the things we can do to lessen \nthat impact on the generations to come.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am not aware of anyone on our side who wishes to speak.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, for his concise and \nimportant comments, the warning signs he has given. I congratulate him \nfor the times he has already constrained spending. He mentioned the \npreventive care doctors take. Maybe his comments have already resulted \nin people taking on a little bit more regarding preventive care. There \nis a lot more that can and should be done. I urge Members to review his \nwords.\n  I thank the Senator for the cooperation on different bills as they \nhave gone through and made changes.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on the third reading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 3248) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11578-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about a piece of \nlegislation that is not getting completed, and I will do that in a \nmoment.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming and others for the work they have \njust completed with respect to the issue of family care and family \nsupport. It is a very important piece of legislation.\n  I listened to my colleague from Oklahoma talk about a number of \nimportant issues.\n  Regarding the issue of health care, clearly we have to deal with the \nhealth care issue. He mentioned the amount of money spent on health \ncare. It is true, we spend more money per person than anybody in the \nworld, by far. And by the way, we rank 48th in life expectancy. Yes, \n48th--not 20th or 2nd but 48th in life expectancy, a country which \nspends far more than any other country per person in the world on \nhealth care. We have a lot to do on health care.\n  With respect to fiscal policy, my colleague raises an important point \nabout things that come to the Senate--proposals, ideas--that are not \npaid for. He raises an important point. They should be paid for.\n  The largest area of that kind of expenditure, by the way, in recent \nyears, has come at the request of the President. Nearly $400 billion, \nnow, is the cost for the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the fight \nagainst terrorism. None of it is paid for. We have sent America's sons \nand daughters to war, wearing America's uniform, and essentially said \nto them: By the way, go fight; when you come back, you can pay the \nbills because the President has not asked and this Congress has not had \nthe courage to decide we ought to pay for that which we spend. That \ndoes need to change.\n  I noticed this morning in the Washington Post an article by a man \nnamed Samuelson, apparently an economist. I have read some of what he \nhas said over the years. He talks about the value of the dollar \nslipping, decreasing, and its consequences on our country. He described \nall the reasons except the real reason. The real reason our dollar has \ndecreased in value is we have an unsustainable trade deficit of $800 \nbillion a year, $2 billion a day, day after day after day. That is \nunsustainable and will, without question, jeopardize this country's \nfuture. It will have a profound influence on the value of the dollar \nwith respect to the value of our currency. That will have an influence \non virtually everything else in this country.\n  So we have to get our hands around this issue of international trade \nand start demanding and insisting on fair trade, start deciding with \nour trading partners--China and other countries, Japan, South Korea, \nEurope--that we are not going to allow these dramatic trade imbalances \nto occur. They will have dramatic impact on this country's economic \nfuture. I will have more to say about that at another time.\n  Because there was discussion about health care in the Senate, I \nwanted to speak about something that isn't getting done today, and it \nis a real tragedy. I use the word ``tragedy'' because it is the right \nword to use about this issue.\n  Senator John McCain and I have worked as chairman and vice chairman \nof the Indian Affairs Committee all of this session of the Congress to \ntry to pass a piece of legislation called the reauthorization of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. We come to the end of the session \nwithout progress, unfortunately.\n  Senator McCain has done great work on this issue. My other \ncolleagues--I notice my colleague from Wyoming, who is in the Chamber--\nhave worked with us on this issue. The Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct should have been done, should have been passed. We come to the end \nof another session of the Congress and it is not getting done. There is \na reason for that. We have written legislation that is bipartisan, and \nday after day after day, month after month, the agencies and the \nadministration have objected.\n  Let me describe what we face with respect to Indian health care. A \ngood many American Indians, Native Americans, live in Third World \nconditions. I have spoken about it many times on the floor of the \nSenate. They live in Third World conditions inside this country. I have \nspoken about the grandmother who lay down in this country on a cot in a \nhouse and froze to death. It is in this country. Read that story and \nthen ask yourself: What backward Third World country did that occur in? \nIt occurred in this country.\n  The fact is, whether it is health care or housing or education, we \nface a bona fide crisis on Indian reservations. We have a \nresponsibility, what is called a trust responsibility, for Indian \nhealth care. We spend twice as much per person as a country to provide \nhealth care for Federal prisoners as we do for Native Americans for \nwhom we have a trust responsibility. They get half the support we \nprovide to Federal prisoners for health care.\n  Talk to the Indian Health Service. They will not give you this number \nwillingly, but talk to them long enough and they will tell you, \nfinally, that 40 percent of the health care needs of Native Americans \nliving on Indian reservations is unmet. That is health care rationing.\n  Now, let me describe, if I might, just the consequences of that \nrationing, perhaps, by telling you of some real people. We had a tribal \nchairman who testified before our committee who said: On our \nreservation it is widely known, don't get sick after June first, \nbecause after June first, there is no more contract health money. And \nif you get sick after June first and show up at a hospital, and your \nproblem is not ``life or limb,'' then you're not going to be treated, \nyou're not going to be paid for.\n\n[[Page S11579]]\n\n  So let me describe some of these things.\n  An 80-year-old American Indian elder, a diabetic, living on an Indian \nreservation, fell while tending to her garden, and she broke her leg in \ntwo places. The break was so severe there was a bone sticking out of \nher ankle. She went to the hospital. She was sent home with \npainkillers. She went to a second hospital and was told the condition \nwas not priority 1--not priority 1: which is ``life or limb''--and \ntherefore she was not able to get care at the second hospital. She went \nto the third hospital--limped in--and finally received some care at the \nthird hospital, with a bone protruding from her leg.\n  Now, what is ``life or limb''? That is under what is called contract \ncare. It means that if your life is not at stake, or the loss of an arm \nor leg is not at stake, you do not get the contract care. So don't get \nsick after June.\n  Another American Indian with diabetes called in for a prescription \ndrug refill for insulin, and he was told he needed to come back in and \nget some blood work done before he could get the insulin. It was 2 \nweeks before they could get him in for his blood work, so he was \nwithout insulin for 2 full weeks. As a result, this is an American \nIndian who will likely require dialysis for the rest of his life \nbecause he could not get his prescription for insulin filled on time.\n  Or a woman named Lida Bearstail. Lida told me it was all right to use \nher name. She went to a clinic because of knee pain. Her condition was \none in which the cartilage had worn away, so it was bone on bone, \nenormously painful for Lida. Bones in her knee were rubbing against \neach other with great discomfort and great personal pain.\n  When that happens to one of us, to our families, to the people who \nwork here, what is the response? You get a knee replacement--surgery, \nand replace the knee.\n  Well, what happened to Lida Bearstail? Well, she still limps. She has \ntrouble walking. Perhaps soon she will not be able to walk. Knee \nsurgery is not in her future because this is not about ``life or \nlimb,'' it is just about unbearable, agonizing pain. Again, denied, not \na priority, not ``life or limb.''\n  Ardel Hale Baker told me I could use her story as well. A couple of \nmonths ago she had very serious chest pain and she thought she was \nperhaps having a heart attack. Her blood pressure was very high. Her \nchest pain was very intense. It wouldn't quit. So she went to the \nIndian Health Service clinic. She was diagnosed as having a heart \nattack, and she needed to be sent immediately to the nearest major \nhospital. And they said: You have to go in an ambulance.\n  Well, Ardel Hale Baker said, while she was having this heart attack: \nIs there a chance I could go to the hospital in something other than an \nambulance, some method other than taking an ambulance?\n  They asked her: Why?\n  She said: Well, I'm going to get billed for the ambulance, and I \ndon't have any money.\n  If you are not ``priority 1,'' you may end up paying the bill. Your \ncredit rating is ruined. American Indian after American Indian \ndiscovers that: You are not a priority. Your credit rating is gone. And \nthe credit companies come after you.\n  In the middle of her heart attack, she asked the question: Is there \nsome other method besides an ambulance? Why? Because of cost.\n  Anyway, she arrived at the hospital. And let me tell you what \nhappened at the hospital with Ardel Hale Baker. The nursing staff was \nlifting her off the gurney from the ambulance and putting her on a \nhospital bed, and as they lifted her off the gurney, they found \nsomething taped to her leg. This woman was having a heart attack, and \nthey found a piece of paper taped to her leg. And here is what the \npaper said. It said her name: ``Hale, Ardel.''\n  And then it said:\n\n       You have received outpatient medical services. This letter \n     is to inform you your priority 1 care cannot be paid for due \n     to funding issues.\n\n  So a woman is hauled into a hospital on a gurney with a heart attack \nand a paper attached to her leg saying: ``This will not be paid for.'' \nThis kind of thing is unbelievable, and it is going on in this country \nwith respect to American Indians for whom we have a trust \nresponsibility for health care, and those needs are not being met.\n  As I indicated, Senator McCain and I have worked long and hard on \nthis legislation, only to find roadblocks every--every--part of the \nway. The Health and Human Services agency, the Justice Department, \nvirtually every agency continues to raise roadblocks even today.\n  I have come to the floor many times in this session of the Congress \nto talk about a young girl named Avis Littlewind. She is also a part of \nthis legislation. Avis Littlewind was 14 years old when she killed \nherself. It does not sound good to say that. That is what happened to \nher. She laid 90 days in a bed in a fetal position, missing school, \nseverely depressed. Then she took her life.\n  Avis Littlewind was a teenager, 14 years old, who apparently felt \nthings were so hopeless, she was so helpless, that she should take her \nlife. Her sister had taken her life 2 years prior.\n  Now, I went to that reservation. I met with the tribal chairman, I \nmet with the tribal council, I met with Avis's schoolmates, I met with \nthe relatives, to try to understand what causes this. And it is not \njust Avis Littlewind. It is not just this young girl. There has been a \ncluster of suicides, teenage suicides, on these reservations, and none \nof us really want to talk about it. But if we don't, we will not be \nable to address it.\n  Senator McCain and I held some hearings on this subject. The Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act begins to address this, as it is addressed \nin some other legislation that we have moved as well.\n  But my point is this, there are so many challenges. Do you want to go \nto a place where you can find 5,000 people and one dentist working in a \ntrailer house? Do you want to see that sort of thing? Do you want to go \nto health clinics that are not open at key times during the day, and \nlong lines when they are open? Do you want to go to places where the \nrate of diabetes is not double, triple, quadruple, but 12 times the \nnational average, and see the people who have lost their legs as a \nresult of diabetes, see the people on renal dialysis? Do you want to \ntalk to the people who drive 50, 100 miles or more to get renal \ndialysis?\n  The fact is, we have a bona fide crisis in health care on Indian \nreservations. We are not meeting that crisis. We have legislation that \nshould have been passed in previous Congresses. Senator McCain and I \nhave done everything humanly possible to get a piece of legislation \nthat would get cleared to pass this Congress, and I regret to tell you, \ndespite all the good feelings on the floor of the Senate about what is \nbeing done, frankly, I think it is a disgrace that this legislation is \nnot being done.\n  People are dying. There are young children who are not getting health \ncare who are sick and need health care. There are elders with bones \nsticking out of their legs who are told health care is not available to \nthem. There are women showing up on gurneys in hospitals with paper \ntaped to their legs saying: ``This woman is not eligible for funding \nfor health care.''\n  That ought to shame every American that it is happening. And we can \ndo something about it by passing legislation called the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act. We are not asking for everything here. We are \njust asking for the right thing.\n  Senator McCain and I have worked for a long while, and if I sound \nfrustrated, it is because this is not just some other piece of \nlegislation. This will mean that some people will die because we have \nnot fixed the health care system, and we have not addressed these \nneeds. We should not have to be reminded of this. It is our \nresponsibility. This trust responsibility for the health care for \nNative Americans belongs to us, and we ought not have to be expected to \nbe reminded of it. We ought to come to the floor of the Senate and \ninsist on it. Instead, month after month after month, we have had \nobjections, yes, in this Congress, I should say. We have had holds on \nthe legislation. We have had committees that have insisted they could \nnot move on it. We have had agencies downtown. And for dozens of \nreasons, we now come to the last day of the U.S. Congress in this \nsession, and no action, and no capability, it appears to be, of making \nprogress. And I am deeply disappointed.\n\n[[Page S11580]]\n\n  I will, of course, not give up. We will be back in January. We will \nstart again. But this is deeply disappointing to me and to others who \nhave relied on the good will of not just those in Congress but those \ndowntown in the Federal agencies to understand there is a crisis. This \nis about health care. It is about ``life and limb.'' And when you have \nthis kind of crisis, you have a responsibility to the children, to the \nelders, to others living on Indian reservations, some of whom live in \nThird World conditions. We should not be putting up with that. We \nshould reach out a hand to say there is a lot of trouble in the world--\nand we reach out a hand to try to see if we can help in other parts of \nthe world--there is plenty to do right here at home as well. I support \nreaching out to troubled spots of this world. But I believe we also \nhave a first responsibility to reach out in this country to say to \npeople who are living in abject and desperate poverty without health \ncare that we are going to solve those problems, we are going to work \nwith them.\n  I got interested in and involved in these issues a long time ago when \nI saw a picture in a paper of a young girl named Tamara. Tamara was a \n3-year-old American Indian girl living on an Indian reservation, and \nshe was placed in a foster care home. The woman who placed her in the \nfoster care home was handling 150 cases--150 cases. She did not have \nthe time or the capability to check what kind of home they were putting \nthis 3-year-old girl in. The result was, they put that girl in an \nunsafe home.\n  On a Saturday night, in a drunken party, a 3-year-old girl named \nTamara had her nose broken, her arm broken, and her hair pulled out by \nthe roots--at a drunken party in a foster home that no one had checked. \nThis 3-year-old girl suffered scars that will be with her the rest of \nher life.\n  The fact is, we understand that some of these things are happening, \nand we have a responsibility to do something about it. I did something \nabout that. There is nobody on that reservation handling that many \ncases anymore. No social worker can do that. What that child suffered \nwas our responsibility.\n  So I got involved because I saw what was going on some long while \nago. And the more I have worked on these issues, the greater I see the \nneed for us to do the right thing. Senator McCain feels exactly the \nsame way, and we have worked as hard as we can work on a bipartisan \nbasis in the Indian Affairs Committee, with the Republicans and \nDemocrats on that committee, believing that health care is a priority, \nand that our responsibility to reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act is a primary responsibility.\n  And, again, I regret that we come to the last day of the session and \nfind a circumstance where it is not going to be passed.\n  It takes no skill to oppose. I think it was Mark Twain who was once \nasked if he would engage in a debate, and he said: Of course, I would \nbe happy to engage in the debate, as long as I can take the opposing \nview.\n  They said: We haven't told you the subject of the debate.\n  He said: It doesn't matter what the subject is. Taking the opposing \nview will require no preparation.\n  That is how it is in this Chamber. It is how it is downtown in the \nagencies. It is the easiest thing in the world to oppose. It takes no \npreparation at all.\n  We come to the end of this session with enough having opposed \nprogress on the Indian Health Care Improvement Act that this will not \nbe done in this session of Congress. There will still be hope because \nwe will turn to it again in January. My hope is those who have borne \nthe responsibility of stopping this important piece of legislation will \nunderstand the consequences and decide to help us rather than hinder us \nas we try again in the next session of Congress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11580-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11580-S11581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 4047\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 664, S. 4047. I \nask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have a \nnumber of objections on our side. On behalf of at least five Members in \nthis caucus, I will be constrained to object, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to speak a moment on the \nbill, if I may.\n  The Maritime Transportation Security Act requires the Transportation \nSecurity Agency to develop a biometric security card for port workers \nthat would be used to limit access to sensitive areas within a seaport. \nTo satisfy this law, TSA is developing a transportation worker \nidentification credential--we call it TWIC--card. The law requires that \nthe Secretary issue this card to an individual requesting it, unless he \ndetermines that the individual poses a terrorism security risk or if \nthey have been convicted of treason, terrorism, sedition, or espionage.\n  To fulfill this requirement of the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct, the Department of Homeland Security has drafted regulations that \nbar certain criminals from receiving these transportation worker \nidentification credentials. Specifically, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity proposed regulations that would permanently bar from our ports \ncriminals convicted of espionage, sedition, treason, terrorism, crimes \ninvolving transportation security, improper transport of hazardous \nmaterial, unlawful use of an explosive device, murder, violations of \nthe RICO Act where one of the above crimes is a predicate act, and \nconspiracy to commit any of these crimes.\n  It would also bar recent felons, those convicted within the last 7 \nyears, or incarcerated in the last 5 years, from working in secure \nareas of U.S. ports, if they have been convicted of any of these \nfelonies: assault with intent to murder, kidnaping or hostage taking, \nrape or aggravated sexual abuse, unlawful use of a firearm, extortion, \nfraud, bribery, smuggling, immigration violations, racketeering, \nrobbery, drug dealing, arson, or conspiracy to commit any of these \ncrimes.\n  These proposed regulations were developed in consultation and \ncoordination with the Departments of Justice and Transportation to \nidentify individuals who have a propensity to engage in unlawful \nactivity, activity that places our ports at risk. Further, these \nregulations are nearly identical to the regulations that govern those \nwho have access to our airports and who are involved with transporting \nhazardous material in the United States. These prohibitions are crucial \nbecause individuals who engage in the type of unlawful activity \ndescribed in the proposed regulations have a greater likelihood to \nengage in activity that puts American ports at risk.\n  Our law enforcement officials understand this risk. They understand \nthe threat our ports face with traditional crimes, particularly \norganized crimes, when they work with terrorists. For example, just \nrecently the FBI apprehended a member of the Russian mafia attempting \nto sell missiles to an FBI agent he thought was acting as a middleman \nfor terrorists. Joseph Billy, Jr., the FBI's top counterterrorism \nofficial, recently commented that the FBI ``is continuing to look at a \nnexus'' between organized crime and terrorists, and that they ``are \nlooking at this very aggressively.''\n  The threat is not only criminals working directly with terrorists, it \nis criminals looking the other way when a suspect container comes \nthrough the port. Joseph King, a former Customs Service agent and now a \nprofessor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, outlined the \nconcern very clearly:\n\n       It's an invitation to smuggling of all kinds. Instead of \n     bringing in 50 kilograms of heroin, what would stop them from \n     bringing in five kilograms of plutonium?\n\n\n[[Page S11581]]\n\n\n  A criminal in one of our ports may think he is just helping his \nbuddies smuggle in drugs, but inadvertently he may be helping to \nsmuggle a weapon of mass destruction into the United States.\n  Earlier this year I offered an amendment to address this threat and \nensure that serious felons are kept out of our ports. My amendment \nwould have codified in statute the proposed regulations. The amendment \npassed unanimously and was included in the Senate-passed version of the \nSafe Port Act. Unfortunately, behind closed doors in the conference \ncommittee this amendment was almost completely gutted. The bill went \nfrom having language which prohibited 20 serious felonies that put our \nports at risk to a list of just four--felonies so rare as to make the \nconference report language meaningless. I was extremely dismayed to see \nthis language was stripped. I cannot understand who would oppose \nlanguage that would ban serious felons from secure areas in American \nports.\n  The ranking member of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from \nHawaii, has stated in the Congressional Record that he supported the \noriginal DeMint language. I understand the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, the Senator from Alaska, also supported the DeMint language. \nI am at a bit of a loss to conclude who in the Senate opposed this \nstrong homeland security provision. Today the Senator from North Dakota \nsaid several of his colleagues did, but we don't know who they are.\n  While there does not seem to be a Senator who is willing to admit to \nopposing the provision, the longshoremen's labor union is more than \nhappy to take credit for gutting the provision. Last month the \nInternational Longshore and Warehouse Union, in their newsletter, \nclaimed credit for killing the provision. They stated:\n\n       Congress will return after the election in a ``lame duck'' \n     session and work through part of November and December. We \n     have heard rumors that Senator DeMint is particularly angry \n     with the [union's] successful lobbying effort to strip his \n     anti-labor provision. He may attempt to amend another piece \n     of legislation, so the union will stay on guard to protect \n     its members' interests.\n\n  Apparently they have, as we have seen today by the objection to this \nvery commonsense measure. The unions are not stopping at just fighting \nlegislation that I am proposing here to keep serious felons out of our \nport workforce. They are gearing up to mount a legal battle against the \nproposed regulations as well.\n  In response to a Wall Street Journal editorial on the subject, the \nunion stated that the proposed regulations were ``double jeopardy'' and \n``unconstitutional.'' This is a clear indication that they have a legal \nchallenge in mind. It seems clear now that once the regulations become \nfinal, they are going to take the Department of Homeland Security to \ncourt and that the proposed regulations are going to be bogged down in \nlengthy legal battles likely for years.\n  The consequence will be that as we continue to fight this global war \non terror, America's ports will be staffed by serious felons. Some may \nbe tempted to come to the defense of the longshoremen with various so-\ncalled concerns: These individuals have paid their debt to society; \nbarring these individuals is going to gut our port workforce; or that \nthe crimes listed are somehow not related to homeland security.\n  These concerns are plain wrong. I don't disagree that convicted \nfelons should be given a second chance. I hope they get back on their \nfeet and become productive members of their communities. What I don't \nagree with is that we should give them a pass, literally and \nfiguratively, to access the most secure areas of America's port \ninfrastructure. When they are fresh out of prison, we should not trust \nthem with the most vulnerable areas of our ports.\n  Second, I have heard that barring these individuals will empty the \nranks of the port workforce. The facts don't bear this out. When the \nDepartment of Homeland Security issued nearly 350,000 ID cards for \nHAZMAT truckdrivers and subjected them to the same background check as \nI propose putting in the law, only 3,100 were disapproved, less than 1 \npercent. The workforce in the United States is elastic enough that we \ncan pick up the few thousand longshoremen jobs opening up because the \ncriminals in the port workforce had to be fired.\n  Finally, some are maintaining these are not serious crimes. I want \nsomeone to come down here and tell me which individuals he wants \nworking at his local port--murderers, extortionists, drug dealers, \narsonists, document forgers? I want to hear the rationale for stopping \nthis important bill.\n  The list that the Transportation Security Agency came up with is a \nlist of serious felons who represent a serious threat. It is going to \nkeep these dangerous criminals out of our ports.\n  The bottom line is this: This bill applies nearly the same \nprotections to seaports that already applies to our airports. It is a \nregime that has been successful. It will make our ports safer by \nkeeping individuals who have shown a willingness to break the law out \nof our ports. This is very important. We can spend all the money in our \ntreasury trying to screen cargo, and we have appropriated or approved a \nwhole lot of money to secure our ports. But if we don't screen the \npeople who work at our ports, we cannot expect to have effective port \nsecurity. It is very unfortunate today that my Democratic colleague has \ntaken this commonsense provision and objected to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is a good thing because I had finished my talk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave \nsoldier who died while serving his country in Iraq. On December 3, \n2006, Army CPT Shawn English was killed when his humvee struck a \nroadside bomb. Captain English, who served as an Army deep sea diver, \nwas based in Panama City Beach, FL, but news of his death reverberated \nin his hometown of New Albany, OH. Captain English leaves behind his \nwife Tricia and three sons, Nathan, Noah, and Austin. Captain English \nwas 35 years old.\n  Shawn spent nearly his entire adult life in the military--first as an \nenlisted soldier and later as a commissioned officer. He grew up in New \nAlbany. As a boy, he raised 4-H sheep and played football for New \nAlbany High School, where he graduated in 1990. Shawn joined the \nmilitary when he was 18 and went on to attend college at Wright State \nUniversity, receiving his degree in 1999.\n  Shawn joined the Army after high school and by the time he deployed \nto the war in Iraq, he was already an experienced combat veteran. He \nhad served his country bravely years before in the gulf war in an \narmored cavalry unit. He later joined a Ranger battalion before \nbecoming a diver.\n  Shawn's middle school teacher Debbie Smith says that he was always \nenergetic and a delight to have in the classroom--that he was a student \nwith a wonderful personality. He simply loved to learn. ``He was \ndedicated to defending our country,'' Debbie remembers, ``and \nparticularly making sure that children were safe.''\n  Those closest to Shawn remember him as a family man. ``He was a very \nloving father and a wonderful brother,'' said his sister Dawn. ``I \nreceived an e-mail from him at around noon on the Saturday before he \ndied,'' said his brother-in-law, Todd. ``It was in response to the \npictures of the Buckeyes game that I sent him. He was very short (in \nthe e-mail), but said that he was tired and that things were really \nintense. He asked that I pray for him.''\n  Shawn's father-in-law Curt expressed his grief at learning the news \nof Shawn's death. ``It's just so hard for us to comprehend,'' he said. \n``We're heartbroken. I could not--do not--love my own sons more than I \nloved that man. He was such a good man. He believed in his country and \nhad a deep faith in God.''\n  Shawn was in Iraq to train and lead Iraqi soldiers. He had been in-\ncountry since February 2006. As his brother-in-law said:\n\n       Shawn had the option to come home, but said he had an \n     obligation to his men and wanted to finish what he started. . \n     . . He\n\n[[Page S11582]]\n\n     told me that when he came back that this was it. He had \n     served 15 years and was going to look at other options to be \n     closer with his family.\n\n  When they moved to Florida, Shawn and his wife Tricia quickly became \nactive members of the community there. They belonged to the Woodlawn \nUnited Methodist Church, and Shawn coached youth soccer.\n  Shawn was able to return home to Florida on a short leave, during \nwhich he visited his son Nathan's elementary school class. During that \nvisit, he discussed his deeply held beliefs about our country.\n  Shawn's father-in-law explained that ``he stressed to [the students] \nhow fortunate we are to be living in America, with the freedoms we \nhave.'' In that meeting, Shawn talked about his work in Iraq and told \nthe kids how much little things, like soccer balls, meant to the \nchildren in Iraq. The class collected soccer balls to send to the Iraqi \nchildren so that, like Shawn, they, too, could help make a positive \ndifference in the country.\n  Shawn's friends loved him. Captain Nathan Surrey, one of Shawn's best \nfriends, met him when they were both involved in Army management \ntraining in Missouri. In Captain Surrey's words:\n\n       We just clicked. We were fanatical Ohio State fans. We \n     loved sports [and liked to talk about] our ideas on life. Our \n     personalities were the same.\n\n  Captain Surrey also remembers what an excellent soldier Shawn was. \nReflecting upon his friend's courage and dedication, he said that ``you \nhave to be in phenomenal physical shape and be pretty much fearless to \nbe able [to be] anywhere in the world, any time.'' Echoing that \nsentiment, CPT Robert Newbauer, who served with Shawn for 6 years, said \nthat ``anything he did, or set forth to do, he was full of pride and \npassion.''\n  Shawn was a dedicated soldier, but most importantly, he was a loving \nhusband and father. His mother-in-law, Bev Daily, remembers how much \nhis children meant to him. ``Those kids idolized their dad,'' she said.\n  Shawn's family was able to see him one last time--just hours before \nhis tragic and untimely death--when they spoke over video phone. In \nthat conversation, Shawn joked and laughed with his sons. His family \nwas grateful for this last opportunity to speak with him.\n  Shawn's life impacted so many people in so many ways. His family and \nfriends will always remember his smile and strong sense of compassion. \nHe served his country with courage and honor and pride--and for that, \nhe will always be remembered.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep CPT Shawn English's family and \nfriends in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                        Specialist Marco Miller\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave and dedicated \nsoldier--Army Specialist Marco Miller, originally from Warren, OH. Just \nthis past weekend, Specialist Miller was on guard duty in Baghdad, when \na nearby military vehicle was hit by a mortar round. Specialist Miller \nwas wounded by the resulting shrapnel and was transferred to a military \nhospital in Germany. On December 5, 2006, surrounded by family members, \nMarco died from his wounds. According to his mother Renee Daniels, the \nArmy has awarded him the Purple Heart and will be promoting him to \nSergeant in recognition of his bravery. Marco was 36 years old.\n  Marco's sister remembers that her brother loved to be active. He \nenjoyed sports and spent a lot of time working out in the gym. Though a \nstar athlete in high school, he also had a passion for the arts. His \nmother remembers him as someone who had a lot of heart. ``I am very \nproud of him,'' she said. ``Very, very proud.''\n  Marco grew up in Warren and graduated from Warren G. Harding High \nSchool in 1988, where he played baseball for the Panthers and was a \nrunning back for the football team. A serious student in high school, \nhe always tried harder than anyone else. He attended the University of \nAkron and the University of Central Florida. An entrepreneur, Marco \nwanted to retire early, so that he could live ``the good life.''\n  Marco's close friend since before kindergarten, Mahar Hameed, said \nthey had been playing football together since they were 8 years old. \nMarco was a tailback, and Mahar was a fullback. ``I blocked for Marco \nfor 10 years,'' he recalls. Even though Marco had moved to Florida, the \ntwo friends kept in touch throughout their adulthood. Mahar saw Marco \nas he was preparing to leave for Iraq. ``I wouldn't say he was \nnervous,'' he said. ``[Rather,] he just knew he had an obligation to \nfulfill. That's the kind of person Marco was. . . . I can only say he \nwas one of the best people I ever knew.''\n  Frank Thomas, Marco's high school football coach, remembers that \nMarco was extremely personable and had an infectious smile. He always \nworked to the best of his ability and took his goals seriously. As \nCoach Thomas put it, ``He represented his country and family well.''\n  On an Internet posting, one of Marco's former schoolmates remembers \nhim as his guardian angel in school since 7th grade, even though they \nhaven't seen each other in over 12 years. ``We drifted in and out of \neach other's orbits through junior high and high school,'' he wrote. \n``I can't tell you how many times he magically appeared when I was in \nneed of some support.''\n  Marco moved to Florida in 1994, with his younger brother Demond. ``We \nwent to Florida with nothing,'' he recalled. ``Marco was building a \nbusiness.'' After graduating from Full Sail, a media arts college in \nOrlando, Marco put together a production company which did audio-visual \nwork, commercials, and other marketing tools for Disney and Universal \nTheme Parks, as well as local car and motorcycle clubs. Marco was also \nputting together DVDs for his Army buddies, and was hoping to combine \nhis two careers in the future.\n  Marco's oldest sister remembers her brother's extraordinary sense of \nfun. ``The last time he was home,'' she said, ``he made sure he went to \nCedar Point, so he could ride all of the rides [and] not just once. He \nloved the roller coasters. He loved sports cars, jet skis, and anything \nthat was fast.''\n  Marco's love of adventure was one of the things that made him decide \nto be a paratrooper when he joined the Army. Although this was his \nfirst tour in Iraq, he had served in the area during the first gulf \nwar. His mother said that she wanted the public to know that Marco was \na good son and a dedicated soldier. ``He was proud to be in the \nmilitary,'' she said.\n  Marco served in the military for nearly a dozen years--6 while on \nactive duty in the early 1990s, and the last 5 as an Army Reservist. He \nenlisted in the Reserves after the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001.\n  According to his mom:\n\n       Marco knew what he was doing. He volunteered to be in the \n     military. He was considering signing up for another six-year \n     term.\n\n  Tamia Michelle, Marco's daughter, was born just this past August, \nafter he had been deployed to Iraq. Tragically, he was never able to \nmeet her. Marco's sister Kim noted that Marco ``was looking forward to \nbeing a father. He looked forward to doing all of the things that a \nfather does with a daughter.''\n  This has been a hard year for Marco's family. The last time they were \nall together was for the funeral of Marco's stepfather Anthony Daniels \njust this past May. Marco was helping his mother cope with the loss.\n  Marco's family does take some solace in knowing that he died doing \nwhat he wanted to be doing what he loved doing. They will always \nremember his patriotism and devotion to duty. As his brother said:\n\n       Marco lived a full life. He did everything he wanted. He \n     traveled from the East Coast to the West and back. . . . He \n     really lived up to his potential and lived life the way he \n     wanted to do. He just felt that if he was going to serve his \n     country, this was the best way for him to do it.\n\n  My wife Fran and I will keep the family of Marco Miller--his daughter \nTamia Michelle, his mother Renee, his sisters Meka and Kim, his \nbrothers Demond and Christoff, and his stepsister Carrie--in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Shamus O. Goare\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army SSG Shamus Goare \nfrom Danville, OH, who was killed on June 28, 2005, when his helicopter \nwas shot down over Afghanistan. He was serving as the MH-47/Chinook \nflight engineer in the 3rd Battalion, 160th Special Operations Aviation \nRegiment,\n\n[[Page S11583]]\n\nbased out of Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia. He was 29 years old. He \nleaves parents Judy and Charles and his brother Kortney.\n  Shamus graduated from Danville High School in Knox County in 1994. He \nbecame a flight engineer because he loved math, science, and \nengineering--and he excelled at all three. Shamus's father described \nhis son as ``a real quiet guy, but when he said something, you knew you \nreally had to pay attention.'' His friends and family knew him to be \npretty quiet unless he was talking about something he loved--such as \ncars and the military.\n  On August 1, 2005, Shamus would have celebrated 11 years in the Army \nas a special operations engineer. Being a member of the 160th Special \nOps Aviation Regiment (Airborne) that flew Blackhawks and Chinooks, \nmeant that Shamus took on very dangerous missions. On a special \noperations mission that would become his last, the Night Stalkers of \nthe 160th were attempting to rescue Navy Seals who went missing in \nmountains near the Pakistani border.\n  Shortly before his death, Shamus had received a medal of valor for \nhumanitarian work in Afghanistan. He was working with children, which \nwas something his father said he loved. His eagerness to serve his \ncommunity and his country was apparent when Shamus managed to trick his \nmother into signing the enlistment forms before he had even graduated \nfrom high school. He was 17, at the time, and according to his father, \nhe thought ``he'd get to see the world before he went to college.''\n  Life in the military was a good fit for Shamus. It led him to a \nseries of selfless and compassionate acts of heroism, many of which, he \ncould not divulge to his family due to the nature of his work with the \n160th's Night Stalkers. And true to their motto, Shamus never quit--\neven to the very end.\n  His father said that ``Shamus really believed in what he was doing. \nHe would always say if we don't fight over there, we'll have to fight \nere.'' His dedication to his duty would not allow him to tell his \nfamily where he was or what he was doing, but that didn't stop him from \ntalking about home and what he would do when he got back to the United \nStates.\n  One of his many hobbies was to drive around in his all-terrain \nvehicle. He would talk about his restoration project of a 1966 Buick \nSkylark a classic car that needed a new engine. Shamus also like to \nfind time to restore old computers.\n  A quick study, he was mostly self-taught. His father recalls that \n``nobody told him how to do things--he just figured it out.'' Even in \nhigh school, his 40 classmates could see Shamus's analytical mind at \nwork.\n  On a field trip to Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton with \nhis high school physics teacher, recalls seeing Shamus' mind at work. \n``He was calculating the estimated time of arrival to see how it \nmatched up to the teacher's time.''\n  Another of Shamus's high school classmates, Missy Duncan, remembers \nbeing shocked when she found out that he had enlisted. ``He was just so \nquiet,'' she said.\n  Stephanie Fritz, another classmate, said this about her friend:\n\n       We knew he was out of the country for the last two \n     reunions, but we didn't know that he had done four tours over \n     there. We're really proud of him. He was just the nicest \n     person.\n\n  Missy and Stephanie were among the many students who paid tribute to \nthe heroism of their fallen classmate by placing a flag display on the \nfront lawn of Danville High School. A former history teacher of \nShamus', Jim Holmes, first came up with the idea for the flag display. \nHe talked about the display this way:\n\n       What Shamus said about us fighting over there, so we \n     wouldn't have to fight over here, really touched me. I \n     thought of all the men and women giving their lives so we can \n     be free. I just thought it would be nice if we do something \n     to [pay tribute] to them.\n\n  Helping to place the eight dozen flags that the American Legion and \nthe local cemetery association donated, Missy said this, ``Though we \nare all doing different things now, it's nice that we can still come \ntogether as classmates and honor one of our own.''\n  Among Shamus's family members who came together to watch the flag \ndisplay were his cousins Kim, Marsha, and Keith. Kim said that ``It's \nso nice to see them come together and do something like this for \nShamus.'' The pride and honor that they felt as the Danville High \nSchool alumni placed their flags in front of their school reminded the \nfamily of how Shamus had found his niche in life when he joined the \nmilitary. Marsha recalled that ``when Shamus would come home, he would \nstand so tall and so proud.''\n  In the words of U.S. Army Chaplain Father Jim McNeely, as he remarked \non Shamus's heroism:\n\n       There are two very important qualities necessary to be a \n     hero--humility and self-sacrifice. The life of Shamus Goare \n     embodies those two virtues, and that's why he is a hero. He \n     was an unassuming young man. He did not seek fame and \n     fortune. He didn't require his name to be spread in \n     headlines, nor did he demand recognition for his \n     achievements. His greatness lies in his quiet professionalism \n     and love for others that drew him to military service. To \n     him, doing his duty with excellence was satisfaction. And \n     Shamus's duty as a soldier was to serve.\n\n  And now, it is our duty to remember and to honor Army Staff Sergeant \nGoare. My wife Fran and I continue to keep his family in our thoughts \nand prayers.\n\n\n                        Sergeant Bradley Harper\n\n  Mr. President, this afternoon I wish to honor Marine SGT Bradley \nHarper, a native of Dresden, OH. Sergeant Harper was killed in Iraq on \nAugust 3, 2005, in a roadside bombing. The 25 years old sergeant was a \ncommunications specialist assigned to the Marine Reserve's 4th Assault \nAmphibian Battalion, 4th Marine Division, based out of Norfolk, VA. He \nis survived by his wife Kendra, his parents Steve and Janet Harper, his \nsister Jenny, and his brother Daniel.\n  Brad--as family and friends called him--grew up in Dresden, where he \nattended Tri-Valley High School. Brad's friends and classmates remember \nhim as an all-around good guy who was very well liked.\n  According to Kyle Powell, a former classmate:\n\n       There isn't one bad thing anyone could say about Brad \n     Harper. Everybody knew him and everybody liked him. He always \n     had a smile on his face. He always laughed. He was never in a \n     bad mood.\n\n  Kim Waaland, athletic director at Tri-Valley Local Schools, remembers \nBrad from when he played on the offensive line for the school football \nteam. He said:\n\n       He was a solid young man. [He was] a good friend and a good \n     teammate. He made the most of his ability. He could always be \n     counted on. He always wanted to do the right thing.\n\n  He also remembers that Brad was always interested in learning more or \ndoing more to make the team better. He was not surprised when he \nlearned that Brad had decided to become a marine.\n  Brad joined the Marines Corps Reserves as a teenager in Ohio and then \nwent on to earn a degree in criminal justice from Zane State College. \nTom Holdren, a criminal justice instructor at Zane State, said this \nabout Brad:\n\n       I had a number of conversations with Brad while he was at \n     school here. He often talked about wanting to be on the right \n     side. He wanted to fix the things that were wrong in the \n     world. I am sure he had a brilliant career ahead of him [and \n     that] he served with honor. He was just that kind of young \n     man.\n\n  After earning his degree, Brad moved to Virginia Beach in January \n2004 to become a police officer. At the police academy, he graduated \nsecond in his class, and his peers selected him to serve as sergeant-\nat-arms. This was the beginning of a career dedicated to serving and \nprotecting others.\n  Rene Ball, a Virginia Beach Police Department spokesperson, describes \nBrad this way:\n\n       [He was a stellar candidate. He was superb in the academy. \n     He was one of those guys who, if another recruit fell behind, \n     he'd go back and make sure that they were all right. Everyone \n     on the force thought he was a great guy.\n\n  Those who worked with Brad remember him as an upbeat, eager \npoliceman. Master Officer Harry McBrien was one of Brad's instructors \nduring his time at the Police Academy. He said that Brad was often \nrelied on to work with the recruits who were struggling. And, when the \nAcademy staff tried to ``stress him out a little bit,'' Master Officer \nMcBrien remembers that Brad ``just smiled'' and kept going. He said the \nfollowing about Officer Harper: Brad was an awesome guy who could \nhandle anything. He was always smiling, had a great mood, and a \npositive\n\n[[Page S11584]]\n\nattitude. He was a role model for everyone else in the Academy.\n  Brad was upbeat before being deployed to Iraq. In an interview with \nThe Virginian-Pilot, Brad said that ``this is my chance to go, to do my \npart.''\n  Brad's devotion to military service impressed everyone with whom he \ncame into contact. Nick Beach, a fellow marine and friend, said that \nBrad was always an inspiration--someone who joined the Marines and \ndecided to serve his country because of his caring heart. Nick said:\n\n       I think the reason there were so many junior Marines who \n     looked up to Brad is because he was a true Marine. He led \n     from the front and never let anyone fall behind. He would go \n     back and give them a hand and bring them back up to the \n     front.\n\n  Brad was dedicated to his marines and his job as a police officer, \nbut he was also devoted to his family and friends. He loved his wife \nKendra, whom Brad met while she was studying at Ohio University in \nZanesville. According to Brad's sister Jenny, ``Kendra was his world.'' \nThey would have been celebrating their third wedding anniversary 2 \nweeks after Brad's death. After his passing, Kendra released the \nfollowing statement about her husband:\n\n       In the eyes of those who knew and loved Brad, he is a real \n     hero. He gave 100 percent in whatever assignment he \n     undertook. He was proud to be a Marine and considered it an \n     honor serving as an officer for the City of Virginia Beach \n     2nd Precinct Oceanfront. He will live on forever in our \n     hearts.\n\n  Jason McBride met Brad while they were both in grade school. The two \nboys grew up together and both played football in high school. Jason \nwas the best man in Brad's wedding, and there was no man better than \nBrad Harper in Jason's mind. While Brad was in Iraq, Jason heard from \nhim about every 2 weeks through email. Jason received an email from \nBrad shortly before his death. Jason said that he was looking forward \nto coming home they could go out to a Buckeyes football game.\n  Jason said:\n\n       Brad was the best friend any guy could ever have. He would \n     always go out of his way to help you. He'll always be my best \n     friend and nothing will ever change that.\n\n  Brad's dedication to military service will never be forgotten. In the \nwords of his sister:\n\n       Brad's bravery and courage, like all the others before him, \n     will never be forgotten. He was a high achiever. Anything he \n     ever wanted to do, he tried, and he achieved. He wanted to \n     serve his country. He wanted to be a marine. He wanted to be \n     a police officer. He had high hopes, and he wanted to go far.\n\n  Indeed, everyone who knew Brad misses him. Virginia Beach police \nofficers memorialized his death by ``draping the badge''--a traditional \nshow of honor and brotherhood by police who place a black swath across \ntheir shields when a fellow officer is killed.\n  At Brad's funeral, MG David Bice said that Brad Harper ``changed the \nworld before our very eyes.'' Indeed he did.\n  Fran and I continue to keep the family of Marine SGT Bradley Harper \nin our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                   Staff Sergeant Curtis A. Mitchell\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to Army SSG \nCurtis Mitchell from McConnelsville, OH, who was killed on December 12, \n2005, when an improvised explosive device exploded near the tank that \nhe was commanding. He was 36 hours away from ending his second tour in \nIraq while serving with the 3rd Squadron, 7th U.S. Cavalry, Company C, \nbased at Fort Stewart, GA. He was 28 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Mitchell leaves his wife Frances, his son Curtis, Jr., \nhis stepsons Eric, Sean, and Alexander, his stepdaughter Keauna, his \nparents Edward and Regina, his brothers Charlie, Edward, Wayne, and \nWilliam, his sisters Angie, Betsy and Regina, and his grandfather Buddy \nCunningham.\n  Friends and family lovingly referred to Curtis as ``Tony.'' He was \nborn in Columbus and moved with his father and mother, just after \nkindergarten, to Malta, OH, in Morgan County, about 80 miles southeast \nof Columbus. He was a member of the Future Farmers of America at Morgan \nHigh School and went straight into the Army when he graduated in 1995.\n  Brian Smith of Los Angeles, CA, went to high school with Tony. He \npaid tribute to his road trip and FFA camp friend by saying:\n\n       He was a great guy, and I, for one, will be forever \n     grateful for his service to America.\n\n  Martha Koon of Reynoldsburg, OH, describes her high school friend by \nalso saying:\n\n       Curtis was a great guy. [He was] like a brother to me in \n     high school. We shared a lot of fun times. He will be greatly \n     missed.\n\n  Three of the Mitchell boys joined the military. Tony and Edward--\nknown to family and friends as ``Jimmy''--enlisted as marines, and \nWilliam entered the Air Force. Charles said:\n\n       I worried more about Jimmy, but figured he was okay because \n     Tony was with him.\n\n  Being stationed together, Tony and Jimmy were patrolling with the \nsame unit in Iraq when the IED exploded that took Tony's life.\n  Tony Mitchell liked hunting, target shooting, fishing, playing video \ngames, and anything at all that had to do with his children. He was a \nbig Ohio State and Notre Dame football fan, but hadn't told his family \nwhich team he was rooting for in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl.\n  Tony's brother William graduated from Air Force basic training on \nDecember 9, 2005--a week before his brother's passing. He said Tony's \ndeath hasn't softened his decision to join the military. William said \nthat ``I'm going to do what my brother would have wanted me to do,'' \nwhich, was to stay in the military and serve his country.\n  William posted the following message to his late brother on an online \ntribute site. This is what he wrote:\n\n       You are my big brother, and I miss you. I just know that \n     you are watching Jimmy and me in our military career. I think \n     about you all the time and how you inspired me to join the \n     Air Force, because you thought about joining, but you went to \n     the Army. I will never forget how much you loved your job, \n     and it makes me love mine [even] more.\n\n  Tony was one of the first servicemembers to enter Baghdad at the \nstart of the war and was part of the operation that killed Saddam \nHussein's sons. His fellow soldiers knew him as a great leader, a great \nfighter, and a great man. He received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart \nand was one of the most ``squared-away'' soldiers in his unit, \naccording to SSG Travis Wiley, a Company C member, who served with Tony \nduring his first tour in Iraq.\n  Staff Sergeant Wiley said:\n\n       Tony always knew what needed to be done. All he'd say was \n     ``I got it,'' and you knew the mission would be complete. He \n     took care of everyone else. He was a joyful guy. He didn't \n     want to see anyone mad. He'd get mad, but only for about two \n     or three minutes.\n\n  Tony served in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Somalia, along with the two tours \nin Iraq. Tony planned on spending the rest of his career with the Army. \nHe had recently signed an extension contract. Tony had been stationed \nfor a few years at Fort Stewart, GA, where he lived with his wife of 1 \nyear, Frances. Tony loved his family, was a good husband, and adored \nhis young son Curtis, Jr.\n  Ronda Mitchell, Tony's sister, said that her brother ``was a \nwonderful dad, son, brother, and uncle. He was always nice to people. I \nloved him because he was a good brother to me. He was funny and good to \nget along with.''\n  Lora Thayer of Rolla, MO, paid tribute to her high school with the \nfollowing message:\n\n       My heart grieves for the loss of such a wonderful and kind \n     person. I graduated with Tony in 1995 and was a friend of his \n     through youth group. My heart hurts, and I will never forget \n     the wonderful person he was to all of us. He will be \n     remembered, not just for his valiant death, but for the man \n     he eventually became. He truly was the kind of person to put \n     others before himself. He is a . . . hero, and I will never \n     forget him.\n\n  No one will forget Army SSG Curtis ``Tony'' Mitchell. My wife Fran \nand I continue to keep his family and friends in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would also like to make another \nunanimous consent request that my colleague to the east from Tennessee, \nSenator Alexander, be recognized for 15 minutes after Senator Durbin, \nwho will follow time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11585-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11585-S11586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11585]]\n                             TIMBER TAX ACT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, we are here at the end of a session, a \n2-year session where many of us have worked very hard to try to come up \nwith commonsense solutions for some age-old problems in our Nation and \nlooking for commonsense solutions to new and different challenges that \nour Nation and its business leaders as well as workers face as our \nbusiness models change and grow and the more complicated nature of how \nbusinesses are set up changes and grows. We have worked hard this \nyear--I certainly have for my State--to look at how we can balance \nthose things and how we can create a good environment for all of the \ngood, solid, responsible corporate citizens who exist out there in this \ngreat Nation who are trying desperately to present the kind of good \njobs, the good-paying jobs working Americans need to stay where they \nare, to live in the communities in which they grew up, and to provide \nfor not just their children but their aging parents.\n  So I think as we come to the close of this session, we have all kind \nof gotten into a hustle and a bustle, much like any holiday season \nbrings, where we tend to get a little overexcited about some things, \nyet we don't stay focused enough on what it is we really need to be \ndoing. The working families of this country need us right now. They \nneed us to be responsible. They need us to focus on the things that \nwill be productive for them, productive for this country, and the \ncompanies that are working hard to produce and maintain jobs in many of \nour States across this great land in order to make sure that those \nworking families can stay working, that their children can stay in \nschool and that their future for higher education is there, and that \nthese families can stay together and care for their aging loved ones.\n  So I come to the Chamber to speak about a subject which I believe is \nimmediate and serious or certainly has immediate and serious \nconsequences to the working people of my State. I am talking about the \nhemorrhaging of jobs in the forest products industry particularly.\n  Here to my side is really an outdated map because we have seen the \nloss of well over 700 jobs since June of this year in the forest \nproducts industry. But in any case, there has been a tremendous amount \nof loss in employee layoffs, closed saw mills and paper mills in this \ncountry. I think it really, if you take a look at this, drastically \nshows the hemorrhaging that is occurring and what it means to good, \nhard-working American families across this country.\n  Over the last year and a half, the State of Arkansas has lost 1,800 \ntimber manufacturing jobs. These are good jobs. They are negotiated \nunion jobs. They are located in our small rural towns. They are the \njobs which are the foundation of these families, these American \nfamilies who are the fabric of our country, whom we come to the floor \nevery day, day in and day out, to talk about.\n  But it doesn't end there. For every highly skilled, highly paid plant \njob that is lost, another job is lost out in the forest--not just these \nwhich are represented here but jobs including truckdrivers and \nforesters, the cafe along the way that supports that industry, and \nthose people who are out working in the forest--the loggers, all of \nthose different entities. That means about 3,600 families are not \nhaving a very merry holiday this year.\n  In fact, we have lost over 1,000 jobs in just the last 10 days alone. \nBut it is going to get worse. If the Congress does not do something \nhere, with the opportunity that has been presented to us--many of us \nhave been working on this issue over the last 8 to 10 months. But here \nin the close of this session and this week, we have an opportunity to \ndo something, to help stop the loss of these manufacturing jobs out of \nour country to places such as South America and Asia. I am talking \nabout enacting the Timber Tax Act which we have talked about over this \npast year.\n  For many months, the Timber Tax Act has consistently and repeatedly \nbeen included as part of the extenders packages we talked about. For \nexample, it was included in the Senate conferees' agreement in the \npension bill, in the Reid extenders amendment, and in the Baucus \nextenders amendment. The bill has broad bipartisan support, with over \n33 cosponsors from every part of the country. That should come as no \namazement to any of us when you look at this map and realize that it is \nnot just one region of our country that is suffering, but it is many \nparts of our country that are suffering.\n  Additionally, this provision provides relief to the entire industry \nacross the board, from the smallest woodlot owner to some of our \nlargest, oldest forest companies. Over 9.9 million individual tree \nowners will receive immediate and significant regular and minimum tax \nrelief.\n  Unfortunately, we have found some concern about whether we need \ncompetition or greater competition in this industry. We come to this \nfloor every day talking about how competition makes our Nation \nstronger. We talk about how competition can help us grow, not just as \nindividuals, not just as companies, not just as a nation, but as a part \nof the global community. I believe that. I believe competition is a \ngood thing. If it is done in a fair way and if people are given the \nopportunity to show what they are made of and to get out there and do \nthe job they believe they are capable of doing and really compete, \nworking together to compete in a global marketplace, I think everyone \nis a winner. But when we keep in artificial stopgaps or actually keep \naway opportunities and continue to keep an artificial circumstance \nwhich stymies the kind of competition that can make us strong, we all \nend up being losers. I think that is a lot of what has occurred here. I \nthink it is extremely shortsighted and it opens all of our similarly \nsituated companies--all of them, whether it is the forest products \nindustry, which has multiple different types of entities, or any of our \nentities--it situates them and puts them up against unbelievable \nscrutiny and criticism.\n\n  The timber tax provision is sound tax policy. Over the past several \nyears, forest products companies have been under intense pressure to \nreduce their Federal taxes by either reorganizing as a nontaxpaying \nentity, or to sell their timberlands, whether they sell them to pension \nfunds or to timber management organizations--wherever they may go to \noffload that part of their industry. But I want us to think a little \nbit more about that. We talk about being shortsighted. Think about what \nthat means to the conservation of this country. You look at the small, \nfamily-owned timber companies that exist out there that are fighting \nand trying hard to keep their heads above water in an industry and in \ncircumstances where they are put at a disadvantage. Who is most likely \nto be a good steward of the land? Who is most likely to go in and \nreforest? It is the third- or fourth-generation small business owner, \nthe small family-owned timber company that is going to go in and take \ngood care to be a good steward of this land. Those are the most likely \nones.\n  Let's not put them at a disadvantage because then, all of a sudden, \nall of our timberland, particularly the family-owned timber company, is \ngoing to be owned by big groups, and all they want to do is go in and \ncut and then sell off to developers. Let's make sure we have diversity \nin this industry; a good, diverse, competitive industry that looks at \nall sides of what we are trying to protect here: family jobs, the \nenvironment, the landscape of many of our small rural States. It is \nvery important.\n  As the integrated companies separate their mills from their plants \nand from their timber, there are obvious results: plant closures and \njob loss, not to mention what happens with that family-owned business \nthat is such a good steward in the conservation of the land.\n  As a result of this sort of artificial, short-term tax-driven \npressure, the amount of U.S. timberland held by integrated forest \nproducts companies has fallen from 50 million acres to 15 million \nacres. Think about that. I want my colleagues to think, when you take \nthose kinds of lands out and put them under a bigger umbrella where \nnobody is going to really be able to come in and say you can't come in \nand clearcut that and sell it to a developer or whatever, they are more \nlikely to wave their hand, do it, and go on.\n  But when you have a small family-owned business that has been there \nfor generations, they are so much less likely to do any of that. They \nare going\n\n[[Page S11586]]\n\nto go back in, and with a great sense of pride and respect as well as \nconfidence that this is going to continue to be a small family-owned \nbusiness, they are going to reforest and they are going to reinvest in \nthat forest product and that timber company.\n  By enacting the timber tax provision, Congress will forestall a \nfurther decline, and we will allow forest products companies to make \ntheir decisions based exclusively on sound business principles--not \nlooking at what they have been backed into a corner to do in order to \nsimply keep their business or to simply keep one piece of their \nbusiness. They will lay off the jobs, they will break up the integrated \ncompany, and they will move on because it is easier and because it \nkeeps them alive--as opposed to making good, sound, principled business \ndecisions.\n  Without its passage, I fear the State of Arkansas will see further \nimmediate closures and loss of jobs. I plead with my colleagues, we \ncannot lose this opportunity. We cannot lose this opportunity to take \nsomething that we have looked at and talked about and developed over \nthe last 10 or so months. We have seen it in other packages, and we \nknow how productive it can be. I hope the majority of this body will \njoin me in seeking a collaborative effort to make sure that we do not \nsee even what the current map would look like if this one were updated, \nor to think of what it may look like 5 or 10 years from now, with the \nincredible loss of jobs in timberland and our family-owned timber \nbusinesses. It would be devastating.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention to this issue. I plead with \nthem on behalf of the people of Arkansas, those unbelievably hard-\nworking families who live in those rural communities, who know our \nforests and know how to take good care of them: Please let us work to \nkeep those jobs and to keep those businesses going in order that we can \nnot only save those jobs but save a way of life in parts of rural \nAmerica, as well as making sure that we have the best interests of our \nforest lands at heart, private forests and others. I think we have a \ngreat opportunity to do it, and I hope we will act on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11586-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO J.B. HUNT\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, joining my \ncolleague Senator Pryor, as we pay tribute to the life of one of \nArkansas's business and philanthropic giants: Mr. J.B. Hunt. The \nbillion dollar trucking company that J.B. Hunt built can only by \ncharacterized as the very personification of the American dream, and \nthe only thing more impressive than the trucking empire he has created \nis the life he led and the journey he took to get there.\n  I am so grateful to have known this wonderful man and to have called \nhim my friend. From the moment you met J.B. Hunt, you knew he was not \nyour typical business mogul. He was much more. He was much like all of \nthese hardworking Arkansans whom I reflect on this map.\n  J.B. Hunt's formal education ended when he dropped out of school at \n12 years of age when, similar to many people of the Great Depression \nand that generation, he had to find employment to help his family \nsurvive. That is what we are talking about, we are talking about \nAmerican families who are working hard to reach that dream. Here is a \nman who did.\n  Every time I was able to be around J.B. Hunt, I always knew he never \nforgot that challenging period of his life, and its impact helped shape \nthe character of the man who would put in the hard work and long hours \nto get the job done right. When I first heard the news of his passing, \nI reflect on our first meeting. He asked about me, came up to me, and \nhe said: Now, Blanche, who are your people anyhow? Of course that \nmeant, Who are your relatives? Who are your parents? Where do you come \nfrom?\n  He immediately recalled that he had come to know my father from the \ntime he spent personally hauling rice loads across the State of \nArkansas. Mr. Hunt reminisced that those were back in the days when he \nhad just one truck. And I thought then that not only was J.B. Hunt a \nman who was proud of what his company had become, but he appreciated \nthe time and the hard work that had been required to get there. He knew \nmore than just where his trucks traveled, he knew the people along the \nway. Although J.B. Hunt is considerably larger today--any of our \ncolleagues who travel across the interstates will see a J.B. Hunt truck \nfrom Lowell, AK,--Mr. Hunt himself never changed who he was as an \nindividual. His dedication reached well beyond his company to many \nphilanthropic efforts that continue to greatly benefit our State of \nArkansas.\n\n  True to form, J.B. Hunt dedicated much more than millions of \ndollars--he dedicated considerable amounts of his time. Until his \ndeath, he remained a man who was willing to put in the hard work and \nthe long hours to do the job right--and Arkansas is a far better place \nas a result.\n  I am certainly grateful to have had his friendship and to pay tribute \nto the life he led so well. My thoughts and prayers and my deepest \nsympathies are with his family at this very difficult time, and my \ngratitude goes out to Mr. Hunt, who truly exemplified that it is not \njust the view at the top, it is truly the journey that gets you there \nthat is worth more than anything that you could get in return.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague, Senator Pryor, from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the two same subject \nmatters that the senior Senator from Arkansas talked about, in that \norder. I do want to talk about J.B. Hunt, but first I want to talk \nabout the timber tax.\n  Before I do, I ask unanimous consent for Senator DeWine to have 1 \nhour to finish his remarks, after the conclusion of the remarks of the \njunior Senator from Tennessee, who I understand is the last speaker in \nthis sequence this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let me notify the staff, Senator DeWine \nsaid he would certainly be flexible, if someone needed some time and \nneeded to maybe cut in a little bit. He was certainly willing to work \nwith whoever wanted to do that, but he did ask we seek unanimous \nconsent for 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11586-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11586-S11587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE TIMBER TAX\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, if I may, let me talk about this timber tax \nissue. Clearly, forests provide a lot of jobs for many people all over \nthis country. For Arkansas, those jobs are very important to our \nState's economy. But also one thing that we often forget is these \nforests are extremely good for our environment. They absorb carbon \ndioxide, they clean waterways, they provide natural habitat for all \nkinds of species out there, and they help keep an ecological balance in \nour country.\n  One of the great developments that has occurred in the last \ngeneration is that this country and the people in the timber industry \nhave become much better, much more adept at managing the forests in a \nvery good, long-term business way but also in a great way for the \nNation's environment. In fact, when you look at Arkansas, the timber \nindustry has done such a good job there that it is now the No. 2 \nmanufacturing industry in the State.\n  I know that is the same in other States. There are many States that \nhave very large timber industries, but we oftentimes take it for \ngranted. I am looking around this room and seeing all the wood \nproducts. I am reading on one now and using one as a file folder and \nspeaking behind one and standing on one. Often we take that for \ngranted, but the wood products industry is very important for this \ncountry. In fact, you could say it helped build this country.\n  Unfortunately, now the forestry industry, the wood products \nindustry's health is in jeopardy. They have two major problems. No. 1, \nwith globalization, they have a lot of foreign competition. The folks I \ntalk to in the industry, they will understand that. They are ready to \nmeet that challenge. They understand it is a new day and it is very \ncompetitive. They are getting a lot of pressure from places such as \nCanada and rain forest timber and materials that are coming out of Asia \nand Russia, and they understand that. They are willing to fight that \nfight if the playing field is leveled.\n\n[[Page S11587]]\n\n  But the other problem is internal. It is not from foreign \ncompetitors, it is, frankly, from the Government and it is the Tax Code \nand how the Tax Code works within the industry. If I can give one \nexample, last week there was an announcement in Mountain Pine, AR. Now \nMountain Pine only has about 772 people who live in the community, but \nthere is a mill there that makes plywood. That mill just announced it \nis closing.\n  Senator Lincoln mentioned this a few moments ago. That mill has 340 \njobs. That one employer in that town of 772 hires 340 people and \nemploys them. It is closed. It is gone. Certainly, I hope at some point \nin the future the community can rally and find another use for that \nfacility. Maybe they can get someone else in the wood products industry \nin. Who knows. But that is a symptom of what is going on because the \nowner of that facility is on the wrong side of the Tax Code.\n  We talked about the timber tax. We have a fix that we proposed. \nSenator Lincoln and many others worked very hard to try to get this \ndone. But because they are on the wrong side of the Tax Code, they are \nhaving to close plants. Frankly, it is causing a huge strain on their \nbottom line.\n  One of the things I need to do when I am on that subject is to thank \nSenators Dole, Hutchison, and Cornyn, who have been very helpful in \ncosponsoring a bill that we think will help solve this problem.\n  Price Waterhouse Coopers & Lybrand, in April of 2005, wrote a report, \nand they found that the U.S. corporate forestry tax burden is the \nsecond highest compared to seven major competitor nations. Analysis \nshowed that the tax burden of the U.S. forestry industry is a full 16 \npercentage points higher than the median of their competitor nations. \nWe understand that in this country we have more responsible foresting, \nwe understand we have stricter environmental regulations, and we also \nunderstand that our tax burden may be a little bit higher here and \nthere. But the unfortunate thing going on here is it is disproportional \nwithin the industry depending on how the company is organized.\n  Here is what I mean. If a company is a C corporation, it is taxed one \nway. If it is a REIT, it is taxed another way. That means the folks \nthat are REITs have a big tax advantage over the traditional companies. \nThis has a disproportionately difficult effect on small companies, the \nfamily-owned businesses in places such as Arkansas and Louisiana and \nthe State of Washington and in other places where you have a lot of \nfamily-owned timber businesses, because they don't have the resources \nto recalibrate themselves in the form of REITs. It doesn't make sense \nfor their business.\n  What has happened, given our Tax Code, is basically the Federal \nGovernment says: Look, if you want to stay in the business, you have to \norganize yourself in a certain way. That is not fair.\n  What is happening all around this country is that these timber \ncompanies are making business decisions based on the Tax Code. We have \nseen this happen. We know businesses are going to adapt to the \nconditions they have, and one of those conditions is the Tax Code. They \nare always going to adjust and adapt according to that. But when they \nstart to make decisions such as this which are so dramatic and alter \ntheir business models so much, bad things are going to happen \neventually.\n  If you look at the real estate bubble which burst back in the 1980s, \na lot of those deals in the early 1980s which were done in the real \nestate market were done for tax reasons. They did not make any sense in \nthe business world, but they made a heck of a lot of sense under the \nTax Code. Finally, when the Congress got around to closing some of \nthose loopholes and simplifying the Tax Code, the bubble burst.\n  My concern with the forestry industry is that someday when we \nreconcile these problems, it is going to be too late for a lot of these \ncompanies, especially the small family-owned businesses.\n  This is not strictly an Arkansas problem. The latest employment \nfigures I have from my State are that the industry employs about 43,000 \npeople, with an annual payroll of $1.3 billion. That is a lot of money. \nThat is a big part of our State's economy. However, if you look around \nthe country, they employ about 2 million workers, with an annual \npayroll of $51 billion. This is not just a local problem in the State \nof Arkansas. Both Senators from Arkansas are here talking about it, but \nit is a problem for the whole country and the Nation's economy.\n  I ask my colleagues to support a better timber tax policy. We want a \ntax policy that is fair, that restores competitiveness, that provides \njob security for hundreds of communities and families, that benefits \nthe environment, and which is really the best thing for the country as \nwell as for the industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11587-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11587-S11588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JOHNNIE BRYAN HUNT, ``J.B.''\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Johnnie Bryan Hunt died a couple of days \nago in Arkansas. I just spoke with his wife a few moments ago. As \nalways, she was delightful, and she was very upbeat and very positive \nand really appreciated all the prayers and all the well-wishes she has \nreceived from Arkansas and from around the country over the last couple \nof days.\n  Yesterday, we lost a great American and a great Arkansan and a great \nexample to us all. Johnnie Bryan Hunt was born in Cleburne County, AK, \nin 1927 during the Great Depression. He left school at the age of 12 \nand went to work for his uncle in the sawmill. We were just talking \nabout the timber industry in our State. He went to work for his uncle \nin the sawmill just to help the family get by, as many Americans did \nback in those days.\n  He served in the U.S. Army.\n  During his early career, he was a farmer, he was a lumber salesman, \nhe was an auctioneer, and a truckdriver. Then he invented his own \nbusiness. It was called a rice hull business. He got the rice hulls \nover in the eastern part of the State and trucked them over to the \nwestern part of the State to make ``poultry bedding,'' as he called it, \nout of the rice hulls. That venture did not work out exactly the way he \nwanted it to.\n  His first trucking company, which he formed as part of that and \nshortly thereafter, failed. He lost about $19,000 in that first \nventure. But like many Americans, J.B. Hunt didn't quit. He went back \nto the drawing board. He kept working. He knew he had the ability. He \nknew he had the gift of problem-solving.\n  A few years later, he founded the trucking company which today is the \nlargest publicly held truckload transportation company in North \nAmerica, J.B. Hunt Trucking. Even though he started with 5 trucks and 7 \ntrailers, today he has over 16,000 employees, 11,000 trucks, and 47,000 \ntrailers and containers. He did this with hard work, he did this with a \nlot of dedication and with a lot of focus.\n  But one thing they say about J.B. Hunt the man and the company he \nfounded is they are smart. They use technology, they are very \ninnovative, and they work very hard to get on the cutting edge of that \nindustry. In fact, J.B. Hunt is really a poster child for the American \nsuccess story. We know that through hard work and opportunity, things \ncan happen for you in this country. And he is proof that can happen in \na very big way.\n  During the course of his life, he was director of the American \nTrucking Association, the American Studies Institute Advisory Board, \nthe Intermodal Transportation Institute, which he was innovative in, \nthe University of Arkansas Campaign for the 21st Century, and the \nNorthwest Arkansas Business Council. In addition to those boards and \nthose industry groups on which he served, he also was extremely giving \nwith his resources. Two of his favorite charities are the Arkansas \nEaster Seals and the March of Dimes.\n  I know he will be sorely missed in his hometown of Lowell.\n  People always associated Arkansas with J.B. Hunt the man and the \ntrucking company because he really did put it on the map. He came to \nnorthwest Arkansas and ended up in northwest Arkansas before this \nperiod of exceptional growth started there. These two counties up in \nthe northern corner of our State are two of the fastest growing \ncounties in America. The companies that are there are companies such as \nWal-Mart, Tyson Foods, J.B. Hunt, and, of course, the University of \nArkansas is in that corner of the State as well.\n\n[[Page S11588]]\n\n  People ask me: Is there something in the water up there? What is it \nabout this little area of your State? Is it the great quality of life? \nIt is the great work ethic? Yes and yes. More than anything, it is \nabout great leadership, and J.B. Hunt was part of that great \nleadership. He was on the team of men and women who moved their \ncommunities forward and in many ways not only changed those communities \nbut changed the State and changed the world.\n  I join Arkansans and Americans in offering my condolences and prayers \nto J.B. Hunt's family and his friends, including his wife Johnelle and \ntheir children Jane and Bryan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, while both of my distinguished colleagues \nfrom Arkansas are on the Senate floor, let me tell them how much I \nappreciate their leadership in dealing with this last item of business \nrelative to this Congress and which is particularly important in my \nhome State of Texas, as it is in other timber-growing regions of the \nUnited States.\n  As we find ourselves in global competition for jobs and work, there \nare certain things we need to keep our eyes on to help make America \nmore competitive and to make sure we continue to create the jobs and \nopportunities which have always been the key to our prosperity. Of \ncourse, the present occupant of the chair knows that having a qualified \nworkforce is one of the key elements of our ability to compete in a \nglobal economy, as is our tax policy and our health care system, which \nis a factor in the ability of American businesses to be competitive, \nour regulatory environment, and our civil justice or litigation system.\n  I wish to focus specifically on our tax policy. The fact is that in \nmany industries our tax policy in this country makes certain aspects of \nour economy less than competitive. Certainly that is true when it \napplies to the timber tax issue.\n  The timber tax provision I am speaking about would lower the capital \ngains tax for owners of timberland, both individuals and corporate \nowners, but mainly it is small business community members and farmers. \nThe great thing about this is we are not talking about a tax increase \non anybody; we are talking about reducing the tax on this element of \nour economy, of our workforce, mainly small business owners and \nfarmers, to help make them more competitive in a global economy.\n  It was my sincere hope that this provision would be included with the \nso-called tax extenders package that I hope is ultimately passed by the \nSenate today or tomorrow, but, as the Senators from Arkansas have \nalready pointed out, I know we are all disappointed that it has not \nbeen included. I think that is a shame. My hope is that, having left \nthis work undone, Congress, when we return in January, will take up \nthis issue again and attempt to pass it.\n  The U.S. forestry industry and its workers are at the heart of a \nvibrant economy that has produced the highest living standards in the \nworld. As the jobs report released just today indicates, job creation \ncontinues apace across this big economy here at home. But there are \nsectors of the economy that are struggling because of the disadvantages \nthey have, particularly with regard to our tax policy. The forest \nproducts industry and its workers, including those in Texas and across \nAmerica, are facing significant challenges which, if not overcome, will \nlead to reduced economic growth, lost jobs, and ultimately the decline \nof living standards for future generations.\n  Although job growth continues here at home, as we saw by today's \nreport, it is important to highlight that American paper mills and wood \nproduct mills are permanently closing their doors, resulting in a loss \nof those good-paying jobs. At the same time, our foreign competitors, \nfacing generally lower taxes, are expanding their capacity.\n  As has already been pointed out by the senior Senator from Arkansas, \nthe Price Waterhouse Coopers & Lybrand report in April of 2005 examined \nthe effect of the U.S. tax system and found that our tax rules \nconsistently disadvantage U.S. companies and workers relative to the \ntax rules in most nations with which we have to compete. By reducing \nthe cost disadvantage faced by practicing sustainable forestry here in \nUnited States, this proposal can help reverse the trend of decreasing \nU.S. competitiveness in the forest products industry and maintain those \nmanufacturing jobs of U.S. workers.\n  Simply put, this proposal is about creating more good-paying jobs \nhere at home, not by conferring any additional benefits on our American \nemployers and job creators but by reducing the impediments and the \nobstacles that Government puts in the way to job creation and \ncompetition in the global economy.\n  I wish to especially express my appreciation to Senator Lincoln, the \nsenior Senator from Arkansas, for her strong advocacy for this issue. I \nlook forward to working with her in our next Congress to try to do \neverything we can to remedy this wrong and to help make America and \nparticularly the forest products industry more competitive in a global \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois had the next \n15 minutes. I don't see him. I was to follow him, but to conserve time \nI will go ahead and take my 15 minutes now and then ask unanimous \nconsent he be allowed to follow me when he arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11588-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11588-S11591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL COMPETITIVE INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I salute the Senators from Arkansas and \nTexas on their comments about the timber tax. That is not my subject \ntoday, although I intend to talk about competitiveness, jobs, but this \nis something we do need to pay attention to, not just for the jobs but \nfor conservation in our country. That was mentioned eloquently by \nSenator Lincoln.\n  I was in Waverly, TN, in Humphreys County the other day, and people \nare very upset because the timber company--I guess partly because of \nthe Tax Code--has sold thousands of acres to an organization that \ndoesn't care anything about the forest. That organization is cutting \nall the trees and going about their way. The people in that county, for \na long time, have enjoyed having that forest properly managed--not just \nthe jobs; they like the jobs, as well, but they like the trees.\n  What we may be doing in an unanticipated way is having a tremendous \nnegative impact upon the beauty and the forests of the United States by \nour tax policy even though we don't intend to do that. I am glad the \nSenators from Texas and Arkansas and others are interested in this \nissue. I would like to work with them in the new Congress to try to be \nof some help.\n  I am here today to suggest, especially to my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who will be in the majority starting next month, that \nwe, all of us together, have a remarkable opportunity to start the new \nyear with a truly bipartisan piece of legislation critical to the \nfuture of the United States.\n  Our new majority leader, who will be Senator Reid, has said he would \nlike to foster a more bipartisan atmosphere as the Senate begins its \nwork next year. So would I. So would most Members. The best bipartisan \nbill I know that is ready for action in the Senate is the bill that \nSenator Reid and Senator Frist are cosponsors of, the National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act.\n  At the end of September, our two leaders, Senator Frist and Senator \nReid, the Republican and Democratic leaders, introduced this bipartisan \ncompetitiveness bill. It has the support of the chairmen and the \nranking members of the Energy, Commerce, and HELP Committees and, in \nfact, was created by those three committees. It wasn't written by the \nRepublicans and handed to the Democrats for approval. We wrote it \ntogether. We have worked on it for 18 months. The product is here\n\n[[Page S11589]]\n\nand ready for action. I had hoped we would be able to complete our work \non this legislation before the end of the year. However, because of our \ncurrent schedule, we can't.\n  January is just around the corner, and it will be an opportune moment \nbecause the bill is so bipartisan there is no reason in the world that \nit can't be chalked up as an early victory for a new bipartisan Senate.\n  Senator Bingaman has worked as hard on it as Senator Domenici. \nSenator Inouye has worked as hard on it as Senator Stevens. Senator \nKennedy has worked as hard on it as Senator Enzi. So has Senator \nMikulski, and so has Senator Hutchison. In other words, this is our \nproduct. It is ready for action.\n  The prospects of passing a significant piece of legislation to \nprotect America's brain power advantage in the world are also strong in \nthe House of Representatives. My friend and colleague, Bart Gordon from \nTennessee, is likely to become the new chairman of the House Science \nCommittee. When Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman and I and many \nothers introduced the Augustine Report, the report of the National \nAcademy of Sciences that detailed 20 steps we should take as a country \nin order to keep our brain power advantage, Congressman Bart Gordon in \nthe House of Representatives put his legislation in at the same time. \nHe is strongly committed to this agenda, has worked as hard as anyone \nin the Congress, and we have all been working together for some time.\n  The incoming Speaker, Congresswoman Pelosi, laid out an agenda on \nthis issue that drew heavily on the National Academies' ``Gathering \nStorm'' report, the Augustine Report I described. She even brought \nGeorge Lucas to Washington to tout her agenda and told President Bush \nthis is an area where the two parties can work together.\n  President Bush himself has been a leader in this area, which is \nenormously helpful since the President is the Nation's agenda setter. \nIn his State of the Union Address, President Bush talked importantly \nabout our competitive position in the world. He has seen the need for \nit as a President. He saw it before that as a Governor. He followed up \nhis action with money. He put his money where his mouth was and he put \nsignificant new dollars in the budget this year to fund his American \nCompetitiveness Initiative.\n\n  The President says: Let's do it. The House of Representatives says: \nLet's do it. We in the Senate have worked 18 months. At one point, we \nhad 70 cosponsors of our competitiveness legislation: 35 Democrats, 35 \nRepublicans. A good way to welcome the new year would be to pass the \nbill. We ought to be able to do it before the February recess.\n  This bill is about growing our economy. It is about creating the \nlargest number of good new jobs we possibly can. It is about \nrecognizing we are very fortunate as a country to have just 4 to 5 \npercent of the people in the world, nearly 25, 26, 27 percent of all \nthe money in the world, and that the principal factor in that has been \nour creative brain power advantage.\n  But China and India and maybe other parts of the world have realized \nthat their brains work just like ours--sometimes they are even smarter \nthan ours--and they are working hard to make sure that they get their \nshare of the wealth.\n  This legislation is a progrowth investment that we must make if \nAmerica is to set the pace in science and technology for the next \ngeneration.\n  In August, a group of Senators met with a number of Chinese leaders \nin Beijing, including the President of China, Hu Jintao, and the \nChairman of the National People's Congress in China, Wu Bangguo. Just 2 \nmonths earlier, President Hu had gone to the Chinese Academy of \nSciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering to outline a 15-year \nplan to make China a technology leader.\n  In his speech, President Hu said China must ``promote a huge leap \nforward of science and technology; we shall put strengthening \nindependent innovation capability at the core of economic structure \nadjustment.''\n  We all know that when a Chinese leader talks about a great ``leap \nforward'' it is a pretty big deal in China. This was the center of \ntheir economic policy. In our conversations with the top two leaders in \nChina, we found when we talked about North Korea or Iran or Iraq, the \narea in which they were most animated was this whole idea of innovation \nand technology.\n  The Science section in the New York Times this Tuesday has a column \nentitled ``With An Improved Particle Accelerator China Sees Golden \nOpportunity For Collaborative Research.'' China knows if it wants a \nlarger share of the world's wealth, it needs to have a brain power \nadvantage. That should remind us of the importance of keeping ours.\n  We have seen the same thing in India, in a trip by Senators to \nBangalore last year, their version of our Silicon Valley, we saw that \ntheir research is cutting edge. They are creating new jobs. They \nunderstand how to improve the standard of living in the people of that \ngreat country.\n  The challenge facing America is about brain power and jobs. We are \nnot about to fall over the cliff. Actually, in the last 10 years our \nshare of the world's wealth has grown, according to the International \nMonetary Fund. Ten years ago we had 25 percent of all the gross \ndomestic product in the world. Last year it was 28 percent. Yet we know \nwe need to keep on our toes to keep our jobs.\n  Most of this good fortune comes from that brain power advantage an \neducated workforce and technological innovation. We have the finest \nsystem of colleges and universities. That system attracts 500,000 \nforeign students today. Many of them are the brightest young people in \nthe world. They are here creating good new jobs that improves our \nstandard of living.\n  No country has the national research laboratories we have. We have \nwon the most Nobel Prizes in science. We have registered the most \npatents. Such innovation has been responsible for as much as half of \nthe Nation's growth in productivity--in plain English, the reason we \nhave such a disproportionate share of the world's best paying jobs.\n  Yet we see what is happening--not just in China and India, but also \nin Finland, Singapore, Ireland, and more. They understand this, too, \nand are working hard to catch up, get ahead, and get their share.\n  That is why last year Senator Bingaman and I, with Senator Domenici's \nencouragement, walked down to the National Academy of Sciences not far \nfrom here and asked: What are the top 10 actions, in priority order, \nthat Federal policymakers could take over the next decade to help the \nUnited States keep our advantage in science and technology? We figured \nMembers of Congress probably weren't the right ones to make that list. \nSo we asked the people who should know.\n  They, in turn, assembled an all-star panel of business, government, \nand university leaders, headed by Norm Augustine, former chairman and \nCEO of Lockheed Martin. The group included three Nobel Prize winners. \nIt happened to include the President of Texas A who is now about to \nbe the Secretary of Defense. We asked for 10 recommendations. They gave \nus 20, in priority order.\n  Then a bipartisan group of Senators, led by Senators Bingaman and \nDomenici, introduced what we call the Protecting America's Competitive \nEdge Act, or PACE, to implement those recommendations.\n  This included increasing Federal funding for basic research in the \nphysical sciences by 10 percent a year for 10 years; doubling our \ninvestment in basic research as we recently did for medical research; \nproviding 25,000 undergraduate scholarships and 5,000 graduate \nfellowships for future scientists; allowing foreign students who come \nhere to earn a Ph.D. in the sciences to stay 1 year after graduation, \nand, if they find employment, to become automatically eligible for a \ngreen card; recruiting 10,000 new science and math teachers with 4-year \nscholarships; training 50,000 current teachers in summer institutes at \nnational labs and universities; creating a new coordinating office to \nmanage a centralized research infrastructure fund of at least $500 \nmillion per year; giving American companies a bigger research and \ndevelopment tax credit so they will keep more good jobs here instead of \nmoving them overseas.\n  As I mentioned earlier, our bill, the PACE bill, attracted 70 \ncosponsors: 35\n\n[[Page S11590]]\n\nRepublicans, 35 Democrats. There was no other piece of legislation \nquite so popular that was that important in this session of Congress. \nWe made a lot of progress since we introduced that legislation.\n  I mention the President's State of the Union Address and the $5.9 \nbillion in his budget for fiscal year 2007 for his American \nCompetitiveness Initiative. In March, the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee reported a bill with eight provisions related to energy \nresearch, as well as math and science education for students and \nteachers in association with the national labs. In May, the Commerce \nCommittee reported a bill that included ideas not just from the \nAugustine Report but also from the excellent Council on Competitiveness \nand from the President's own proposals. Then the immigration bill that \npassed the Senate in May included three provisions to attract the \nbrightest minds in our country. They drew from the Augustine Report. \nThen the Defense authorization bill that passed the Senate in June \nincluded a provision related to support for early career researchers \nfunded by the Pentagon. The so-called tax extender bill, which has been \nheld up, includes the research and development tax credit that was the \ncornerstone of both the Augustine Report and the President's \ninitiative. It appears likely to pass before the end of this week.\n\n  Then, at the end of September, just before the Congress left town for \nthe election, a bipartisan group of 14 Senators, led by Senator Frist \nand Senator Reid, our Republican and Democratic leaders, introduced the \nNational Competitiveness Investment Act, a bill that will help America \nkeep its brainpower advantage so we can succeed in a more competitive \nglobal economy.\n  The bill includes provisions from the bills that passed the Energy \nand Commerce Committees and adds an important education component that \nSenator Enzi and Senator Kennedy took the lead on. It focuses on the \nareas that are important to maintaining and improving U.S. innovation \nin the 21st century. One, it increases research investment; two, it \nstrengthens educational opportunities in science, technology \nengineering, and mathematics from elementary through graduate school.\n  Several sections in the bill are derived from proposals in the PACE \nAct, which I introduced earlier this year with Senators Domenici, \nBingaman, and Mikulski. This is a critical effort. We face what has \nbeen called a new ``flat'' world where more and more countries can \ncompete with us, and we must rise to the challenge.\n  That is why this bill would double funding for the National Science \nFoundation from approximately $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2006 to $11.2 \nbillion in 2011. It sets the Department of Energy's Office of Science \non a track to double its funding over 10 years, increasing from $3.6 \nbillion in fiscal year 2006 to over $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2011.\n  It would strengthen the skills of thousands of math and science \nteachers by establishing training and education programs at summer \ninstitutes hosted at the national laboratories and by increasing \nsupport for the Teacher Institutes for the 21st Century program at the \nNational Science Foundation.\n  It would expand the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at the \nNational Science Foundation to recruit and train individuals to become \nmath and science teachers.\n  It would assist States in establishing or expanding statewide \nspecialty schools in math and science that students from across the \nStates would be eligible to attend. Tennessee wants to do that, as they \nalready do in North Carolina and in other States.\n  It would expand advanced placement and international baccalaureate \nprograms by increasing the number of teachers who are prepared to teach \nthese math, science, and foreign language programs. This would allow \nthousands of new students, who are bright enough but may come from \nfamilies with low incomes, to take these outstanding college prep \nclasses.\n  The Frist-Reid bill would provide grants to universities to establish \nprograms modeled on the successful UTeach program at the University of \nTexas--which the current Presiding Officer knows a great deal about--\nwhere students getting a bachelor's degree in math or science can \nconcurrently earn teaching credentials and become the new generation of \nmath and science teachers.\n  And finally, it creates partnerships between national laboratories \nand local high-need schools to establish centers of excellence in math \nand science education.\n  The bill authorizes $20.3 billion in new spending over 5 years. This \nis a significant savings over what was originally reported by the \ncommittee and what was originally included in the PACE bill.\n  About $4.6 billion over 5 years in authorized funding has been cut \nfrom competitiveness bills passed by the Energy and Commerce \nCommittees. Our friends in the White House should appreciate that, and \nthe taxpayers will as well.\n  The bill avoided duplicative undergraduate scholarship programs that \nwere proposed in earlier legislation. That was a priority of many \nMembers of the House of Representatives. It reduced the cost of a \nnumber of other proposed and existing programs.\n  In the end, this is a small price to pay to secure our competitive \nedge. I would emphasize, this is a pro-growth investment. This creates \njobs. This puts money in our pockets. That is what we are talking about \nwhen we are talking about keeping our brainpower advantage.\n  The potential for what this legislation could do for our country was \nillustrated in the community of Oak Ridge, TN, just this week. Oak \nRidge is the home of one of the Department of Energy's national \nlaboratories--the most important energy laboratory in the world, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  Three students from Oak Ridge High School--Scott Molony, Steven \nArcangeli, and Scott Horton this Monday won the team prize in the \nNational Siemens Competition, which recognizes and rewards students \nwilling to challenge themselves through scientific research. This is \nnot a small honor. The winners will share a $100,000 scholarship as \nencouragement to continue in math and science careers in the future. \nEducation Secretary Margaret Spellings was on hand to present the \naward.\n  The students used supercomputers to analyze tens of thousands of \ngenes so they could figure out how to engineer biofuel production by \nmicro-organisms.\n  Because of the hard work and ingenuity of these three students, their \nproject may one day provide a tool that could enable scientists to \ngenetically engineer bacteria that would cost-effectively turn plant \nmatter into bioethanol used to fuel automobiles. Their project has \ncontributed to a growing body of research on creating micro-organisms \nthat can produce alternative fuels. In fact, the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory received a major grant to continue the research that this \nstudent project began.\n  Part of the reason these three students succeeded is they were able \nto connect with the work and expertise at the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory. Their lead adviser, Dr. Nagiza F. Samatova, is a senior \nresearch scientist in the Computational Biology Institute, Computer \nScience and Mathematics Division, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n  The National Competitiveness Investment Act will give more young \nAmericans across our country the opportunity these bright students have \nhad. The bill provides for student internships and summer programs at \nnational laboratories such as Oak Ridge across this country. The bill \nwould allow more scientists such as Dr. Samatova to spend more of their \ntime working with such bright students.\n  The Senate should act quickly, in January, on the National \nCompetitiveness Investment Act. It should be a Reid-McConnell piece of \nlegislation. It should have the support of every Member of the Senate. \nIt would, I hope, be passed before the February recess and sent to the \nHouse of Representatives, where I know Congressman Gordon and Speaker \nPelosi and Republicans and Democrats who care about this as much as we \ndo will be coming up with their own version of competitiveness \nlegislation.\n  This legislation would invest in basic scientific research and help \neducate the next generation of scientists. It would help us keep pace \nwith other nations that are moving swiftly to overtake our scientific \nleadership. More\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\nyoung people would have the opportunities these three students at Oak \nRidge High School have had. There is broad bipartisan support.\n  I hope the new majority leader will make this one of his first \ninitiatives in the Senate next year, just as he made it an important \ninitiative toward the end of this session.\n  If America is to continue to be the global economic leader, we cannot \nafford to let this wait.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, it is an interesting time to close a \ncongressional session. We are about to consider a major spending bill, \nhundreds of billions of dollars, and a major tax bill that will have an \nimpact on millions of Americans and scores of interest groups and \nbusinesses. It is interesting to see what the priorities are in the \nclosing moments. We know that there will be many groups, particularly \namong businesses, that will be benefited by this tax bill. But it is \ninteresting to me that in the list of priorities, sadly, there is a \ngroup that we are ignoring. That group, of course, is the children of \nthis country, the children who don't have health insurance.\n  Illinois started an ambitious program last year to make sure all kids \nin Illinois have health care insurance. It is surely the right thing to \ndo. Most uninsured children with asthma never see a doctor until they \nare hospitalized with an acute attack. One study found that kids \nwithout health care are 25 percent more likely to miss school. Another \nfound that one in five children without health coverage needed glasses \nto see the chalkboard, but they didn't have any.\n  It is certainly wise to give these children health insurance. One in \nfour uninsured children uses the emergency room as their regular source \nof medical care. The Florida Healthy Kids Corporation reports that \nemergency room visits dropped 70 percent when uninsured children were \ngiven the opportunity to see a doctor in an office.\n  Illinois's All Kids Program is ambitious, and it is working. But we \ncan't do it alone. In 1997, the Federal Government made its first \ndownpayment on a program for States to help make sure children have \naccess to health care. The State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nknown as SCHIP, began when Congress and the White House agreed that \nchildren in America should be able to see a doctor when they are sick, \nwhen they need to buy glasses to see the chalkboard or when they need \nto be protected from infectious disease. Today, 9 years later, after \nthe first Federal payments were delivered, 10 million children in \nAmerica are without health insurance.\n  In Illinois, we are providing basic, bare-bones health care for \n122,700 low-income children through the SCHIP program. The State has to \nmatch the Federal money, but we couldn't do it without the Federal \nhelp. This year the Federal payments will run out before the bills are \npaid. In fact, we are told the SCHIP payment will be 60 percent of what \nthe Federal payment needs to be to maintain the current caseload, not \nto expand it and bring in more uninsured children, just to cover those \nchildren who, without SCHIP, would have no health insurance.\n  On Tuesday morning, the package that we are considering today \nincluded a bipartisan, no-cost provision to reallocate Federal SCHIP \nmoney so that Illinois and a dozen other States would be able to \nprovide basic health insurance coverage for the kids already in the \nprogram. Twenty-four hours later, on Wednesday morning, after \nnegotiations took place in the middle of the night, the SCHIP provision \nwas gone. A lot of other things remained. There are still lots of tax \nprovisions in there for special interest groups and businesses. Some of \nthem are worthy. Some of them I support. But it is interesting that the \nfirst casualty of negotiation turned out to be 10 million uninsured \nchildren. They were left behind. Suddenly, low-income children in at \nleast 11 States were dropped from this tax extender package. Merry \nChristmas from the United States Senate and the United States House of \nRepresentatives to these poor children who, because of our inaction and \nrefusal to acknowledge the need for this program, have decided not to \nfund it.\n  Suddenly the rug was pulled out from under 73,620 low-income kids in \nmy State. SCHIP payments to Illinois to take care of these kids will \nfall short by $150 million. We made a promise to help these kids 9 \nyears ago. These kids are innocent children. All they are asking for is \nthe basics--the chance to go to a doctor, a chance to get the shots \nthey need so they can avoid serious illnesses, a chance to get the \nglasses they need to be good students in the classroom, just the \nbasics. This Congress, in its efforts to adjourn, to go home and enjoy \nthe holidays with our own children and our own families, has forgotten \nsome kids across America who need help in the SCHIP program.\n  I urge my colleagues not to give up on this issue. When we start to \ndebate this tax extender bill in the hours ahead, I hope all my \ncolleagues from affected States will come to the floor and will call to \nthe attention of every Member of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives how we have failed in meeting this priority.\n  I sincerely hope that if we are unable to restore these funds in \nthese closing hours, that this will indeed be a high priority of the \nnew Congress when it resumes its work in January of next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11591-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11591-S11592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE IMPORTANCE OF SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the 109th Congress fades into memory and \nthe 110th Congress comes into view, I want to say a few words about the \nimportance of Senate rules. One of our finest accomplishments over the \nlast 2 years was something that the Senate chose not to do. In May \n2005, the Senate turned aside the so-called nuclear option and decided \nto preserve the rules of the Senate which allow for extended debate on \njudicial nominations.\n  Almost a century ago the Senate adopted rule XXII which formalized \nthe principle of extended debate and established a balanced mechanism \nfor limiting debate. The current version of rule XXII requires two-\nthirds of the Senate to cut off debate on any change in the rules and \nthree-fifths of the Senate to cut off debate on any other question \nbefore the body. The nuclear option would have forced a change in this \nvenerable Senate rule by the brute force of a simple majority vote.\n  The campaign to rewrite Senate rules was misguided from the start. It \nwas a raw abuse of power fueled by a misreading of history. The Senate \ncame dangerously close to adopting this plan. On the eve of the \nshowdown vote, a courageous band of 14 Senators, 7 Democrats and 7 \nRepublicans, came together to derail it. They agreed to vote as a block \nagainst the nuclear option in exchange for an up-or-down vote on a \nhandful of disputed court of appeals nominees.\n  I feel very comfortable that had that vote occurred, this same result \nwould have followed, but did I want to roll the dice on that? The \nanswer is no. In the aftermath of that so-called Gang of 14 agreement, \nI was asked who won? I said the American people won. I am happy to \nreport that commentators since then have also said that the American \npeople won.\n  Had the nuclear option prevailed, it is almost certain that other \nvaluable Senate traditions would soon have fallen to political \nexpediency, raw power, simple majority vote, and we would have become \nanother House of Representatives. Confirmation of a handful of \ncontroversial court of appeals nominees was a small price to pay for \npreserving the sanctity of the Senate rules for future generations.\n  The nuclear option was the most important issue I have worked on in \nmy public life. Its rejection was my proudest moment as minority \nleader. I emerged from the episode with a renewed appreciation for the \nmajesty of\n\n[[Page S11592]]\n\nSenate rules. As majority leader, I intend to run the Senate with \nrespect for the rules and for the minority rights the rules protect.\n  The Senate was not established to be efficient. Sometimes the rules \nget in the way of efficiency. The Senate was established to make sure \nthat minorities are protected. Majorities can always protect \nthemselves, but minorities cannot. That is what the Senate is all \nabout. For more than 200 years, the rules of the Senate have protected \nthe American people, and rightfully so.\n  The need to muster 60 votes in order to terminate Senate debate \nnaturally frustrates the majority and oftentimes the minority. I am \nsure it will frustrate me when I assume the office of majority leader \nin a few weeks. But I recognize this requirement is a tool that serves \nthe long-term interest of the Senate and the American people and our \ncountry.\n  It is often said that the laws are ``the system of wise restraints \nthat set men free.'' The same might be said of the Senate rules.\n  I will do my part as majority leader to foster respect for the rules \nand traditions of our great institution. I say on this floor that I \nlove so much that I believe in the Golden Rule. I am going to treat my \nRepublican colleagues the way that I expect to be treated. There is no \n``I've got you,'' no get even. I am going to do everything I can to \npreserve the traditions and rules of this institution that I love.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later today we will be considering the \nVietnamese proposal for permanent normalized trade relations. Before \nconsideration of that issue, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss \nwhat I believe to be the beauty of freedom and the power that just one \nindividual can have in personifying a truly transcendent value.\n  Recently I had the opportunity to come to know a young woman in \nOrlando, FL, a constituent of mine named Liz McCausland.\n  She contacted my office some months ago with a seemingly simple \nrequest. She wanted to see her mother. Her mother is Thuong Nguyen \nFoshee. She goes by ``Cuc.'' At the time of the request, Mrs. Foshee, a \nU.S. citizen, born in Vietnam, was sitting in a Vietnamese jail. She \nhad been in that jail for some period of time and she had not been \ncharged with a crime. She had not had the benefit of counsel. She had \nnot been informed of the charges against her in any way, shape or form.\n  For several weeks immediately after her arrest, her family didn't \neven know where she was. This ordeal began in September 2005. She had \nno hope for due process. She had the need for some medical care and \nattention, and this went wanting for several weeks, if not months. She \nfinally began to have contact with the U.S. consul, and it was a 20-\nminute visit once a month.\n  At the time of her arrest, Mrs. Foshee had gone to Vietnam, her \nnative country, as a U.S. citizen to attend a nephew's wedding. The \nVietnamese Government, at some point or another, finally said she was \nsuspected of terrorist activity. The fact is that it should not come as \na surprise that the Vietnamese Government was not fond of Mrs. Foshee \nbecause she was one of those people, whom I can certainly identify \nwith, who believes it is the right of every person, no matter where \nthey live, to elect their leaders--something as simple as what we did \non November 7 in this country, which we take for granted. There are \nstill people around the world who are denied such a right.\n  The Vietnamese people today cannot elect their leaders. Cuc Foshee \nbelieves that a Vietnam that is free to elect their leadership is a \nVietnam that would respect also the rights of all of its people. So \nbecause she was someone who was vocal in the Vietnamese-American \ncommunity and spoke freely of her hope and wishes for her native land, \nshe actually became an obvious target to a government that felt \nthreatened by the voice of a common citizen who believed she should \nspeak out.\n  For that, Cuc Foshee and several other Americans, in fact, were \narrested, interrogated, and sent to jail, without the knowledge of when \nor if they would ever be released or allowed to return to the United \nStates. Many people went to work on this problem. Today, I thank our \nSecretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, for her interest in this matter, \nand I particularly thank U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Michael Marine, \nand the staff of the U.S. State Department, and others, whether in \nVietnam or in the State Department here, who worked on her case. \nVolunteers came to help. The law firm of Holland & Knight offered their \nservices pro bono. In addition to that, I particularly note and thank \nmembers of my staff who worked diligently and passionately to seek the \nrelease of Mrs. Foshee. Melissa Hernandez, in my office in Florida, and \nJohn Goetchius, here in Washington, worked hand-in-glove with Mrs. \nFoshee's daughter, Liz McCausland, and others, to see that Mrs. Foshee \ncame safely back to the United States. She has been returned to the \nUnited States, and it has been a wonderful blessing to her family.\n  We recently celebrated, in Orlando, her return home. Congressman Ric \nKeller was also there, my colleague, who also step-by-step was a \npartner for me in seeking the release of Mrs. Foshee.\n  So when the permanent normal trade relations between the U.S. and \nVietnam came to be considered, I objected to the legislation being \nconsidered until I was confident that Mrs. Foshee would be able to \nreceive the kind of due process that we expect as a matter of course, \nwhich she deserves under any observance of human rights, and until she \nwould be back with her family in Orlando. That has now occurred.\n  Mrs. Foshee's freedom has allowed me to lift any objections to \nconsideration of the PNTR status as it relates to Vietnam. While I will \nvote for that today, I must say that concerns remain. Vietnam's \ndisregard for the rule of law is something that is not only troubling, \nbut it will make normal trade relations difficult with free societies.\n  It would be good for the Government of Vietnam to understand that \ntolerance, as it relates to people's willingness to practice religion \nas they see fit, is important in order to join the family of nations in \na full and complete way.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the Government of Vietnam in allowing \nMrs. Foshee to come back to America and be free. But I must suggest \nthat, at the same time, it is hollow if it is only for Mrs. Foshee \nbecause of the pressure brought to bear her case. The right of people \nto freely speak, elect their leaders, and to live in a democratic \nsystem is the only way for the people of Vietnam to fulfill the promise \nthat they have, to fulfill the promise that can come through normalized \ntrade relations with the United States.\n  The people of Vietnam not only can have normal trade relations, they \nmust live it. They will find that the rule of law will be a troubling \nmatter if it is not observed. Whether it is foreign businesspeople \ntraveling to Vietnam, whether it is the rule of law as it applies to \ncontracts, it is a fundamental, essential, integral part of normal \ntrade relations. Mrs. Foshee's hope was that others in Vietnam would \nhave the opportunity to live in freedom such as she has tasted in \nAmerica. I hope that day will come as well.\n  My career as a public servant has been irrevocably influenced by this \nexperience. I believe I will never do anything greater than to have \nplayed a part in securing the freedom of one individual. I know what it \nmeans. I understand what it is like to live under oppression. I believe \nthat all people, no matter where they are, are entitled to live with \nthe dignity and the hope that comes from understanding that there is \nfreedom and there are human rights that are observed.\n  Each of us owes a debt of gratitude to Mrs. Foshee for taking a stand \nfor freedom and, in her own example, leading us to know that it has a \nvalue, even if at times a price must be paid for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11592-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11592-S11593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REAUTHORIZING THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the tax \nextender package that will be coming over from the House. It is a very \nimportant measure, one of the last items of business that probably will \nbe passed in this session. It is such an important bill. I have to say \nit doesn't have everything we had hoped it would have. But the \nimportant parts that are included are very important. The sales tax \ndeduction--the deductibility of State sales taxes--is a huge item of \nequity for taxpayers in our country.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, there are eight States that do not \nhave income taxes. Yet between the years of 1986 and 2004, there was an \ninequity. If a State chose to have State income taxes to raise its \nrevenue, their citizens could deduct from their Federal income taxes \nthose State income taxes. But if a State didn't have an income tax and \ninstead raised its State revenue with State sales taxes, you could not \ndeduct the sales taxes on your income tax. It was a huge inequity.\n  It is essential that in our country we have the same treatment for \nthe people of every State regarding how they pay their State taxes. So \nthis bill, the tax extender package, which will be voted on either \ntonight or tomorrow, is that equalizer. It does extend for 2 more years \nthe sales tax deduction that would be allowed, just as State income \ntaxes are deductible, from your Federal income tax return. We have had \nthat opportunity for 2 years--2004 and 2005. This would have it \navailable for 2006, this year, and next year, 2007.\n  The taxpayers in Texas, Alaska, Florida, Washington State, Nevada, \nSouth Dakota, Tennessee, and Wyoming would be set to have the penalty \nif this bill does not pass. This is something I have worked on for \nyears. Since I came to the Senate, I have tried to equalize this \ninequity. Finally, in 2004, we were able to do that, and now we cannot \nlet this equity go. There are many people who have worked to make this \nhappen, especially the leaders of the Senate. Senator Frist and Senator \nReid have been working on this, as I have, for all these years, trying \nto do what is right by our States, as well as the other States that are \naffected in this way. We won that right in 2004, and now we will be \nable to go forward and continue the equitable treatments of all \ntaxpayers in our country.\n  The other points in the bill that I think are so important are the \ndeduction for college tuition and fees. This can give up to $4,000 to \nfamilies who are sending children to college. That is something that \nmakes a huge difference to the families in our country who are paying \nthe ever-increasing college tuition rates. It has a $250 deduction for \na teacher who buys classroom supplies out of their own pockets. I know \nteacher after teacher in this country who has seen a child who doesn't \nhave a workbook or who wants to enhance the quality of instruction, so \nthe teacher buys, from her own pocketbook, the supplies that will \nenhance the educational opportunity. Yet the teachers have done it out \nof the goodness of their hearts, not because they are highly paid--\nbecause we know teachers are notoriously underpaid. It is because they \ncare about the students and about the learning. So we have a deduction \nfor those teachers who have done this, and that is in the bill before \nus in this Congress.\n  We will extend the research and development tax credit. That has been \nthe lifeblood of innovation in our country. We have extended this \ncredit 11 times since it was enacted in 1981. We know that it has \nhelped us remain competitive, with increased competition from foreign \ncountries, and has added American jobs because of the creativity and \ntechnological innovation that has been provided. I wish that we had a \nfew more tax cuts.\n  We have an inequitable situation with timber taxes, where we have a \ncompetition with foreign countries that are subsidized. It is my \npriority to work on that going forward. It is not in this bill. I wish \nit were. I pledge my efforts, along with many other States, to extend \nor to have this tax credit reenacted.\n  There is also a very important energy production bill that is in the \ntax extender package. It is a bill that passed the Senate with full \nsupport, and it will bring the cost of energy down. It is the opening \nof leases 181 and 181 South in the Gulf of Mexico. These are leases \nthat will open up natural gas and oil, which will have a major impact \non the cost of fuel in our country.\n  It is good for America. We must look to our own natural resources to \nstop our dependence on foreign resources for energy. If we are going to \nremain secure in our country, and if we are going to remain in control \nof our economy, we will pass this legislation that opens up these very \nimportant leases in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  While no bill is perfect, no bill does everything everybody wants, I \nam in strong support of the tax extender bill. I have heard people \nspeak against the bill and say: How can we pass tax cuts when we have \ndeficits? The fact of the matter is, we have higher revenue when we \nhave tax cuts. We have had the highest revenue in the history of \nAmerica since the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. We have brought the \ndeficit down and have cut it in half already because of the tax cuts. \nThe stock market is hitting new highs because of the tax cuts.\n  I hope we will continue to extend tax cuts for hard-working Americans \nto make our country competitive, to keep the revenue coming in, to \nbring the deficit down, and to keep the healthy economy that has caused \nour unemployment to go down to the lowest rates we have had in the last \nfour decades.\n  It is a good bill. We will work next year to increase the tax cuts, \nto continue the tax cuts and keep our robust economy and our low \nunemployment.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding me \nthis time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11593-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11593-S11598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  private first class joshua a. ramsey\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army PFC \nJoshua A. Ramsey from Defiance, OH, who died in Iraq on December 12, \n2004. He was 19 years old.\n  Joshua leaves behind his father and stepmother Bruce and Le'Ann, his \nmother Joy, and his brothers Brad and Ty. He is also survived by his \ngrandparents Robert and Margaret Ramsey and Jerry and Nancy Buckles.\n  Born in Norman, OK, Josh moved with his family to Ohio when he was 10 \nyears old. He attended Ayersville Elementary School and joined the Boy\n\n[[Page S11594]]\n\nScouts. He graduated from high school and the Four County Career Center \nin 2003, and joined the Army just 2 days later. He did not hesitate. He \nsimply knew it was time to serve his country. Josh was assigned to the \n95th Military Police Battalion based in Mannheim, Germany.\n  One of Josh's teachers at the Career Center, Tonya Fisher, remembers \nthat ``Josh was a good student and a good classmate. He worked really \nhard in class and was really dedicated. He knew he wanted to go into \nthe military.''\n  After graduating, Josh returned one August to talk to the students in \nthe public safety class. ``He gave us hugs,'' Tonya remembers, ``and \ntold teachers, `Everything you said was right.' ''\n  Josh Ramsey will be remembered for his compassion and his love of \nchildren. While serving in Iraq, his favorite job was distributing \nsoccer balls and school supplies to the kids he met. He would often \nstop his humvee, just so he could get out and talk to people. He told \nhis father Bruce that Iraqis simply wanted the same thing that we all \ndo--just to get by and to take care of their families. And that was \nJosh--always reaching out to others, always building bridges.\n  ``[Josh] loved his job,'' his mother Joy remembers. ``I know he died \ndoing what he wanted to do, and I find comfort in that.''\n  Josh had a passion for cars and one car, in particular--a fully-\nloaded silver Grand-Am GT that he bought while home on a 2-week leave. \nHe was going to have his brother Brad ``hot-rod it up'' for him. \nAccording to his stepmother Le'Ann, he couldn't wait to return home and \nshow it off to all his friends.\n  Josh's parents made a car payment for him as a Christmas gift, and \nJosh, himself, was making double payments on it with his Army salary. \nHe planned to have it paid off entirely in 2 years. A gasoline card for \nhim to bring home and use to fill up his gas tank was included in one \nof his care packages. On Josh's weekly phone calls home, he didn't want \nto talk about the war all that much--he wanted to talk about his car.\n  Josh's grandmother Margaret said that ``when it's 150 degrees, you \nneed something to dream about and to plan for. If it helped him through \nthe tough times, it was well worth it. We took pictures of him with his \nnew car, so he could show his buddies.''\n  Josh was a very family-oriented young man, and so hated to leave \nthem. He had a special relationship with his grandparents, and his \nmother Joy remembers the quiet times they shared during Josh's visits \nhome. He would go fishing and golfing. For dinner, he would ask Joy to \n``fry up those little brown things.'' These were chicken livers--one of \nJosh's favorite meals.\n  Josh always remained calm about the dangers he faced in Iraq, even \nwhen he admitted conditions were getting rough. As he told his mother \nJoy, ``Mom, I have one of the most dangerous jobs in the Army, but I \nwouldn't have it any other way.'' Josh also believed in his job--he \nbelieved in what he was doing. ``I think we're doing some good over \nthere, Dad,'' he told his father.\n  Josh had a bright future before him. He was interested in police work \nand had joined the Army partly because of the experience of working \nwith the military police. He also talked about becoming an American \nhistory teacher.\n  Josh was loved by all who knew him. He had so much energy and zest \nfor life. One friend, Christy, remembers that he drove a long way while \non leave just to see her and give her a hug. And another friend, David \nStreeter, wrote the following in an Internet tribute to Josh:\n\n       Josh was my best friend, and I loved him like a brother. I \n     first met him while I was in basic training and by some \n     strange luck, we where stationed in Mannheim together, then \n     in Iraq. Not a day goes by that I don't think about him, Rest \n     in peace Private First Class Ramsey.\n\n  Josh's cousin, Brooke Westcott, left this message for Josh:\n\n       Josh was my cousin, and we were like brother and sister. He \n     was always there for me when I needed him. He told me that we \n     would go graduation and birthday shopping for me. I miss him \n     so much and he will always be in my heart.\n\n  With his compassion and bravery, Josh truly made this world a better \nplace. He was devoted to his country, his fellow soldiers, and his \nfamily. His mother wears his military dog chains around her neck. Her \nson will never be forgotten.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of Josh Ramsey in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                   staff sergeant zach wobler tribute\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army SSG Zachary \nWobler, from Wheelersburg, OH, who died on February 6, 2005, when his \ndismounted patrol encountered small arms fire in Iraq. He leaves his \nwife Corissa, his daughter Trinity, his mother and stepfather Jeannette \nand Tim Poston, and his father Anthony Wobler. Zach--as his friends and \nfamily called him--was 24 years old at the time of his death.\n  Growing up in Ohio, Zach's parents taught him strong values--values \nthat Zach would carry with him throughout his entire life. He was \nalways hard-working, disciplined, and honest.\n  Zach, himself, once commented on how important honesty was to his \nfamily. In his words, ``My father was big on honesty when I was young. \nThat's one thing that was drilled into our family when I was young.'' \nZach's mother Jeannette said that he never caused her a moment's worry \ngrowing up. He was so friendly--he never met a stranger. ``People loved \nhim when they met him,'' she recalls.\n  Zach graduated from Ottawa-Glandorf High School in 1998, where he \nplayed football, competed in track and field, and was named the \nschool's senior homecoming attendant. After graduating, Zach studied at \nBowling Green University and joined the National Guard. He also took \nclasses at Owens Community College. Zach joined the Army in 2000. As \nhis father, said, ``My son was a true soldier. He was definitely a \nhero, and he was admired. He was truly a great person.''\n  Zach was very successful in the Army. He took advantage of every \ntraining opportunity available to him and quickly rose in the ranks. In \n2002, he was even named Paratrooper of the Year at Fort Bragg. As his \nstepfather Tim said, ``If Zach did any thing, he wanted to do it \ncompletely. He didn't do anything halfway.''\n  Zach was deployed to Iraq in 2003. While serving there, there was \nnothing more important to him than the men under his command. He always \nwanted to be on the front lines, and he always cared more about his \ncomrades' safety than his own. During his first deployment, his \nsuperiors wanted him to leave earlier than his troops, but Zach \nrefused. As his mother said, Zach ``was a natural sergeant. The men in \nhis unit loved him. He stayed with them, and they loved hanging out \nwith him.''\n  Even though during his first deployment to Iraq Zach suffered a knee \ninjury that required surgery, he decided that it was more important for \nhim to be with his men in Iraq than any place else. And so, he returned \nfor a second deployment. According to his mom, ``Zach's men weren't \ngoing without him.''\n  Zach was more than just an admired leader to the men he served with, \nhowever. He was also a friend and confidante. He could simply talk to \nanyone. Regardless of rank, they would come to him with problems--both \npersonal and professional. According to SPC Ryan Logue, a sniper in \nZach's scout team, ``Zach always put his men first, and took care of \nour needs both professionally and personally. He was my mentor. [He \nwas] like my older brother.''\n  SSG Mike Beal remembers Zach's cheerful nature and constant \nwillingness to help. He said: ``I couldn't find the words to describe \nhow I never heard Zach complain about anything or about how he was \nalways there for his friends.''\n  While Zach was, indeed, a committed soldier, he was also a devoted \nfamily man. According to his mother, the only thing that mattered to \nhim more than his job was his 3-year-old daughter, Trinity. ``[Zach] \ntold me that should anything happen to him,'' his mom said, ``He hoped \nthat his little girl would understand when she grew up that he did it \nfor her.''\n  Zach had a bright future before him. His dream was to eventually work \nin government intelligence. Based on his success throughout life, I \nhave no doubt he would have succeeded.\n  I would like to share something Zach said when talking about the \nchallenges of facing deployment. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S11595]]\n\n\n       Nobody knows `til it comes down to it whether you are ready \n     or not.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, Zach was ready. He always had been.\n  Army SSG Zachary Wobler was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. As \nhis father said:\n\n       He wanted to be buried there, because he has other friends \n     buried there. If it ever happened to him, he wanted to be \n     with the people who gave their lives in all of the wars.\n\n  Zach's father also remembers the dedication with which his son served \nour Nation. He said:\n\n       If Zach were here today, and you asked him if he would do \n     it again knowing what the outcome would be, he would say yes. \n     . . . He was excellent. He was a fantastic guy. I tell you \n     now, I miss him so badly.\n\n  Zach will never be forgotten. His wit and charm will always make his \nfriends and loved ones smile. They will remember how one of his quips \nwas once featured on the David Letterman Show. It was No. 3 on a list \nof ``Top Ten Questions To Ask Yourself Before Jumping Out of a \nHelicopter.'' Zach had replied: ``Am I really in that much of a hurry \nto get to the ground?''\n  Most importantly, Zach had a deep commitment to helping others. His \ncompassion touched so many people, and his family has received an \noutpouring of support. As his father said, ``I never realized there are \nso many people who cared so much.''\n  Mr. President, we do, indeed, care.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family and friends of SSG \nZachary Wobler in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                      SERGEANT MICHAEL C. O'NEILL\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army SGT Michael C. \nO'Neill from Mansfield, OH, who died on November 21, 2004, in Germany \nfrom injuries sustained in Afghanistan, while supporting Operation \nEnduring Freedom. He was 22 years old. Sergeant O'Neill leaves his \nparents George and Holly, his brother Kevin, and his grandmother Janet.\n  When I think about the dedication of our men and women in uniform in \ntheir efforts to promote and protect freedom, I am reminded of \nsomething President Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       Freedom is a fragile thing and is never more than one \n     generation away from extinction. It is not ours by \n     inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by \n     each generation for it comes only once to a people.\n\n  Michael O'Neill--Mike to his friends and family--rose to this \nchallenge of establishing freedom in both Afghanistan and Iraq. He \ndedicated his life to the service of our Nation and embraced the chance \nto help others who could not help themselves.\n  Mike was born on May 7, 1982, in San Rafael, California. His family \nlater moved to Mansfield, OH. In 2001, Mike graduated from Mansfield \nSenior High School. During high school, Mike was very active in \nathletics, especially soccer and cross-country. He also loved the \nKentucky Derby.\n  After graduation, Mike joined the Army and completed his training at \nFort Benning, GA, as an infantryman. He was assigned to B Company, 3rd \nBattalion, 75th Ranger Regiment.\n  Without question, Mike O'Neill was an extraordinarily dedicated \nsoldier. When he died, he was serving his fourth overseas deployment \nsince he had enlisted in 2001. He had served in Iraq as part of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.\n  Because of his honorable achievements in the Army, Michael has been \nawarded numerous medals--more than I can list here. But they include \nthe Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Meritorious Service Medal, and \nthe Army Achievement Medal.\n  Mike is deeply missed by all who knew him. They remember his blue \neyes and his bright smile. Shortly after his death, several friends \ngathered at Todd Basilone's house to comfort each other and to remember \nMichael. Brett Gordon said that they were all heartbroken. In Brett's \nwords, he owed everything to Mike.\n  Katie Mayo, another of Mike's former classmates, said that he had \nbeen an unbelievable person and a friend of hers since childhood.\n  Nick Sazdanoff is another of Mike's many, many friends. He spoke with \nMike over the phone just a few weeks before his death. He recalls how \ndedicated he was to the service. ``Mike is an outstanding soldier,'' he \nsaid.\n  Mike shared a strong bond with his friends. He, Brett Gordon, and \nTodd Basilone all had the same tattoo on their ankle--a tribal design. \nAccording to Brett, ``My freshman year in college we did it--right \nafter Mike got out of basic training.''\n  Michael O'Neill's death has been a loss to his entire community. He \nis the second 2001 graduate from Mansfield Senior High to have died \nserving in either Iraq or Afghanistan. The other, SPC A.J. Vandayburg \ndied on April 9, 2004, while deployed in Iraq. A.J.'s father Allen left \nMike the following message on an Internet tribute webpage:\n\n       Mike--you are a hero and were like a son to me. I know that \n     you and A.J. are together and have no more worries, but I \n     wish I had you both back. Till we all meet again, Mike, we \n     all love you. You were a true Ranger.''\n\n  A loving son and brother, Mike was also dedicated to his family. His \nparents Holly and George will never forget the wonderful memories they \nhave of their son, and I am honored that I was able to meet and speak \nwith them during calling hours held for Mike. His Uncle Michael--and \nnamesake--wrote his nephew the following message on an Internet tribute \npage:\n\n       Mike--I take this time during Memorial Day weekend to \n     remember you and to say how proud I am of you. I miss you \n     very much--even more so when I listen to a military ballad of \n     some sort. I never got the chance to thank you and all our \n     sons and daughters who are in service to our country. So, \n     I'll keep you all in my thoughts and prayers. God bless you, \n     Mike--my namesake and my nephew.\n\n  SGT Michael C. O'Neill truly embodied the Ranger Creed that reads, in \npart, as follows:\n\n       I accept the fact that as a Ranger, my country expects me \n     to move further, faster and fight harder than any other \n     soldier . . . I will shoulder more than my share of the task \n     whatever it may be, one hundred percent and then some. . . .\n\n  Mike was an honorable soldier and an honorable man, who will live on \nin the hearts and minds of all those who had the privilege of knowing \nhim. My wife Fran and I continue to keep his friends and family in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                     sergeant joseph garmback, jr.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Ohioan--Army SGT Joseph \nMartin Garmback, Jr., from Cleveland. He died in service to our country \non July 8, 2004, while stationed in Samara, Iraq, about 70 miles north \nof Baghdad, where he and the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry's mortar \nplatoon were halfway through a shift at an Iraqi National Guard \nheadquarters. Sergeant Garmback was 24 years old.\n  Sergeant Garmback leaves his mom and dad Marylon and Joseph Garmback, \nSr., his three sisters Susan, Arlene, and Christine, and his girlfriend \nChristiane.\n  Joseph was born on April 9, 1980, in Cleveland. He grew up in the \nsame West Park neighborhood where his family went to church--where he \nwas baptized, received his first communion, and went to Sunday school. \nMembers of his community cherish their fond memories of the fun loving, \nconsiderate, and loyal Joey Garmback, as he was known to those closest \nto him.\n  Joey grew up with a strong conviction to serve the United States as a \nsoldier in the Army--just as his father had. At the age of 16, Joey \nleft high school and took on a job running parties for a catering firm \nowned by Bill Rini. Bill remembers Joey well and describes him as a \n``very kind, compassionate kid, who worked for everything he got.'' \nBill saw Joey growing into a capable young man. Knowing of Joey's \ninterest in the Army, Bill introduced him to his friend, SGT James \nMauer, who helped Joey earn his high school diploma and enlist in the \nArmy in May 2002.\n  Joey was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 26th Regiment, 1st Infantry \nDivision out of Germany. His father had been a paratrooper, and Joey \ntold his parents that he planned to re-enlist in jump school after \nfinishing his first term of service. During his time in the military, \nSGT Garmback was an extremely decorated solder, earning 16 medals, \nincluding the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.\n  But, though his medals and awards are a sign of his dedication, Joey \nwas so much more than the ribbons and medals he earned. He was a \nwonderful son, friend, and brother. Joey lived the way he served--with \npassion, love, and a strong loyalty for those around him.\n  The last days Joey spent at home were happy and busy. He returned \nfrom\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\nGermany over Christmas, and as a present, Joey's family took him to a \ndifferent place every day--to the arcade, to the movies, on road trips. \nJoey spent his last days with his family, doing all of his favorite \nthings.\n  Joey left a lasting impression on this world. Those who knew him will \nnever forget his smile, his compassion, or his fierce dedication. One \nof Joey's childhood friends, Laura Weimer, wrote this note to the \nGarmback family:\n\n       I have known you all for many years. Joey and I grew up \n     together, and I had the honor of watching him grow from a kid \n     to a wonderful young man. Joey is a hero who fought bravely \n     for our country. He will always be remembered and missed. \n     Joey is part of who I am today, and I will always cherish \n     him.\n\n  Indeed, SGT Garmback lives on in the hearts of his family, the \nfriends he grew up with, and those he fought beside. SGT Owen Fulsome, \none of these men, wrote the following message to Joey after his death:\n\n  Garmback--you were a good friend and an excellent soldier. We had a \nlot of good times in Germany. You always gave 100 percent to our squad \ndown there, and I will never forget you. You are truly a hero and the \nMortars were lucky to serve with you.\n\n  Starr Richmond grew up with Joseph and was proud to watch him become \na strong and able young man. This is what Starr said about Joey:\n\n       There are no words to express how much Joe will be missed \n     and always be loved. It is always hard to lose someone and \n     even harder when it is your child. But, with family, friends, \n     and love, it helps the hurt. Joe . . . did more in his time \n     than most people his age will ever do. He was a great friend, \n     and he became our hero. Always remember the time we had with \n     him. Whether it was sad and you cried with him or angry and \n     you yelled with him, especially remember the times he brought \n     a smile to your face and made you laugh. I will always \n     remember the fun times as kids and remember him growing into \n     a man and fighting for our country. He will be greatly missed \n     and loved forever. Thank you, Joe, for being my friend.\n\n  SGT Joseph Garmback, Jr., was a good man who worked hard and loved \nhis family and his country. We will always remember him and we will \nalways be proud of him.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Joseph's family in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n\n\n                             Brian Wagoner\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to civilian contractor \nBrian Wagoner, originally from Maumee, OH, who was killed on March 3, \n2005, when a roadside bomb exploded as he was escorting a convoy of \nengineers in Iraq. He was 30 years old.\n  As a civilian contractor providing security as Iraq is rebuilt, Brian \nplayed an indispensable role in preserving that nation's newly found \nfreedoms. Brian worked for contractors who worked with the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers to destroy captured enemy munitions. Brian's job was \nto protect the people responsible for defusing the weapons of the \ninsurgency. Brian was on the front lines.\n  On March 3rd, 2005, Brian and his colleague and friend Jimmy Riddle \nwere accompanying a convoy of workers to an ammunition storage point in \nAl Ashraf, Iraq. During this convoy operation, a roadside bomb was \ndetonated. Both Brian and Jimmy were killed instantly.\n  Brian's life ended in service, protecting others and keeping them out \nof harm's way. Reflecting on his life, family and friends remember \nBrian Wagoner as a man who always wanted to serve others. Growing up in \nMaumee, he sought responsibility. At Maumee High School, he volunteered \nto manage the football team. Even though he didn't play, he was a key \ncontributor to the team. As former Maumee High football coach Hal \nLaFountaine remembered, ``He was a real find for us. He was quiet, \nunassuming, and just did his job. For him to become the professional he \nwas and the things he did, it made sense. It fit his personality. He \nwas a team player.''\n  After graduating from Maumee High School in 1994, Brian left Ohio for \nNorth Carolina and military service. He spent 4 years in the Army's \n82nd Airborne as a member of the Air Defense Artillery unit at Fort \nBragg. Near the end of his time serving in the Army, Brian married the \nlove of his life Melissa, or ``Missy'' as he called her.\n  Brian and Missy had three beautiful children together, Bryce, \nBrandon, and Allyson. No matter where Brian was or what he was doing, \nhis family remained the center of his universe.\n  With a young family to support, Brian left the Army and enrolled in \nschool to become a police officer. Applying the discipline and work \nethic he learned at Fort Bragg, Brian quickly worked his way from \npatrolman to police chief of Pinebluff, NC.\n  He was promoted to the top spot at just 26 years of age. As if his \nservice in the military and work in the police force weren't enough, \nBrian volunteered as a firefighter in his spare time. As his wife \nexplained, ``Brian was a fearless guy. He was in the military. He was a \nvolunteer firefighter. He was a police chief.'' Anywhere there was an \nopportunity to get involved and help others, that's where you'd find \nBrian. He always wanted to be where the action was.\n  While serving as police chief in Pinebluff, Brian was recruited by a \ndefense contractor based in Minden, NV, that provides security for \ncompanies overseas. His expertise in law enforcement made him a prime \ncandidate to protect workers rebuilding Iraq. Given his leadership \ntraining and as a chief of police, Brian was also well suited to train \nthe newly constituted Iraqi police. By any measure, the job was a great \nfit.\n  Brian saw the opportunity to work in private security as the chance \nto give his family a better life. As Missy explained, ``Most of all, \nBrian wanted to provide for his family. He wanted to be able to give \nthe children and me anything he possibly could.''\n  Through this job, Brian would be able to secure a better future for \nhis family, while also satisfying his desire to serve his country \nabroad. He accepted the offer in 2004.\n  Brian's assignment in Iraq was a dangerous one. His assignment was to \nconfiscate explosives. Even though his family worried, Brian only saw \nopportunity, excitement, and a chance to give. When he wasn't clearing \nexplosives, Brian gave Iraqi children clothes his own kids outgrew. \nThat was the essence of the man--simultaneously a protector and a \nprovider and--at all times--selfless.\n  Even though he was thousands of miles away, Brian kept in close \ncontact with his loved ones. As Missy recalled, ``There was not a \nmoment that went by that he did not tell me that he loved me, missed \nme, or that I was beautiful.'' No matter the distance that separated \nthem, Brian's heart was always with his family.\n  Brian's death was devastating for his family, his friends, and his \ncommunity. It was not only sudden, but he was scheduled to return home \nfrom Iraq to his family in only 9 days.\n  A memorial service for Brian Wagoner was held at the Church of St. \nAndrews United Methodist in Toledo. Brian was buried in Fayetteville, \nNC. A flag outside of the Pinebluff, NC, townhall flew at halfstaff in \nhonor of Brian's service as chief of police and firefighter.\n  Today, we honor and remember him again here on the Senate Floor. \nAlthough Brian Wagoner is gone, memories of him remain. He will be \nremembered as a lighthearted, humorous man, who loved NASCAR and who \nwould take his wife to the shops of Hendrick Motorsports and Dale \nEarnhardt, Inc.\n  Brian Wagoner will be remembered as an avid outdoors man, who had a \npassion for people and animals. ``He was always on the go, even when he \nwas young,'' his father recalled. ``He loved to fish, he loved to \nswim--he really liked to be on the go. But, even though he was very \nbusy, he always had time for his kids.''\n  And that is how Brian will be most vividly remembered--as a family \nman who put his family and their future ahead of all else. ``You could \ntell he loved his wife and his kids,'' said Pinebluff Town Clerk Betty \nMcDuffie. ``The last time we spoke . . . we talked about getting \ntogether and having a cookout in March, when he got home.''\n  Just this past November, Brian was honored by the United States Army \nwith the Defense of Freedom Medal--the civilian equivalent of the \nPurple Heart. It is an award that he richly deserved. We are proud of \nhim and his service.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep his family and friends in our \nthoughts and prayers. Our hearts go out to\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nBrian's father Jim, his mother Barbara, his brothers Jason and \nChristopher, and his wife Melissa and their children Bryce, Brandon, \nand Allyson.\n\n\n                         Specialist Jason Lucas\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army SPC Jason Lucas \nfrom London, OH, who lost his life October 13, 2006, while serving our \ncountry in Afghanistan as a part of the NATO peace keeping force. Army \nSpecialist Lucas was killed when his vehicle was attacked by a suicide \nbomber. He was 24 years old.\n  Jason was a brave soldier, who was proud to serve. He had a warm \nheart and a big, infectious smile. His friends and loved ones often \ncalled him ``Smiley.'' He leaves behind his wife Monica their two sons \nZausten and Ethan, his father Bill, his mother Beth; and his sister \nSamantha.\n  Jason was born in Columbus and grew up in London. For 2 years, he \nlived in McEwen, TN. While there, he worked on farms and learned how to \nhunt deer and turkey. He was called ``Cutie,'' because he always had \ngirlfriends. He enjoyed playing football and basketball while growing \nup, but his favorite sport was always baseball. Jason graduated from \nLondon High School.\n  Unsure exactly what career to pursue after graduation, Jason worked \nin a warehouse for a time and at various other jobs. His mother recalls \nhis interest in being a firefighter, policeman, FBI agent, or working \nwith the Drug Enforcement Administration. But instead of pursuing these \nadmirable careers, Jason chose to become a United States soldier. ``He \nloved being in the Army,'' his high school sweetheart and wife Monica \nremembers. ``He was the best guy. He loved being in charge.''\n  Jason's take charge attitude led him to the position of squad leader \nat the Army's boot camp in Fort Polk and then again in Afghanistan. \n``Jason was proud of what he did,'' recalls his mother, Beth. While \nserving overseas, he had told her, ``I was trained by the best, and I'm \nworking with the best. Don't worry about me.''\n  CPL Christopher Jackson remembers this same determined spirit. This \nis what he said:\n\n       His personality made training easier. He . . . wasn't \n     afraid to stand up and take charge. When you were with him, \n     you wanted to work for him. He didn't have to tell you to \n     work.\n\n  Jason loved his work, and what kept him and his fellow soldiers in \ngood spirit through the tough times was his incredible sense of humor. \n``Lucas was an excellent soldier, but his personality was his greatest \nasset,'' 1LT Daron Moreno said. ``He knew how to live and how to make \nothers laugh.''\n  First Lieutenant Moreno remembers when Jason would perform his \nfavorite impersonation, acting like a high school football coach, \nsticking out his gut and screaming, ``What the heck is going on here? I \ncan't believe what you are doing'' First Lieutenant Moreno said that \nJason would continue ``ranting and raving'' as the coach and that by \nthe end of his performance, the rest of the soldiers would be rolling \nover with laughter.\n  Indeed, Jason's enthusiasm and humor could make any day fun. His \nfriends--Cheryl, Joe, and Chance--from Grove City, OH, remember one of \nthese days, in particular, with Jason. Together, they wrote the \nfollowing on Jason's Internet tribute webpage:\n\n       We will never forget our times we spent with Jason--\n     especially the day at King's Island. We rode a couple rides \n     that only Jason could talk us into. We had such a great time \n     when we were together. Jason kept in touch after joining the \n     service and it was always nice to hear from him. We will \n     never forget him or what he did for our country. Our deepest \n     sympathies go out to [his wife and children] and to the rest \n     of Jason's family. We were so saddened to hear of the loss of \n     Jason. It was an honor to have known him as a friend and a \n     Hero.\n\n  Jason Lucas was more than just a funny guy--especially to his family. \nHe was a dedicated father and loving husband, and spent as much time as \nhe could with his family. His son Zausten, is always wanting to play \nArmy--to be just like his daddy. According to Jason's wife, little \nZausten can identify Army helicopters and planes and wants only Army \nclothes and toys.\n  Monica remembers how important it was to Jason to keep in touch with \nhis family while abroad. ``We talked to him every day--about three \ntimes if not more,'' she said. ``He was a great daddy.''\n  Jason was home this past summer spending time with his wife and \nchildren. He also spent time with his father Bill. ``We had a lot of \nfun,'' Bill recalls. ``I'm just thankful of the time I had to spend \nwith him, especially this past July before he left.''\n  In September, Jason left for Afghanistan for what was supposed to be \nhis last year overseas. Jason and Monica had plans to move the family \nto Fort Polk, where Jason had planned to return by December. They \ndidn't intend to settle there for long, however. ``Maybe Kentucky or \nTennessee,'' Monica recalls, would be where they intended to settle \ndown. Together, they dreamt of moving somewhere beautiful when he was \ndischarged.\n  Jason's family will miss him deeply. Monica and their sons left Jason \nthe following message for Jason on the Internet. This is what they \nwrote:\n\n       Daddy, we love you with all our heart, we will never forget \n     you.\n\n  Jason will be remembered affectionately for his commitment to his \nfamily and for his dedicated service to our country.\n  He was always trying to make others laugh and bring a smile to their \nfaces. He could make everyday fun. His bright, beaming smile will never \nbe forgotten. We will always remember him as a brave and courageous \nsoldier.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of Army SP Jason Lucas \nin our thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                       Sergeant Nathaniel S. Rock\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marine SGT Nathaniel \nRock from Toronto, OH. Along with 5 other members of his sniper unit, \nSergeant Rock was killed on August 1, 2005, while on a mission in the \nAl Anbar province of Iraq. He was 26 years old.\n  Sergeant Rock leaves his parents Adriana and Tim, his sisters Nicole \nand Tara, his brother Jared Rock, and his niece and nephew, Taylor and \nElija.\n  Growing up, ``Nate'', as his friends and family called him, was \nalways drawn to the military. When he was only 12 years old, he loved \nto eat the military pre-packaged meals that he got from his sister's \nMarine husband. His favorite clothes were camouflage, and ``Army'' was \nhis favorite game to play.\n  Nate also loved to hunt and fish, and loved his mom's cooking--\nspaghetti, homemade soup, and cabbage rolls. He graduated from Toronto \nHigh School in 1997, and enlisted in the Marines when he was only 17. \nThe decision wasn't a surprise to anyone who knew him. He served in the \nMarines for 6 years and then joined the Marine Reserves in 2003. His \nparents were always supportive of his decision to serve. As his father \nsaid, ``It is some comfort to us that we know he was doing what he \nwanted--what he loved to do.''\n  Nate was also a graduate of the Jefferson Community College Police \nAcademy in Steubenville, OH. Michael Garcia attended the Academy with \nNate and reflected upon his friend in the following message on an \nInternet tribute website. This is what he wrote:\n\n       I never met a man in my life who was as honest, outspoken, \n     and courageous as Nate. He was probably the most liked person \n     in the Academy. He was serious most of the time, but if you \n     got on his good side and got him to laugh, he wouldn't shut \n     up and was your best friend from that day forward. Everyone--\n     teachers and students, alike--respected him and liked him. \n     But, he earned his respect from us because of his abilities. \n     We knew what he was capable of being--[and that was] a United \n     States Marine.\n\n  After graduating from the Police Academy, Nate became a part-time \npoliceman for the Martins Ferry Police Department, where his brother, \nJared, also worked. Martins Ferry Police Chief Barry Carpenter \nremembers that Nate was an excellent young officer--talented, with so \nmuch potential.\n  ``He was a young police officer who took a vested interest in \neveryone and especially his work,'' Chief Carpenter said. ``He was here \nat every opportunity, and I especially liked him. I always saved a spot \nfor him.''\n  Chief Carpenter also remembers that serving in the Marines was simply \nNate's dream. ``It was a goal he'd always had and a goal he was able to \nachieve,'' he said. ``It allowed him to serve his country.''\n  Nate was, indeed, a proud and dedicated Marine. In a Mother's Day \ncard that he sent to his mother, he explained his reasons for serving. \nThis is what he wrote: ``I'm sorry I'm putting\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\nyou through this, but I couldn't sit on the sidelines and watch Marines \nbeing hurt on the TV.''\n  This was Nate. He always wanted to be involved--he always wanted to \nbe there for his fellow Marines. That was the type of man he was.\n  As his father Tim said, ``He was proud to be a Marine--to be serving \nhis country. He was true to his duty and true to his men.''\n  SGT Brian Casagrande served with Nate and the other fallen members of \nhis unit. In a eulogy for them, he had this to say about Nate:\n\n       Nate Rock was a Marine who made his presence known wherever \n     he was. Before the platoon left for Twenty-nine Palms, he was \n     incorporated into my team, and I quickly came to respect him \n     as a man and a Marine. After arriving in country, he led his \n     own team. We soon became friends and came to know everything \n     about each other. He will not only be missed by me and the \n     platoon, but by his family that he constantly talked about \n     and his fellow police officers who he served with in Martin's \n     Ferry, Ohio.\n\n  I had the privilege of meeting Nate family and speaking with them at \nNate's calling hours. He was a courageous young man--someone who valued \nhis friendships and loved his family dearly, as they loved him.\n  Nate's death has been a loss to his entire community. One of his \nformer teachers, Roy Golec, remembers Nate for the rare sense of \nintegrity and purpose he had even as a teenager. ``He could do just \nabout anything he put his mind to,'' Roy said. ``He had his head on \nstraight, and he knew what he wanted to do.''\n  Joe Neeper, Nate's neighbor, had known him all his life. According to \nJoe, Nate was the epitome of professionalism and loved being a Marine. \nHe was always disciplined, committed, and ready to serve. As Joe said, \n``When you talked to Nate, you noticed he had the Marine Corps \nattitude.''\n  In Nate's memory, the Northeast Ohio Dog Training Academy gave the \nMartins Ferry Police Department a new drug dog. He was named ``Rock,'' \nafter their fallen officer.\n  One of Nate's fishing companions and brothers-in-arms, John Howard, \nreflected on his friend in the following message:\n\n       Every time I cast my line out, I am overwhelmed with great \n     memories of the good times Rock and I had while fishing the \n     Potomac River. The last summer of our active service, it \n     became a nightly ritual to throw the rods and tackle boxes \n     into Nate truck and head down to the dock for catfishing. \n     Even when the fish weren't biting, our stories would keep us \n     occupied.\n\n  And Joel Andrade, who served with Nate in the Marine Corps from 1998 \nto 2001, said this about his fellow Marine:\n\n       Nate stood out from the rest. I remember him as a quiet, \n     polite guy, who was respected by everyone. He was always \n     willing to help anybody who needed help and always greeted \n     you whenever he saw you.\n\n  The world is a better place because of Nathaniel Rock. He intuitively \nunderstood the importance of service. He loved his family. He loved his \ncountry. He was a dedicated, committed marine, who is missed by his \nfamily, friends, comrades, and community.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Sergeant Rock family in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I come to the floor with several \nobjectives. We will be voting later tonight. We are still waiting for \nthe bills to come over from the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11598-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11598-S11599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TENNESSEE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we serve in a class of Senators, we have \nseveral roles. We wear several hats. Probably the most important one is \nto represent the people who elected us, and that is our constituents \nback home in our home States. That has been for me a real honor over \nthe last 12 years, to serve the people of Tennessee.\n  In addition to that, of course, we serve America as 100 individuals \nrepresenting this entire country. That is a real privilege. If you are \nelected to leadership, you have other responsibilities.\n  Twelve years ago, the people of Tennessee entrusted me with the \nresponsibility to serve their interests in the Senate. I have done my \nbest each and every day to meet the Volunteer State's needs and to \nserve the people of my home State with dignity and honor. What an honor \nit has been to follow in the footsteps of former Senators Howard Baker \nand Bill Brock. What a tremendous privilege it has been representing \nthe interests of the people of Tennessee.\n  And serving along side true statesmen such as Fred Thompson and Lamar \nAlexander--men who have dedicated so much of their lives to the people \nof Tennessee--has been a remarkably rewarding experience.\n  When I first stood for election in 1994, I pledged to all Tennesseans \nthat I would serve two terms in the Senate and then return to home to \nlive under the laws I had helped enact.\n  I made that commitment because I believe strongly in the concept of \nthe citizen legislator--spending years developing real world experience \noutside the political arena as I did in medicine and then bringing that \nexpertise to the legislative process for a period of time . . . only to \nmake way for the next citizen with his or her fresh perspectives and \nnew ideas.\n  As the time comes to resume my private life in the Music City, I have \nspent countless hours reflecting on the milestones in my service to \nTennessee from which I derive particular pride.\n  I think about accomplishments such as establishing a prescription \ndrug benefit that provides quality, affordable coverage for more than \n700,000 beneficiaries in Tennessee.\n  I think about the State sales tax deduction, which I hope we will \nsoon extend for 2 more years. Enacting that provision corrected a 15 \nyear inequity in the Tax Code by allowing Tennesseans to deduct their \nState sales tax expenses from Federal income tax returns--and it \nresulted in additional savings of nearly $500 in taxes for more than \n530,000 families across the State.\n  I recall the hours spent combating methamphetamine, a drug epidemic \nthat has plagued Tennessee and dozens of other States.\n  I helped develop minimum Federal standards restricting access to the \ningredients that produce methamphetamine, the drug our Nation's local \nlaw enforcement officials have ranked as our greatest problem.\n  I also enjoyed working with other members of the Tennessee delegation \nto establish a statewide methamphetamine task force and develop a \nstatewide crime tracking system--all in an effort to eradicate this \ndevastating drug from our communities.\n  During my time as majority leader, we also enacted a tobacco buyout \nthat ended an outdated quota system that hurt Tennessee's farmers by \nproviding fair compensation that will bring a total of $767 million to \ntobacco communities in the State over the next decade.\n  And we passed my National Park Fee Equity Act, a law that provides \nthe Great Smoky Mountain National Park with an additional $200,000 to \n$300,000 each year by allowing the park to keep 100 percent of the user \nfees it collects.\n  I was also pleased earlier this year when the Senate confirmed the \nfinal member of a TVA board modernized by legislation I nursed through \nthe legislative process over a 9-year period--legislation that resulted \nin the first African-American board member, the first west Tennessee \nboard member, and the first chief executive officer in TVA history.\n  In addition, we passed legislation I authored allowing TVA to \nrefinance its debt at lower rates, thus saving roughly $100 million per \nyear.\n  These reforms will help increase accountability and oversight at TVA, \nwhich benefits both the utility and its ratepayers.\n  I have also worked extensively with my colleagues on the HELP \nCommittee to extended health care and support services to Nashville, \nMemphis, and other emerging metropolitan communities disproportionately \naffected by HIV/AIDS through reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE \nAct.\n  The CARE Act provides funding for low-income, uninsured and \nunderinsured individuals affected by HIV/AIDS, but none of Tennessee's \ncities met the legislation's original criteria to receive support--a \nfact I knew we had to correct and one which we rightly remedied.\n  I have dedicated significant energy to strengthening Tennessee's \nresearch infrastructure, and bringing both the Spallation Neutron \nSource project and the National Leadership Computational Facility to \nOak Ridge demonstrates our State's leadership in advanced science and \ntechnology.\n\n[[Page S11599]]\n\n  I was also pleased to play a central role in the development of the \nMemphis Bioworks Foundation and the revitalization of the Central \nMedical District in Memphis by securing $8.1 million for these efforts.\n  And to ensure that we encourage the bright young men and women of our \nState to pursue an education in these fields that are vital to \nAmerica's competitiveness in the 21st century's global economy, I also \ncreated the SMART Grant program--a $3.75 billion initiative that \nprovides financial assistance to students seeking degrees in math, \nscience, engineering, technology, and foreign languages critical to \nnational security.\n  I have tried to encourage economic growth in other ways, however, \nworking closely with communities throughout Tennessee to provide the \nFederal assistance that can often enable local governments to pursue \nopportunities that will benefit their citizens for generations.\n  I secured $100 million to construct sections of Interstate 69 in \nTennessee from Dyersburg to Memphis--a highway that will one day serve \nas an economic engine for much of West Tennessee.\n  When community leaders in the Chattanooga area asked for assistance \nwith the crumbling Chickamauga Lock and Dam, a structure providing \naccess to hundreds of miles of waterway used for economic economy in \nEast Tennessee, I helped ensure the authorization of a new 110 ft.-by-\n600 ft. replacement lock.\n  Construction funding for the replacement structure has been \nsuccessfully secured in each year since 2003, and after a long period \nof hard work and difficult discussion, the White House agreed to \ninclude the project in its most recent budget request.\n  Several years ago, violent tornados ravaged Jackson, and local \nleaders sought my assistance in rebuilding badly damaged neighborhoods \nand city infrastructure.\n  I was honored to secure almost $11 million from the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to rebuild public housing lost as a \nresult of the devastating storms and an additional $2.1 million for the \ncity's police department to improve communications during such \nemergencies.\n  Nashville long sought a light rail system that could help alleviate \nthe burden placed on its roadways and improve the flow of consumers \ninto downtown--the heart of its economic marketplace.\n  So I went to work and eventually secured $24.6 million in funding \nnecessary to start and complete the Music City Star East Corridor \nCommuter Rail Project, which allowed Tennessee's first commuter rail \npassenger service to begin between the Riverfront Station in downtown \nNashvil1e and the city of Lebanon in Wilson County just 3 months ago.\n  And when the city of Memphis began redeveloping its riverfront, I \nlent my support to the cause and secured nearly $8.7 million for the \nCobblestone Landing and Beale Street Landing projects.\n  To help advance this work, I facilitated an agreement that will allow \nthe University of Memphis Cecil Humphreys School of Law to relocate to \nthe Postal Service Front Street Station in downtown Memphis--a move \nthat will act as a cornerstone of riverfront redevelopment and reshape \nthe law school's future.\n  I have also tried at every turn to provide steadfast support for \nTennessee's brave men and women in uniform as a sign of my gratitude \nand respect for their extraordinary efforts on behalf of our Nation.\n  Because they deserve only the best facilities, I secured $32 million \nto construct a new headquarters facility for the Tennessee Army \nNational Guard in Nashville and an additional $31 million to \nconsolidate personnel previously located in 22 different buildings into \na single, state-of-the-art command headquarters for the 101st Airborne \nand other units at Fort Campbell.\n  Because they and their families deserve basic economic fairness, I \nhelped secure passage of the Fort Campbell Tax Fairness Act, which now \nensures Volunteer State residents working at Fort Campbell are spared \nfrom a State income tax like all other Tennesseans.\n  I could spend many hours on the Senate floor recalling the countless \nways in which I have worked to meet Tennessee's needs during my 12 \nyears as a Member of this body.\n  But instead, I would rather thank the people of Tennessee for the \nopportunity.\n  I will forever treasure the experience--and the many individuals I \nhave had the privilege of befriending across our great State along the \nway.\n  Electing me to serve two terms in the Senate is the greatest honor \nthe citizens of Tennessee could have ever given me.\n  No words could ever express my deep appreciation.\n  I look forward to returning home and continuing my efforts to repay \ntheir generosity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

S11599-S11600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FULFILLING DUTY, PRESERVING LEGACY: NOMINEE CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this week, among other agenda items, the \nSenate considered the nomination of Robert Gates as Secretary of \nDefense. It puts me in mind of similar high-level nominations we \nconsidered earlier this year, and throughout the 109th Congress. \nNamely, Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito, and a host of \nother judicial nominees and presidential appointees.\n  When I consider these nominees I am reminded of the progress we've \nhave made--the remarkable strides we've taken--to ensure continued \nfulfillment of our constitutional duty as United States Senators. \nWhether we recognized it or not, the 109th Congress had the potential \nto become a pivotal turning point in our Nation's history--with \nrepercussions reaching far into the future.\n  Over the past 30 years, the Senate's confirmation process has slowly \nbut steadily deteriorated. We faced the confirmation of fewer and fewer \njudicial nominees. During the Carter and Reagan administrations, the \nSenate confirmed 9 out of 10 appeals court nominees. But in the first \nterm of the current administration, the Senate blocked one out of every \nthree appeals court nominees.\n  Those that were confirmed took longer and longer. In the Carter and \nReagan administrations, the Senate took an average of about 60 days to \nconfirm a Federal appeals court nominee. But in the first term of this \nadministration, we took an average of nearly 300 days.\n  And as the judicial nominations process deteriorated, so too did the \nquality and civility of debates. Bitterness and acrimony seeped in, \nthreatening to poison the Senate's legacy--and our nation's future.\n  The 108th Congress marked the low point. For the first time in \nhistory, a minority of Senators obstructed the principle of a fair up-\nor-down vote on judicial nominees. That was unprecedented. Never in 214 \nyears of Senate history had a judicial nominee with majority support \nbeen denied an up-or-down vote.\n  Two years ago, I faced a decision. I could ignore the events of the \n108th Congress. Through passivity, I could permit the active \nobstruction of Senate duties--and the active destruction of Senate \ntraditions.\n  Or I could do something to halt the unchecked downward spiral. I \ncould protect the Senate's history of fulfilling our constitutional \nduty. I could help restore our legacy.\n  At the beginning of this Congress--the 109th Congress--I made a \ndecision. I chose to stand on principle. I came to this floor, and \nreminded my colleagues of the 14-word oath of office we each take: ``I \ndo solemnly affirm that I will support the Constitution of the United \nStates.''\n  Our first responsibility, above all else, is to do our constitutional \nduty. Yet in the 108th Congress, the Senate failed to perform an \nessential constitutional duty. It failed to offer advice and consent to \nthe President by filibustering ten judicial nominees and threatening to \nfilibuster another six.\n  So nearly 2 years ago, when the 109th Congress opened, I took a \nstand.\n  In the spirit of bipartisanship, I extended my hand across the aisle \nto the new Senate Democratic leadership. I held the sincere hope that \nwe could move forward beyond the difficulties of the 108th Congress--to \na future of cooperation.\n  I said:\n\n       If my Democratic colleagues exercise self-restraint and do \n     not filibuster judicial nominees, Senate traditions will be \n     restored. It\n\n[[Page S11600]]\n\n     will then be unnecessary to change Senate procedures. . . . \n     But if my Democratic colleagues continue to filibuster \n     judicial nominees, the Senate will face this choice: Fail to \n     do its constitutional duty or reform itself and restore its \n     traditions, and do what the Framers intended.\n\n  And it was at that point I made it clear that if the obstruction of \nfulfilling our constitutional duty continued, I would enforce the \nconstitutional option--what some of my colleagues took to calling the \n``nuclear'' option.\n  The principle is simple. The U.S. Senate has a constitutional \nobligation of advice and consent on the President's nominees.\n  To consent--or not consent. To vote yea or nay.\n  That is our constitutional duty.\n  And nothing--not party, not ideology, not politics, and not even \ntradition--should interfere.\n  That is the principle.\n  The nomination process is a grueling experience. Even for those \nnominees with impeccable credentials, a spotless record, and \nunassailable positions--it's anything but pleasant.\n  We grill nominees. We scrutinize their every word--both written and \nspoken. We demand justifications for their every action and decision. \nWe advertise their flaws, both real and imagined. And we posit \nhypothetical situations before them, to gauge their reactions.\n  It takes a certain amount of stamina--of endurance--to undergo the \nnomination process. It demands exposure of the nominees and their \nfamilies to public slander and character assassination.\n  And yet we have the audacity to compound this grueling experience by \nforcing nominees to languish without benefit of a vote.\n  So the principle I outlined at the beginning of this Congress--that \nevery nominee should have a fair up-or-down vote--is twofold. First, \neach vote is the fulfillment of our constitutional duty to offer advice \nand consent on each of the President's nominees. And second, each vote \noffers a measure of fairness to nominees. They have submitted to the \ngrueling public scrutiny entailed by the nomination process. In return, \nthey deserve a definitive answer--yea or nay--on whether they have \npassed muster.\n  Undoubtedly, we lose many qualified candidates because they choose \nnot to endure the public scrutiny of being nominated. But how many more \ndo we lose--needlessly--because they fear languishing without a vote?\n  That is why I made it clear--at the outset of this Congress--that I \ncould not countenance the perpetuation of the travesties of the \nprevious Congress.\n  Looking back, I firmly believe that without that firm stand--without \nthe promise of the constitutional option--we would not be where we are \ntoday.\n  Without the promise of the constitutional option, we would not have \nseen the so-called Gang of 14.\n  Without the promise of the constitutional option, it's unlikely we \nwould have confirmed two Supreme Court nominees with such timeliness.\n  Without the promise of the constitutional option, I have no doubt \nthat future generations would look at the 109th Congress as a negative \nturning point for the Senate. A turning point in which, through our \npassivity, we allowed a laudable Senate tradition to trump Senate duty \nas defined in the Constitution.\n  We have, for the time being, protected our Senate legacy.\n  I recounted these events for a reason. There is purpose to my \nreminiscing.\n  This week we are wrapping up the business of the 109th Congress. We \nare preparing for a change in control of the Senate. Many of my \ncolleagues will return for the 110th Congress. I would leave them with \nthis challenge: continue the progress of the 109th Congress.\n  We have halted the deterioration of the nominations process. We have \neven turned it around, helping prevent numerous nominees from \nlanguishing indefinitely.\n  But despite these important strides, there have still been \ncasualties.\n  Just yesterday, President Bush accepted John Bolton's resignation \nfrom his post as Ambassador to the United Nations. A man eminently \nqualified to articulate the position of the United States--and yet a \nminority of my colleagues refused to grant him an up-or-down vote.\n  They refused to take a decisive stand--yea or nay. And in so doing, \nthey abdicated their constitutional duty of advice and consent.\n  And there are others. Ten circuit court nominees still await a \ndefinitive vote, as do 21 district court nominees. And some have waited \nyears. Not months, and certainly not days: but years.\n  It is true that the number of nominees still languishing is smaller \nnow than it was at the end of the 108th Congress. And I firmly believe \nthat what progress we've realized is a direct result of standing on \nprinciple.\n  For more than 200 years, the Senate operated on the underlying \nassumption that every nominee deserved an up-or-down vote. In the 109th \nCongress, we were forced to defend that assumption. And we did so, by \nstanding on principle.\n  We have made important strides. We have stopped the downward spiral, \nand started to regain lost ground. But the fact remains: we still have \nfarther to go. We have made progress, but it hasn't been enough.\n  So let me reiterate: to the 110th Congress--to my returning \ncolleagues, and to the new Members--I issue this challenge: continue \nthat upward momentum. Continue the progress of the 109th Congress.\n  Fulfill your constitutional duty of a fair up-or-down vote on each \nnominee.\n  Fulfill your commitment to fairness by giving nominees a firm yea or \nnay.\n  And fulfill your place in history by helping preserve the Senate's \nlegacy. Don't let history remember the 110th Congress as the one when \nthe Senate turned rebel.\n  It comes down to this: You can build on the progress of the 109th \nCongress. Or you can abdicate your constitutional duty, and irreparably \ndamage America.\n  Looking back, I can proudly say the Senate stood on principle during \nthe 109th Congress. We made genuine progress. I hope I can say the same \nof future Congresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11600-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11600-S11601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SECRETARY OF THE SENATE EMILY REYNOLDS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I came to the floor to recognize two \nindividuals who have been very close to me and contributed \nsignificantly to the progress I have made here in this body and, \nindeed, the progress that we make as an institution.\n  I rise to pay tribute to Emily Reynolds, our magnificent Secretary of \nthe Senate. Abraham Lincoln once said, ``I am a success today because I \nhad a friend who believed in me, and I didn't have the heart to let him \ndown.''\n  Looking back at the past 13 years, those words ring true. I know for \na fact that successes and triumphs I have enjoyed throughout my years \nin office are largely attributable to family and friends and staff, \npeople who have stood with me, people who hold me to a higher standard, \npeople who compel me to meet that standard.\n  Today, I specifically speak about one such person who has been at the \ncenter of everything I have done over the past 13 years, Emily \nReynolds. No one has believed in our mutual vision for the future of \nTennessee and the country--that mutual vision that she has shared and I \nhave shared, that we have shared for the people of Tennessee--nobody \nhas articulated and stood behind that more than Emily Reynolds.\n  Most of my colleagues know Emily as the Secretary of the Senate. She \nis the woman who keeps the legislative machine well oiled, moving and \nrunning smoothly, no matter what the circumstances; the woman largely \nresponsible for bringing us the Capitol Visitor Center, and the woman \nwho signs our paychecks every other week.\n  Thirteen years ago this month, I came out of the operating room \nhaving made the decision to run for the Senate. I learned early on from \nmy experiences in the operating room--part of the surgical team--how \nimportant it is to surround yourself with the best of the best. So I \nsought counsel from former Majority Leader Howard Baker, who very \nquickly introduced me to his former chief of staff Jim Cannon. They \nboth within a few days steered me to a remarkable fellow Tennessean who \nhas literally been with me every step of the way over the last 13 \nyears, currently serving as Secretary of the Senate, Emily Reynolds. It \nshould come as no surprise after meeting her that I wanted Emily on my \nteam.\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\n  In that first campaign, I was a political novice. I was the underdog. \nI had no political experience whatsoever. The pundits said I didn't \nhave a fighting chance. But Emily had faith in our vision. She moved \nfrom Washington back home to Tennessee to join our fledgling campaign. \nShe believed in our mission.\n  When we set up our 24-hour-a-day campaign headquarters over a \nrestaurant in Nashville, Emily was there almost 24 hours a day. When I \nopened my first official Senate office, she was there. And now, as I--\nas we all--carry our last boxes out of our offices and out of this \nmajority leader's suite, she is there standing with me.\n  She served as my deputy campaign director back in 1994, and as my \nstate director at home in Tennessee, and as my campaign manager for my \nreelection campaign in 2000, as chief of staff of my Tennessee office \nhere in Washington, and for the past 4 years, she has served all 100 \nSenators as the 31st Secretary of the Senate.\n  To this day, the range of Emily's capabilities astounds me. She is a \ngenuine people person. People love her. People are attracted to her \nwarm personality. She makes you smile. She makes you laugh.\n  And what versatility. She is comfortable shooting the breeze with \nfarmers down in rural Tennessee. But she is just as comfortable walking \nthe Halls of the Senate and the Congress with Senators, with diplomats \nand foreign heads of state. No matter what the situation, whether it is \nsinging on the stage of the Grand Old Opry or standing on the floor of \nthe Senate, Emily's passion for people shines through that warm smile.\n  But beyond possessing the rare capability of being able to set just \nabout anybody at ease, Emily is a talented administrator. She juggles \nthe demands of all 100 Senators, Democrat and Republican alike, and \ntheir staffs, a thankless task, while always wearing a friendly smile. \nShe is loved and respected by Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Under her direction, the Senate has benefited from an ambitious \noverhaul of our computer systems, bringing them up to date with the \nlatest in modern technology.\n  Emily humbly describes her job as ``making the trains run on time.'' \nThat is true. But it doesn't give the complete picture of who she is or \nwhat she does. Within the Senate, she has fostered a stable environment \nof mutual respect and mutual trust. Her supreme attention to detail has \nserved the Senate and our Nation well. Whether she is collaborating \nwith the Sergeant at Arms to develop crisis contingency plans, or \nworking with the Senate Historian's Office to produce new publications \nthat augment and preserve the Senate's history, Emily is a born leader. \nHer devotion is unmatched.\n  Emily comes from a very close family whom I have had the privilege to \nknow. That is where her values come from. That is where her sunny smile \ncomes from. That is where her work ethic comes from. I can only imagine \nhow proud of her accomplishments her dad Clarence is, her sister Ellen, \nand her brother Ernie, and how proud her mother Josephine would be, \ntoo.\n  Clarence, you did good. You did well.\n  Emily's service to the Senate will surely be missed. As an \ninstitution, we can only hope that she again returns to our body as she \ndid after her service to another Tennessee majority leader, Howard \nBaker. Yes. In fact, Emily Reynolds worked in the very Republican \nLeader's office which I now occupy, from 1980 to 1984, where she worked \nfor then chief of staff Jim Cannon, chief of staff for Howard Baker.\n  I cannot tell you how thankful I am having had her at my side for the \npast 13 years. She is a true friend and a trusted adviser. I cannot \nthink of anyone more fittingly described by Lincoln's words.\n  Great things lie ahead for Emily Reynolds. The sky is the limit. And \nwhile I don't know exactly what direction she will travel, I am certain \nthat, as always, the people of Tennessee and the entire United States \nof America will benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11601-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11601-S11602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the hearing we had 3 days ago in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee is one of the four hearings we \nhave had on climate change. It is probably the most misunderstood of \nall issues out there today--and the most alarming to a lot of people. \nThis hearing was totally different. This hearing was about how the \nmedia is skewing the results, how the media is hyping the anxiety of \nthis thing and totally ignoring the science.\n  It is kind of interesting. A lot of people are not aware that when \nyou have a hearing, you will have Republicans and Democrats each \nbringing in experts. We had five experts; two of them were brought in \nby the Democrats and three by the Republicans.\n  It was interesting because one of the Democrat witnesses, Dr. Daniel \nSchrag of Harvard, believes that manmade emissions are driving global \nwarming. Let me clarify this because it is not understood by very many \npeople.\n  The issue is not that the world is getting warmer. Yes. It is. It is \nalways either getting warmer or cooling. There is never any time when \nit is static.\n  So we are going through a warming period. It increased to about 1998, \nand then it stopped pretty much at that time. But even their witness, \nwho was a believer, said that the Kyoto Protocol is not the right \napproach to take and agreed it had almost no impact on the climate if \nall the nations complied.\n  Probably one of the most major breakthroughs that we have had is the \nrecognition by virtually all scientists that the Kyoto Protocol, which \nwould be devastating to the United States, or any country--ask Great \nBritain. They will tell you. They signed onto the Kyoto Accord. In \nfact, if you look at some of the countries, such as Canada, 60 \nscientists who were advisers to the Prime Minister of Canada are saying \nif we had known back in the late 1990s the science of today, we would \nnever have done that. Now they are petitioning the Prime Minister to \nget out of the Kyoto Protocol.\n  It was kind of interesting. Al Gore, who really believed this was his \nticket to the White House back when he was the Vice President of the \nUnited States, went to a guy named Tom Quigley, a scientist, and said \nwe would like to know if all the countries--this is back when they were \ntrying to get us in the United States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol--\nsaid if all the countries of the developed world were to do this, what \neffect would that have on the temperature over a 50-year period. He had \na neat chart to hold up. He said if all the countries in the developed \nworld, the United States of America and all the other developed nations \ndid this, over 50 years it would reduce the temperature by 6/100ths of \n1 degree centigrade, which isn't even measurable.\n  Now all these people agree with that--all of the scientists who used \nto be on the other side of the issue.\n  One of the witnesses there was a paleoclimate researcher, Bob Carter \nfrom Australia, the James Cook University. He has gone back to \nAustralia. Everyone recognizes him as being one of the outstanding--in \nfact, he has been on quite a few TV shows. He says there is a huge \nuncertainty in every aspect of climate change.\n  David Deming, a geophysicist, said:\n\n       Every natural disaster that occurs is now linked [by the \n     media] with global warming, no matter how tenuous or \n     impossible the connection. As a result, the public has become \n     vastly misinformed on this and other environmental issues.\n\n  That is a significant thing. While we recognize that we are going \nthrough a natural period where the climate is getting warmer, it was \nactually warmer in the 1930s than it is today. It was warmer in the \nfifteenth century than today.\n  But during this period of time, they are trying to say it is due to \nman-emitted gases. They are called antigeometric gases, methane, \nCO2. Now they are all realizing that CO2 has \nvirtually nothing to do with it, and that is why you are seeing so much \nof the panic in the media. Dan Gainor was one of the only nonscience \nwitnesses. He approached it from an ethical perspective, talking about \nthe one-sided climate coverage, saying it violates the ethical code of \nthe Society of Professional Journalists which urges the media to \n``support the open exchange of views. Even views they find repugnant.'' \nThat code calls for reporters to distinguish between advocacy and news \nreporting which, he says, they have not been doing.\n\n[[Page S11602]]\n\n  One of those individuals who is a strong supporter of human gases \ncausing climate change, Mike Hulme, the director of the UK-based \nTyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, is on the other side of \nthis thing and has now--talking about the media--chastised the media \nand environmentalists for choosing the ``language of fear and terror'' \nto scare the public. Hulme noted he has found himself ``increasingly \nchastised'' by global warming activists because his public statements \n``have not satisfied the [activist] thirst for environmental drama and \nsearch for exaggerated rhetoric.''\n  A report in August of 2006 from the UK labor-leaning Institute for \nPublic Policy talked about the way the media is handling it:\n\n       A quasireligious register of doom, death, heaven and hell \n     using words such as ``catastrophe,'' ``chaos'' and ``havoc.''\n\n  The report also compared the media's coverage of global warming to \n``the unreality of Hollywood films.''\n  Another individual who was a supporter at one time, David Bellamy \nfrom Britain, has come around talking about this. The one I am going to \ntalk about in January at some length is a man named Claude Allegre, the \nFrench geophysicist and a former Socialist Party leader. He is the only \none I know who is a member of both the French and the United States \nAcademies of Science. Allegre now says the cause of warming remains \nunknown and the alarmism ``has become a very lucrative business for \nsome people.'' In short, their motive is money. And he is right, it is \nabout money.\n  One by one, the people, scientists are coming around. This hearing \nhas had more response throughout the Nation. I have lists of newspapers \nthat have editorialized as a result of this. That awakening is taking \nplace, but that is not why I am here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11602-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JEANE KIRKPATRICK\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, our majority leader has been paying \ntribute to some great people we work with, and I agree with every word \nhe said. However, we have somebody else who needs tribute today.\n  A real American hero died yesterday. That was Jeane Kirkpatrick. It \nhappens I have been close to Jeane Kirkpatrick for a number of years. \nPeople do not realize she was born in Duncan, OK, down in the oil \npatch. She was the daughter of an oil field wildcatter. I knew her way \nback in the early stages before she was even brought up by Ronald \nReagan to take the lofty positions she held. She was Ronald Reagan's \nforeign policy adviser in his 1980 campaign and the first woman to hold \nthe position of U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  When someone was asking me in the media recently what is the one \nthing you can say she made the greatest contribution in, I said, she is \nthe first one who called people's attention to what the United Nations \nis doing, the fact that they have gotten involved in things they should \nnot be involved in. She was one of the last stalwarts to hold out for \nsovereignty at the United Nations in the United States.\n  The Washington Times noted Jeane Kirkpatrick's eyes twinkled at the \nmention of the August 1984 night at the Republican National Convention \nin Dallas when she eviscerated the liberal Democrats as the ``blame \nAmerica first crowd.'' Boy, is she right. Look what has been happening.\n  She was awarded the Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian \nhonor, in May of 1985. She received her second Department of Defense \nDistinguished Public Service Medal and has received more medals than \nany other person I know in her field. In 1991, the Kennedy School at \nHarvard University established the Kirkpatrick Chair in International \nAffairs. She served as senior fellow and director of foreign and \ndefense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. She is \nfamous for her Kirkpatrick doctrine which advocates United States \nsupport of anti-Communist governments around the world. Along with the \nEmpower America codirectors, Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp, she has been \nactive up to the present time.\n  One of the things we worked on together was the John Bolton \nnomination. To me, the saddest day is when we found that John Bolton \nwas throwing in the towel. He had been abused enough. The only way to \nsave the United Nations was with John Bolton. She got behind him and \npushed him and got him involved.\n  A lot of people say she is too conservative, but she has been \nrecognized and compared to, of all people, former Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan. A lot of people do not realize this, but Pat Moynihan \nwas also an Oklahoman. The Chicago Tribune said on November 14 of this \nyear, such distinguished ambassadors as Democrat Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan and Republican Jeane Kirkpatrick also were criticized for \ntough talk on occasion, even when their passion proved to be right on \npoint.\n  In recent years, it was Jeane Kirkpatrick who called my attention to \nsomething happening--and I am not blaming anyone in this Senate. A \ntreaty that was called the Law of the Sea Treaty received a 16-to-0 \nvote from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. People did not \nrealize that was a treaty that would turn over to the United Nations \nthe jurisdiction of two-thirds of the entire surface of the world and \nthe air above it. I held hearings as a result of Jeane Kirkpatrick \ncalling this to my attention. We were able to stop it when it was ready \nto be passed in the next week.\n\n  I would say we lost a real hero, a real American hero, someone who \nhas been fighting Communists and fundamental Islamic terrorists for her \nentire life. She has made a great mark. I love her dearly and will \ncertainly miss Jeane Kirkpatrick.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one who is known \nas Mr. Budget of the Senate. When I stepped up to the position of \nmajority leader 4 years ago, my first priority was to hire a staff of \ncapable advisers. When I stepped up, it happened very quickly, so I \nknew I wanted the best of the best. I already had a wonderful staff \ndevoted to help the people of Tennessee, but what I needed was a core \ngroup of people to help me with the larger picture, to set an \naggressive agenda and help me get it through.\n  I knew immediately who I wanted to advise me on budget and \nappropriations. In an ideal world, I knew exactly who that would be. \nAnd, of course, that was Bill Hoagland. I had known Bill and worked \nwith Bill as a freshman Senator when he was staff director of the \nBudget Committee, then chaired by Pete Domenici, and I relied on him \nthrough those early days again and again in private meetings and \ntutorials to show me and to introduce me and my budget staff at the \ntime the budget ropes, the process. So when that Christmas Eve 4 years \nago came, I picked up the phone and I called Bill Hoagland. I asked--I \npleaded with him--to become a part of my team.\n  Bill came to the Senate Committee on the Budget in the early 1980s \nfrom the Department of Agriculture. He started as a group leader and \nsenior analyst and worked his way up through the ranks to become staff \ndirector. After more than two decades on the Budget Committee under \nSenator Domenici, Bill was the acknowledged expert on Senate floor \nprocedure for budget resolutions and appropriations measures. He was \nthere during Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. He was staff director during the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1995. For 21 years, Bill had a voice in every \nmajor Senate budget and appropriations measure. I was certain his \nexpertise would be a tremendous asset to my team. And, indeed, it has \nbeen.\n  Bill has proven his worth time and time again. While serving as my \ndirector of budget and appropriations, Bill has played critical roles \nin ushering forth the Deficit Reduction Act and the Tax Increase \nPrevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006, and many others.\n  During these negotiations, Bill's voice is often the voice of reason, \npracticality, of realism. His plain speaking only enhances credibility \nas the preeminent authority, the unquestioned preeminent authority on \nSenate budget and appropriations.\n  But Bill isn't all business. The Senate Committee on the Budget \nfondly remembers him for genuinely caring about his staff. They \nremember his informal Friday late-afternoon happy hours where staff \ncould share stories about the past week and learn things\n\n[[Page S11603]]\n\nabout activities in the weeks ahead. In fact, they were so fond of \nthose informal get-togethers that the current Republican staff director \ninstalled a plaque naming the room after Bill Hoagland.\n  My own staff and I will always carry memories of Bill bringing the \nKentucky Derby to the Capitol with mint juleps on the Dole balcony \nbehind me. And I will never forget Bill's weekly economic reports which \nI share on a regular basis with my colleagues. They were as much an \nexercise in dry wit as a profound analysis of the economic outlook.\n  After some 25 years, Bill has led one of the most distinguished staff \ncareers ever to grace the Senate. On behalf of this Senate, I thank \nBill for his dedication as a public servant to this Nation. Never doubt \nfor a moment how much we value your wise counsel, Bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Bill Hoagland is truly one of the best I \nhave had the chance to serve with in 20 years. Bill Hoagland is deeply \nknowledgeable, decent, caring. He is one person who has extraordinary \ncredibility on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have known Bill in my 20 years in the Senate. Throughout that \nperiod I have served on the Committee on the Budget. Bill has been, at \nvarious times, the staff director or the leadership stamp on these \nissues. I have enjoyed so many quiet moments with Bill in which we have \nreflected on things that concern us about the direction of the country. \nMore than that, I have enjoyed his uncommon decency.\n  Bill Hoagland is somebody who will be very much missed. I believe \nBill Hoagland, because of his intense interest in the fiscal affairs of \nthis country, in the economic well-being of our Nation, will always be \nthere to give good advice.\n  On many occasions I have joked with Bill and made him job offers for \nfar more pay than he was getting on the other side of the aisle. Bill \nalways kind of indulged my humor and never paid too much attention to \nit because he was firmly rooted on the other side.\n  Bill Hoagland represents the best of this institution. And it is with \nreal sincerity I say I will very much miss Bill's very good judgment in \nthis Senate. I thank the leader for his remarks about our very good \nfriend, Bill Hoagland.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have been drafting my farewell comments, \nand I had a little section in there about my friend Bill Hoagland, but \nI will just take this opportunity now to add my voice to those who have \nbeen talking about Bill.\n  I cannot tell you how many times in the last few years I have gone up \nto Bill in the corner of the Chamber over here and asked him what was \nreally going on around here. And Bill Hoagland always knows what is \nreally going on around here. Not only is he an expert on the budget, he \nis an expert on the Senate, and he is an expert, quite bluntly, in \nstrategy as well as an expert in tactics.\n  So I thank Bill for his good and wise counsel to me. I know he has \nsupplied that counsel to so many other people in the Senate as well. \nBut I, from a personal point of view, have appreciated Bill very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11603-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11603-S11606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Private First Class Jacob D. Spann\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army PFC \nJacob D. Spann from Columbus, OH, who died on February 6, 2006, when a \nroadside bomb detonated beneath his military vehicle in Iraq. Jacob was \n21 years of age at the time.\n  PFC Spann leaves his father and stepmother Larry and Libby, his \nmother and stepfather Deborah and Dennis, brothers Derek, Adam, Joe, \nJosh, and Chris, sisters Sonni, Sarah, Erin, and Helen, and grandmother \nJean.\n  Jacob Spann--known to family and friends as Jake, Jakey, and \nsometimes even Jake the Snake--graduated from Westerville North High \nSchool in 2003, and was known for his way of walking into a room and \nlighting it up with his smile and big blue eyes. He had a talent of \nbeing serious one minute, and fun-loving and light-hearted the next.\n  While at North High, Jake participated in wrestling, track, and \nfootball. He had a natural athletic ability and was always looking to \nimmerse himself in something new and exciting. Dean of students and \nhead football coach at North High Chad Williams was assistant coach \nwhen Jake was a linebacker. He remembers Jake as ``an extremely \nhardworking, dedicated football player.'' In his words, ``[Jake] was a \nkid who knew he was going to do everything he could for the team.''\n  Always most important for Jake were his family and friends. He was a \ntrue and loyal friend to his high school classmates. It was here that \nJake met and started dating the love of his life, Abby Van Huffel.\n  After graduating, Jake took courses at Columbus State Community \nCollege and worked in an autobody shop. The auto-body shop allowed him \nto express a love of art that he had ever since he was a child, when he \nwould spend hours drawing and painting. If he didn't make the Marines, \nhe was thinking of opening his own shop. But Jake felt compelled to \njoin the Marines.\n  Jake joined the Corps in January 2005. He was assigned to Battalion \nLanding Team's 1st battalion, 2nd Regiment, 22nd Expeditionary Unit, \n2nd Expeditionary Force, based at Camp Lejeune, NC. Jake was well-liked \nby those who he worked with in the military. His senior drill \ninstructor wrote the following to Jake's family on an Internet tribute \nWeb site:\n\n       I would like to express my deepest sympathies to the Spann \n     Family. I was your son's Senior Drill Instructor while he was \n     in Boot Camp. I have spoken to two of the Drill Instructors \n     who worked that Platoon with me, and your son's death has had \n     a profound impact on all of us. I was deeply saddened when I \n     saw it in the Marine Corps Times. Your son was a very good \n     recruit, and I know he was a good Marine.\n\n  Jake deployed to Iraq in November 2005. As always, however, before he \nleft, he was thinking more of others than of himself. With the few days \nhe had before leaving, he returned to Westerville for a visit and took \nAbby out for a special birthday dinner. Abby's birthday wasn't until \nDecember, but Jake would be far away then, and he didn't want to miss \ncelebrating with the girl he loved.\n  Before leaving, Jake also gave his mother Deborah a special present. \nIt was a pendant on a chain--a Marine Mother's Medal of Honor. Deborah \nhas worn it everyday since. ``We have a large and loving family,'' she \nsaid, speaking of her son's love for those in his life. ``His family \ncame first and his Abby came first, and he loved us more than anything. \nAnd he loved his country, and we respect that.''\n  According to his older sister Sonni, Jake was very proud when he left \nfor Iraq. The Marines had given him the confidence he had been \nsearching for. In conversations with his stepfather, he had even spoken \nof becoming a drill sergeant one day.\n  It was typical of Jake that when he called home from Iraq, he wanted \nto talk more about the ones he cared about than himself. He wanted all \nthe news he could get about his family--particularly his five brothers, \nfour sisters, and four nieces and nephews. Jake loved to call and talk \nto his mom, whom he loved with all his heart.\n  Jake Spann was an excellent marine. Fellow platoon brother Lance \nCorporal Monhollen said this about Jake:\n\n       I was in the same platoon as Spann in Boot Camp. He was a \n     leader then and was a leader before he died. He was also a \n     great friend.\n\n  Jake will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. He is an \ninspiration to many students at Westerville North High School. In the \nwords of Chad Williams:\n\n       While a lot of our kids don't have a personal connection \n     with Jake, they really feel he's a part of the Warrior \n     football family, and they've asked me a lot about him. I \n     think that's kind of the best way to honor someone. A lot of \n     young kids are asking about him and want to live up to the \n     same honor and characteristics he had.\n\n  After Jake died, the lettering outside his old high school was \nchanged to proclaim: ``Jacob Spann--An Ultimate Warrior.''\n  Jake's mother finds it comforting that he did not return home from \nIraq alone. She tells a story of how six of the family's best friends \nwere out of the country when they heard the news that Jake had died. \nWhen traveling home, their return trip was full of delays. The pilot \nfinally came on and informed the passengers that there\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\nwould be one final delay, as the plane was waiting for a ``very special \npassenger\"--a fallen soldier. ``Our friends realized it was our son,'' \nDeborah said. ``Things happen for a reason. They brought him home to us \nand he was escorted by a Marine who would not leave his side until he \nwas where he needed to be.''\n  This was a fitting, final journey for a young man who had always been \nsurrounded by loving family and friends. Countless mourners attended \nJake's funeral and burial services to pay their respects and offer \ncomfort to Jake's family. According to Jake's mom, the toughest \nchallenge Jake would have faced returning home would have been \nselecting the perfect ring for the planned engagement and wedding to \nAbby.\n  At the funeral, Jake's brother read a letter from Abby, who said she \nhad been expecting to write wedding vows--not a eulogy. The letter \nended with the line, ``I will always be here loving you.'' On the \nmarble of Jake's tombstone, Abby is remembered as his ``soul mate.''\n  Marine PFC Jacob Spann was a fine man of whom we can all be proud. He \nwas loved by his community, his family, his friends, and his Abby. His \nlife and the sacrifice he made for our Nation will never be forgotten.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Jacob's friends and family in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                          Major Guy Barattieri\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army MAJ Guy \nBarattieri, originally of the Pleasant Ridge neighborhood of \nCincinnati, OH. A member of the National Guard's Alpha Company, 1st \nBattalion, 19th Special Forces Group, based in Buckley, WA, Major \nBarattieri was working in a civilian contract capacity on October 4, \n2006, when he was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq. He was 36 years of \nage at the time.\n  Guy--known fondly by friends and family as ``Bear''--was born on June \n21, 1970, and raised in Pleasant Ridge. He attended Nativity School and \nwas a linebacker on the 1986 State Champion Purcell Marian High School \nfootball team.\n  Cliff Pope, a teammate of Bear's and his closest friend, remembers \nhim as someone who ``had a passion and intensity that was infectious to \nus all.''\n  According to his uncle Larry Wheatley, Bear had always loved the \nmilitary--had loved it ever since he was just a small boy. When he was \naccepted into the United States Military Academy at West Point, it was \na dream come true for him. Once at West Point, however, injuries kept \nBear from continuing to play football.\n  Chris Jenks is one of Bear's former classmates and teammates from \nWest Point. He remembers the ``never-quit'' attitude with which Bear \napproached his injury. He wrote the following in Bear's memory on an \nInternet tribute Web site:\n\n       Army doctors told Bear that he could no longer play \n     football. Bear took that in stride, and . . . decided that, \n     technically, the doctors never said he couldn't play Rugby, \n     [so] he started playing rugby, [instead].\n\n  After graduating from West Point in 1992, Bear attended the Infantry \nOfficer's Basic Course Ranger School and the Mortar Course before being \nstationed in Baumholder, Germany. He later attended the Intelligence \nOfficer Advanced Course and branched out to the Special Forces. His \nfriend Chris Jenks remembers how impressed he always was by Bear's \n``innate'' infantry leadership skills. ``Some things you can train or \nteach,'' he said. ``Some things you are born with.''\n  In 2001, Bear joined the Seattle Police, where he was president of \nhis academy class. Bear's friend Detective Nick Bauer, who was his \nfield-training officer, described Bear with the following words:\n\n       [He was an] absolutely distinguished soldier, and a \n     distinguished officer--an extraordinary man, one of those \n     guys who won the hearts and minds of everyone he came in \n     contact with.\n\n  Bear remained with the Seattle Police Department until 2004.\n  In 2002, Bear went on active duty as a detachment commander in \nKuwait. When the 101st Infantry Division entered Baghdad in March 2003, \nBear's team was at the lead. For the role that he played, he received a \nBronze Star and Combat Infantryman's badge.\n  Without question, Bear made an impact in Iraq. He participated in \nmultiple missions, during which he captured three of the most wanted \nmembers of Saddam Hussein's government--individuals who had been \ndepicted on the deck of playing cards issued by the U.S. Military.\n  Bear was a dedicated and excellent soldier. But he was also something \nmore--a loving and devoted family man. For Bear, those he loved always \ncame first. On December 11, 2005, Bear married the love of his life--\nLaurel. They adored each other. He was a loving father to his two \ngirls--his 6-year-old stepdaughter Rees, and Odessa, who was born on \nJuly 19, 2006. He loved his family more than anything else in the \nworld.\n  Family friend Mary Mascarella remembers that Bear was a doting \nfather. He would take Rees to swimming lessons, make her lunch, and \ntake her to school. And, when Odessa was just 3 weeks old, the family \nwas visited by Bear's stepmother Barbara. Barbara remembers how excited \nhe was about their new daughter. ``It was his first baby,'' she said, \n``and he did it all--diapers and everything.''\n  I had the privilege of seeing several photos of Bear with his family. \nOne is from his wedding, with a beaming Laurel on one arm and Rees \ncradled in the other. Another picture shows Bear with the newborn \nOdessa in his arms. It is clear from looking at these pictures, how \nincredibly happy Bear's family made him.\n  Even when he was away from home, Bear's pride and delight in his \nfamily was apparent. In a tribute to Bear created by FOXNews, John \nFiegener remembers the way Bear lit up at the mention of his family. He \nwrote:\n\n       [His] quick smile was one of the things that struck me most \n     about Bear, and his biggest smiles were reserved for the many \n     frequent mentions of his family back home. He never hesitated \n     to show pictures of his wife, his daughter, and eventually, \n     his newborn baby girl.\n\n  In Iraq, Bear was the head of the security team at the FOX Baghdad \noffice, and was there in October 2005 when car bombs destroyed the \nhotel where they were located. On the FOXNews tribute Web site, Gordon \nRobinson remembers how important Bear was at that time. He wrote this \nabout him:\n\n       Bear was the person who held all of us together, both as \n     individuals and as a news bureau. . . . Throughout it all, he \n     remained calm. When it was over, he was confident and \n     smiling, and that attitude helped the rest of us to \n     understand that we, too, were going to make it through.\n\n  Cliff Pope had met Bear during their freshman year of high school at \nPurcell Marian. He remembers how committed Bear was to the ideals of \nfreedom and democracy. In Cliff's words:\n\n       Bear believed in America, he believed in democracy, and he \n     believed in his heart that God put him on this earth to \n     protect this country. And, he lost his life serving out what \n     he felt was his life's mission, which was protecting others.\n\n  There are perhaps no better words than those to describe the type of \nman that Bear was. He was simply someone who cared. His friends, his \nfamily, and his Nation are all proud of his service, and we owe him our \neternal gratitude.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of MAJ Guy \nBarattieri--his wife Laurel and his daughters Rees and Odessa, his \nmother Patricia Wheatley, his father and stepmother Dick and Barbara \nBarattieri, and his sisters Nicole, Becky, and Gina--all in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                             Sy Jason Lucio\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a brave man from \nClyde, OH--Sy Jason Lucio. Sy was working as a civilian technician in \nAfghanistan, when on April 6, 2005, he boarded a transport helicopter \nbound for Bagram Air Force Base. Less than 100 miles from their landing \nspot in Afghanistan, rough weather forced his Chinook helicopter to the \nground, killing all onboard.\n  Sy leaves his son Lars, his mother Sally, his father Stanley, and his \nsister Hannah.\n  Sy attended Clyde High School, where he was known for his energy and \nintelligence. After moving to Toledo and graduating from Swanton High \nSchool, he decided to attend Penta Career Center. Over the next few \nmonths, he quickly absorbed whatever his instructors threw at him. Sy \nwas well on his way to becoming an electrician of international \ncaliber.\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\n  Being the skilled technician that he was, he was an avid motorcycle \nenthusiast and bought himself a Buell, which he rode whenever he got \nthe chance. He, like many young men before him, enjoyed the sound of \nthe engine, the freedom, and the exhilaration.\n  Sy also loved camping. In his youth, his parents took him on many \ntrips to the countryside. Perhaps it was there that his sense of \nadventure was born. More than anything, though, Sy loved spending time \nwith his son Lars.\n  Sy's mother Sally remembers how he was happiest rolling around on the \nfloor with Lars and the other children in the family. She said that \n``he was such a good daddy. I knew he'd be a good father, but he \nexceeded my expectations.''\n  It was hard for Sy to leave his family behind him, but he knew there \nwas plenty of work for a skilled electrician in Afghanistan. To support \nhis family, to see the world, and to help his fellow countrymen, Sy \njoined on with a U.S. contractor, and in early January 2005, he \ntraveled to their Texas headquarters for training. From there, he flew \nto Afghanistan.\n  Sy entered this strange new world with confidence. He knew he had the \nskills, and he knew he could make a difference in the lives of our \nservicemembers and the lives of the Afghan people.\n  Sy's supervisor shared his memories of the brave young man. These are \nhis recollections:\n\n       Sy [sigh] had great electrical skills. He was a quiet man, \n     but very personable, and he often talked about his son. He \n     really cared about what he was doing and he was proud of the \n     contributions he was making. . . .\n\n  Indeed, Sy had so much about which to be proud. He traveled to \noperating bases in far-flung parts of Afghanistan. Whatever the harsh \nenvironment did to the military's equipment, Sy was there to fix. Day-\nin and day-out, our servicemembers rely on the best hardware and \ntechnical support in the world. Sy's knowledge and ability gave our \nAmerican military confidence in their equipment. There is no doubt that \nhis work saved lives.\n  Mr. President, those who knew Sy remember him more for how he lived, \nthan for how he left this earth. They remember his intelligence, his \nkindness, his adventurous spirit, and his strong moral convictions. \nThey remember how he never wanted anyone to worry about him.\n  Indeed, Sy left an indelible mark on this world, in the memories of \nhis loved ones, and in the lives he changed through his great work. As \nhis cousin, Sarah Wilson, said, ``He was a hardworking guy, a very \nloving guy, and a great father. He would do anything for anybody.''\n  Sy was a thoughtful and quiet man. He had a soft half-smile, which \nrelatives said he often wore instead of a grin so that people wouldn't \nsee his dimples.\n  Mike Urbine, Sy's instructor at Penta Career Center, knew that he was \nenthusiastic about his career, and he saw Sy's intelligence reflected \nin his work. This is what he said about Sy:\n\n       He seemed to have a clear head on his shoulders and was a \n     highly energetic individual. He was a pleasure to work with. \n     He was adventurous. I can see him going to foreign lands and \n     working for a big contractor.\n\n  Sy's father Stanley remembers his son as a strong family man. He \nremembers Sy the patriot, and Sy the man, who--despite his youth--was \nelected to the central committee of the Lucas County Democrat party. \nStanley said the following of his son, ``He believed in the union. He \nbelieved in his son and taking care of him. He believed in God.''\n  Mr. President, Sy Lucio may not have worn a uniform, but he was \nserving his Nation. He worked alongside our service members, he \ntraveled with them, and he worked to protect them by ensuring the good \nworking order and safety of their equipment. His death makes it \nabundantly clear that he shared many of the same risks. Whatever titles \nhe held, career-wise, though, he was first and foremost a loving \nfather, an adventurer, and a brave American. He died a hero.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Sy's family in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n\n                    Private First Class Samuel Bowen\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor and remember a fellow Ohioan--\nArmy PFC Samuel Bowen, from Cleveland, who lost his life on July 7, \n2004, while serving our country in Iraq.\n  Private First Class Bowen leaves his wife Melanie, their three \nchildren Tiust, Darius, and Breonna, his mother Elsie, and his two \nsisters Consuella and Tamatha.\n  Samuel--Sam to friends and family--was loved by everyone he met. \nKnown for his friendly face, Sam was the ``big man with a big heart, \nintimidating in size, but soft-spoken and kind.''\n  His demeanor made him a favorite among those who knew him. He was \nwell-liked by the patrons who frequented the restaurants where he \ncooked. And he was loved by his fellow Ohio National Guardsmen, who \nfought by his side.\n  Sam spent most of his life in Berlin, MD, before moving to Cleveland. \nHe was the middle child between two sisters. His mother described Sam \nas a typical boy who liked to take things apart and put them back \ntogether. At 8 years old, he would tag along with the local electrician \nwho gave him his own tool belt. Other fond memories include one when \nSam was 3 years old and liked to stand on the kitchen stool to cook a \nscrambled egg breakfast for his sisters.\n  Four years after graduating from Stephen Decatur High in Berlin, MD, \nSam enlisted in the Army where he honed the cooking skills he had \npracticed as a young boy. After retiring from active duty, Sam joined \nthe Reserves and was stationed in Iraq this past December as a member \nof the Ohio Army National Guard's 216th Engineering Battalion based in \nAkron, OH.\n  Although he was on the other side of the world, Sam made sure to keep \nin touch with his family, especially his wife Melanie and their \nchildren. Sam's sister Consuella remembers that Sam would often leave \nmessages on her answering machine--messages she has not erased.\n  Consuella described her brother with these words: ``nice and always \ndoing [things] for others. That was his thing--always doing for others, \ntrying to take care of everybody else.'' That's exactly what he did.\n  While in Iraq, Sam risked his life to save another soldier in his \nunit, his comrade Ron Eaton. On June 16, 2004, Sam and Ron were outside \nan Army PX store in the intense Iraqi heat, buying Gatorade, when \ngrenades were thrown at them. Several rounds came their way and \nshrapnel flew through the air injuring Ron and forcing him to the \nground. Without regard for his own safety, Sam grabbed Ron and pulled \nhim to safety while explosions erupted around them. Ron credits Sam \nwith saving his life in the incident that claimed the lives of three \nsoldiers and injured 25.\n  Sam was one of the first to call Ron following his surgery for the \ninjuries he sustained before Sam pulled him out of danger. Ron recalled \nthat Sam wanted to hear his voice to make sure his ``battle buddy'' was \nokay. Ron was looking forward to meeting Sam's family and wanted to \nthank him in person for saving his life.\n  Tragically, Ron will never have that chance, as Sam was killed when a \nrocket-propelled grenade exploded near his vehicle in Samarra, Iraq on \nJuly 7, 2004.\n  Sam Bowen was a hero--an American hero, whom we should remember the \nsame way his family will--as ``always doing the right thing.''\n  Just like Ron Eaton, we will never be able to fully thank Sam for his \nselflessness. We will never be able to adequately express our respect \nfor this man, who gave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  At times like this, I am reminded of something that President Reagan \nsaid almost 20 years ago at a Veteran's Day Celebration:\n\n       There is a special sadness that accompanies the death of a \n     serviceman, for we're never quite good enough to them--not \n     really; we can't be, because what they gave us is beyond our \n     powers to repay. And so, when a serviceman dies, it's a tear \n     in the fabric, a break in the whole, and all we can do is \n     remember.\n\n  Today, I stand here so that we may all remember Army PFC Samuel Bowen \nand the sacrifice he made for our country.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Sam's family and friends at Sam's \ncalling hours, and I know that they will forever remember his smiling \nface, his friendly demeanor, and giving attitude.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Sam's family and friends in our \nthoughts and prayers\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Lance Corporal Jonathan Etterling\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marine LCpl Jonathan \nEtterling, from Wheelersburg, OH, who died on January 26, 2005, in a \nhelicopter crash near Rutbah, Iraq. He was 22 years old. He is survived \nby his parents William and Kay and his sister Angela.\n  Born December 27, 1982, in Portsmouth, OH, Jonathan--Jon to his \nfamily and friends--was fascinated by military life from a young age. \nAs a boy, his mother remembers him spending hours taking apart a rifle \nand putting it back together. His bedroom walls were covered with \nmilitary posters. He loved war stories and movies--anything that \nrepresented bravery, selflessness, and sacrifice.\n  Jon's decision to join the Marines didn't surprise anyone who knew \nhim. As his Sunday school teacher Cathy Sizemore said, ``Some people \nhave a higher calling. Jon's was his country.''\n  Although Jon was the Etterling's only son, Jon had three surrogate \nbrothers growing up--his lifelong friends James Howard, Josh \nHuddleston, and Alex Watts. The three met as young kids growing up on \nthe playgrounds of Wheelersburg.\n  Alex remembers meeting Jon in first grade. Standing in knee high tube \nsocks and sporting a goofy grin, Jon had asked him, ``Hey--you wanna be \nfriends?'' Alex, shy and somewhat surprised, was happy to agree. Like \nso many other people, he was drawn to Jon's good-natured enthusiasm. \nQuickly Jon, James, Alex, and Josh became inseparable, causing others \nto jokingly refer to them as the Four Musketeers.\n  As a cheerful, easy-going student at Wheelersburg High School, Jon \nexcelled in the classroom and on the playing fields. He demonstrated \nboundless energy and dedication, playing nose tackle on the football \nteam, running track, singing in the chorus, and acting in plays. He \nwas, as his high school superintendent described, ``an outstanding \nyoung man . . . one of those kids who made you smile just being around \nhim.''\n  Jon was also an extremely hard worker. Jon was always trying to \nbetter himself, doing everything his athletic coaches asked of him. \nThis work ethic earned Jon the respect of fellow teammates and coaches. \nOne of his football teammates, Bryan Yelley, said this of Jon's \nattitude:\n\n       He was just one of those guys who got along with everybody. \n     He played hard--did everything as hard as he could. Whenever \n     he did something, he did it to the full extent of his \n     capabilities. As a person, he was everybody's friend.\n\n  Jon strove for excellence in everything he attempted. This \nstraightforward approach to life would help him achieve his lifelong \ndream of becoming a Marine. Regarding Jon's goal of serving our \ncountry, his football coach, Jim Gill, had this to say:\n\n       He was always interested in the military. I think when he \n     joined the Marines and reached boot camp, he reached his \n     goals. [With] the dedication he put into things he did, there \n     was never any doubt he would succeed.''\n\n  Jon's former defensive ends coach Dave Pyles agreed. ``Jon fit the \nbill of a Marine,'' he said. ``Being the first in, that was him.'' For \nJon, there was no greater privilege than to serve and protect this \ncountry.\n  Upon graduation from Wheelersburg High School in 2002, Jon and his \nthree closest friends--James, Josh, and Alex--joined the Marines and \nendured the rigors of boot camp--together. Unsurprisingly, Jon's \ndedication was evident during this challenging time. His friends \ndescribed him as ``the rock''--the one who they could all depend on for \nstrength and resolve. Among the very best of the Marine Corps, Jon \nstood out.\n  After completing his training at Parris Island, Jon was stationed in \nHawaii and spent 3 months in Thailand--plus time in Okinawa, Korea, and \nJapan--before going to Iraq. During this time, he was able to see and \nexplore a world much larger than most could imagine.\n  When Jon arrived in Iraq, he immediately moved to the front lines, \nnear Fallujah. He was enthusiastic about his job and excited to be \nthere. He wanted to make a difference. His father remembers that Jon \nwas doing what he loved--what he believed in. As his sister Angie said, \n``My brother was very much military material.''\n  I had the privilege of attending Marine Lance Corporal Etterling's \nfuneral and to meet his family and to see the overwhelming outpouring \nof love and support. Jon's three best friends--his brothers--James \nHoward, Josh Huddleston, and Alex Watts were able to attend the \nfuneral, as well. The Four Musketeers were united once again.\n  Jon's life and his service to this country will not be forgotten. \nUpbeat and cheerful, he was always willing to lend a hand to those who \nneeded it. He could be counted on to do the right thing. He had an \nincredible work ethic, a strong faith, and a deep respect for others. \nAnd no matter how difficult they were, he always accomplished his \ngoals.\n  His father summed it up best, when he said: ``I just can't be more \nproud of him.''\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family and friends of Lance \nCorporal Jonathan Etterling in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11606-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         EFFECTIVE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANCE FOR DRUG TREATMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, with the close of the 109th Congress, the \nSenate will lose to retirement one of our most seasoned and respected \nMembers--Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. Across five terms in this \nbody and before that three terms in the House of Representatives, where \nI was privileged to serve with him also, Paul Sarbanes has made his \nmark as a serious and diligent legislator, a classic workhorse Senator \nrather than a showhorse Senator. The Baltimore Sun has called him the \nsilver fox Senator who ``works quietly but with shrewd skillfulness.''\n  I have always respected and admired Senator Sarbanes, both as a \nstalwart Democrat and also always a proud, unabashed progressive.\n  As a young man, he graduated from Princeton and went on to Oxford as \na Rhodes Scholar and then Harvard Law School. But he never forgot his \nexperiences growing up among the families of Maryland's Eastern Shore. \nHe never forgot his roots as the son of a Greek immigrant who worked \nlong hours to build a successful restaurant business.\n  In the Senate, Paul Sarbanes has been outspoken in his support for \npublic schools, expanded access to higher education, to job training, \nand the other essential rungs on the ladder of economic opportunity in \nAmerica.\n  He has fought to protect Social Security, to clean up corruption in \nthe business world. In the wake of the Enron and WorldCom scandals, \nSenator Sarbanes took the lead in crafting legislation to prevent the \nrecurrence of the rampant accounting fraud that was destroying \nconfidence in corporate America.\n  In the early years of this past decade, in classic Sarbanes style--\nmethodically, thoughtfully, and minimum of partisanship--he held 10 \nhearings on the issue in 2002, listening to all points of view. The \nresult is known universally as the Sarbanes-Oxley law which cleaned up \nthe accounting industry and mandated new disclosure and conflict-of-\ninterest reporting requirements on U.S. corporations.\n  There are many reasons why Paul Sarbanes is the longest serving \nSenator in Maryland history. Throughout his career in this body, he has \nfought hard on issues of special importance to Maryland, including \nlegislation to protect the Chesapeake Bay. But he has never lost touch \nwith his roots among working people and the immigrant community.\n  He has always been a model public servant, a person of enormous \nintellect, intelligence, integrity, and industry. For 30 years in the \nSenate, Paul Sarbanes has faithfully served the people of Maryland and \nthe people of the United States, and there is no doubt he will pursue \nnew avenues of public service in retirement.\n  I will miss his friendship, I will miss his wise counsel in the \nSenate, but I wish Paul and also his wonderful wife Christine all the \nbest in the years ahead.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to follow that up by expressing my \nrespect and admiration for a longtime friend of mine, my neighbor to \nthe north, so to speak, who is also retiring this year; that is, our \nSenator from Minnesota, Mark Dayton.\n  Senator Dayton is a public servant in the purest sense of that term. \nHe did not come to the Senate 6 years ago in search of status or \ncelebrity or power for power's sake. He has never sought the spotlight. \nHe came here for one reason: to serve the people of Minnesota and of \nthe United States. He has done so in a diligent, consistent, and \nselfless manner.\n  I especially appreciate the way Senator Dayton has followed in the \nprogressive tradition of Minnesota's great Senators, Hubert Humphrey, \nGene McCarthy, Chris Mondale, and Paul Wellstone. On issue after issue, \nhe has fought for working people and their families, for seniors, and \nfor the least fortunate among us. To take just one case in point, no \nSenator has been more persistent and eloquent in fighting to allow \nseniors to purchase prescription drugs in Canada where pharmaceuticals \nare oftentimes less expensive. He has donated his entire Senate salary \nto the Minnesota Senior Federation to help finance trips on the \n``Prescription Express'' to purchase cheaper drugs in Canada, and he \nhas gone to bat for seniors when they were harassed by border agents \nupon their return.\n  To his everlasting credit, Senator Dayton voted against a resolution \neffectively authorizing the war in Iraq. He spoke out passionately \nagainst the dangers of launching that war. He has used his seat on the \nArmed Services Committee to take the administration to task for its \nmultiple mistakes and failures in conducting that war. There has been a \nsingular absence of effective oversight of this war on the part of this \nCongress, but as an individual Senator, Mark Dayton has done his best \nto fill that vacuum. On the Armed Services Committee, he has been \ncourageous and outspoken, and we will remember him for that.\n  Throughout his adult life, Mark Dayton has been devoted to serving \nothers and looking out for those in the shadows of life. After \ngraduating from Yale, he could have gone on in the family retail \nbusiness. He could have coasted on his family's wealth, but he chose a \nvery different course. He chose to work as a teacher for 3 years in a \npretty tough public school on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Later he \nwent to work as a counselor for runaway young people, as chief \nfinancial officer of a social service agency in Boston, and then as a \nstaffer to Senator Walter Mondale. After returning home to Minnesota, \nhe also served as the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of \nEnergy and Economic Development. He was elected State auditor in 1990.\n  I think the first time I met Mark Dayton, I was a Congressman in Iowa \nand he was running for the Senate in Minnesota, and that was 1982. I \nwent up to campaign for him. I had been involved in agriculture and \nagricultural endeavors, and so I went up to meet with them and met this \nyoung guy running for the Senate. He was unsuccessful that year--I hope \nnot due to the fact that I went to campaign for him. He was \nunsuccessful that year, but he never gave up. He never gave up trying \nto find new avenues to serving the people of Minnesota.\n  As I said, that culminated in him serving as the commissioner of the \nDepartment of Energy and Economic Development for a number of years \nunder Governor Perpich and then being elected in his own right as the \nState auditor in 1990. Under his leadership as State auditor of \nMinnesota, he did a lot to make sure that State government was running \nefficiently and effectively and transparently and making sure the \nauditor's office kept a check on all the different agencies in \nMinnesota to make sure they were expending the taxpayers' dollars \nwisely and legally and transparently.\n  So I was delighted when, even though in 1982 he didn't make it to the \nSenate, he then made it in the year 2000. In the last 6 years, again, \nas I said, Mark Dayton has devoted himself selflessly to helping people \nless fortunate in our society. His common theme has been amplified \npowerfully: his passion for public service and his commitment to \nlooking out for others. So I have no doubt that Mark will pursue other \navenues of public service in the years ahead.\n  I will miss his friendship here on the Senate floor, but our \nfriendship will continue. I know that in whatever capacity he can find, \nhe will do what he can to make Minnesota and our country a better, \nfairer, and more just place for all its citizens. I certainly wish my \ngood friend Mark Dayton the best in the years ahead.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11608-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11608-S11609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11608]]\n                   HEAD START PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I now turn to a topic not as good as what \nI just talked about. In the final hours of the Congress, as we have \nhere today--maybe going into tomorrow--I am always amazed at how those \nwho are well off in our society, those who are doing quite well, how \nthey always get taken care of in the final hours when the Congress \ncloses down. Tax extenders--why, there is stuff for everybody in there, \nfor the people who are doing well. A continuing resolution will come \nthrough, basically taking care of all the running of Government. We \nhave a few other cats and dogs coming through here. It is always at \nthis time that I am amazed at how often it is that people who are at \nthe bottom rung of our ladder economically speaking fall through the \ncracks and no one cares. Hey, we have business to do here. We have to \nget the tax extenders through. We have to get out of here and go home.\n  Because of the failure of the Appropriations Committee in the House, \nbecause of their failure to do a small extension, which I will explain \nin a second, because of their failure, beginning in January, 54,000 \nkids will not be able to go to Head Start Programs in this country. \nFifty-four thousand kids have been in Head Start Programs in December \nand November, but in January, January 3--they probably won't be going \nto Head Start. Now, again, they will only be out for a couple of months \nbecause once we get back in here and we do another extension, either a \nCR--a continuing resolution--or an omnibus bill, we will take care of \nit. The authorizers aren't opposed to it; I have checked with them. The \nappropriators aren't opposed to it. But it wasn't put in the bill. They \nfiled the rule in the House, and they can't change it, they say, now.\n  Let me describe what I am talking about, why 54,000 kids--poor kids--\nwon't get Head Start beginning in January. What happened was on January \n18, 2001, a rule was promulgated from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. A rule was promulgated which said that by January 18, \n2006--last January 18--it required that all Head Start children be \ntransported only on buses that are or very closely match school buses. \nWell, I have pointed out continually since that time that this is very \nonerous for a lot of kids who are now transported on paratransit buses. \nThese are transportation vehicles which are not school buses, but they \nare paratransit vehicles which usually take the elderly to places or \nthey take people with disabilities to work or to shop or whatever. They \nare paratransit vehicles. They are usually smaller vehicles, but they \nare not a ``schoolbus.'' But they are effectively used, and have been \nfor many years, to transport kids to Head Start Programs. Of course, \nthe children are transported in child safety seats that are placed on \nthe paratransit buses.\n  Well, they estimate there are about 54,000 kids in America today who \nget transported to and from Head Start using paratransit. The rule \nwhich said they had to go on schoolbuses was supposed to go into effect \nlast January 18. Well, it didn't. Why? Because a lot of us here \nbipartisanly said: Wait a minute, this is not right. This is not right. \nWe need to fix this.\n  Well, how do you fix it? You fix it with Head Start reauthorization. \nThe last Head Start reauthorization was in 1998. We thought there was \ngoing to be a Head Start reauthorization this year. We thought, \nfinally, this year we are going to get a Head Start reauthorization \nbill and we will take care of this mess created by this rule of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. So we extended this deadline \nfrom January 18; we extended it until June.\n  Well, they still hadn't passed a Head Start reauthorization, so on \nthe Katrina supplemental we extended it until December 31 of this year. \nSo what we did was we extended a moratorium, an abeyance of that rule \nuntil December 31 of this year so that kids--Head Start kids had been \nriding paratransit buses to and from Head Start since--well, for years \nbut since January 18 of this year when that rule was supposed to go \ninto effect, the rule that said they can't ride them anymore, which, \nagain, is nonsense--nonsense. It is much cheaper, it is just as \neffective, and there are a number of other reasons why riding these \nparatransit buses are fine for these kids. So we put it off. We held \nthis rule in abeyance until December 31; that is, this December 31. \nOnce again, we didn't get a Head Start reauthorization, so we wanted to \nextend it again past December 31. So how do you extend it? You extend \nit on the appropriations bill, the continuing resolution.\n  Now, had we done our job and gotten the various appropriations bills \nup, we would have put this in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation appropriations bill. We would have extended the time probably \nuntil next September 30 to give us time to pass a Head Start \nreauthorization. So I called over last night. I talked to the staff \ndirector of the House Appropriations Committee. I told him about this: \nCan't you put it in? There is no opposition to it. Well, they didn't \nput it in. I called him today. He said, well, he checked with the \nauthorizing committee and he said the authorizing committee was opposed \nto it. I couldn't believe it. So I called the chairman of the \nauthorizing committee, Congressman McKeon from California, with whom I \nhave worked in the past. I talked to him about it. He got back to me \nand he said: I don't have any opposition to it. I checked with the \nappropriators; the appropriators didn't have any opposition to it on \neither side of the aisle. They thought: Yes, this is fine. But it was \nleft out.\n  You know, if this had been a provision to take care of some wealthy \npeople in this country, some special interest group, you can bet it \nwould not have been dropped. It wouldn't have been dropped. But now \n54,000 kids won't get to go to Head Start.\n  I mentioned that to someone today, and here is what they said: Well, \nwhy can't their mamas take them? I am not talking about kids who have \nBMWs or SUVs. These are poor kids. They don't have cars. They don't \nhave vehicles. I am not talking about middle-income kids who live in \nthe suburbs; I am talking about the poorest kids in our country going \nto Head Start Programs. They don't have mamas who can take them in an \nSUV or a carpool. So here we are.\n  So I put the word out. I said: Well, when that CR comes over here, it \nis amendable. I will offer an amendment to put it on there. There is no \ncost. Everybody is for it. Nobody wants to object. Now I hear that if I \ndo, there will be a motion to table my amendment. They will table it \nbecause the House will send over their continuing resolution and then \nthey are going to go home, adjourn and go home. So if I offered my \namendment, and if it were to pass, it would mean the House would either \nhave to stay in or come back.\n\n  Then they will tell me, Oh, you can't do that, Harkin, because don't \nyou know the Government will shut down. You see, the continuing \nresolution that we are on now funds the Government until midnight \ntonight. They will say if you do that, they will have to come back, it \nwill shut the Government down, and blah, blah, blah. Mr. President, \nthose 54,000 kids not going to Head Start, January, February, maybe \nMarch until we can get our bill through, I think is more important--I \nstand tonight to tell you and tell anyone who is watching, it is more \nimportant for those 54,000 kids to go to Head Start in January, \nFebruary, and March than it is to allow 435 Congressmen to get out of \ntown and go home. It is more important.\n  Once in a while I have gotten a reputation around here for doing \nthings in the last hour. Usually it is because something such as this \nhappens. It seems to me it is always true that at the end, the final \nhour, it is something such as this, and some on the bottom rungs of the \neconomic or social ladder of this country get dropped and forgotten. We \nought to be ashamed of ourselves. We can't fix this? We can't take care \nof this? Because they filed, they have a rule, this and that?\n  I tried to get this on the postal reform bill. There is a postal \nreform bill out there floating around someplace. Oh, we can't do it \nnow. They are done writing it and blah, blah, blah. We just can't do \nit.\n  It is a shame, isn't it? It is a shame that we can take care of the \nrich and the powerful, it is a shame that we can take care of postal \nreform. It is a shame we can take care of continuing the resolution to \nkeep everyone paid in the Federal Government. But, we can't\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\nfind it in ourselves somehow to take care of these kids, these Head \nStart kids. We are just going to say I am sorry, that is the way it is.\n  I haven't made up my mind yet whether I am going to offer this \namendment tonight, or whenever that CR gets over. I have a right to. It \nwill probably get tabled which means killed. The word has already gone \nout that we will probably have to table the Harkin amendment. I suppose \npeople will say there goes Harkin again. We want to get out of town and \nhe has something else.\n  I don't know. I haven't made up my mind yet. I wanted to set the \nrecord straight. You are going to hear about it. Senators are going to \nhear about this in January. You are going to hear about the fact that \nHead Start kids for some reason can't get on these paratransit buses \nand we are wondering why it happened.\n  I don't know, I may offer the amendment tonight, and if someone moves \nto table, I may ask for a rollcall vote, and we will see how important \n54,000 kids are compared to 435 Congressmen over there who can't come \nback in a moment to take care of these kids in January and February, \nthe coldest parts of the winter in certain parts of our country. So we \nwill have to see, we will see what happens to the CR when it comes \nover. I guess I want to tell my colleagues they will probably have to \nvote on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to a very special lady. \nI mourn her passing today, a great American patriot, Jeane Jordan \nKirkpatrick. She, of course, is best known as our Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations under the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, but her history \nwas of a dedicated American in public service before that.\n  She first rose to international prominence as a foreign policy \nadviser to Ronald Reagan's first Presidential campaign. Although she \nconsidered herself a Democrat at that time, she always placed principle \nabove partisanship. In Governor Reagan, she saw a man who shared her \ncommitment to freedom and democracy and was willing to call evil by \nname.\n  As America's first female permanent representative to the United \nNations, Jeane served President Reagan from 1981 to 1985, and was an \neloquent promoter of American values. She once said, ``I think that \nit's always appropriate for Americans and for American foreign policy \nto make it clear why we feel that self-government is most compatible \nwith peace, the well-being of people, and human dignity.''\n  Since leaving full-time Government service, Jeane Kirkpatrick has \nserved as an educator, commentator, a wise woman whose counsel has been \nhighly sought after. She has continued to be a passionate advocate for \nhuman rights and has also actively supported missile defense, United \nNations reform, and the war against Islamic fascism. Most recently, I \nhave had the pleasure of working with Jeane on the Committee on the \nPresent Danger, which Senator Lieberman and I cochair, and on which she \nplayed an important advisory role.\n  America has lost a great patriot and defender in Jeane Kirkpatrick. \nShe will be sorely missed, but she will certainly be fondly remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11609-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING CONGRESSIONAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. KYL.

I wish him godspeed in his new \nendeavors. He certainly has been a joy to work with as part of the \nRepublican leadership because of his good temperament, his wise \ncounsel, his knowledge of human nature, and his deep commitment to this \nbody, the people of Tennessee and, most importantly, to the United \nStates of America.\n\n\n                             Dennis Hastert\n\n  I also want to acknowledge that we will no longer have as Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives in a couple of weeks a colleague of mine \nwhen I first came to the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert of \nIllinois. I saw Dennis this morning at the White House with the \nPresident, who also acknowledged the great contribution of Dennis \nduring his period as Speaker of the House. Since we were colleagues \ncoming to the House of Representatives in 1986, I will say a special \nword of thanks to Dennis for his service.\n\n\n                            Katie Altshuler\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to make some comments about Katie Altshuler. \nKatie has been the head of the Republican policy committee the last \nseveral months and has served several of us here in this body, \nprimarily with her work here on the floor of the Senate. Katie will be \ngreatly missed by all the staff of the Republican policy committee but \nalso by the staff of all of the Senate family here, who know that she \nwas a very big part of that Senate family. She and her husband will be \nreturning to Oklahoma. I know all of us wish her well. She is one of \nthose little sparks of humanity who makes life a little bit more \nworthwhile at some of these long nights and weekends that we \noccasionally have to spend here in the Senate.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  I also acknowledge that several of my colleagues will not be with us \nafter we conclude our business tonight, tomorrow, the next day, or \nwhenever we are going to conclude our business here, colleagues with \nwhom I have served with a great deal of pleasure.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition in these waning \nhours of the 109th Congress to provide a summary of the good work \naccomplished over the last 2 years on behalf of America's veterans, and \nto comment on comprehensive legislation that is now pending in the \nSenate. I provide this summary in my capacity as chairman of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, a title I will soon pass on to my \nfriend, Senator Danny Akaka of Hawaii.\n  Before the 109th Congress convened, I made a decision to serve as \nchairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n[[Page S11610]]\n\nfor two fundamental reasons. The first and most important was that our \ncountry was at war and continues to be at war, and a nation at war, \nwith hundreds of thousands of young men and women having spent \nextensive tours overseas in hostile lands, fighting for our country, \ndeserves the full attention of the Senate. Many have died during the \ncourse of combat operations. Others have been seriously wounded. \nThousands more will transition out of the military service in the \ncoming years and will attempt to reenter the workforce or go to school \nunder the Montgomery GI bill. There simply was no greater calling than \nfor me to assume the leadership role to ensure our Government was \neffectively assisting the current generation of America's veterans and \ntheir families.\n  Second, I have always been nonplused, I guess, at the \ncharacterization that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs was a ``B'' \ncommittee. This characterization exists despite these facts. Mr. \nPresident, 24 million Americans have served in the military and are \npotentially eligible for VA-administered benefits. In addition, VA will \nsoon have a budget over $80 billion, which is one of the largest and \nfastest growing budgets within Government. And finally, VA has the \nsecond largest Federal workforce of any Government agency.\n  Therefore, it was my goal to elevate the committee's profile and the \nimportance of the veterans' benefits and services by embarking on a \ncourse of vigorous oversight and legislative effort and, I believe, \naccomplishment.\n  It is my humble opinion that I share the credit with 13 other members \nof the committee. One of them is here on the floor with me, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison of Texas, who also served not only on the authorizing \ncommittee with me but chairs VA MilCon and has played a critical role \nin veterans issues. We have been diligent and active participants of \nthe committee, and the business of this committee, in my opinion, has \nbeen extremely productive in the last 2 years.\n  The committee held 52 hearings during the 109th Congress. From the \nstart, our focus was on the combat wounded, the combat deceased, and \ntheir families. We held a hearing on the difficulty that surviving \nspouses have in getting timely and effective, consistent information \nregarding their benefits following the active-duty death of their loved \none.\n  We held several hearings on whether returned combat veterans are \nprovided with a seamless transition--many of us have heard those words \nused--from active duty to civilian life. We are still working with DOD \non that, to make sure it is truly seamless.\n  We focused on medical and vocational needs of our severely wounded. \nWe examined the research being done within the VA to advance our \nunderstanding of various diseases and disabilities confronting veterans \nin the hope that advances in medical science and technology could one \nday improve their lives. And there is clear evidence today that that \nvery thing is happening.\n  The committee was particularly active in examining VA's budget needs, \nand no one can argue about the high priority this Congress placed on \nfunding the VA system.\n  The total VA budget will have increased from approximately $63 \nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2004 to over $80 billion upon \nenactment of a fiscal year 2007 appropriations bill, an increase of 27 \npercent.\n  In addition to resources provided, this Congress has put in place a \nsystem of accountability to ensure that the appropriations provided to \nVA are being used to meet the needs of those who rely on the vital \nhealth care provided by VA facilities around the Nation.\n  By law, VA now submits quarterly reports to the Congress on its \nbudget that contain a comparison between VA's planned expenditures and \nactual expenditures.\n  More importantly, VA is required to include quality indicators in \nthis report, such as the percentage of primary care appointments \nscheduled within 30 days of a patient's desired date.\n  I am confident that the Congress has the mechanisms in place to know, \non short order, if VA's budget needs are outpacing its resources, and \nis therefore equipped to take swift remedial action if necessary.\n  On the legislative front, the Senate has continued to do the work \nexpected of it by the men and women we serve and represent. Let me give \na quick accounting of the legislative provisions that were enacted into \nlaw during this Congress:\n  First S. 1234 and S. 2562. In both the first and second sessions of \nthe Congress, cost-of-living-adjustment legislation was enacted to \nincrease the rates of disability compensation and survivors' \ncompensation. Benefit rates were increased by 4.1 percent for 2006 and \nwill be increased by 3.3 percent for 2007.\n  Second, Traumatic Injury Protection under Servicemembers' Group Life \nInsurance, T-SGLI. In many instances the wives, parents, and other \nfamily members of servicemembers who are traumatically injured incur \nsubstantial financial obligations in order to spend time with their \nloved ones during recovery periods at military hospitals.\n  Under the provisions of Public Law 109-13, those traumatically \nwounded since the start of OIF and OEF as a result of combat wounds are \neligible for financial payments which range from $25,000 to $100,000 \nfor qualifying injuries, depending on severity. To date, more than \n2.500 wounded servicemembers have received payments as a direct result \nof this legislation.\n  As of December 1, 2005, all servicemembers and Reservists insured \nunder the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program are also covered \nunder the T-SGLI benefit. The coverage extends to all qualifying \ninjuries regardless of whether injuries are incurred as a result of \ncombat.\n  Under the provisions of H.R. 3200, the maximum coverage for members \nof the Armed Forces and veterans of the Service Members Group Life \nInsurance and the Veterans Group Life Insurance benefit was increased \nfrom $250,000 to $400,000.\n  The bill, as enacted, also requires that spouses be notified when \nmembers insured under T-SGLI elect less than maximum coverage or \ndesignate a beneficiary other than the spouse or the children or the \nchild.\n  In fiscal year 2006, the National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. \n1815, under provisions of H.R. 1815 and as a result of veterans \ncommittees oversights, the Department of Defense was directed to \nprovide customized integrated information to survivors of those killed \non active duty about their future Federal benefits through an Internet \nWeb site.\n  I was amazed when we started these hearings that we were still \ndealing with a hodgepodge of approaches of how we dealt with the \nsurviving spouse of a lost one.\n  DOD was also directed to develop a uniform policy on providing \ncasualty assistance to survivors. I would like to especially thank \nSenators Warner and Levin for their cooperation on that bill.\n  Also under H.R. 1815, a provision was adopted to prohibit military \nfuneral honors and burial in VA national cemeteries and in Arlington \nNational Cemetery to any person who is convicted of a Federal or State \ncapital murder for which a sentence of death or life in prison may be \nimposed\n  We had an example of a fellow from Maryland who had killed two \nelderly people and was sentenced to death, died in prison, and was \nburied at Arlington. This provision was adopted following our \ncommittee's oversight and hearing of that double murder that I just \nexpressed. I will speak more to my colleagues about the status of the \ndouble murder incident in a moment.\n  In June of 2006 President Bush signed into law S. 1235, a bill to \nhelp severely injured servicemembers in their transition from the \nmilitary to their civilian lives. It authorizes VA to make grants \navailable--ranging from $2,000 to $14,000--to assist with housing \nadaptations on a family member's home in which a severely disabled \nveteran is living.\n  It allows servicemembers, who have been legally determined 100 \npercent disabled when they separated from the military, up to 2 years \nfrom that date to apply for premium-free Servicemembers' Group Life \nInsurance coverage. Finally, it enables them to convert their coverage \nto Veterans' Group Life Insurance, or an individual plan or policy, \nduring the same 2-year period.\n  As to H.R. 5037, undoubtedly most of my colleagues are aware of the \nfringe\n\n[[Page S11611]]\n\ngroup which has used its protected free speech rights to deliberately \ndisrupt funerals of our military heroes. That is why the Senate voted \nunanimously to put reasonable restrictions on demonstrations at VA \ncemeteries and Arlington National Cemetery.\n  An amendment was put forward on the floor of the Senate balancing the \nrights of grieving families to a dignified funeral ceremony; the rights \nof private property owners who live near cemeteries to be free from \noverly intrusive Federal laws; and the rights of demonstrators to have \ntheir message heard. The amendment was accepted, the bill was passed, \nand it is now Federal law.\n  In addition to the bills already enacted into law, the House and \nSenate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have agreed on a comprehensive \nsubstitute amendment to S. 3421, which has cleared the House and awaits \nSenate action. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  S. 3421, the ``Veterans Benefits. Health Care, and Information \nTechnology Act of 2006,'' contains provisions that would: enhance \nveterans' health, education, memorial affairs, and other benefit \nprograms; improve VA's information technology infrastructure; authorize \nthe construction of needed VA medical facilities; improve services for \nhomeless veterans; remove the remains of a convicted double murderer \nfrom Arlington National Cemetery; and, I am proud to say, repeal an \noutdated and paternalistic law that limits the ability of veterans to \nhire an attorney to represent them during the VA claims process.\n  While a fuller accounting of the provisions of S. 3421 can be found \nin the Joint Explanatory Statement language accompanying the amendment \ntext in the Congressional Record--and I ask unanimous consent that the \nJoint Explanatory Statement be printed in the Record along with the \ntext of the substitute amendment to S. 3421,--I will make a few remarks \nabout three provisions of note that I have championed.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT ON AMENDMENT TO SENATE BILL, S. 3421, AS \n                                AMENDED\n\n       S. 3421, as amended, the ``Veterans Benefits, Healthcare, \n     and Information Technology Act of 2006,'' reflects a \n     Compromise Agreement reached by the House and Senate \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs (the Committees) on the \n     following bills reported during the 109th Congress: H.R. \n     1220, as amended, H.R. 3082, as amended, H.R. 5815, as \n     amended, H.R. 5835, as amended, H.R. 6314, H.R. 6342 (House \n     Bills) and S. 716, S. 1182, as amended, S. 2694, as amended, \n     and S. 3421, as amended (Senate Bills).\n       H.R. 1220, as amended, passed the House on July 13, 2005; \n     H.R. 3082, as amended, passed the House on July 24, 2006; \n     H.R. 5815, as amended, passed the House on September 13, \n     2006; H.R. 5835, as amended, passed the House on September \n     26, 2006; H.R. 6314 passed the House on November 14, 2006; \n     H.R. 6342 passed the House on December 6, 2006 and passed the \n     Senate on December 7, 2006; S. 716 passed the Senate on \n     December 22, 2005; S. 1182, as amended, passed the Senate on \n     December 22, 2005; S. 2694, as amended, passed the Senate on \n     August 3, 2006; and S. 3421 passed the Senate on September \n     26, 2006.\n       The Committees have prepared the following explanation of \n     S. 3421, as further amended, to reflect a compromise \n     agreement between the Committees (Compromise Agreement). \n     Differences between the provisions contained in the \n     Compromise Agreement and the related provisions of the House \n     Bills and the Senate Bills are noted in this document, except \n     for clerical corrections, conforming changes made necessary \n     by the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, \n     and clarifying changes.\n\n                TITLE I--ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION MATTERS\n\n\n    ATTORNEY REPRESENTATION IN VETERANS' BENEFITS CASES BEFORE THE \n                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n     Current law\n       Chapter 59 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     policies and procedures with respect to individuals acting as \n     agents and attorneys before the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA). Section 5901 of title 38, United States Code, \n     generally requires that any agent or attorney be recognized \n     by the Secretary in order to act in the preparation, \n     presentation, or prosecution of a claim before VA. Section \n     5902(a) of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the \n     Secretary to recognize representatives of certain \n     organizations to act in that capacity for claims before VA \n     and section 5903 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes \n     the Secretary to recognize an individual for purposes of a \n     specific claim before VA. Section 5904(a) of title 38, United \n     States Code, provides general authority for the Secretary to \n     recognize agents or attorneys to act as representatives in \n     the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of claims \n     before VA. To be recognized under section 5904(a) of title \n     38, United States Code, the Secretary may require that the \n     individual show that he or she is of good moral character and \n     in good repute, is qualified, and is competent. For agents or \n     attorneys recognized under section 5904(a) of title 38, \n     United States Code, the Secretary is authorized to suspend or \n     exclude the individual from practicing before VA for any of \n     the reasons set forth in section 5904(b) of title 38, United \n     States Code. Section 5904(c) of title 38, United States Code, \n     generally provides that an agent or attorney may not \n     charge a fee for services ``provided before the date on \n     which the Board of Veterans' Appeals first makes a final \n     decision in a case.'' Section 5905 of title 38, United \n     States Code, specifies that individuals may be fined or \n     imprisoned for impermissibly charging, soliciting, or \n     receiving a fee other than as provided in section 5904(c) \n     of title 38, United States Code.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 101(a)(1) of S. 2694, as amended, would add three \n     new subparagraphs to section 5904(a) of title 38, United \n     States Code. New subparagraph (2) would authorize the \n     Secretary to issue regulations prescribing qualifications and \n     standards of conduct that individuals must satisfy to be \n     recognized under section 5904(a) of title 38, United States \n     Code, including having a specified level of experience or \n     specialized training. New subparagraph (3) would authorize \n     the Secretary to issue regulations setting forth reasonable \n     restrictions on the amount of fees that an agent or attorney \n     may charge for services rendered in connection with a claim \n     before VA. New subparagraph (4) would authorize the Secretary \n     to charge a periodic registration fee to agents or attorneys \n     recognized under section 5904(a) of title 38, United States \n     Code, in order to help defray any costs to VA in collecting \n     such fees, recognizing individuals under section 5904(a) of \n     title 38, United States Code, administering the payment of \n     fees, and overseeing agents or attorneys.\n       Section 101(a)(2) and (3) of S. 2694, as amended, would \n     amend sections 5902 and 5903 of title 38, United States Code, \n     to subject individuals recognized under those sections to \n     suspension from practice before VA for any of the reasons \n     specified in section 5904(b) of title 38, United States Code. \n     Section 101(b) of S. 2694, as amended, would amend section \n     5904(b) of title 38, United States Code, to allow the \n     Secretary to suspend an individual from practicing before VA \n     if the individual presents frivolous claims, issues, or \n     arguments to VA or fails to comply with any other conditions \n     specified by the Secretary in regulations. Those new bases \n     for suspension, as well as the bases currently listed in \n     section 5904(b) of title 38, United States Code, would apply \n     to any individual recognized under section 5902(a), section \n     5903, or section 5904(a) of title 38, United States Code.\n       Section 101(c) of S. 2694, as amended, would repeal the \n     provisions of section 5904(c) of title 38, United States \n     Code, that prohibit agents or attorneys from charging a fee \n     for services rendered prior to the date on which the Board of \n     Veterans' Appeals first makes a final decision in the case. \n     The purpose of this section would be to allow any individual \n     to hire an agent or attorney to represent the individual at \n     any stage of the VA proceedings. As conforming changes, \n     section 101(d) would modify the requirements for attorneys to \n     file fee agreements with VA and section 101(e) would \n     authorize the Secretary to review attorney fee agreements. In \n     addition, section 101(f) would amend 5905 to strike the \n     criminal penalties applicable to an individual who \n     impermissibly solicits, charges, or receives a fee for \n     services provided in connection with a proceeding before VA.\n       Finally, section 101(g) of S. 2694, as amended, would set \n     forth the effective date for the provisions of section 101. \n     In general, the provisions of section 101 would be effective \n     6 months after the date of enactment. However, the provisions \n     that would provide additional bases for suspension, repeal \n     the limitation on hiring agents or attorneys, modify the \n     requirements for filing fee agreements, and modify the \n     Secretary's authority to review fee agreements would apply \n     only to claims submitted to VA on or after the effective \n     date.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 101 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language, except that it would allow individuals \n     to hire an agent or attorney only after a notice of \n     disagreement has been filed in a case as provided in section \n     7105 of title 38, United States Code. In addition, the \n     Secretary would be required to prescribe in regulations the \n     qualifications and standards of conduct for recognizing \n     individuals under section 5904(a) of title 38, United States \n     Code. The Secretary also would be required to prescribe in \n     regulations a requirement that an individual recognized under \n     section 5904(a) of title 38, United States Code, annually \n     provide to VA information about all jurisdictions where the \n     individual is admitted to practice law, relevant \n     identification numbers, and a self-certification that the \n     individual is in good standing in all such jurisdictions.\n       The Compromise Agreement would allow the Secretary to \n     suspend or exclude an individual recognized under section \n     5904(a) of\n\n[[Page S11612]]\n\n     title 38, United States Code, from practicing before VA if \n     the individual charges excessive or unreasonable fees and \n     would preclude the agent or attorney from being reinstated \n     unless the excessive fees are refunded to the client. It \n     would also add language to the effect that fees that \n     represent no more than 20 percent of an award of past-due \n     benefits shall be presumed reasonable.\n       The Compromise Agreement would prohibit the Secretary from \n     recognizing an agent or attorney under section 5904(a) of \n     title 38, United States Code, if the agent or attorney has \n     been suspended or disbarred and would permit the Secretary to \n     suspend or exclude an agent or attorney for that reason.\n       Finally, the Secretary would be permitted to charge agents \n     or attorneys an assessment in circumstances when a fee for \n     services is provided directly by the Secretary to an agent or \n     attorney from past-due benefits. The assessment would be \n     equal to 5 percent of the amount of such fees to be paid to \n     the agent or attorney, except that the amount of the \n     assessment may not exceed $100. The Committees intend that \n     these assessments would assist VA with the cost of processing \n     payments of attorneys' fees.\n       The Compromise Agreement would also require the Secretary \n     to report to the Committees, 42 months after the date of \n     enactment, on the effect of permitting representation, for a \n     fee, after a notice of disagreement is filed, and recommend \n     any changes to that law.\n\n                        TITLE II--HEALTH MATTERS\n\n\n                   ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS\n\n     Current law\n       Chapter 74 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes VA \n     to hire a wide range of clinical care personnel to provide \n     treatment to veterans who seek health services from the \n     Department. Because the hiring authority is specific to \n     listed medical professionals, VA is not permitted to employ \n     any professional not mentioned in statute.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 5 of S. 1182, as amended, would establish \n     qualifications and add the professions of Marriage and Family \n     Therapist and Licensed Mental Health Counselor to the list of \n     clinical care providers VA is authorized to hire.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n  PAY COMPARABILITY FOR THE CHIEF NURSING OFFICER, OFFICE OF NURSING \n                                SERVICES\n\n     Current law\n       Section 7451 of title 38, United States Code, prohibits VA \n     from paying the position of Chief Nursing Officer, Office of \n     Nursing Services, at a rate that exceeds the maximum rate \n     established for the Senior Executive Service under section \n     5382 of title 5, United States Code.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 6 of S. 1182, as amended, would exempt the position \n     of Chief Nursing Officer, Office of Nursing Services, from \n     the provisions of section 7451 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n          IMPROVEMENT AND EXPANSION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES\n\n     Current law\n       Various provisions in subchapter II, chapter 17 of title \n     38, United States Code, authorizes VA to provide mental \n     health care and readjustment counseling services to veterans \n     enrolled in the VA health care system.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 8 of S. 1182, as amended, would direct VA to expand \n     and improve programs and services in a number of settings in \n     order to ensure that VA can adequately address the mental \n     health needs of returning servicemen and women, and would \n     authorize the appropriation of $95,000,000 in each of fiscal \n     years 2006 and 2007 to carry out the provisions contained in \n     this section.\n       VA would be directed to expand the number of clinical \n     treatment teams principally dedicated to the treatment of \n     PTSD; expand treatment and diagnosis services for substance \n     abuse; expand tele-health initiatives principally dedicated \n     to mental health care in communities located great distances \n     from current VA facilities; improve programs that provide \n     education in mental health treatment to primary care \n     clinicians; and expand the number of Community-Based \n     Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) capable of providing treatment for \n     mental illness.\n       It would also require VA to ensure that it has the capacity \n     to provide, or monitor the provision of, mental health \n     services at every CBOC in the system. As part of this, VA \n     would be directed to establish performance standards and \n     working environments that give appropriate recognition to the \n     importance of mental health care.\n       Additionally, require VA to meet the needs of any veteran \n     who entered a VA health care facility seeking mental health \n     or substance abuse treatment and would provide VA the option \n     of using tele-mental health services or contracting to \n     implement the law.\n       It would require the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans \n     Affairs to establish a joint VA and Department of Defense \n     (DOD) workgroup that would consist of seven experts in the \n     fields of mental health and readjustment counseling from each \n     Department. The workgroup would examine ways to combat \n     stigmas associated with mental health to better educate \n     families of servicemembers about how to deal with such \n     issues, and would require the Departments to report to \n     Congress on their findings.\n       It would also require VA and DOD to enter into a Memorandum \n     of Understanding to ensure that all separating servicemembers \n     receive mental health and sexual trauma screening.\n       It would direct VA to establish systemwide guidelines for \n     screening primary care patients for potential mental health \n     issues or disorders, as well as to conduct appropriate \n     training for clinicians of the Department to carry out mental \n     health consultations.\n       It would require VA's National Center on Post-Traumatic \n     Stress Disorder (PTSD) to collaborate with the Secretary of \n     Defense for the purposes of enabling DOD mental health care \n     providers and clinicians to benefit from the unique and \n     comprehensive expertise that VA has in the area of PTSD \n     diagnosis and treatment. It would also direct the two \n     entities to develop joint training and protocols to ensure \n     consistency and authorize the appropriation of $2,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2006 for the purpose of carrying out these \n     requirements.\n     House bill\n       H.R. 1588, the Comprehensive Assistance for Veterans \n     Exposed to Traumatic Stress Act of 2005, introduced by \n     Ranking Member Lane Evans, would direct the VA to expand and \n     enhance mental health care services for veterans.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement would incorporate \n     provisions from H.R. 1588 and follow the Senate language that \n     would include only the provisions to require VA to ensure \n     that each CBOC of the Department has the capacity to provide, \n     or monitor the provision of, mental health services; require \n     VA to submit a report to Congress not later than January 31, \n     2008, on the capacity of the Department to provide mental \n     health services at each CBOC operated by the Department; \n     require VA to establish systemwide guidelines for screening \n     primary care patients for mental health disorders and \n     illnesses, as well as conduct appropriate training for \n     clinicians of the Department to carry out mental health \n     consultations; require VA's National Center on PTSD to \n     collaborate with the Secretary of Defense for the purposes of \n     enabling DOD mental health care providers and clinicians to \n     benefit from the unique and comprehensive expertise that VA \n     has in the area of PTSD diagnosis and treatment; direct the \n     two Departments to develop joint training and protocols to \n     ensure consistency; and authorize to be appropriated \n     $2,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out the collaborative \n     PTSD requirements.\n\n\n                     DISCLOSURE OF MEDICAL RECORDS\n\n     Current law\n       State and private sector health care providers currently \n     provide such information to Organ Procurement Organizations \n     (OPOs) pursuant to a regulation promulgated by the Department \n     of Health and Human Services under section 1320b-\n     8(a)(1)(A)(iii) of title 42, United States Code. Section \n     5701(a) and section 7332 of title 38, United States Code, \n     prevent VA from providing OPOs with VA patient names, home \n     addresses and general medical information, and any treatment \n     information for sickle cell anemia, substance abuse, and \n     treatment for HIV infection.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 9 of S. 1182, as amended, would ensure that DOD not \n     violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability \n     Act (HIPAA) regulation by providing VA with access to certain \n     medical records of servicemembers while the future VA \n     beneficiary is still on active duty. In addition, the section \n     would allow VA to disclose the name and address of any \n     veterans in the VA health care system to a recognized OPO for \n     the limited purpose of determining whether the veteran is a \n     suitable organ donor.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 204 of the Compromise Agreement follows would allow \n     VA to disclose the name and address of any veterans in the VA \n     health care system to a recognized OPO for the limited \n     purpose of determining whether the veteran is a suitable \n     organ donor and explicitly include eye and tissue banks as \n     recognized OPOs.\n\n\n                   EXPANSION OF TELE-HEALTH SERVICES\n\n     Current law\n       No applicable current law.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 11 of S. 1182, as amended, would direct VA to \n     increase the number of Veterans Readjustment Counseling \n     Service (Vet Center) facilities capable of providing health \n     services and counseling through telehealth linkages with \n     other facilities of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); \n     and require VA to submit a plan to the Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the\n\n[[Page S11613]]\n\n     House of Representatives to implement this requirement at the \n     end of each of fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 205 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language with a modification that revises the requirement to \n     implement the plan at the end of fiscal years 2007, 2008, and \n     2009.\n\n\n                   STRATEGIC PLAN FOR LONG-TERM CARE\n\n     Current law\n       Public Law 106-117, the Veterans Millennium Health Care and \n     Benefits Act, among other things, required VA to develop a \n     program of non-institutional long-term care services and \n     mandated that VA maintain the institutional staffing and \n     level of extended care services at, or above, the level of \n     staffing and services during fiscal year 1998.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 13 of S. 1182, as amended, would require VA to \n     publish a strategic plan for long-term care not later than \n     180 days after the date of enactment.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 206 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n              BLIND REHABILITATION OUTPATIENT SPECIALISTS\n\n     Current law\n       No applicable current law.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 14 of S. 1182, as amended, would require VA to \n     establish Blind Rehabilitation Outpatient Specialists (BROS) \n     at not fewer than 35 additional VA facilities not later than \n     30 months after the date of enactment.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 207 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     language.\n\n\n                EXTENSION OF CERTAIN COMPLIANCE REPORTS\n\n     Current law\n       Section 1706(b)(5)(A) of title 38, United States Code, \n     required VA to submit to the Committees a report on its \n     compliance with the so-called specialized services capacity \n     requirement set forth in section 1706 of title 38, United \n     States Code.

In addition, section 202 would make several \n     Congressional findings, including a finding that Russell \n     Wayne Wagner is the only individual convicted of a capital \n     offense who has been interred or inurned in Arlington since \n     1997, the year Congress first expressed its intent to keep \n     the remains of such offenders out of national cemeteries.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 404 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language.\n\n              TITLE V--HOUSING AND SMALL BUSINESS MATTERS\n\n\n                 RESIDENTIAL COOPERATIVE HOUSING UNITS\n\n     Current law\n       Under the provisions of chapter 37 of title 38, United \n     States Code, VA is authorized to guarantee loans for eligible \n     veterans and survivors to buy or build a home; to buy a \n     residential condominium; to repair, alter or improve a home; \n     to refinance an existing home loan; to buy a manufactured \n     home with or without a lot; to buy and improve a manufactured \n     home lot; to install a solar heating or cooling system or \n     other weatherization improvements; or to buy a home and \n     install energy-efficient improvements. Current law does not \n     include the purchase of stock in a cooperative housing \n     corporation (cooperative) amongst the home loans VA may \n     guarantee.\n     House bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Senate bill\n       Section 601 of S. 2694, as amended, would extend VA's \n     authority to guarantee loans to the purchase of stock or \n     membership in a cooperative.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 501 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate language; however, the authority for VA to \n     guarantee share loans in cooperatives would terminate 5 years \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n\n    DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS GOALS FOR PARTICIPATION BY SMALL \n  BUSINESSES OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY VETERANS IN PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS\n\n     Current law\n       Under current law, VA is required to comply with title 15, \n     United States Code, which establishes policies with respect \n     to aid to small businesses. Title 38, United States Code, \n     does not contain any requirements for the Secretary with \n     regard to small businesses owned and controlled by veterans \n     and service-disabled veterans in procurement.\n     House bill\n       Section 101 of H.R. 3082, as amended, would add a new \n     section 8127 to title 38, United States Code, to govern how \n     VA contracts with veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned \n     small businesses desiring to contract with VA.\n       New section 8127 would require the Secretary to establish \n     contracting and subcontracting goals for each fiscal year for \n     contracts with small businesses owned and controlled by \n     veterans and service-disabled veterans. Performance \n     appraisals of senior officials and Assistant Secretaries with \n     procurement authority would be required to include whether \n     the annual contracting goals of their administrations or \n     organizations were met. VA would be required to conduct \n     reviews of contracts and subcontracts to verify that \n     contracts and subcontracts were actually awarded to veterans' \n     businesses as outlined in their contract or subcontract.\n       VA would be allowed to award non-competitive contracts to \n     small businesses owned and controlled by veterans when the \n     amount of the contract is below the simplified acquisition \n     threshold as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. Sec. 403). Further, \n     contracting officers would be allowed, but not required, to \n     award sole source contracts to small businesses owned and \n     controlled by veterans to meet the annual goal set by the \n     Secretary for contracts above the simplified acquisition \n     threshold but below $5,000,000. Contracting officers would \n     retain the option to restrict competition to small businesses \n     owned and controlled by veterans if the contracting officer \n     has an expectation that two or more such businesses owned by \n     veterans will submit offers for the contract including all \n     contracts exceeding $5,000,000.\n       To be awarded a contract under the new section small \n     businesses owned and controlled by veterans would be required \n     to be listed in a database of veteran-owned and service-\n     disabled veteran-owned small businesses maintained by the \n     Secretary. The Secretary would verify that each small \n     business is owned and controlled by a veteran and in the case \n     of a service-disabled veteran, the veteran's service-disabled \n     status. New section 8127 would make the database available to \n     all Federal departments and agencies and determine whether \n     certain types of information would be restricted to the \n     public. New section 8127 would also bar any small business \n     that misrepresented itself to the Department as a small \n     business owned and controlled by a veteran or service-\n     disabled veteran from contracting with the Department for a \n     period of 5 years.\n       A small business owned and controlled by one or more \n     veterans would continue to be recognized as such after the \n     death of a veteran if a surviving spouse of a veteran \n     acquires a majority ownership interest. This small business \n     would be recognized as a veteran-owned or service-disabled \n     veteran-owned small business until the earliest of the \n     following: (a) the date on which the surviving spouse \n     remarries; (b) the date the surviving spouse relinquishes \n     ownership; or (c) 10 years after the date of the veteran's \n     death.\n       New section 8127 would give preference to small businesses \n     owned and controlled by veterans relative to other set-aside \n     groups and within other set-aside groups when another set-\n     aside contracting preference category is being used by VA.\n       The Secretary would be required to provide quarterly \n     reports to the Committees that would include percentage of \n     contracts awarded by the Department and each Administration \n     of the Department to small businesses owned and controlled by \n     veterans and service-disabled veterans.\n       Finally, section 101 of H.R. 3082, as amended, would \n     provide a transition rule that would allow small businesses \n     currently listed on VA's current database of veteran-owned \n     small businesses to retain veteran-owned status. After one \n     year, the business may be removed if found not to be a small \n     business owned and controlled by one or more veterans. The \n     Comptroller General would be required to conduct a study on \n     the efforts of the Secretary to meet the goals established in \n     section 8127 for the first 3 fiscal years after date of \n     enactment and report to Congress on January 31 of each such \n     year. Not later than 90 days after the end of the study, the \n     Comptroller General would be required to submit a report to \n     Congress on the findings of the study.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 502 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language except\n\n[[Page S11616]]\n\n     for the following: (1) senior VA officials performance \n     appraisals would not include contracting goals; (2) a small \n     business owned and controlled by a veteran would continue to \n     be recognized as such only if the veteran was rated as 100 \n     percent service disabled or died due to a service-connected \n     disability; (3) the Secretary would be required to give \n     annual reports to the Committees; (4) and the Comptroller \n     General would be required to brief the Committees on the \n     efforts of the Secretary for the first 3 fiscal years and \n     report 180 days after the end of the time period.\n       The Committees are fully aware that the Department has \n     several statutory small business set-aside procurement goals \n     and that the process of meeting those goals is accomplished \n     throughout a fiscal year. The Committees also understand that \n     meeting the various goals is done in parallel, not \n     sequentially. For example, the Committees recognize that for \n     a given acquisition, there may not be any qualified veteran \n     or service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, however there \n     may be qualified businesses from another set-aside authority \n     that could fulfill the contract.\n       The intent of this provision in the Compromise Agreement is \n     to emphasize the importance of meeting the contracting goals \n     for veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses by \n     giving those competitive parity with other set-aside \n     categories. The Committees also seek to give contracting \n     officers the tools to meet veteran and service-disabled \n     veteran-owned business set-aside goals.\n       The Committees anticipate that acquisition officials will \n     exercise reasonable judgment when attempting to meet the \n     several set-aside goals including giving ``preference'' to \n     veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. The \n     goals for veteran and service-disabled veteran owned \n     businesses are not in any way intended to prevent attainment \n     of other set-aside goals.\n\n\n department of veterans affairs contracting priority for veteran-owned \n                            small businesses\n\n     Current law\n       Title 38, United States Code, does not require the \n     Secretary to give preferences to small businesses owned and \n     controlled by veterans and service-disabled veterans in \n     procurement.\n     House bill\n       Section 102 of H.R. 3082, as amended, would create a new \n     section 8128 that would give priority to small businesses \n     owned and controlled by veterans.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 503 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language.\n\n               TITLE VI--EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING MATTERS\n\n\n  training of new disabled veterans' outreach program specialists and \n   local veterans' employment representatives by national veterans' \n                      training institute required\n\n     Current law\n       Section 4102A of title 38, United States Code, sets the \n     conditions for the funds that states receive to carry out \n     employment services for veterans. Training for Disabled \n     Veterans' Outreach Program Specialists (DVOPS) and Local \n     Veterans' Employment Representatives (LVERs) by the National \n     Veterans' Training Institute (NVTI) is not required under \n     current law as a condition for funds.\n     House bill\n       Section 304 of H.R. 3082, as amended, would, as a condition \n     of a grant or contract from the Veterans Employment and \n     Training Service (VETS), require all new DVOPS or LVERs to \n     complete training provided by NVTI within 3 years of \n     designation as or being assigned the duties of a DVOPS or \n     LVER. If the Secretary of Labor did not provide an exception \n     to a state, the Secretary may reduce the amount of the grant \n     or contract for the state for non-compliance. The states \n     would be required to submit information on employee training \n     at NVTI to VETS. Employees designated or assigned the duties \n     of DVOPS and LVERs with 5 years of service would be exempt \n     from the requirement and those with less than 5 years would \n     be required to complete training within 5 years of the date \n     of enactment of this provision.\n     Senate bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 601 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House language except that the Secretary would be \n     authorized to establish reasonable exceptions to the required \n     completion of the training at NVTI. The Compromise Agreement \n     would require any DVOPS or LVERs, who are designated as such \n     on or after January 1, 2006, to complete the required \n     training within 3 years after the date on which the employee \n     was so designated.\n\n\nrules for part-time employment for disabled veterans' outreach program \n       specialists and local veterans' employment representatives\n\n     Current law\n       Section 4103A of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     that employees hired as DVOPS may be employed as full- or \n     part-time.

The Committees note that the need for some of these \n     projects was determined based on initial CARES results. VA \n     has subsequently begun detailed studies at a number of sites. \n     In some locations, these studies have led to modified plans. \n     In an effort to avoid the unnecessary expenditure of scarce \n     resources VA should defer any action on the design or \n     construction of these projects until related ongoing studies \n     are complete and these studies support the need for the \n     expenditure of funds authorized by this section.

Mr. President, currently, veterans and other claimants \nseeking veterans' benefits may not hire an attorney until the VA \nadministrative proceedings have been completed--a process that often \ntakes several years.\n  That law flows from a Civil War era policy intended to protect \nveterans from unscrupulous attorneys. That policy arose at a time--\nunlike today--when attending law school was not required to become a \nlawyer and there was no effective professional oversight of lawyers.\n  In recent months, it has become abundantly clear that many veterans \nand their survivors want the option of hiring an attorney to help them \nnavigate the increasingly complex VA system. In fact, the prohibition \nagainst veterans hiring attorneys is considered to be unfair and \noutdated by a broad spectrum of individuals and organizations, \nincluding veterans' organizations, veterans' advocates, judges, law \nprofessors, and bar associations.\n  For these reasons, I am very pleased that a compromise version of \nlegislation I authored was accepted that would allow veterans to hire \nattorneys after a veteran files a Notice of Disagreement with VA's \ninitial decision on their claim.\n  A provision of S. 3421 will enable the spouses of seriously wounded \nveterans to obtain educational assistance benefits sooner than they \nhave ever been able to before.\n  The need for the educational assistance provision was brought to my \nattention by U.S. Army SFC Jeff Mittman, a young man who was blinded \nafter an attack in Iraq and is being treated at Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center.\n  Sergeant First Class Mittman's wife would like to begin receiving \neducational assistance benefits from the VA while her husband undergoes \ntreatment in order to improve her job opportunities once he is \nofficially discharged from service, but is now prevented from doing so \nby law. If enacted, S. 3421 would remove that barrier.\n  Finally, S. 3421 would remove the cremated remains of a convicted \ndouble murderer from Arlington National Cemetery.\n  In the summer of 2005, we learned that the remains of a brutal \nmurderer--Russell Wayne Wagner--were placed in the Nation's preeminent \nmilitary cemetery, Arlington National Cemetery.\n  I was appalled to discover that the law enacted in 1997 to deny \ncapital offenders from burial in national cemeteries did not apply to \nWagner.\n  This was also quickly brought to my attention by the Senator from \nMaryland, Barbara Mikulski. We joined together in that effort. The \nanswer was it couldn't happen, it couldn't be removed because of the \nlaw.\n  While we moved swiftly to close the loophole that permitted Wagner's \nburial in the first place, the question remained: Should his remains \ncontinue to be included among the scores of honored dead in Arlington? \nFor me and Senator Mikulski, who joined me in this effort, the answer \nwas ``no.''\n  That is why I am so pleased that S. 3421 would direct the Secretary \nof the Army to remove Wagner's remains from Arlington.\n  As I stated last summer, we must not dishonor the sacrifices made by \nthose memorialized at our Nation's military cemeteries by including \namong them individuals who, through their own heinous acts, have \ngrievously dishonored themselves because at another time in their life \nthey were veterans.\n  S. 3421 is an impressive assortment of legislation. It contains the \ncollective work of more than 44 Senators. I want to take some time to \nsingle out a few of them.\n  Senators Burr and Obama for their work on the homeless assistance \nprovisions of the bill; Senators Hutchison, Feinstein, Graham, \nLandrieu, and Murray for their work on the construction provisions; \nSenators Thune, Salazar, and Burr for their work on the rural health \ncomponents of the bill.\n  And lastly, the committee's ranking member, and a true friend of \nveterans, Senator Akaka.\n  I ask my colleagues for their vote. And I thank every Senator on the \ncommittee and in the Senate for their support in seeing this, and all \nof the other veterans' bills, through the Senate.\n  I also want to thank my House colleagues, in particular Chairman \nBuyer, Ranking Member Evans, and Acting Ranking Member Filner. We were \nable to come together in the spirit of compromise in the final hour on \nsome key provisions, and it is a fitting way to end this Congress.\n  As we head into a new Congress, I want to extend my best wishes to my \nfriend, and soon-to-be chairman, Senator Akaka. It has been a pleasure \nworking with a Senator of his quality, and I pledge that as ranking \nmember I will strive to emulate the kindness, cooperation, and \n``aloha'' that he showed me during my time as chairman of this great \ncommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished chairman \nof the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Senator Craig has done an \noutstanding job of making sure the laws that weren't working, where we \nwere not doing what we should be doing to help our veterans, were \nchanged.\n  He has worked a long time on the bill now coming to its final \npassage--finally. He has been working on it for 2 years, that I am \naware. He has done a terrific job. There is a lot of authorization that \nis essential to go forward next year on appropriations.\n  I appreciate the work of the Senator. He is retiring as chairman of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs and going to ranking member. I know \nhis working relationship with the new chairman is such that we will \ncontinue to see progress in this area.\n\n\n                  military construction appropriations\n\n  I will talk about the continuing resolution being passed by the House \nin a few hours that will be sent to the Senate. We will send that bill \nto the President to meet the midnight deadline so Government can \ncontinue to function.\n  I am talking tonight about this bill with very mixed feelings because \nI am chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military \nConstruction, Veterans' Affairs and Related Agencies, and I wanted to \npass the full bill, the appropriations for military construction, and I \nwanted to make sure we covered our veterans' needs. It is an important \nsubcommittee, of which I have served as chairman these last 2 years. I \nhave worked with my ranking member, Senator Feinstein, to assure we had \nthe funding we needed. Senator Feinstein and I were ready to go on our \nbill. It passed in September. It is a bill that passed unanimously in \nthe Senate. I know everyone agreed we had\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\ncovered the bases that need to be covered to do what is right for our \nmilitary--active duty and the veterans--who have served our country in \nthe past.\n  Unfortunately, our full bill is not going to pass. It is not going to \npass because, first, it was held up in the Senate for appointing \nconferees, held up by a few Senators who thwarted the majority. I was \nvery disappointed we lost those weeks. Our Appropriations Committee \nchairman Thad Cochran tried, as I, to pry the bill out so we could go \nto conference and work with the House.\n  Finally, this week, through the leadership of Senator Frist and \nSenator Stevens from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense, we were able to alleviate all of the concerns \nraised and get the bill to conference.\n  Then, unfortunately, the members of the House committee had \ndetermined we did not have enough time to conference the bill. I think \nwe did have enough time. We had the time to do all of the construction \nthat should be started right now. However, that is not going to happen.\n  I would not have allowed this bill to go forward, and I would be \nspeaking against it right now if we did not have a provision in the \nHouse-passed continuing resolution that will give budget transfer \nauthority to the Department of Veterans Affairs so that there will be \nno medical need, no service need, no payment to any veteran that will \nnot be made before this continuing resolution runs out.\n  If that provision had not been added in the bill, we would not be \npassing this bill tonight because I would be talking all night to keep \nit from passing.\n  I called the Secretary of Veterans Affairs this afternoon, and I \nasked him if he could assure me that there would be enough money in the \naccounts from which they could transfer to assure that all of the \nmedical needs, including surges in medical needs, would be able to be \ngiven. The Secretary assured me that is the case. The Secretary said \nthey had enough surplus money, enough rainy day fund money, and enough \nmoney in the other accounts that they would not hurt the other accounts \nand they would be able to transfer. He did say that by the time we got \nto February 15, if we didn't have a full bill, they would be beginning \nto run into trouble. He gave me his word--and I know his word is good--\nthat if they see some shortfall that would start happening before \nFebruary 15, and if there is no bill, he would call me immediately, and \nwe would begin to work on a supplemental approach.\n  I am certainly going to trust his word. Secretary Nicholson has been \na man of his word throughout these years I have worked with him. He is \na veteran himself, a distinguished veteran. He knows the veterans \nissues. He cares about veterans. He will call, as he did last year when \nhe saw a looming shortfall and he asked for help and we gave him the \nhelp to assure the veterans' needs would be met. We are going to cover \nit, and we are going to do it in a way that will assure that the \nmedical care is given.\n  I have to say, I am disappointed we are going to adjourn without \ncompleting the full bill, without completing the military construction \nso it can start right away, without completing the appropriations and \nthe priorities that we are putting in the next year for veterans. I \nknow they will not suffer in any way because Secretary Nicholson \nassured me of that.\n\n  I will be watching. I will be staying on top of the VA's financial \nsituation throughout this period that the continuing resolution is \ngoing to run, to the middle of February. If a problem arises, I will \nnot stop advocating for the supplemental appropriation that will be \nnecessary to assure we have the funding we need.\n  We will work together in this Congress to assure that the men and \nwomen who are protecting our freedom, as we speak today, get the \nquality of life they deserve. We will continue to work together to \nassure that the veterans who have served our country, who have answered \nthe call of our country, are given everything to which they are \nentitled and which we owe them.\n  I am going to be the ranking member of this subcommittee next year, \nhaving served as chairman for 2 years with a wonderful ranking member, \nSenator Feinstein. It has been pure joy. She has a wonderful staff. We \nhave never had a disagreement that couldn't be worked out. We have made \nsure the priorities, which are the same for both of us, have been met. \nI will be a loyal ranking member, and I hope the new chairman will have \nthe same relationship and the same overall goal for Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs that Senator Feinstein and I have \nhad. I believe he will.\n  I am going to vote for the continuing resolution. However, I could \nnot be more disappointed that we did not pass the full appropriations \nbill for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. I know the \nveterans will be taken care of, and I know the military construction \nwill begin with the new starts a couple of months late. We will get \nthose projects done with that small delay. I am going to make it my \npriority to assure that happens.\n  Senator Stevens has come to the Senate. I want to say, in addition to \nSenator Cochran, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye have been the \nadvocates for our military throughout the time I have been in the \nSenate. I am honored to be a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Defense. I know those two leaders work together, as Senator \nFeinstein and I do, and that is with one goal: to make sure the \nmilitary, who are in harm's way, who are fighting so we may speak \nfreely in this Chamber, who are fighting for our children and \ngrandchildren to have the freedom we enjoy and that has been given to \nus by generations past, will have the opportunities they deserve, and \nthat is the quality of life that we can give them.\n  I thank the Senate for coming to the end with this continuing \nresolution. I will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, be permitted to \ntake the floor following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we ought to understand what we are \ntalking about now because the bills that are before the Senate now and \nthe CR should have been enacted by October 1. This bill will move that \nmoney out to February now and will not be available to the department \nagencies until sometime in February.\n  I am concerned about this because prior to this Congress, the \nquality-of-life money for the members of the Department of Defense was \nunder the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense that I cochair with my \nfriend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  We are disturbed that Congress has not finished its work on the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. To me, \nthe failure to complete this work is inexplicable.\n  I am disappointed we are unable to reach an agreement with the House \non the matters contained in this bill and to realize the necessity of \ncompleting action on the bill in total. We are neglecting our \ncongressional responsibilities by not completing work on this bill. It \nis unfortunate. We have had a considerable amount of time to do so.\n  This is not a routine disagreement between Members of the House and \nthe Senate. This is a disagreement that affects our Nation while we are \nat war. We have hundreds of thousands of service men and women deployed \naround the world. This sends a message we are not willing to take the \ntime to finish the work necessary to assure they have the money, the \nfunding, the facilities to do the work we have asked them to do. It \nwill have an impact on military life and the morale of our armed \nservices.\n  The Military Construction appropriations bill not only contains money \nfor military construction and for quality of life, but it also contains \nthe money for our veterans. In total, it provides critical funding for \nfamily housing, barracks, mission facilities, implementation of the \nbase closure and realignment process, maintenance of defense and \nveterans facilities, environment cleanup, the Defense Health Program, \nand medical care for our veterans.\n  Now I am told that the CR does now come up to the President's request \nfor\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\nthe medical health program, and that really removes part of my \nobjection to proceeding on this bill. Without this bill, the Department \nof Defense and Veterans Affairs have to contend with this continuing \nresolution. Most people do not understand it. It means these moneys \nwill be postponed until mid-February, the additional moneys that are \nnecessary to meet the additional demands being placed on our Armed \nServices before September 30. We are supposed to finish this bill by \nSeptember 30.\n  I am told the Department of Defense will not be able to start a \nsingle military construction project, although those projects were \nauthorized more than 3 months ago. It means the projects cannot be \nstarted until the regular bill is passed. I hope it will be passed in \nFebruary.\n  Now, I took the time to go to Italy and look at the new Army base \nthere and the new Air Force base there, as we are redeploying our \nforces from Germany and other places into Italy. Those projects involve \nbarracks, quality of life facilities, and family housing. That cannot \ngo forward. The money will not be available because it was not covered \nby the 2006 appropriations bill. It is not covered by this continuing \nresolution.\n  I think it is true now, because of what I mentioned, the Veterans' \nAdministration should be able to sustain the medical care for our \nveterans without disruption. But I can tell the Senate, they will not \nbe able to go much more than mid-February without running into real \ntrouble. So one of the first bills that ought to be considered when we \nget back is the Veterans appropriations bill.\n  I am here tonight because I announced to our conference I would \noppose this CR unless it contained these bills in it. After consulting, \nand my staff consulting, with the Department of Defense, the Veterans' \nAdministration, and understanding what the House has done now since \nthat time on the medical portion for the Veterans' Administration, it \ndoes not seem possible for me to do that now. All I can do is express \nmy deep reservation about voting for this bill under the circumstances.\n  We should have had at least the balance of the military money and the \nveterans money made available by this Congress before we went home. And \nI am really disappointed it is not possible.\n  Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Texas, you wish the floor \nagain? The Senator from Ohio would follow me, but you wish to comment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would just like to clarify, with the \nSenator from Alaska on this subject, that the Senate did act. The \nSenate did pass our bill, and we did appoint conferees, and it was a \nlack of willingness on the part of the House to have conferees meet \nwith the Senate. His disappointment is the same as mine.\n  I am going to start working on January 4, when we are sworn in to the \nnew Congress. And I hope we can take the bill that has been passed \nunanimously by the Senate and work through the appropriations process \nand pass this bill before the continuing resolution is ended on \nFebruary 15. We do not have to wait until February 15. And once the \ncommittee is constituted, and we have a chairman and a ranking member, \nI will be the ranking member, and I will work with the chairman. And I \nhope we can pass this bill because it is in very good order and it was \nunanimously supported by the Senate. And I think we are pretty close to \nwhat the House passed. I think, with a strong will, we will be able to \ncome in before February 15 and start those projects about which the \nSenator from Alaska just spoke.\n  So I will look forward to working with him in the new year, both for \nDefense appropriations and for this Military Construction bill and the \nVeterans Affairs bill and the military quality of life that is in the \nbill that we passed in the Senate earlier this year.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for those \ncomments.\n  My point is, the Congress as a whole should have finished its job. We \nshould have done this job before this Congress ends, particularly for \nthose bills which impact the men and women in our Armed Services, their \nfamilies, and the veterans who have served, particularly the new class \nof veterans now who are coming out of the service, many of whom are \nwounded. Many of them have readjustment problems. This bill, the bill \nthe Senator from Texas and her subcommittee prepared, would have \nanswered many of those problems. It would have made money available now \nto deal with them.\n  I am chagrined that bill is not going to pass. I think it is a \nfailure of this Congress. And we ought to admit it is a failure. But as \nfar as this Senator is concerned, we have done everything we can to try \nto rectify that. It is just not possible to get the Congress to vote. \nThe House has already voted. I do not think it is possible for us to \ntry to amend this bill now. And I am told the agencies involved have \nreviewed it and say they will find a way to continue their work until \nFebruary without it.\n  That does not answer the question to me though because the things \nthey should start now would be well underway by February, and it will \nnot be possible with postponing this bill. It is a tragedy we are not \nable to complete our appropriations process, in my opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11623-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11623-S11624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Jerko ``Jerry'' Zovko\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to pay tribute to \nJerko Zovko, a civilian contractor from Cleveland, who was killed on \nMarch 31, 2004, while doing his security work in Iraq.\n  Jerko--or ``Jerry,'' as he was known by his family and friends--could \nbe described as many things. He was a family man who maintained a close \nrelationship with his parents, brother, and others in his Croatian \ncommunity outside Cleveland. He was extremely bright, being fluent in \nfive languages. He was extraordinarily brave, having served as an elite \nArmy Ranger in Bosnia and Kuwait and then as a private security agent \nin Iraq.\n  Perhaps best described by his mother, Danica, ``Jerry was a man with \na principle and ideals. . . . He loved people. He wanted the world to \nbe without borders, for everyone to be free and safe.'' Jerry gave his \nlife for what he believed in, for a people who he thought deserved \ntheir freedom.\n  Born in Cleveland and raised in Euclid, OH, Jerry and his younger \nbrother Tom cultivated their Croatian heritage through their tight-knit \nfamily and community. Jerry attended St. Christine School and then \nEuclid High School, where he played soccer. In his free time, he worked \nwith his father at the family auto body shop. Known as a skinny kid \ngrowing up, no one could have predicted that he would grow into the \nhulking military man as his family lovingly described him.\n  Following high school, Jerry went to Ohio State University with the \nintention of becoming a doctor. However, his aspirations changed after \na life-altering trip to his family's homeland of Croatia when the \ncountry was achieving its independence from the former Yugoslavia. \nJerry predicted correctly that conflict was about to erupt in his \nfamily's homeland, and he wanted to be ready. He returned to the United \nStates and enlisted in the Army when he was 19 years old.\n  Jerry was dedicated to the idea of universal freedom and he lived his \nlife in pursuit of that goal. Jerry spent 8 years in the Army as a \nmember of the elite Army Rangers and served mostly overseas, including \nin Bosnia and Kuwait. His personality shone through in whatever he did. \nArmy buddies remembered with fondness how Jerry built a swimming pool \non the roof of the barracks and how he would zip around the base on a \nmotorcycle with a sidecar.\n  Not wanting to worry his family, Jerry used to tell his parents that \nhe never saw combat because he was ``just a cook.'' Though he knew his \nparents constantly feared for his safety, Jerry continued to risk his \nlife for the good of others.\n  After being discharged as a Sergeant from the Army in 2001, Jerry \njoined Blackwater Security--a private security company--and worked for \nsome time in Dubai. Jerry then decided that the Iraqi people needed his \nhelp. His family pleaded with him not to go, but in their hearts they \nknew that Jerry would do what he believed was right.\n\n[[Page S11624]]\n\nHis brother Tom recalled Jerry's independent streak and that no one \ncould stop him from doing what he set out to do. His mother remembered \na talk they had before Jerry left in which he told her that he was \nneeded in Iraq and that we all need to support our troops and stay \nunited.\n  While working in Iraq, the newly freed people were Jerry's first \npriority. He started to learn and speak Arabic, because as he said, he \nwanted to help the Iraqis and he wanted to do it on their terms. Jerry \nworked in a number of hotspots in Iraq and never shied away from a \ntough job.\n  Jerry eventually lost his life while guarding a food truck in \nFallujah. Like the way he lived his life, Jerry lost his in the service \nof others.\n  I had the privilege of attending the calling hours for Jerry and am \ngrateful for the chance to talk to Jerry's family about their son, \nbrother, and friend. I thank them for sharing their memories with me.\n  We will never forget Jerry Zovko. It became apparent, in talking with \nhis family, that Jerry will forever live on in the hearts and minds of \nhis parents Danica and Jozo and his brother Tom. Jerry touched the \nlives of everyone he met, whether they were family, members of the \nCroatian community, Army buddies, or people living on the other side of \nthe world.\n  May we all remember this great American hero.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep his family in our thoughts and in \nour prayers.\n  Mr. President, since February 2002, I have come to this floor to \nhonor and to remember the brave Ohio men and women who have died \nfighting for our country in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has been my very \nsad duty to give 153 of those speeches.\n  These courageous servicemembers--with the many faces of Ohio, the \nmany faces of America--came from the smallest villages in our State and \ncame from the largest cities. Some came from our farms. Some were born \nin Ohio and in America. But others were born in foreign lands far away. \nSome were 18 or 19 years old. Some were in their forties. Some were \nprivates and lance corporals, while one was a lieutenant colonel. Some \njoined the military as a result of the September 11 attacks, while \nothers planned on a career in the military from their youngest days, \nmarching around as small children in their fathers' uniforms.\n  Some, Mr. President, Members of the Senate, had seen a lot out of \nlife, while for others--most of them, really--their lives had just \nbegun. All of them, though, shared something in common. All of them \nchanged lives in countless ways, leaving enormous impacts on their \nfamilies and their friends and their loved ones. Their absence leaves a \ngaping hole in the lives of those left behind. And while that makes it \nvery hard, we also know that the world is a better place because these \nbrave men and women were a part of it. It is a better place because \nthey lived.\n  We are all so very fortunate to have had them in our lives for the \nall-too-brief time that we did. And for that, we are eternally \ngrateful. We, as citizens, will never be able to repay these Ohioans \nfor their service. We know when we lose a servicemember there is, as \nRonald Reagan said, a tear in the fabric that holds us all, holds us \nall as Americans, and holds us together, and that there is really no \nway to repair it.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt perhaps put it best when he said:\n\n       Their blood and their toil, their endurance and patriotism, \n     have made us and all who come after us forever their debtors.\n\n  We are, indeed, in their debt.\n  As John F. Kennedy once said:\n\n       A Nation reveals itself not only by the men [and women] it \n     produces, but also by the men [and women] it honors [and] \n     remembers.\n  That is exactly what I have tried to do these past few years, \nspeaking about these brave and courageous Ohioans. It is about honoring \nand remembering each of these truly unique, wonderful souls. Our Nation \nis proud of them. They lived their lives well, with great purpose and \ncommitment and love of family and country. And for that, we will never \nforget them.\n  I would say to the families of those who have died in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, training exercises, service to our country, that I will \nremember them and I will think about them until the day I die.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11624-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11624-S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPRECIATION TO SENATE COLLEAGUES AND STAFF\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, early on Thanksgiving day, Mary Frances \nDarling was born. She is our 10th grandchild and the 6th child of our \ndaughter Jill and her husband Bill. As I said on election night this \nyear, I am a very lucky man. I am blessed with a wonderful family.\n  I am also blessed because for the last 30 years--30 years--the people \nof Ohio have given me the opportunity to represent them, first as Green \nCounty prosecuting attorney, then as State senator, then as a \nCongressman for four terms from the seventh congressional district, \nthen Lieutenant Governor, and now, for the past 12 years, in this \nwonderful body as a U.S. Senator. For that opportunity, I will be \neternally grateful.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1995, it had been a little over a year \nsince our daughter Becky had been killed. I was, quite candidly, still \nnumb. We as a family had been through a lot. But I knew that our time \nhere on Earth is short, and I wanted as best I could to spend my time \nin the Senate, whatever time I had, working on tangible things, getting \nconcrete results that impact the lives of families in Ohio and in our \nNation. I have tried to do that, but I have not done it alone. Whatever \nI have achieved has been with the help of so many people.\n  Over the past 12 years, I have worked with every Member of this \nSenate, and I consider each Member of this Senate a friend. I have had \nthe privilege to work with two Republican leaders and one who in \nJanuary will become the Republican leader.\n  Trent and Tricia Lott were two of the first people Fran and I met \nwhen we came to the House in 1983. Tricia is Fran's best friend here in \nWashington, and Trent is my dear friend. I have benefited from his \ncounsel, from his advice, and from his help, now for well over 20 \nyears.\n  Bill Frist and I came to the Senate together in 1995. Karyn and Bill \nare very good friends. Bill has been an unbelievably accessible leader. \nWe share a passion for fighting the spread of AIDS. Bill's public role \nin that cause is obvious and apparent to everyone. But what is not so \nobvious and what is little known is what Bill Frist has done behind the \nscenes, what his role has been in working with so many people, working \nwith the White House and others to get this job done. No one has played \na bigger role. And when the history is written, Bill Frist's name will \nbe there in bold print as someone who has saved so many, many lives.\n  Mitch McConnell. Mitch and Elaine are dear friends. When I faced the \ntough challenge of getting a bill or amendment passed, I went to Mitch. \nI have done it for 12 years. I did it as recently as yesterday. Mitch \nMcConnell is tough. He is strong. He is wise. He will be a great \nleader. His advice as to how to thread the legislative needle is \nresponsible for so much of what I have passed. He also has a big heart, \nas was demonstrated time and time again when I would go to him. He is \nchairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. After I talked to him, \nhe would, at my request, put money into things which saved children's \nlives, child survival or to save little children, little babies in \nHaiti. He did it. He got it done. He made a difference.\n  I have been lucky enough to serve on the Judiciary, Appropriations, \nHELP, and Intelligence Committees, and I want to thank the chairmen who \nhave led those committees over the past 12 years. I was the first Ohio \nSenator to serve on the Appropriations Committee since 1945. With the \nhelp of Chairman Stevens, Chairman Cochran, and their staffs, I was \nable to secure well over $1 billion for projects throughout Ohio that \nmake a difference.\n  I particularly thank Arlen Specter. I thank his clerk and my good \nfriend, Bettilou Taylor. They have both been so helpful to me in \nsecuring millions of dollars for programs through Labor-HHS \nappropriations. These two dedicated public servants helped me provide \nfunding for important programs, things such as the Children's Hospital \nGraduate Medical Education Program and projects in Ohio to build \nfacilities and provide services for people with disabilities. They also \nhelped me fund projects to help meet the health needs\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\nof seniors and low-income communities throughout the State. Because of \nthem, I have been able to secure over $12 million for Ohio's children's \nhospitals.\n  Senator Specter, Bettilou, let me tell you from the bottom of my \nheart and on behalf of Ohio's sick and poor kids and their families, I \nthank you.\n  I also sincerely thank Judiciary Committee Chairmen Specter and \nHatch; HELP Committee Chairmen Enzi, Gregg, and Jeffords; and \nIntelligence Committee Chairmen Roberts and Shelby. I have been \nfortunate to have passed dozens of bills and amendments in my career in \nthe Senate, and most of them were provisions that I worked along with \nthese chairmen to pass. It would never have happened without them. I \nappreciate their help.\n  I appreciate all the help Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley \nhas given me--a dear friend--especially when it came to passing my \nbills to improve the foster care and adoption system. I have worked \nwith many Members of the Senate on this very important issue, foster \ncare and adoption, including Senators Jay Rockefeller, Mary Landrieu, \nLarry Craig, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, John Chafee, Jesse Helms, Bill \nRoth, Jim Jeffords, Dan Coats. They all shared a passion for foster \ncare children. They all shared a passion for the adoption issue.\n  I also thank my good friend from Pennsylvania, my friend who keeps \nthe candy drawer over there, Rick Santorum. Like so many who spoke \nabout him yesterday, I applaud Rick for his passion and his absolute \nfearlessness in standing up for what he believes. I recall being on \nthis floor many nights late at night during the debate over partial-\nbirth abortion. Some nights it was just Rick and me, and we closed this \nplace. He got it done. I thank him for that.\n  I also remember how Senator Santorum stood with Senators Lindsey \nGraham and Sam Brownback to help me pass my unborn victims of violence \nbill and see it signed into law. It took several years to pass this \nlegislation, and Congressman Graham had been the sponsor and was the \nsponsor of the bill in the House. I applaud his determination to get \nthis done. When it comes to foreign policy issues, I share an interest \nin Western Hemisphere issues with my friends Senator Norm Coleman, the \nchairman, and Mel Martinez. Mel, thank you. Senator Coleman has \nadmirably served this body as chairman of the Western Hemisphere \nsubcommittee. I sincerely enjoyed travel with him to Haiti.\n  I also enjoyed traveling to Africa with the good Senator from \nTennessee, Lamar Alexander. Lamar has contributed a great deal to this \nbody. He will contribute more, especially in the area of education \npolicy, where he is clearly the expert.\n\n  Senator Judd Gregg and I also worked on a very important education \nissue. He started it. He worked it. I helped him. We got it done. That \nis the School Choice Program here in Washington, DC. We broke the \nlogjam. We got it done. I applaud his commitment to the children of \nthis, our Nation's Capital.\n  I thank my friends Chuck Hagel and Lindsey Graham for the good \nconversations they have shared with me on foreign policy issues. \nSpeaking of that issue, I thank my neighbor on the floor and my \nneighbor to the west in Indiana, Dick Lugar, for being the rock that he \nis on foreign policy and for giving me good counsel and advice.\n  I want to thank my dear friend John McCain, with whom I came to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1983 and who has been my friend since. I \nthank him for his courage. I thank him for his wise counsel on military \nand foreign relations issues.\n  I also thank a dear friend of mine who does not now serve in this \nbody, former Senator and Secretary of Energy Spence Abraham. He did a \nlot of things. One of the things that took guts and courage is he \nfought with me and others to protect legal immigration while he served \nin the Senate. He took a lot of flack for it.\n  I was honored to work with Senator Gordon Smith, Senators Harry Reid, \nJack Reed, and Chris Dodd, to pass the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act. \nI applaud Senator Smith and his wife Sharon for having the courage to \ntake the tragedy of their son Garrett's suicide and do so many \nwonderful things with it. They are wonderful people.\n  Last year, I was extremely proud to be one of 14 bipartisan Members \nof this great body who decided to work together to break what had \nbecome a gridlock in the Senate over judicial nominations. In the grand \ntradition of the Senate, individuals from both political parties came \ntogether that time to solve a problem which threatened not only the \njudicial nomination process but was threatening to shut the Senate down \ncompletely. I want to thank my friends with whom I was proud to stand \nin that effort: John McCain, John Warner, Lindsey Graham, Olympia \nSnowe, Susan Collins, Lincoln Chafee, Joe Lieberman, Senator Byrd, Ben \nNelson, Mary Landrieu, Daniel Inouye, Mark Pryor, and Ken Salazar. They \ngot it done.\n  I thank my friend, my colleague, my partner, Senator George \nVoinovich. George and I have worked together in the Senate on so many \nthings for Ohio, from NASA Glenn to the Great Lakes. We first got \ntogether in 1989. We joined up as partners in 1989 when I decided to \nleave the U.S. House--it was a tough decision for me--and join him as \nhis Lieutenant Governor candidate. I have not regretted it. It was the \nright decision, and we have worked together ever since then. I thank \nhim and I thank his wonderful wife Jan for their friendship and love.\n  I also want to thank all the members of the Ohio congressional \ndelegation with whom I have sincerely enjoyed working over the years. I \nhave worked with every one of them. They have all made a difference. \nThey are all my friends, Democrats and Republicans. Specifically, I \nextend my appreciation to my Congressman, my dear friend Dave Hobson. \nHe is a savvy man. I have gone to him many times for advice, and I have \ngone to him to get things done for Ohio.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't thank the wonderful staff people in \naddition to my own staff whom I have had the pleasure to work with in \nthe Senate. I thank the outstanding Senate floor staff: Dave Schiappa, \nLaura Dove, and all the other floor staffers who are such wonderful \nprofessionals and who serve us all so well. Thanks to the staff of the \nRepublican leadership: Eric Ueland; Bill Hoagland, whom I talked about \nearlier today and whom I go to for advice a lot; Kyle Simmons, Malloy \nMcDaniel, Laura Pemberton, and on and on.\n  I also thank all the committee staff with whom I had the pleasure to \nwork. They are too plentiful to name, but I cannot leave this body \nwithout thanking my dear friend Mary Dietrich, clerk of the DC \nAppropriations Committee. I saw Mary on the floor last night. I so \nenjoyed working with her. She is a pro. She is great. I also thank Paul \nGrove, clerk of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, who worked with me \nin helping increase funding for the various humanitarian aid programs. \nI know he got tired of seeing me coming, but he was always gracious and \ngot the job done.\n  If there is one thing I have learned in the Senate, it is that you \nmust work together with members of both parties, Democrats and \nRepublicans. I see my friend on the floor, Senator Paul Sarbanes, who \nwill be leaving. I have worked with him over the years. I have worked \nwith many Democratic Senators over the years. I want to take a few \nminutes to thank them for their willingness to set aside party politics \nto make a difference and to get tangible results.\n  First, I thank my very good friend Senator Chris Dodd. Senator Dodd \nand I have worked together on many bills that have become law. We \nworked together--not once, not twice, but three times--to pass three \nbills into law to expand the research and testing of drugs prescribed \nfor children. Senator Hillary Clinton also joined us in this effort, \nand I thank both of them for their dedication and dogged determination \nin helping to ensure our children have access to the medicines they \nneed.\n  Senator Dodd and I also came together to create a national toll-free \npoison control hotline--I will remind my colleagues one more time of \nthat number: 1-800-222-1222.\n  Senator Dodd and I also share a commitment to providing additional \nresources for our Nation's firefighters and first responders. We know \nthat these men and women have the responsibility of looking out for us \nand our\n\n[[Page S11626]]\n\nfamilies, and we, in turn, have a responsibility to provide them with \nthe resources they need to do their jobs. Together, Senator Dodd and I \npassed the Fire Act in 2000, and that law has provided over $3.1 \nbillion for grants to fire departments around the Nation for needed \nequipment, training, and communications technology. I am proud of the \nover $100 million in Fire Act grants that my home State of Ohio has \nreceived.\n  Finally, Senator Dodd and I worked together with a wonderful American \nstatesman--Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan--to pass the Nazi War Crimes \nDisclosure Act, which has led to the declassification of countless U.S. \nGovernment files containing information about Nazi war criminals. The \nAmerican people deserve to have access to this information. For all of \nour work together, Senator Dodd, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Jay Rockefeller for joining me \nin fighting to make our adoption system work better for children around \nthe country. My good friend Senator Rockefeller was the lead cosponsor \nof two of my bills that we got signed into law, and I was the lead \ncosponsor of one of his bills that also became law. These laws have \nhelped minimize the amount of time children spend in foster care and \nincreased the number of adoptions across the country.\n  Those laws are making a difference every day. They are changing \nchildren's lives.\n  As members of the Senate Steel Caucus, Senator Rockefeller and I also \nworked successfully together to impose tariffs against foreign \ncountries that were dumping steel in the United States. The dumping by \nthese countries was hurting our steel industry and, therefore, it was \nhurting families throughout Ohio and West Virginia. Senator Rockefeller \nand I also teamed up to increase automobile and highway safety. He is a \nchampion there, too.\n  Last year, Senator Rockefeller was the lead co-sponsor of several \nbills with me that will save lives on our roads. Together, we passed \nthese bills into law as part of the last Highway bill. We will never \nknow the names or faces of the people whose lives will be saved by \nthese laws, but it is enough for both of us to know those men, women, \nand children are out there. Senator Rockefeller--it has been a pleasure \nto work with you. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Mary Landrieu. Senator \nLandrieu and I share a profound concern for low-income students around \nthe country and for the welfare of young people here in the District of \nColumbia. In 2001, we worked together to amend the No Child Left Behind \nAct to make sure that additional funding went toward low-income schools \nand the students who attend those schools. Since passage of our \namendment, low-income schools in Ohio have received $259 million. I \napplaud Senator Landrieu for her commitment to these children.\n  I also want to thank Senator Landrieu for the excellent work we did \ntogether on the District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee. We \nworked together on this subcommittee from 2001 to 2004, and again, our \nfocus was on improving the health and well-being of children. We \nimproved the city's long-troubled foster care system and helped fund \nvarious improvements to Children's Hospitals in the District. It was \ntruly a pleasure working with the good Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I have had the great fortune to work closely on the \nJudiciary Committee with my friend Senator Pat Leahy. I am proud of the \nmany things that we worked on together. Specifically, we both know that \nour State and local law enforcement officers need to have the best \ntechnology available to protect our families and loved ones. I thank \nSenator Leahy for working with me in 1998 to pass the Crime \nIdentification Technology Act, known as CITA. We worked together to \ndevelop, pass into law, and provide funding for this critical bill, \nwhich has included over $500 million to help law enforcement officials \npurchase cutting edge forensic and communication technology and improve \ntheir crime labs--all in an effort to help local law enforcement fight \ncrime and make our communities safer.\n  I also appreciated working with Senator Leahy to pass my bill in 2003 \nthat eliminated the statute of limitations for child abduction and sex \ncrimes and required child pornographers to register as sex offenders. \nFinally, Senator Leahy and I worked together, along with Congressman \nTed Strickland in the House, to pass my Mentally Ill Offenders bill and \nget it signed into law in 2004. This law goes a long way toward \nproviding mental health services for criminals desperately in need of \nthose services. Thank you, Senator Leahy. And, of course, neither of \nthese laws would have happened without the help of Judiciary Chairmen \nSpecter and Hatch.\n  Mr. President, since 1997, I have been a member of the Judiciary \nAntitrust Subcommittee. During my time in the Senate, sometimes I \nchaired the Committee, and sometimes my friend Senator Herb Kohl \nchaired the committee. But, no matter who had the gavel, we ran it the \nsame way--as a bi-partisan committee, which shined a light on \ncompetition issues and helped consumers and businesses get a fair shake \nin the marketplace. Both of our staffs planned the subcommittee agenda \ntogether, organized hearings together, and held meetings together. That \nis exactly the way it should be, and I am proud that Senator Kohl and I \nwere able to achieve and promote a bipartisan consensus on important \nantitrust issues in many critical parts of our economy.\n  Senator Kohl and I also worked together to write and pass into law \nthe DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act in 2000. We worked on this \nbill after learning that many law enforcement agencies did not have the \nfunding to process DNA material from crime scenes and those DNA samples \nended up just sitting on shelves and not getting analyzed. Our law \nprovides funding to process these samples, identify criminals--such as \nrapists--and get them off the streets. It has truly been an honor and a \nprivilege to work with Herb Kohl.\n  Mr. President, I also have had the distinct pleasure to work together \nwith Senator Mikulski on the Retirement Security and Aging Subcommittee \nand the Aging Subcommittee. I always knew that my good friend from \nMaryland was a tough negotiator, but over the last Congress, I was \nreminded of just how determined and tough she can be when she knows \nshe's in the right. Thank heavens, she and I were on the same side.\n  Senator Mikulski and I worked together this year and in 2000 to \nreauthorize the Older Americans Act, and we also joined forces to fight \nagainst efforts to weaken the pension plans of millions of \nmanufacturing retirees and employees. It was during these negotiations \nthat I was glad to have a partner as tough as Senator Mikulski, and I \nthank her.\n  Since 1999, I have been the co-chairman of the Senate Great Lakes \nTask Force with the senior Senator from Michigan, Carl Levin. Together, \nSenator Levin and I have fought--side-by-side--to pass laws and \nincrease funding to help restore and protect the Great Lakes. We passed \nthe Great Lakes Legacy Act, which has brought over $60 million to clean \nup contaminated rivers flowing into the lakes, including $25 million to \nclean up the Ashtabula River.\n  Senator Levin and I also recently won Senate passage of the Great \nLakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act to increase the authorization \nof grants to protect the Great Lakes, and we worked together to prevent \ninvasive species from entering the Great Lakes by authorizing and \nfunding a barrier in Chicago, where Asian carp might enter the Lakes. I \nthank Senator Levin for his dedication to this unique natural resource.\n  I have spent a great deal of my time here in the Senate fighting for \nthose who are less fortunate and who cannot fend for themselves--not \nonly here in the United States, but also throughout the world. Over the \nyears, I have sponsored and passed several provisions that have \nincreased funding for humanitarian programs.\n  I want to thank my good friend Senator Dick Durbin for working with \nme to increase funding by $100 million for the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS and to increase funding by over $60 million for the prevention of \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. Senator Durbin has also \nworked with me to help provide assistance to the poorest\n\n[[Page S11627]]\n\nnation in our hemisphere--and that is Haiti. Dick, Fran and I traveled \ntogether to Haiti and I thank him for joining me in efforts to provide \na better life for the people of Haiti. He is a good and compassionate \nman, and I thank him for his work and for his friendship.\n  Once again, these things would not have happened but for Mitch \nMcConnell, Pat Leahy, and the people on the subcommittee who provided \nthe money.\n  While I am talking about Senator Durbin, I also want to thank him for \njoining me in passing legislation that guaranteed that the children of \nservice members who die in service to their country don't lose their \nfree health care coverage. Before our law, children of service members \nwho died serving their country would lose their free health care after \n3 years. But, children whose parents were in the military and did not \ndie would receive health care until they turned 21. That just wasn't \nright, and Senator Durbin agreed with me. Together, we changed that \nlaw. I thank him for working with me on that effort, and I thank \nChairman Warner for working with us on this bill, it could not have \nhappened without him.\n  Mr. President, I also had the pleasure of working with Senators \nDurbin, Corzine, Biden, and Brownback, as we have tried help bring a \nstop to the terrible genocide that is occurring in Darfur.\n  Together, we have increased funding for humanitarian relief and \nsecurity efforts in this war-torn region, where so many innocent \nvictims continue to suffer. I was proud to join my friends in this \neffort, and I know they will continue this fight.\n  Mr. President, none of these important increases to these HIV/AIDS \nand humanitarian aid programs could have happened without the help of \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee--Senators McConnell and Senator Leahy. To \nboth of them and to their able staffs, thank you.\n  I want to thank Senator Frank Lautenberg for working with me to set a \nnational .08 blood alcohol content standard for alcohol-impaired \ndrivers.\n  This was a tough fight, and Senator Lautenberg is a good man to have \nwith you in such a fight. I am proud to say that in 2000, we \nsuccessfully got our bill passed and signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Byrd, not only for the \nlegislation that we have worked on together, but more importantly for \nthe outstanding service he has given this body and this country. \nSenator Byrd and I worked together years ago to pass the Continued \nDumping Subsidy Offset Act--a law that helped bring hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to U.S. manufacturing companies that were the \nvictims of illegal dumping by foreign companies. This law brought over \n$315 million to manufacturers in Ohio. Thank you Senator Byrd for the \nwork we've done together and for your outstanding service to this \nSenate and to this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I want to wish the best to all of my fellow Senators \nwho were defeated this fall or who are retiring this year--Senators \nFrist, Santorum, Talent, Burns, Allen, Chafee, Dayton, and Jeffords. \nThey are all good people and all good friends. I wish them well.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to say that I still miss my \ngood friend Senator Paul Wellstone. Senator Wellstone was a determined \nand outstanding public servant. In 1998, Paul and I worked closely \ntogether to write the law that reformed and improved the effectiveness \nof job training programs. It was always a pleasure to work with Paul \nWellstone--such a passionate and committed and dedicated public \nservant.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues all know, none of us could get \nanything done here in this body if it were not for the extremely \ndedicated, hard-working people on our staffs. I am grateful for the men \nand women who work for me now and those who have worked for me all \nthrough my time in the United States Senate. I didn't say thank you \noften enough, but I ant each of you to know how much I sincerely \nappreciate all you have done for me--all you have done to help the \npeople of Ohio and the people of this Nation. I say to them: You have \ndone such great work. You have helped people. You have improved their \nlives and, in some cases, you have saved lives through your efforts. \nYou have made a difference, and you all should be very proud. I know I \nam proud of each and every one of you.\n\n  I have been so fortunate to have had so many qualified, talented \npeople working for me over the years. Time will not permit me to name \neach one, but I thank all of them collectively for their efforts.\n  Thank you to all the schedulers who through the years got me where I \nneeded to go and kept me on track. I would be lost, literally, without \nyou.\n  Thank you to all my personal assistants and executive assistants. You \nall have taken such good care of me, which, admittedly, has been tough \nto do. I have not made it easy.\n  Thank you to my press team--all my past press secretaries and press \nassistants. You have helped spread the word about the good things this \nteam has done for the people of Ohio. I thank you for your diligence \nand dedication.\n  I thank my legislative staff--all my legislative assistants, \nprofessional committee staff, legislative aides, legislative \ncorrespondents, researchers, and writers. You have been the best team \nany Senator could ever ask for. I am proud of you. You have worked so \nhard, so tirelessly, and with such commitment. You got things done. You \nhave made a difference.\n  Thank you to all my current and past staff assistants, receptionists, \nand interns. You have been on the front lines every single day. You \nhave heard a lot. You manned the phones. You greeted all of our \nconstituents. You have helped me in countless ways. You have done your \njob so well with great respect, grace, and patience.\n  Thank you to our mail team. One thing is certain in this business: \nthe letters and e-mails never stop coming. That is a good thing. Thank \nyou for opening all the correspondence, sorting it, taking care of it, \nand making sure responses got out. I bless you for that.\n  Thank you to all my past office managers and system administrators. \nYou have kept my office running. Without each of you, we couldn't open \nour doors each business day. You are great.\n  Thank you to my entire team in Ohio--to all my current and past \nregional directors, district representatives, staff assistants, and \ncaseworkers. You are the best Ohio has to offer. I am proud to have \nworked with each one of you. I couldn't have done my job without you. \nYou all know our State so very well. You have been so caring and kind \nto our constituents. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n  While it would be impossible for me to talk about each of my past \nstaff members individually, I would like to take a moment to say a few \nthings about some of my key advisers over the years. I will dearly miss \nworking with each one of you. Bluntly, I don't know how I am going to \nget along.\n  Thank you to my past and present finance team. They are the ones who \ngot me here: Mary Sabin, Rachel Pearson, Amy Ford Bradley, and last, \nbut certainly not least, Brooke Bodney, who has taken me through the \nlast few years. You all have amazed me over the years. You have pushed \nme, prodded me, you made me do something I don't like to do: make phone \ncalls and ask people for money. Please know how grateful I am to each \none of you. Your jobs were not easy, and you did a phenomenal job.\n  Thank you to my past campaign managers--Curt Steiner in 1992, Laurel \nPressler Dawson in 1994, Josh Rubin in 2000, and Matt Carle from my \n2006 race. Curt has been my friend for over a quarter of a century. He \nis smart and political savvy. Laurel was a great campaign manager in \n1994. I will have more to say about her in a minute. Josh has been a \npermanent fixture in the DeWine family since the early 1990s. I have \nalways appreciated his advice and wise counsel. Matt did a fine job \nthis past election cycle. He knows Ohio very well.\n  I would also like to mention my friend Chuck Greener who has been a \nfriend for over 25 years. I am grateful for his friendship and wise \ncounsel. He always takes my calls. He always calls back. He is there \nfor me. He is there for Fran.\n  Thank you to each of the individuals who have served as staff \ndirectors of my subcommittees. Louis Dupart served as staff director \nfor our Antitrust Subcommittee. Louis always came to me with such great \nlegislative\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\nideas. He is the one who came to me with the idea of the Nazi war crime \nlegislation. I will forever be grateful for that.\n  Pete Levitas also served for several years now as staff director for \nthe Antitrust Subcommittee. Pete is a brilliant lawyer. He has been one \nof my most dedicated staff members, and he is one of the funniest \npeople I have ever met. He can always make me laugh, and we always need \npeople around us, Pete, to make us laugh.\n  Dwayne Sattler served as staff director for our Employment and \nTraining Subcommittee. He worked tirelessly to help reform this \ncountry's job training program. A lot of the bill was his work product. \nI thank him for that.\n  Last, but certainly not least, Karla Carpenter, who has served as the \nstaff director for three of my subcommittees: Aging, Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Services, and Retirement Security. What in the world \nwill I do without her? She has been with me since 1994. She is, as she \nlikes to say, ``the smartest person she knows.'' Mr. President, let me \ntell you, she is certainly one of the smartest persons I know. She got \nour Adoption and Safe Families Act signed into law, as well as the \nOlder Americans Act and pensions bill. Thank you, Karla.\n  I would also like to thank my able Intelligence Committee designee, \nJohn Pack, and my excellent former designees Jack Livingston and Jim \nBarnett. You have been great advisers.\n  I have been most fortunate to have had the chance to work with three \nof the smartest, hardest working legislative directors around. My first \nSenate legislative director and chief counsel was Nick Wise. He was \nalso legislative director for me in the House of Representatives. Nick \nalways had a unique ability to analyze an issue and drill it down to \nthe essence of the matter, and then explain it to me. Unique talent.\n  My next legislative director was Robert Hoffman. He came to my office \nfrom Senator Larry Pressler's office, where he was the Senator's \nlegislative director. Robert did a fantastic job for me. He has an \nunstoppable work ethic. He was so dedicated and had such a solid \nunderstanding of the legislative process. I thank Robert.\n  My current legislative director is Paul Palagyi. What will I do \nwithout Paul, who is my go-to guy on so many things? He has been my LD \nfor nearly 6 years and has built an extraordinary legislative team. \nPaul has put up with a lot. He is also an adviser for my two dogs at \nhome.\n\n  During my time in the Senate, I have had two speechwriters. My first \nSenate speechwriter was Mike Potemra. I can say with honesty Mike is \none of the most intelligent people I know. He is just so knowledgeable. \nIn his own words, Mike is an ``unusual guy.'' That he is, but he is \nalso deeply endearing, and I am fortunate to have had the opportunity \nto work with him. I thank Mike.\n  Now, Mr. President, I come to the point in my speech where it is not \nscripted, and that is because it is about Ann O'Donnell. Ann O'Donnell \nhas been my speechwriter. Ann O'Donnell has been someone who has made \nan unbelievable difference in my life. She is a tireless worker. She is \na compassionate person. Fran and I have traveled with Ann to Haiti. I \nhave seen her compassion for the children of Haiti. She is someone who \nnever stops working.\n  During this past week, because I am leaving the Senate, because I \nwould not be here in January, I have tried to finish giving tribute \nspeeches to all soldiers and troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIt was an unbelievable task. Ann put it together. She got it done. We \ndid 75 speeches this week. It wouldn't have happened without her. A lot \nof things I have done would not have happened without her. I thank her. \nI thank her for being who she is.\n  I have had two communications directors during my time in the Senate. \nFirst was Charlie Boesel. Everyone loves Charlie. His personality is as \nflamboyant as his taste in colorful clothes. Charlie was a pleasure to \nwork with and did a fine job for us. I will tell you, it was great fun \nto have Charlie join us for a few days on the campaign trail. Fran and \nI were so happy to see Charlie back.\n  My current communications director is Mike Dawson. I first met Mike \nwhen I was running for Governor in 1989. Mike, whom I did not know, \ncame to me and kept coming to us and said: Hey, I want to work for you, \nI want to help you on your campaign. We finally said yes, and he was on \nthe campaign. He worked on my Governor's race and then my Lieutenant \nGovernor's race when I joined George in his bid for Governor. Mike \nworked in the Voinovich administration, he worked for Senator \nVoinovich, and he has been my communications director for the last 5 \nyears. I am grateful for his wise counsel. He is my friend. I will \nalways remember what he has done for me.\n  I have had one State director while I have been in the Senate. That \nhas been Barbara Schenck. Barbara worked with me when I was Lieutenant \nGovernor. She is truly one of the finest individuals I have ever known. \nShe is smart; she is articulate; she is spirited; yes, she is feisty; \nand she is passionate. She is also extremely compassionate. She has \nbeen my right hand in Ohio. I talked to her many days six, seven, eight \ntimes. I can't imagine not working with her in the days ahead, but I \nknow she is going to do some amazing things. Barbara, you are the \ngreatest. Thank you.\n  Finally, my chief of staff, Laurel Pressler Dawson. I truly believe--\nI have not checked this--that she has been chief of staff to a Senator \nand a Congressman probably longer than anybody in this body. Laurel has \nbeen my chief of staff since January 1983 when I entered the U.S. House \nof Representatives. We have seen and been through so much together in \nour personal lives, as well as professional. She has been there during \nthe great tragedies in my family. She has always been there. When our \ndaughter Becky died, she was at the hospital. She was the one who came.\n  She was the one person who had the ability to tell me no, and I would \nlisten to her. Everybody needs someone who tells them ``no'' and \nlistens to them. I have been privileged to have her be my most trusted \nadviser for over two decades. She always just got it done. She managed \nmy organization with great skill. I cannot thank her enough for all she \nhas done for me and for my family.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate are well aware, Fran and I have a big \nfamily. We are blessed. We are parents of 8 children, now the \ngrandparents of 10 grandchildren. I would like to take a couple minutes \nto talk about my family before I end.\n  First I thank my oldest child, my son Patrick. I always turned to Pat \nfor his thoughts on policy and politics and have so appreciated his \nhelp in my campaigns and his keen advice and his input. Pat's three \nboys--Michael, Matthew, and Brian--are a delight. They are a delight \nevery day. They were a delight to have on the campaign trail. I thank \neach of them for all their hard work and their efforts.\n  I thank my daughter Jill, her husband Bill, and their children, \nAlbert, Isabelle, David, Caroline, Justin, and newborn Mary Frances. \nJill and Bill and the kids walked in so many parades this summer and \nfall and throughout the years, as all our kids have. I can't count \nthem. They have always been so helpful and supportive. I thank Bill for \nhis expertise on issues regarding persons with disabilities. He has \nhelped me understand the needs of those with disabilities. He has \nhelped me do more to help them.\n  Our son John recently completed his Ph.D. in ecology. Fran and I are \nso proud of him. He and his wife Michele and their sweet little \ndaughter Josie Jean have recently moved to West Virginia, where John is \nnow working on river restoration.\n  Our son Brian is engaged to Kalie Spink. They are planning their \nwedding for this coming April. Fran and I are so looking forward to \nthat and looking forward to having Kalie join our family. Brian works \nin the best job probably in the family. He works for a minor baseball \nteam, the Carolina Mudcats. I envy him every day.\n  I thank my daughter Alice for the sacrifices she made this year to \nhelp with our campaign. She is a law student at Ohio Northern \nUniversity--my alma mater--and took the fall semester off to work on \nthe campaign where she was in charge of coalitions. Thank you, Alice. \nYou did a great job.\n  Our son Mark is a sophomore at the College of Wooster, where he runs \ncross-country and track. Mark is a good person, a person who is very \ncompassionate. For his Eagle Scout project, he traveled to Haiti, a \nplace my colleagues know is very important to Fran and myself. He \nplanted trees\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\nthere. He worked with Father Tom Hagan and helped with the \nreforestation project.\n  Our daughter Anna is a freshman in high school. She is a runner like \nall her brothers and sisters. She is a sweet, quiet, caring young \nwoman. She has put up with a lot this past year with her mom and dad \nbeing gone quite a bit of the time, going back and forth between \nWashington and Ohio. But she has handled it so well. We are very proud \nof her.\n  To each of my children and grandchildren, Mr. President, I simply \nwant to say thank you and I love you.\n  As an only child growing up, I was dating Frances in high school and \nI used to love going over to her house because she had a big family. \nThere was always something going on. I want to thank Fran's brothers \nand sisters and their families for all they have done for us over the \nyears, their friendship and love and help and support. We are so very \nfortunate to have all of them in our lives. I want to thank Fran's \nparents, especially, Bill and Mary Struewing. You are great. No one \ncould have a better mother-in-law and father-in-law. You have put up \nwith me since Fran and I started dating in high school, for a long \ntime, and for that I am very grateful.\n  Of course, I want to thank my parents, Dick and Jean DeWine. I have \ntalked about my dad on the Senate floor many times in regard to the K-\nCompany and what he did during World War II. I could not have asked for \ntwo more wonderful parents. They always believed in me. They gave me my \ninterest in politics. They gave me their values. They gave me their \nwork ethic, and I owe them everything, and I love them very much.\n  Finally, every day I think of our daughter Becky who died in 1993. \nBecky was a compassionate, honest, caring young woman who would have \ndone so much with her life. I think of her every day. The things that \nFran and I do for children, we do in her memory.\n  In conclusion, I love Ohio. I love our country. I see a great future \nfor both my State and for America. I am an optimist. My wife Fran says \nthat anybody with 8 kids by definition is an optimist, and I am an \noptimist. Throughout my career in the Senate and after I leave, I will \ncontinue to care about the health and education and welfare of our \nkids. I will continue to care about stopping the spread of AIDS around \nthe globe. I will continue to help improve the lives of our world's \nmost impoverished men, women, and children. I will continue to care \nabout highway safety and the importance of making our cars and roads \nsafer. I will continue to care about making our communities safe for \nour families, safe from crime, safe from terrorism.\n  As I leave the Senate, however, I leave behind unfinished business, \nas we all do, and I encourage my colleagues to continue the work we \nshared on so many different issues.\n  Just this week I introduced the Pediatric Medical Device bill with \nSenator Dodd, a bill that will help ensure that our children have \naccess to lifesaving medical devices that are designed specifically for \nsmall bodies. I hope someone will take up that cause.\n  I thank my colleague Ted Kennedy for working with me, and I was \nworking with him, on the bill to give the Food and Drug Administration \nthe authority to regulate tobacco. It is long past due. It needs to \nhappen. It has not passed, but it will. I know it will pass. I know it \nwill pass, because it is the right thing to do.\n  Two days ago I introduced a bill to make cars and roads safer for our \nfamilies, especially our children. That bill would simply direct the \nNational Highway Traffic and Safety Administration to research new ways \nto keep pregnant women and their unborn children safer in our cars. I \nhope someone will take that up as well.\n  I will finally conclude my remarks by thanking the most important \nperson in my life, my bride of 39 years, Fran. As most people know, I \nwould be literally lost without her. She takes care of me. She takes \ncare of our family. She is our rock. Fran is my partner in all things. \nShe is my best friend. She is the passion of my life. She is my love. \nShe is everything to me. We met in the first grade. It took me until \nthe seventh grade to talk her into going out on a date with me, and it \ntook me 7 more years to convince her to marry me. I am a persistent \nman. We got married between our sophomore and junior years at Miami. We \ntell people it was a productive 4 years at Miami. We ended up with two \ndegrees and two children by the time we left. I could not have done any \nof this without her by my side.\n  She has been through every one of my campaigns. She has done \neverything. Thirty ice cream socials for 2,500 people who just dropped \nby her house on a Sunday. She has done that for 30 years. She does \nanything and everything. She is smart, she is witty, she is organized, \nand she is very compassionate. She accomplishes more than anyone I \nknow, and she never stops working. I love her more than anything else \nin the world. Someone said to me earlier this year that if I lost my \nreelection bid, it wouldn't be so bad, because even if I lost my Senate \nseat, Fran would still be there by my side. They were right. And for \nthat, I am very fortunate.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues, my friends, come visit us in Ohio. That \nis where we will be. After this month, we will be in our home in the \ncounty where we grew up, the county where we were born, the county \nwhere we live. We will be home in Greene County. Come see us. You are \nalways welcome.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence, and my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the hour is late and we have other \nspeeches to give, but I wanted to comment briefly to my friend from \nOhio. Senator DeWine and I came to the House of Representatives \ntogether in 1982. We have careers that are similar. He served as \nLieutenant Governor for the State of Ohio, I served as Lieutenant \nGovernor of the State of Nevada. He served as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. I served as a Member of the House of Representatives. \nHe and I served as Senators. Our backgrounds are also the same in that \nwe are trial lawyers. I have heard Senator DeWine speak on a number of \noccasions about his days of being a prosecutor.\n  I also want the record to reflect that I approach my brief remarks \nhere tonight keeping in mind our days as trial lawyers, where you could \ngo into a courtroom representing your client, whether it be the State \nor an individual, a corporation or an individual, and you would give \nthat client your very best, as would your opponent. But when that trial \nwas over, you shook hands and went on about your business.\n  I have also had the same experience as Mike DeWine. I have lost a \nstatewide election, and I know that is not pleasant. But I want Mike to \nknow that I admire and respect the work he has done. His wife has been \nso thoughtful and kind to my wife. We all witnessed these speeches that \nhe has given. Many more people have died in Iraq and Afghanistan from \nOhio than Nevada because it is such a heavily populated State, and \nMike's tenacity in directing his attention to each of those families is \nsomething that will always be remembered here in the Senate.\n  Mike, I want you to know that I want us to have the same relationship \nas you leave the Senate as if we were trying a case, and one won the \ncase and one lost. We would walk out and shake hands. That is how I \nfeel about you, someone who has been with me and I with you for 25 \nyears, as Members of Congress and doing other things; we certainly have \na relationship. I am happy to call Mike DeWine my friend.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, from time to time over the last 12 \nyears, new Senators have come up to me as they have come to the body \nand asked the question: How do you do this job? And I usually have \nresponded: Well, what do you want to be? Do you want to run for \nPresident? Do you want to be on the Sunday shows? Do you want to pass \nlegislation? A surprising number of them have said they came here to \npass legislation, important legislation for America that would make a \ndifference. To every single one who said that, I said: Watch Mike \nDeWine. Go study Mike DeWine. The most prodigious, the most effective, \nthe most extraordinary legislator in my time here in the Senate. Quiet, \neffective, a consensus builder. You see by those who are on the floor \nhere tonight that he has friends on both sides of the aisle whom he has \nworked with, cultivated,\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nand built the kind of relationships that make a Senator effective.\n  So I would say to my good friend, the senior Senator from Ohio, he is \na Senator's Senator, the perfect Senator, the master of the art of \nmaking a difference. Farewell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join in the chorus of praise and thanks \nto my friend--and I mean that; the word is thrown around here--Mike \nDeWine. We came to this job together. My very first memory of Mike and \nFran DeWine was when we were both wearing tuxedos and Fran and Loretta \nwere in evening gowns, and we were at our first dinner at the White \nHouse with President Ronald Reagan as Congressmen-elect. The year was \n1982. My wife brought her little handbag, and Fran brought even more to \nthat White House dinner, that formal dinner that evening. She brought a \nbasket and in that basket was her brandnew baby who came with her to \nthe White House dinner. It was the first time I ever met Mike and Fran. \nI still have vivid memories of that moment. I think it was a little \ndaughter in the basket, if I am not mistaken, who might be up here. She \nwas on her best behavior then, as she is now.\n  Another memory I have is when Mike DeWine asked me to join him on a \ntrip to Haiti. I saw a side of my colleague from the Senate which many \nof us have not seen. Fran came along on the trip with bags full of \nsporting equipment and toys and clothes and food, everything they could \njam into this small airplane to bring over to give to some of the \npoorest kids in the world. We went to the Cirque du Soleil, the poorest \nsection of Port-au-Prince. If you haven't seen that poverty, you \nhaven't seen poverty. It is as bad as it gets. We worked our way back \nto a little cinderblock school, the Becky DeWine School, named after \nMike and Fran's late daughter. I watched Mike as he walked through that \nschool and sat down with these little kids, and each one of them poured \nout to him the love and respect and thanks for all that he had done to \nprovide this basic little school for them.\n  That wasn't the end of the day, for sure. We were then off to an \norphanage where we were trying to help a nun, if I am not mistaken, \nwith a building full of squalling babies, trying to get a little help \nso she could take care of them. Then he took me on a famous road trip \nwhere he wanted to show me one of the rural projects. It knocked out \nalmost all the fillings in my teeth, it was such a wonderful road, and \nwe had one of these glorious CODELs that you read about, bouncing \naround in a vehicle to go out and visit people who are at the lowest \nranks of poverty in the world, with babies with red hair from their \nanemia and malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. That is where Mike \nand Fran DeWine spent their time away from the Senate. They left a \nlasting impression and a legacy there. I am happy we are going to try \nto continue that legacy even tonight, I hope, or tomorrow as we bring \nthis session to an adjournment.\n  Time and again, when I was up trying to find a vote, desperately \ntrying to find a vote for global AIDS, for many other causes, I would \nlook across the aisle and hope Mike DeWine was sitting right where he \nis sitting now, because I knew if I could get over there, I had a \nchance. Every time I would sit down with him, Mike would say: This is \ngoing to be tough. He used to always like to say: I am going to have to \npray on this, which meant it was going to have to be a pretty tough \npolitical sell for him and for his colleagues. He never let me down. \nMore importantly, he never let down some of the poorest people on \nEarth. He came through every single time.\n  Mike, you have got the heart of gold that we all dream about. I have \nlost a few elections in my time. It is a sad moment. But as you reflect \non your public career and how much good you have done for so many \npeople, your name and your legacy will live on. I am honored to count \nyou as a friend.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, my heart is full as I think of Mike \nDeWine and his service here in the Senate. I didn't know Mike when I \nfirst came here. I didn't know anything about his visits, I think 13 or \n14, to Haiti, his concern for the poor. He seems to have always been \nmotivated by a moral compass which never wavered from those who needed \nhim, and who weren't getting help from others. It is ironic in the best \nsense that he and I have cooperated on so many pieces of legislation \nthat had to do with children and families and adoption and all kinds of \nthings. It is ironic because in a sense he followed the father, Mr. \nPresident, of our Presiding Officer, in that role. You go to Mike's \noffice, Mike would come to this Senator's office, legislation would \nappear, it would pass--and almost invariably get very little attention. \nThat was not the purpose or the interest of the Senator from Ohio. He \nwanted to do good.\n\n  I think of his interest in children and I think that is a moral \ncompass. If you have that in life and you are not going to let go of \nthat in life, then that fixes you, as the Senator from Illinois \nindicated, in the legacy of the Senate. I also think that his interest \nin Haiti says more about him than words can possibly measure. What \ndrives a man and his wife to go to that country where most of us have \nnever been? Most of us have the image of it that the Senator from \nIllinois described but know not of it directly by experience. \nVacations, free times, are valuable to Senators and their families. Yet \nthe Senator from Ohio took his time and went to Haiti, year after year, \nand fought for their problems and said not a word to anybody. I found \nout about it not from the Senator from Ohio but from somebody \ncompletely different. I found out more about it and then deepened my \nknowledge and my respect for the Senator from Ohio.\n  Finally, I want to say I have the privilege of serving with him on \nthe Intelligence Committee. The Intelligence Committee is serious \nbusiness. The Senator from Ohio rose to the peaks of discretion, \ndetermination, simply trying to find the truth. He wasn't out to get \nanybody, to punish anybody, to embarrass anybody. He wanted to get the \nfacts and then from that make his decisions through his votes.\n  National security on the one hand, children and all of their \nproblems--not just education but children with all of the most complex \nproblems of what happens when you get to be 18 and you have 3 years to \nget to be 21. The father of the Presiding Officer and I worked on that. \nVirtually every problem that can afflict children, unattended by most \npoliticians, was taken to heart by the Senator from Ohio who had the \nadvantage of many years of being a prosecutor.\n  I look upon the Senator from Ohio as absolutely extraordinary, as the \nmajority leader indicated. He is an extraordinary Senator, an \nextraordinarily fine person, a friend in whom I could put complete and \nabsolute trust, who only was here to do his work for the people and \ncauses he cared about--most of all Ohio but then special groups \nprobably unknown except to his conscience.\n  I wish you well, sir.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, could I ask what is the parliamentary \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. The Senator \nfrom Maryland is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11630-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11630-S11635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, over the last few days, a number of my \ncolleagues have been very generous in coming to the floor and speaking \nabout my service in the Senate. I am deeply grateful to all of them, \nand my wife is greatly relieved that the session is drawing to a close \nbecause she fears, if it continues and I continue to hear these \nexcessively praising speeches, I am going to take it to heart and she \nis going to have to contend with the aftermath of all this praise. I do \nthank all of my colleagues for their very generous and their very \ngracious remarks.\n  As my service in the Senate draws to a close, I am above all \nprofoundly grateful for the trust that the people of Maryland placed in \nme for the last 40 years--first as a State legislator, then three terms \nin the House of Representatives, and now five terms in this \ndistinguished body. I think that trust is the greatest honor that any \nAmerican could hope to have. I am deeply appreciative of it.\n  I could not have risen to the challenge that these opportunities for \npublic service have provided without the constant support and the wise \nand reasoned counsel of my family. First of\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\nall, and above all, my wife Christine, whose high standards and \ndedication to our family and to our country are beyond measure and have \nbeen a constant source of inspiration to me. The support and commitment \nof my children, their spouses and their children has been deeply \ngratifying, and I am indebted to them for the encouragement they have \nalways provided and also, if I may say so, for their astute criticism, \non occasion. My sister and my brother and their families have also \nbeen, as one would expect, a constant source of strength, and I am \ndeeply grateful to them.\n  My parents came to this country as immigrants from Greece, both my \nmother and father, and it was from them that I first learned about the \nmeaning of a democratic society and the potential it offers to move up \nthe ladder of opportunity on the basis of ability, hard work, and \nconviction. Their memory is still a very powerful influence in my life.\n  I could not have met the responsibilities of this office without the \nsupport of staff who have been ever ready to work at the highest levels \nof competency, often under great pressure, and to stand up always for \nwhat they believe is right. I am deeply grateful for the principled \ndedication and sharp intelligence they have brought to their \nresponsibilities--whether they were serving on my office staff in \nWashington or in my offices across the State of Maryland; whether on \nthe staff of the Banking Committee, the Foreign Relations, the Budget \nand the Joint Economic Committees on which I have served, or the staff \nof the Senate generally, on whom the efficient functioning of this \nlegislative body depends.\n  I think it is important to pause from time to time to think of the \nmany men and women--they are sitting right here at the tables and \noutside the doors and all across the Capitol and in the office \nbuildings--who make it possible for us to function and who bring a \ndedication to their work that is greatly encouraging. In fact, it has \nbeen a source of encouragement and inspiration to me. Working with all \nof the staff and in particular, of course, my own personal staff, has \nbeen one of the great rewards of serving in public office.\n  I leave the Senate confident that Maryland's representation in this \nbody will be in good hands. For the past 20 years, it has been a \nprivilege to work closely with my colleague from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, who will soon become our State's senior Senator. What a \nfighter she is for a better America. And what a path-breaker she has \nbeen in the course of her political career.\n  It was likewise a privilege to work with her predecessor in this \nbody, Senator Mathias, with whom I developed a close friendship. Both \nhave been wonderful partners.\n  It is especially gratifying to know that, in the 110th Congress, \nBenjamin Cardin will take this seat and be Maryland's junior Senator. \nBen Cardin has given extraordinary public service to the people of \nMaryland. As a Member of the House of Representatives, he has for 20 \nyears represented our Third Congressional District with great \ndistinction, and prior to entering the House of Representatives, he \nserved for 20 years with equal distinction in the Maryland legislature, \nincluding an outstanding tenure as Speaker of the House of Delegates. \nHe is an experienced legislator of the first rank, and he is tireless \nin carrying out effectively the responsibilities of his office. I know \nmy colleagues will enjoy their work with him in the coming Congress.\n  My wife and I are gratified that our eldest son John will, in \nJanuary, be sworn in as a Member of the House of Representatives to \nrepresent the Third Congressional District in the 110th Congress.\n  Throughout my years in public service, I have worked to the limits of \nmy ability to provide the people of Maryland and the Nation dedicated, \ninformed, and independent representation based upon the fundamental \nprinciples of integrity and intelligence. I have been guided in this \neffort by a vision of a decent and just America, based on a strong \nsense of community and offering fairness and opportunity to all its \npeople. These values and that vision were shaped by my family and the \ncommunity where I grew up, by the pride my Greek immigrant parents took \nin their citizenship in their adopted country, and by the high \nstandards of service that community leaders set in a small community on \nMaryland's Eastern Shore, Salisbury, MD, as I was growing up. Those \nvalues and that vision are as clear and as steady today as they were \nwhen I first entered public service.\n  Service in this body has reinforced, many times over, my \nunderstanding and commitment to the institutions upon which our system \nof democratic governance critically depends. I have constantly kept in \nmind the words reportedly spoken by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia \nat the conclusion of the Constitutional Convention. We are marking this \nyear, of course, as my colleagues know, the tercentenary of Franklin's \nbirth. The story is told that, as he came out of the Constitutional \nConvention, the oldest delegate there, a woman in the streets of \nPhiladelphia called out to Franklin and said:\n\n       What is it to be, Dr. Franklin, a monarchy or a Republic?\n\n  And Franklin's reply was:\n\n       A Republic, Madam, if you can keep it.\n\n  A Republic, Madam, if you can keep it--the challenge that Franklin \nuttered that day in the streets of Philadelphia is a challenge each \ngeneration of Americans face. All Americans bear the responsibility to \nrise to Franklin's challenge but none more so than the Members of this \nbody.\n  I have been honored to serve with Members, past and present, who have \nembraced the challenge and sought, through common effort, often under \ndifficult circumstances, to strengthen our Republic and to make the \npromise of America a reality for all of our people.\n  As I prepare to leave the Senate, I want my colleagues to know how \ndeeply I appreciate their friendship and counsel and how highly I value \nthe privilege of having been their colleague. So long as the vision of \nAmerica's promise continues to shine brightly in this body, I have \nevery confidence that our Nation will prevail in the face of great \nchallenges and that its future will be assured.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have experssed my feelings about Paul \nSarbanes. I have spoken before the Democratic caucus about my affection \nfor Paul Sarbanes.\n  I would like to read from the Congressional Directory something that \nthis humble man did not tell us. His Bachelor's degree at Princeton \nUniversity, magna cum laude, and Phi Beta Kappa; Rhodes Scholar, \nBalloil College, Oxford England; first-class B.A. honors in School of \nPhilosophy, Politics and Economics; LL.B., cum laude, Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  These are the things he didn't tell us. He is a man of great \nhumility, a person the leaders whom I have served with in the Senate--\nSenators Byrd, Mitchell and Daschle, Democratic leaders--counted their \nfont of wisdom, without question. I sat for 6 years with Senator \nDaschle, and whenever there was a difficult issue facing him, he had to \ntalk to Sarbanes. I, on a number of occasions, went and obtained \nSarbanes to come and visit with Senator Daschle.\n  I am disappointed that Paul Sarbanes is going to be leaving because \nthat font of knowledge, that font of wisdom will no longer be available \nto me. The leaders used the knowledge and the wisdom conveyed to them \nby Senator Sarbanes for the good of the Republic.\n  Senator Sarbanes has heard me on a number of occasions express my \nappreciation for his friendship and for his dedication to our country, \nbut he has also heard me on every occasion I have had the opportunity \nto talk about his athletic prowess.\n  Paul Sarbanes, even though he kind of saunters around with the \ndignity of a Sarbanes, as a young man he was a good athlete. My \nfavorite story some of our colleagues heard me say, and I know Senator \nSarbanes has heard me say it and he is going to hear it again. He was \nselected as one of the best baseball players in all of Maryland. He \ncomes from the Eastern Shore for the All-Star tournament in Baltimore. \nThe starting lineup is announced: Sarbanes, second base. He goes to \nspeak with the manager and says: I am a shortstop. The manager ignores \nhim. He comes back a little bit later and says to the manager: I was \nselected to\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\nbe an All-Star second baseman. The manager ignores him. He goes back a \nthird time. The manager says: Sarbanes, leave me alone. I'm starting \nKaline at shortstop.\n  Of course, we know Kaline went on to the big leagues when he was 18 \nor 19 years old.\n  I am going to miss this good man and his wife Christine so very much. \nHe is what, in my estimation, a Senator should be.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I said a few words on the floor the other \nday. I meant every one of them. Senator Paul Sarbanes has been kind \nenough to thank me. I wanted to say briefly that from time to time \npeople back in Illinois would ask me: Of all those Senators whom you \nserve with, which ones do you respect the most? Without hesitation, I \nwould always mention the name Paul Sarbanes. I respect him so much, not \nonly for his intelligence and his good humor but also for his wit and \nhis wisdom.\n  The reflective past he has referred to in public service starts in \nthe House of Representatives, his service on the House Judiciary \nCommittee during the tumultuous days of the Watergate hearings, \nimpeachment trial, and coming full circle to the Senate. He has a \nlifetime of public service to be proud of.\n  Christine, his wife, has been at his side. And I know she has shared \nin many of the great victories that their family has been able to point \nto. The greatest victory, I understand, is now the election of her son. \nShe is so proud, as Paul told us, their son John is going to follow in \nhis father's footsteps as a Congressman in this upcoming Congress.\n  I will truly miss Paul Sarbanes as a great Senator and a great \nfriend.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, want to join in the chorus of \ncolleagues by thanking Senator Sarbanes for all he has meant to \nMaryland, all he has meant to the Senate and all he has meant to the \ncountry and all that he has meant to me.\n  I knew Senator Sarbanes 20 years ago, but I knew Paul Sarbanes long \nbefore that. I knew him when he was a young lawyer starting out to run \nfor the House of Delegates. I was also, at that time, a young social \nworker. We were working to stop a highway in the neighborhood. We were \nthe young reformers. Baltimore was dominated by political bosses, by \nthe political machine. And Paul Sarbanes was the first one to buck the \nmachine, to kind of go directly door-to-door to represent the people. \nBaltimore has not seen for years someone who would actually go out and \nknock on doors asking people for their vote, bypass the existing \nestablishment and empower the people.\n  Senator Sarbanes won that House of Delegates seat and did a great \njob.\n  Then he had a hard-fought, again, door-to-door battle--bucking the \nbig boys and big bucks, door-to-door going right through, going \ndirectly to the people who brought him to the House--and\n  In 1976, that wonderful Washington centennial year, we in Baltimore, \nthe home of the Star Spangled Banner, celebrated by sending Paul \nSarbanes to the Senate. And, by the way, that young social worker went \nto the House of Representatives.\n  Senator Sarbanes and I have been side by side for those years. All of \nmy colleagues have talked about the enormous trust and respect they \nhave for him.\n  Much has been said and there is much to be respected about Senator \nSarbanes--his integrity, but trust is really the word. You can trust \nSenator Sarbanes. You can count on Senator Sarbanes. You always knew he \nwould be there when you needed him. The people of Maryland knew that \nwhen they needed him to be able to stand up for those who didn't have a \nvoice, people with dirt under their fingernails, the people who worked \nin those kinds of jobs where at the end of the day you have a bad back, \nyou earned the minimum wage, you didn't have a health benefit, and you \nwondered who really cared about you, Paul Sarbanes would do that.\n  When people invested their life savings and their pension and saw \ncorporate greed eating all of that, they wondered who would speak for \nhonesty and integrity. They knew they could trust Paul Sarbanes.\n  On issue after issue, people knew they could trust him--and they \ncertainly could.\n  You could also count on his wonderful staff. The Mikulski staff has \nsuch great admiration for the Sarbanes staff. It is so outstanding. \nSimilar to the man they work for, they bring great intellectual vigor, \ngreat integrity, and a great ethic of hard work.\n  We often laugh that we are the ``diner Democrat.'' Senators have \nheard about Senator Sarbanes' mom and dad running a diner, my mom and \ndad owned a grocery store. We were kind of the grassroots retail \npeople. So we feel very close to the people.\n  But again, a tribute to him would be incomplete without recognizing \nthe dynamic duo of Christine, who has been an outstanding partner for \nPaul Sarbanes and quite a force in the community in her own right. \nWhether it has been working for the U.N. and for UNICEF in their own \ncommunity, to be on the library board to expand literacy opportunities, \nChristine has been a force in and of herself and for their wonderful \nchildren--John who now joins us in the staff.\n  I could talk at length about Paul Sarbanes, but I will tell you he \nhas been my friend. We have sat next to each other on the Senate floor. \nWe have actually voted in the Senate precincts. When I came to the \nSenate, I was the only Democratic woman to serve here. But I had a \nsaying as I traveled Maryland and traveled throughout the country. When \npeople said: How does it feel to be the only Democratic woman in the \nSenate, I said: You know, I might be all by myself, but I am never \nalone. I have Paul Sarbanes. And that is true for the people of \nMaryland.\n  We wish him well. I know I am going to be seeing him. Wherever there \nis a good bagel or a good political event, I know that Paul Sarbanes \nwill be there.\n  Paul, Godspeed and God bless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very moved by the words of Senator \nMikulski. And as I look over there at the two of them side by side for \nso many years, I feel a void already because they have been so \noutstanding as a team. And I must say they are an inspiration to all of \nus who have watched their friendship, genuinely caring about each other \nand their amazing partnership for the people of Maryland.\n  I certainly can't add anything more to what Senator Mikulski has \nsaid. I will try to say, from my perspective, a little bit about what \nSenator Sarbanes has meant to me.\n  It is a story that not many people know. But when I was in the House \nof Representatives, I was called on to speak about the environment at \nthe Democratic Convention when Geraldine Ferraro was the Vice \nPresidential candidate and Walter Mondale was the nominee. That was a \nlong time ago. I was thrilled. I was an unknown House Member. Now, of \ncourse, I am so excited to be taking over the reins of the Environment \nCommittee, but the environment has been a signature issue.\n  Well, what happened that night, I was slated to talk in prime time. \nBut something funny happened on the way to the forum, which was that \nJesse Jackson spoke at the convention. And he spoke and he spoke and he \nspoke, and then he spoke some more. And then they cheered him on, and \nthen he spoke some more. Well, this was my moment in the Sun. I had \nbought a new suit. I called my mother on the East Coast. I said: Ma, \nbig time. She kept saying: When? And it kept going on and on. Now, when \nJesse Jackson finished his amazing oratory, the entire place emptied \nout. There was no one left in this huge arena. The chair of the \nconvention had to say: Please leave quietly, we have another speaker. \nAnd it was me. No one was left but my family and Paul Sarbanes. He knew \nme just a little at the time. He wanted to encourage me. And he sat \ndown right in front of me with a sign that said something like: Go, \nBarbara, go green--or something like that. He stood there and cheered.\n  Little did I know at the time that he would, many years later, \nwelcome me to the Senate, as of course he did.\n  I know there is other business coming before the Senate. So I am not \ngoing to speak very long at all except to say this: What a privilege it \nhas been, Paul, to work with you. We are on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\ntogether. For a time we were on Banking and Budget. And I watched you \nlike a hawk. You are a humble man, but you could quiz a witness like \nnobody else and with your quiet voice made your point and made a point \nfor the people.\n  I think you are one of the finest minds the Senate has ever had. I \nthink that you have one of the finest hearts. You don't wear it on your \nsleeve, but you do. And I want you to know I have benefited so much \nwatching you and learning from you, and even tonight as you made your \nfarewell talk, you spoke so little about yourself. You spoke about your \nfamily, but the most important thing you spoke about is this great \ncountry that has lifted us all up, the three of us on the floor \ntonight. We know what it is like to be born in a lower middle class \nfamily and struggling our way up. We want to make sure that opportunity \nis there. That is what you spoke about tonight, in all your eloquence.\n  So I will miss you very much. I thank the people of Maryland for \nbeing so wise to send us two such Senators. I know Paul Sarbanes has \nmany wonderful days ahead and much work awaits him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from the great State of \nMaryland, who will be leaving this body at the end of this Congress. \nPaul Sarbanes and I have shared the past 30 years in this body \ntogether, and I can say that the Nation will be losing one of its most \ntalented, well respected, and principled public servants when he steps \naway from the office he has held with such honor and integrity.\n  Paul's career is one that I believe still to this day reflects the \nvalues instilled upon him by his parents, Greek immigrants to this \ncountry, who infused in him a strong work ethic and a sense of service \nto others. He worked his way through school while growing up on \nMaryland's beautiful Eastern Shore and earned a scholarship to \nPrinceton University, where he excelled academically, and earned a \nRhodes Scholarship to Oxford. If that weren't enough, Paul also went to \nHarvard Law School.\n  With all his abilities, with his clear leadership potential and \npromising future, Paul chose to dedicate himself to the service of \nothers. From his years in the Maryland House of Delegates, to his time \nacross the Capitol in the House of Representatives, through his years \nhere in the Senate, Paul has always used his unique abilities and vast \nknowledge, tirelessly working towards finding solutions to the \ncountry's most pressing issues.\n  That is why I was so honored to be able to work closely with him in \ndrafting portions of the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor \nProtection Act of 2002, more commonly known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \nPaul's leadership as Chairman of the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee was needed more than ever as the America people \nlearned of the deception that corporate leaders had perpetrated. In a \nbusiness culture that seemed to reward greed and devalue honesty and \naccountability, Paul was able to create a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that mirrored his values and took a stand for countless \nordinary Americans who were victims of the prevailing culture of \ncorporate excess. It was my distinct pleasure to work with him in such \na noble effort, and I believe it is fitting that such important \nlegislation bears his name and will serve as a testament to his \ncharacter for many years to come.\n  I will miss Paul Sarbanes, although I take comfort knowing that he \nwon't be far away. His career is a lesson to us all in what the Senate \nis all about. It is with a heavy heart that I bid my friend farewell, \nand thank him for setting such a wonderful example for us all to \nfollow.\n  I know he will stay a clear voice for America--but now he and \nChristine can also have the time together they so deserve.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nreflect on the remarkable career of my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Paul Sarbanes, and to thank him for his service to our country.\n  The life of Paul Sarbanes is the archetypical story of America. He is \nthe son of Greek immigrants who moved to the Eastern Shore of Maryland \nand started their own restaurant, where Paul helped out after school. \nHis parents encouraged him to get an education, a message that he took \nto heart. He received a scholarship to Princeton, was a Rhodes Scholar, \nand then graduated from Harvard Law School.\n  After graduation, he quickly gained a taste for economic policy by \nworking at the Council of Economist Advisers during the Kennedy \nadministration under Walter Heller, when the famous Kennedy tax cuts \nwere passed. I am not sure that people around here fully grasped--and \nhe is certainly not one to toot his own horn the depth of his \nexperience in the area of economics, but it is substantial.\n  He entered the Senate the same year I did, 1976, after stints in the \nHouse of Representatives and the Maryland House of Delegates. He \nquickly sought to use his economic acumen and joined the Banking \nCommittee and the Joint Economic Committee, both of which he would \nlater chair. He played an integral role in the Banking Reform Act of \n1999 that made it easier for banks to diversify their investments and \nincreased competition in the industry, giving consumers wider choice in \nthis arena and better returns to their savings. While we all \nacknowledge and bewail the low savings rate in this country and grasp \nfor ways to fix it, the reforms passed by Paul were an important step \nin the right direction that we can and should build on.\n  He has also fought a yeoman's battle to improve the quality of \neconomic data produced by our Government. It is a topic that sounds \ndeadly dull, but it is vitally important, and Paul Sarbanes has made it \nhis duty to get this accomplished. Thanks to his efforts we have much \nmore accurate, reliable, and timely data on economic growth, wages, and \nemployment. We may not always agree on how our Government should go \nabout trying to increase these economic indicators, but because of \nPaul's efforts we know much better what we are arguing about and how \nsuccessful our efforts have been.\n  To me, that is one of the marks of a great Senator: being willing to \ntake on a low-profile issue that gains him nothing with the press or \nhis constituents, but nevertheless improves our well-being. The \neconomists that use this data and the statisticians that work for \nproducing the data know exactly how much Paul's leadership has \nbenefited the country, and this is something that I want the rest of \nthe country to know as well.\n  Of course, despite his numerous accomplishments in the Senate, he \nwill be best known for his authorship of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n2002. I do not need to remind my colleagues that in 2002 our financial \nmarkets were in sore shape and in dire need of ameliorative steps of \nsome sort. People were beginning to lose faith that they could trust \nputting their money in the domestic stock market, a state of affairs \nthat potentially threatened the very fiber of our economy. In the \nCongress there were lots of ideas on how to fix this but very little \nconsensus.\n  Paul waded into this morass and helped shape an all-encompassing bill \nin short order that addressed many of the problems endemic in our \nfinancial markets. Thanks to his skillful maneuvering and that of his \nHouse partner on this bill, Mike Oxley, this legislation quickly passed \nthe House and Senate and became law, stanching the wound in our \nfinancial markets. Like every major piece of legislation passed by the \nCongress, the Sarbanes-Oxley bill was not perfect. However, today the \nDow Jones Industrial Average is near an all-time high and over 50 \npercent higher than in the summer of 2002, in no small measure thanks \nto Senator Sarbanes' efforts.\n  This is, and remains, a mark of a Senator of distinction: One who \nrises to the occasion when a crisis ensues and creates an environment \nwhere Members can work together, across party lines, and with scarce \nregard to short-term political exigencies, to come up with a solution.\n  To my esteemed colleague, Senator Paul Sarbanes, I give you my best \nwishes in retirement, our thanks for a sterling career in service to \nyour country, and my gratitude for your friendship over these many \nyears.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in bidding \ngood\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\nwishes and Godspeed to Senator Paul Sarbanes, the senior Senator from \nMaryland and the longest serving Senator in Maryland history, as he \nretires this week.\n  Senator Sarbanes was elected to the Senate 2 years before me, and \nthank goodness he was here. Paul Sarbanes has been a dear friend, an \nindispensable source of wisdom, a trusted ally, and an inspiration. \nSenator Sarbanes and I even briefly shared an office, when the anthrax \nattacks of 2001 forced him to leave his office in the Hart Building and \nset up shop temporarily in my conference room. After years of close \ncooperation, we were literally working side by side.\n  What I have found over these years is that Paul Sarbanes is one of \nthe smartest, kindest, and most thoughtful public servants in \nGovernment. He is quiet and does not seek the limelight, but behind his \ncalm demeanor is a skilled legislator with a keen mind. Senator \nSarbanes operates by compromise and by building consensus, but he also \nhas plenty of backbone when it is needed. He knows when to coax, when \nto charm, and when to say ``enough is enough'' and get things done.\n  In the wake of the accounting scandals at Enron and other \ncorporations, it was Senator Sarbanes' leadership that led to the most \nsignificant reforms of accounting practices in a generation. The \nlandmark Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which grew out of his longstanding \ncommitment to corporate responsibility and high ethical standards in \nbusiness, curbed some of the corporate abuses that had shaken investor \nconfidence in American business.\n  That law has produced its critics, but most of the detractors are \nunhappy because Sarbanes-Oxley is so effective. Sarbanes-Oxley forces \naccountants to actually review the books. It forces CEOs to understand, \nreview, and sign off on the company's financial statements. And it \nforces companies to produce meaningful financial statements with \ninternal controls that back up the numbers. There are some critics who \nare waiting for Senator Sarbanes to leave the Senate, hoping to weaken \nwhat he built, but they will find many Senators, including this one, \nwho will fight to maintain high standards. Sarbanes-Oxley will continue \nto serve as the foundation for reasonable regulation of our capital \nmarkets.\n  While his name will always be associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley law, \nSenator Sarbanes remains an unsung hero for another accomplishment: \ncracking down on money laundering through the PATRIOT Act. I want to \nsing his praises on this for a moment because it is an issue I am \npassionate about and because Senator Sarbanes deserves greater \nrecognition for his work.\n  For several years prior to the 9/11 attacks, I worked on \nstrengthening anti-money laundering laws--holding hearings, producing \nreports, and writing legislation but my effort had not succeeded. After \n9/11, it was clear that U.S. anti-money laundering laws were full of \ngaps and vulnerabilities that needed to be addressed. But it was also \nclear that many in the financial industry did not want to have to \noperate under tougher laws. Nothing would have been accomplished even \nthen if Paul Sarbanes had not stepped up and led.\n  In the month after 9/11, Senator Sarbanes showed his legislative \ngenius by taking a diverse group of provisions suggested by many \ndifferent Senators and House Members, taming the competing interests, \nand writing a package quickly enough to be included in the PATRIOT Act. \nHis own contributions included a key provision to make anti-money \nlaundering programs mandatory rather than optional and to require anti-\nmoney laundering programs at a wide spectrum of financial institutions, \nsuch as securities firms and insurance companies, not just banks. He \nalso required for the first time that securities firms report \nsuspicious activity.\n  In addition to these major changes, Paul helped enact a variety of \nprovisions that I had been pushing for years. For example, he included \nmy provision that barred banks and securities firms from opening \naccounts for shell banks, closing a major gateway for money laundering. \nHe also helped shut down the flow of dirty money from foreign dictators \nwho were looting their own countries and depositing their ill-gotten \ngains at U.S. banks by including my provision to make proceeds of \nforeign corrupt practices covered by our money laundering laws.\n  And he did all of this work in 1 month, running the conference \ncommittee out of his hideaway office in the Capitol with 1 computer, 3 \nphones, and a shifting group of about 50 staffers from the White House, \nSenate, House, Justice Department, Treasury, and other agencies. He was \nthe only Senator who was present throughout the entire conference, and \nit was his work at key moments that kept the anti-money laundering \nprovisions in the PATRIOT Act. Senator Sarbanes' leadership is one of \nthe great untold stories of that bill, and I hope that his role will \none day be properly recognized.\n  Paul Sarbanes has given Maryland and America a lifetime of public \nservice, on President Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors, in the \nMaryland House of Delegates, in the U.S. House of Representatives, and \nin the U.S. Senate. I know that Paul is proud that his son John will \nnow carry on that tradition of service, having been elected last month \nto represent Maryland's 3rd district in the House. We will welcome John \nSarbanes to Congress, but we will greatly miss his dad.\n  My wife Barbara joins me in congratulating Senator Sarbanes on his \nretirement and in wishing him and his wife Christine all the best. We \ntreasure their friendship and hope they will visit our Senate family \noften.\n  Senator Sarbanes, with apologies to your Greek forbears for my \npronunciation: chronyapola. May you have many years.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I acknowledge and honor my \ncolleague, Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. As Maryland's longest \nserving U.S. Senator, Senator Sarbanes, leaves our great Halls with a \nlegacy of distinction and an undying dedication to his State and this \ncountry. I have tremendous respect for Paul Sarbanes, and the \nstatesmanlike ethics he has brought to this institution. Though his \nthree decades of service contain many significant achievements, none \nstand out more for me--on a personal level--than when Senator Sarbanes \nassisted in my confirmation process to become the Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. I greatly appreciate the \nopportunity I had to serve this country in that capacity, and Senator \nSarbanes played no small role in allowing me to do so.\n  Thank you, Senator Sarbanes, for your meaningful work and lifelong \ncommitment to public service.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to honor in the highest possible \nterms and with profound respect, Senator Paul Sarbanes, one of the true \ngiants of this institution, a sterling public servant and an \ninspiration to the people he has represented for 36 years--30 of them \nin the U.S. Senate, where he has since become Maryland's longest \nserving U.S. Senator. I am grateful to call him a dear friend and \ntreasured colleague.\n  A graduate of Princeton University and one of only two Rhodes \nScholars in the current U.S. Senate, Senator Sarbanes has brought a \nremarkable and stellar mind to his venerable legacy of public service. \nElected to the U.S. House in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1976, he \nhas served the people of Maryland with exemplary integrity and \ndistinction.\n  The principles of fairness and opportunity have directed his tenure \nof tireless civic contribution, characterized by a relentless \ndedication to serving the public interest--a devotion to defending and \npromoting the common good exemplified by his efforts to enact the law \nthat today bears his name--The Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n  I also share a bond with Paul Sarbanes that transcends our service \ntogether in the U.S. Senate, including our substantial work together on \nthe Senate Budget Committee as well as on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. We are both the children of Greek immigrants--both of our \nparents owned restaurants and inculcated in us a passion and commitment \nto education, service, and hard work.\n  Paul Sarbanes has been a hero to Hellenic-Americans for decades. On \ncountless occasions I have been referred to as ``one of two Greek-\nAmericans in the U.S. Senate'' and I am so proud that the Senator from \nMaryland,\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\nPaul Sarbanes, has been the other. Whether serving in the Maryland \nHouse of Delegates, the U.S. House of Representatives, or the U.S. \nSenate, Paul has always been driven by the same Hellenic principles \nthat make our heritage and community great. He remains an inspiration \nto innumerable Hellenic-Americans.\n  As a result of heroic and Herculean service, Paul Sarbanes was \nhonored in June 2003 with the prestigious Paul H. Douglas Ethics in \nGovernment Award from the University of Illinois--established in 1992 \nto honor Senator Douglas, a man often labeled ``the conscience of the \nUnited States Senate.'' The award was fittingly designed to honor \nindividuals who have made a substantial contribution to promoting \nethics. And Senator Sarbanes also received the Cox, Coleman, Richardson \nAward for Distinguished Public Service, from Harvard Law School in \nMarch 2004.\n  Senator Sarbanes' vigorous and exemplary engagement in matters of \npublic affairs undeniably epitomizes the following admonition from \nPericles in his funeral oration more than 2,000 years ago that ``we do \nnot say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds \nhis own business; we say that he has no business here at all.'' Being \ninvolved in the civic life of one's community, country, and heritage \nwas not an option for the sons and daughters of Pericles, and it has \nbeen an expectation that the legacy of Senator Sarbanes inspires all of \nus to meet.\n  As much as the Senate will miss his esteemed presence and I will miss \nhis collegiality in this Chamber, I am heartened by our enduring \nfriendship and by a new generation from the Sarbanes family entering \npublic life in the upcoming Congress with John Sarbanes, serving in the \nU.S. House.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to say something about my \ndeparting colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  To my colleague from Rhode Island, I thank the Senator. In all \nactions it has been a tone of civility. We have always sought common \nground. I express my gratitude for the Senator's service to Rhode \nIsland.\n\n\n                              Mike DeWine\n\n  And the departing Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, said some very \nkind things about his work with me. I, too, want to comment that \nworking with the Senator when moving important legislation in the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions was an outstanding \nopportunity, again, of bipartisanship. Mike DeWine and Barbara Mikulski \npassed the Older Americans Act twice when it previously had not passed \nor been reauthorized in 5 years. We did work so constructively with the \nCommittee on Finance in terms of the recent pension bill.\n  Again, we worked on many projects related to national security \ntogether.\n  I thank Senator DeWine not only for his kind words but, again, his \nongoing efforts, always with the tone of utmost collegiality when he \nworked with me, and his staff.\n\n\n                              Conrad Burns\n\n  And to the departing Senator from Montana, who has a voice about the \nsame decibel level of my own, I wish him well. Again, on the Committee \non Commerce and on the Committee on Appropriations we worked very well, \nparticularly on those issues that were important to science and \ntechnology, new ideas, new thinking, but old-fashioned values.\n  A lot is said about changing the tone, but when we hit the right tone \nwe also hit some pretty high notes. I thank my colleagues and wish them \nwell and Godspeed until we meet again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11635-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11635-S11640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, pretty soon we will be taking up the tax \nbill that includes trade provisions and health provisions. I will start \ndebate on that so we can use our time very efficiently.\n  We are at the end of a very long road on what should be routine \nbusiness: The two tax-writing committees have many provisions that have \neither expired or will expire shortly. The provisions cover three major \nareas of our jurisdiction: tax, trade, and health.\n  The foundation of this bill is a tax-writing committee's agreement \nthat goes back to last summer on the core package of expiring \nprovisions and other items that were dropped from a reconciliation tax \nbill we passed early last spring.\n  These provisions that were dropped were put together in what is \ncalled a trailer bill. That is an odd name for a bill. The bill has \nbeen held up for so long that some people have probably forgotten the \nreason for the nickname. I will remind everyone it is a trailer bill \nbecause it covers tax provisions that were dropped out of the tax \nreconciliation conference agreement of last spring. That conference \nagreement includes the cornerstones of both House and Senate bills \nwhich now have been signed by the President more than half a year ago.\n  The cornerstone of the House bill was a 2-year extension of the lower \nrates on capital gains and dividends. The cornerstone of the Senate \nbill last spring was an extension of the hold harmless on alternative \nminimum tax. I was pleased we covered the cornerstone of both bills. We \nonly had revenue room to cover those two provisions.\n  The other provisions, principally what we call tax extenders, and \nwhat now will soon be before the Senate, were decided to travel in a \nbill that would follow, or trail. Hence, the name trailer bill.\n  The two cornerstones, alternative minimum tax and capital gains and \ndividends, were very important achievements by this Senate last summer \nand when they were originally passed in 2003. The 2-year extension of \ncapital gains and dividends was a key priority for my conference though \nwe were pleased to garner some Democratic votes, as well. It was a \npriority for Senators Frist, Kyl, Lott, Gregg, and others. I was \npleased we were able to deliver on that priority in that conference \nlast spring.\n  The alternative minimum tax was the other cornerstone. The \nalternative minimum tax, everyone recognizes, is a widespread tax \nproblem because at least 15 million families will be affected. It was \nnecessary to help those families so they were not paying a tax that was \nnever intended to be foisted upon them in the first place and would not \nhave been if the original alternative minimum tax passed in 1969 had \nbeen indexed. We assured all of these 15 million families that their \nlives would not be unnecessarily complicated by the tax system.\n  The trailer bill took several weeks of intense negotiations. The \nnegotiators were Chairman Thomas of the House and Senator Baucus and me \nin the Senate. They were tough negotiations, but they produced a fair \nagreement. That agreement, with some additions by the leadership, was \nincluded in the trailer piece of the trifecta bill that came up in July \nwhere we tried to pass a reform of the estate tax with, sort of cute \nprocesses that were put together but did not deliver the number of \nvotes to break a filibuster. That, of course, occurred 4 months ago. A \nbill that should have passed 4 months ago we are still dealing with. \nThat is the way the Senate sometimes works. That is the way the \nCongress sometimes works.\n\n  Chairman Thomas represented the House, Senator Baucus represented \nDemocrats, and I represented Senate Republicans. It was a bicameral, \nbipartisan agreement. In our view, that agreement was closed. No items \nshould be subtracted. No items should have been added. A deal made last \nsummer is still a deal now. Changes would only occur if all the parties \nto the agreement consented.\n  When we returned, we all knew we didn't have another 5 or 6 weeks to \nrenegotiate the trailer bill so we kept mostly to that original \nagreement. In getting to that agreement, I pushed hard for several \nSenate issues to be resolved. I am referring to items other than the \nbasic 2-year extension of the provisions that expired on December 31, \n2005. I will go through a few of those items.\n  First, there is a package of added incentives to enhance Hurricane \nKatrina rebuilding efforts. Senator Lott took the lead on that package \nalong with support from Senators Vitter and Landrieu. We modified these \nprovisions with the work of these Senators.\n  Second, there were tax relief incentives for mine safety. Senators \nByrd, Santorum, and Rockefeller argued for these important provisions.\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\n  Third is an expansion of the veterans mortgage bond program. This is \na program the States use to provide veterans who return from combat \nwith low-interest loans so they can buy their families a home. Senators \nDeWine and Smith advanced these provisions.\n  Fourth, there is a proposal to provide a deduction for private \nmortgage insurance for low-income home purchasers. Senators Lincoln and \nSmith deserve credit for those provisions.\n  Fifth, there was a proposal to level the playing field between \nindividual and corporate timber capital gains transactions. This \nprovision would have ensured that timber-growing areas and related mill \ntowns will not be disadvantaged if the timber company is a corporation. \nMost, if not all of the Senators from the timber-growing States of the \nPacific Northwest, and the Southeast of the United States, had an \ninterest in this provision. This proposal was dropped from the package, \nbut I want my colleagues to know I argued for it.\n  These are a few of the proposals that were negotiated and resolved in \nthe trailer package. In my role as chairman of the Committee on \nFinance, I protected these Senate provisions.\n  In the second round of negotiations, our Senate leadership backed me \nas we proceeded through the trailer issues. I appreciate Senator \nFrist's patience and support in our efforts to reach agreement.\n  Why have I pushed so hard for this trailer package? There are two \nbasic reasons. The first is for the 19 million tax filers who may face \ncompliance problems because of uncertain tax law. The second reason is \nthe hundreds of thousands of business taxpayers who have been in limbo \nwaiting for final approval of measures such as the research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  So let's look at some of those in detail. First, take a look at the \nCommittee on Finance Web site. On September 13 and 26 of this year \nthere are press releases that explain Committee on Finance tax staff \nresearch. At my request, the tax staff looked into the effects of \ndelaying action on the three widely applicable expiring middle-income \ntax relief provisions: deduction of college tuition, teacher out-of-\npocket classroom expenses, and State sales tax deduction. We are \ntalking about a group of up to 19 million tax filers being affected. \nTax filers mean families filing jointly and individually as singles. In \nother words, we are talking about a lot more than 19 million taxpayers.\n  The professional staff, all experienced tax practitioners who \ndiscussed this problem with the IRS, came to the conclusion that \ndelaying action on extenders into the lameduck would have adverse \nconsequences for that group of 19 million taxpayers. I won't go into \nthe details. They are found on the Web site.\n  So everyone knows, I have a few charts to show the impact of these \nprovisions on these 19 million people. First, we have the college \ntuition deduction on the chart behind me. Between 4 and 6 million \nfamilies, students, took advantage of this deduction in 2004.\n  The next chart shows teachers benefiting from the educator expense \ndeduction, where teachers pay out of their own pocket for materials for \nthe classroom. For the last several years we have allowed a deduction. \nI suppose those supplies ought to be paid for by the school district \nbut sometimes the school districts don't do it, the teachers need it, \nthey want to help their kids, they pay for it out of pocket. We have \nallowed a tax deduction. That should not be allowed to expire. \nNationwide, there are 3.3 million teachers who benefit from this \ndeduction.\n  Finally, in the next chart I have the sales tax deduction chart. In \n2004, almost 11 million families and individuals were helped by this \ndeduction. If we do not get this bill passed, they lose that deduction.\n  Serving as chairman of this committee is a privilege and a \nresponsibility. I might say to my friend, Senator Baucus, who will be \nincoming chairman because the Democrats won a majority in the last \nelection, I look forward to returning to the chair in a couple of \nyears.\n  I thank the people of Iowa and my friends and colleagues in the \nSenate Republican conference for that privilege. I have enjoyed every \nday I have served as chairman. It brings responsibilities as well. One \nof those responsibilities is tax policy.\n  Now, whether an individual Senator agrees or disagrees with a \nparticular expiring tax relief matter is always debatable. We all have \nopinions on a multitude of things, and particularly on tax policy. \nProbably no two Finance Committee members, let alone two U.S. Senators \nnot on the committee, agree on all expiring tax relief measures. What \nwe ought to agree on is that we should not deliberately--and I \nunderline that word, ``deliberately''--take actions to unnecessarily \ncomplicate taxpayers' efforts to comply with our admittedly complex tax \nsystem. That is what delaying action on these provisions means.\n  There are no ifs, ands, or buts--we need to act quickly. We are \nalready about a year overdue. But if we get it done yet before we \nadjourn, we will take care of most of the problems taxpayers would \notherwise have. The 2006 IRS forms were finalized, but the IRS \nhopefully can act to mitigate problems for these more than 19 million \ntaxpayers with supplemental forms.\n  As chairman, I would not be doing my job if I stayed silent. I spoke \nout. It is my responsibility to these 19 million taxpayers. Some could \ncall it complaining. Some might call it annoying. Others could call it \npersistence. It is just simply doing my job. When you are talking about \nup to 19 million middle-income taxpayers who are trying their best to \ncomply with the tax system, I will complain until I run out of breath.\n  So that is the first reason I have been pushing for resolution of \nthese matters, going back to the strong statements I made on the floor \nof this Senate at the time the trifecta bill was defeated last July and \ngoing back further since the reconciliation bill was passed in early \nspring.\n  The second reason I pressed for quick resolution was the expiring \nbusiness-related tax incentives. These matter. Just think about what \nyou have heard from your constituents about the need for the research \nand development tax credit to continue and not lapse. These are all \noverwhelmingly popular in the House and Senate, but they are also good \nfor our economy. Businesses are in limbo on these provisions. We are \ntalking about almost a year of being in limbo and at least another \nmonth yet to come by the time we work this through and the President \ngets this signed.\n  A lot of businesses in good faith relied on my assurances. They \nrelied on assurances made by the congressional leadership in May of \n2006. These business folks were assured these extenders would be done. \nIn my own State of Iowa, for example, a major business, Rockwell-\nCollins of Cedar Rapids, IA, took a financial hit because we dilly-\ndallied around with the reauthorization of the R tax credit.\n  It is not just that management cares. Iowa is a manufacturing State, \nand we are proud of our research and development. Thousands of Iowa \nemployees in these companies have a right to ask why this popular \nprovision that does so much economic good has been delayed now at least \n6 months--some people could argue 8 months--beyond the time it should \nhave been signed by the President.\n  Aside from the new proposals I have talked about, the core tax \nextender package prevents tax increases on more than 19 million \ntaxpayers and thousands of businesses. There is a revenue loss of $44 \nbillion. Some have called this a budget buster. But a close examination \nof the facts will tell you that you ought to reach a different \nconclusion. I would remind the Senate that revenues have shown record \nlevels of increase over the last 2 years. These increases were not \naccounted for in budget resolutions because, quite frankly, the money \ncame in faster than anybody could have anticipated when the resolutions \nwere adopted. And that is good because the economy is good, or else you \nwould not be getting all this tax revenue coming in.\n  The tax relief here and in the reconciliation relief bill of last May \nare very small in comparison to the unexpected taxes that have come \ninto the Treasury. So how can anyone call a bill that prevents tax \nincreases a budget buster when the taxpayers are sending record levels \nof taxes into the Federal Treasury? So why would anybody penalize \ntaxpayers with tax increases\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\nwhen revenues are not the source of the deficit? I don't get it. \nBecause if this bill does not pass, it is going to be an automatic \nincrease on the taxpayers and the businesses of this country because of \nthe sunsetting of those tax laws.\n  That is why these bills are before us, to get them reauthorized, not \nto decrease taxes but to keep the same level of taxation, the same \npolicy. It just expired. Renew it. Our budget problems are not because \nof legislation that soon will be before this body. They are derived \nfrom out-of-control spending. That is where the budget busting is \noccurring.\n  Present tax policy is bringing in more money than anybody anticipated \nit would bring in. Although the Democratic leadership has blamed \nRepublicans for the deficit, we all know that spending problem is not a \nDemocrat or Republican problem, it is a bipartisan problem. It is a \ndisease in the Congress of the United States.\n  I agree with the Budget Committee chairman that when Democrats gain \ncontrol of Congress in a few weeks, we are going to see bigger spending \nproblems. I am sure they would deny that tonight, but we have had \nevidence of it over the last decade.\n  My evidence is, take a look at the last 10 years. Try looking for a \nDemocratic spending cut for deficit reduction. Guess what. You are not \ngoing to find one. You will find lots of proposed tax increases. You \nwill find lots of opposition to tax cuts. You will not find spending \ncuts in their deficit-reduction proposals. I hope I am wrong. Maybe we \nwill see folks on the other side offering spending cuts when they have \nthe budget resolution up next March and when they have appropriations \nbills up in the summer of 2007. I might be wrong. I hope I am. But we \nwill see.\n  So if you hear critics, Democrat or Republican, calling this bill a \nbudget buster, keep the fiscal history in mind. Look at the numbers \nover the last 2 years. And take a look back for about a decade. The \nnumbers do not lie.\n  The bill is not a budget buster. It prevents tax increases. \nPreventing tax increases is not a budget problem. Millions of hard-\nworking, tax-paying families do not need tax increases, neither does \nthe American business community.\n  When I am holding my town meetings in Iowa, I have people coming in \ncomplaining about overspending. I do not have people coming into my \ntown meetings saying: Tax me more; I am undertaxed.\n  So I would then go on now, after talking about tax provisions here, \nto talk about the trade provisions. And we will start with the \nGeneralized System of Preferences. This program offers developing \ncountries duty-free access to U.S. markets. I have traditionally been a \nsupporter of GSP. In recent years, however, I have come to question the \nmerits of the Generalized System of Preferences. Too often, GSP \nbenefits have gone to those who simply have not deserved them; in other \nwords, meaning countries that have not deserved them.\n  Perhaps due in part to the GSP Program, some industries in some \ndeveloping countries have reached world-class status. These successful \nindustries clearly are not the struggling businesses in poor countries \nfor which the Generalized System of Preferences benefits were \noriginally intended.\n  In addition, I am concerned that the GSP has threatened U.S. \ninterests in trade negotiations. Given that beneficiary countries \nalready have duty-free access to the U.S. market for many of their \nproducts through the GSP Program, they have little incentive, then, to \nnegotiate lower tariffs on U.S. exports. If they can get their product \ninto our country under this program duty-free, they would consider \nthemselves suckers to give our businesses and farmers the same \nadvantage in their country.\n  But that is what negotiations are all about. Like the Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement, the Peru Free Trade Agreement--both things before \nCongress that we ought to be passing. Those products from those \ncountries are coming in here duty-free. We can have the advantage now \nof sending our products back to those countries duty-free for the first \ntime ever. And do you know what. There are people in Congress here, \nright now, questioning whether we ought to approve the Peru Free Trade \nAgreement. It is stupid to not level the playing field for the American \nworker, the American farmer, and our service industry. But GSP has \nencouraged these countries to come along. Now they have developed. We \nneed the same rights, the same consideration from them that we have \nbeen giving them over the last 20 years through the GSP Program.\n  I am convinced that the lack of progress in the Doha Round of the WTO \nnegotiations can be attributed, at least in part, to this GSP Program.\n  GSP is set to expire in 23 more days. Due to my concern over GSP, I \nconsidered dropping my support for this program altogether, not even \nrenewing it, for the unfair reasons I have told you. But in \nnegotiations this week over a trade package in this bill, I agreed to \ncompromise with Senator Baucus and my counterparts on the Ways and \nMeans Committee for a short-term extension of this program for 2 years. \nDiscussions I have had with Senator Baucus figured in my decision to \nsupport this short-term extension. Senator Baucus has agreed to work \nwith me during the next Congress to reexamine the GSP Program. I \nanticipate that a reexamination of the GSP will result in needed \nreforms to this program.\n  Today's legislation does take a very first step in making changes to \nGSP. It does so by allowing the President to limit the availability of \nGSP benefits for ``supercompetitive'' products. The word \n``supercompetitive'' is a technical term. Imports of products from \nnumerous countries, including Brazil, India, and Venezuela, will be \nimpacted by this provision of the bill, which will become operative in \nJuly of next year. This new supercompetitive standard reflects the \nresults of a review of the Generalized System of Preferences Program, \nthe GSP Program, conducted by the U.S. Trade Representative.\n  Today's bill, in addition to extending the GSP under the proviso that \nwe are going to review it next year, also extends the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, also expiring in 23 days. The Andean Trade Preference \nAct offers four Andean countries--Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and \nBolivia--duty-free access to the U.S. market for a variety of products. \nIt was my strong inclination to extend benefits under this program to \njust two of the Andean countries, Peru and Colombia, for the reason \nthey have been cooperating with us on this free-trade agreement. We \nhave not adopted it yet. If we had adopted it, they would not need this \nprogram, and we would not be talking about it. But I would not be \ninclined to extend the benefits to Ecuador and Bolivia. Peru and \nColombia have worked actively to strengthen their economic ties with \nour country by concluding free-trade agreements. It is only fitting for \nus to extend benefits to them until the point that these free-trade \nagreements are implemented.\n  But Bolivia and Ecuador is another circumstance. Those countries, in \ncontrast, have gone out of their way to demonstrate they do not value \nincreased economic ties with the United States--unless, of course, \nthose ties involve one-way trade benefits through the Andean Trade \nPreference Act where they can get their products into our country very \neasily and it is very difficult and very expensive for us to get our \nproducts into their countries.\n  In order, however, to see that the Andean Trade Preference Act is \nextended to Peru and Colombia, where I said it ought to be for a short \nperiod of time, I had the opportunity to compromise with Senator Baucus \nand our House counterparts on an extension. This bill provides a \nstraight 6-month extension of the program. Another 6-month extension \nwill be provided if steps are taken to implement trade agreements with \nany of those countries, meaning if Ecuador or Bolivia want to get \nonboard and get into the act of cooperating in a bilateral way, they \nwill get greater consideration in the future. But with their new \nPresidents nationalizing their industries, not having respect for \npersonal property, not having respect for the growth that comes from \nthe market economy, you wonder whether they are smart enough to think \nin terms of a free-trade agreement. But we hope they are.\n\n  We have another trade preference program that is very popular; it \nalmost passes unanimously most times in the Congress--the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. That is modified by this\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\nlegislation as well. This African Growth and Opportunity Act offers \nsub-Saharan countries duty-free access to the U.S. market. This program \nis instrumental in promoting economic growth in one of the poorest \nregions of the world. The third country fabric provision of the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act is going to expire October 2007. It allows \nbeneficiary countries to keep preferential benefits on certain apparels \nmade with fabric from countries other than the United States or Africa. \nThis bill extends that third country fabric provision that will expire \nOctober 2007 until 2012.\n  Also, in order to remove disincentives to investment in fabric \nproduction in Africa, we included what we call an ``abundant supply'' \nexception to eligibility under the third country fabric provision with \nrespect to fabrics and yarns that are available in commercial \nquantities from African suppliers.\n  The bill also provides tax benefits to Haiti, the poorest country in \nthe Western Hemisphere, through the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity \nThrough Partnership Encouragement Act, also known by its acronym HOPE. \nThis legislation provides new rules for origin for duty-free imports \nfrom Haiti. Haiti may only receive benefits under the bill if it meets \ncertain political, economic, and labor criteria, as well as textile and \napparel transshipment enforcement requirements. At this time, it is \nvery important to recognize one of our colleagues who worked very hard \non this, and that is Senator DeWine. He has contributed to advancing \nthe economic development of Haiti during his tenure in the Senate.\n  The bill also extends unconditional normal trade relations to \nVietnam--something that should have been passed in November before the \nPresident went to Vietnam. This provision will enable us to enjoy the \nbenefits of Vietnam's imminent accession into the World Trade \nOrganization. That translates into significant benefit for our farmers, \nincluding those in my State of Iowa, by reducing duties on U.S. exports \nof beef, pork, soybeans, and other products.\n  Our manufacturers and service providers also stand to benefit \nsignificantly from the Vietnam normal trade relation bill. And by \nengaging Vietnam through enhanced trade, we can best press the \nVietnamese Government for continued progress with respect to where we \ndon't think there is enough progress yet--religious freedom and human \nrights.\n  In addition, this legislation modifies U.S. law with regard to \nchanges in the U.S. harmonized tariff schedule. The U.S. Trade \nRepresentative periodically makes changes to tariff lines in the U.S. \nharmonized tariff schedule. This year, due to the thousands of changes \nto be made and to administrative delays, the business community \nrequested that Congress extend the usual 15-day window for \nimplementation, so we have extended the deadline to 30 days. This will \nallow time for the private sector to incorporate all of the changes in \ntheir computer system and avoid costly, time-consuming errors to entry.\n  Finally, the bill includes numerous duty suspensions and reductions \nthat have resulted from the Finance Committee's efforts to prepare a \nmiscellaneous tariff bill. These provisions are noncontroversial in \nnature. They reduce tariffs on imported goods not produced in the \nUnited States. As a result, they will provide cheaper inputs for \nbusinesses operating in the United States and, thereby, increase the \ncompetitiveness of our firms and workers.\n  I will talk about health care now, the third major area of \njurisdiction of our committee, and the third major area in this piece \nof legislation. Despite what some might characterize as a ``do-nothing \nCongress,'' the 109th Congress actually accomplished a great deal \nrelative to health care. We enacted the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, \nwhich greatly strengthened and improved the Medicaid Program. Most \nwould acknowledge that this bill made the most significant changes to \nthe Medicaid Program in three decades. Those changes should make it \npossible for the States to serve more low-income beneficiaries, \nfamilies who cannot afford to provide health insurance and pay for it.\n  Significant challenges await us in the new Congress. We will need to \ntake a serious look at the solvency of the Medicare Program. We have to \ndevelop a solution for the Medicare physician reimbursement system. The \nState Children's Health Insurance Program needs to be reauthorized. And \nthere remain serious problems of the uninsured. I look forward to \nworking with my partner and incoming chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, on those issues and doing that in a bipartisan way.\n  However, before we can adjourn this Congress and before we go home to \nenjoy the holidays, there is still urgent work needed to be done, and \nthat is the purpose of this piece of legislation. In the legislation we \nconsider today, there are several provisions that rise to the level of \n``must do.'' These include ensuring that physicians do not receive a \ndrastic cut in the Medicare reimbursement that a formula in place for \nthe last 15 years dictates they take and we generally don't let happen. \nThere are a number of other expiring provisions that must be extended. \nI am very disappointed that this package doesn't include anything to \naddress the coming shortfalls of the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. The Senate package that I introduced with Senator Baucus \nincluded a proposal to address the shortfalls, but that proposal was \nrejected in the negotiations that Senator Baucus and I had with the \nHouse. We apologize for not winning on that.\n  Our legislation will, however, increase payments for providers while \nproviding additional payments for physicians and other health \npractitioners who report quality measures in order to ensure both \ncontinued beneficiary access and improved quality of care. We must \nensure that health care providers can afford to continue to practice \nmedicine. We must preserve Medicare beneficiaries' access to \nphysicians, and we must provide incentives for quality improvement.\n  The physician payment formula is deeply flawed. We need to reform the \nSGR formula's flawed payment system and develop a new way of paying \nphysicians appropriately for their services. Last year, we included a \nprovision in the Deficit Reduction Act to require the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, known as MedPAC, to submit a report to Congress \nearly next year on alternative mechanisms that could be used to replace \nthe existing formula. It is a flawed formula. We must find a long-term \nsolution that will stabilize physician payments in the future. Working \nto develop a better physician payment system will be one of my top \npriorities, and I am sure that under Senator Baucus's leadership, it \nwill be a top priority as well.\n\n  The legislation before us today will eliminate the 5-percent cut in \nphysician fees scheduled to take effect in January 2007 and, instead, \nkeep physician fees at the same level as this year. In effect, this \nwould provide a 5-percent increase in payment fees over what the \nformula would otherwise allow. Next year, we must face the challenge of \nproducing a long-term solution to the physician payment formula. The \none-year-at-a-time approach we have used over the last several years \nmakes the problem worse and does nothing to address the longer term \nchallenges.\n  We need to put better incentives into the health care system so \nproviders are motivated to provide better quality care. So this bill \nbefore us establishes a quality reporting bonus for physicians and \nother eligible professionals--meaning nurse practitioners, physician \nassistants, podiatrists, and other health care professionals who submit \ndata on quality measures from July through December in 2007.\n  Our legislation also creates a fund, effective in 2008, to help \nstabilize physician payments and promote physician quality initiatives. \nThis new fund of $1.35 billion will be available in 2008 to help \nminimize fluctuations in physician payments and promote physician \nquality initiatives.\n  The physician payment changes will be offset by two adjustments to \nthe Medicare Advantage stabilization fund. Our legislation does not \nrepeal the fund but, rather, preserves the funds for future years. We \nadjust the funds in two ways.\n  First, the fund will be reduced by $10 billion to $3.5 billion. \nSecond, the Secretary will be able to use the proceeds in the funds \nonly in the years 2012 and 2013. There is strong participation in the \nprogram right now, and if more funds are needed to be added back to\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\nthe Medicare Advantage stabilization funds, Congress can add these \nfunds in future years.\n  I have been working very closely with my colleague Senator Baucus on \nrealigning incentives in Medicare to reward for quality of care, rather \nthan paying physicians as we do now, on volumes of service, without any \ncare about quality. We have been doing that under these formulas for a \nlong time. We began the process of moving toward quality care \nreimbursement in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. This Medicare \nModernization Act required hospitals to report 10 quality inpatient \nmeasures in order to receive full payment update. Now almost 99 percent \nof hospitals are reporting this data. Without this incentive, they \nwould not have done so. Our legislation includes provisions to extend \nquality reporting for hospitals to hospital outpatient departments and \nambulatory surgical centers as well, beginning no sooner than 2009.\n  Now that hospitals are reporting this data, it is time for other \nproviders, such as physicians, to do that as well. The quality \nreporting measures in our bill today are a small step toward creating \nbetter incentives for quality care in Medicare. The transitional bonus \npayment policy included in this bill for reporting quality measures is \na good first step for physicians and practitioners.\n  The physician quality measures in this legislation before us today \nhave been developed primarily by physician organizations, including the \nAmerican Medical Association and physician specialty societies. All of \nthe measures adopted for 2007 have the support of the physician \ncommunity and will be easily reported electronically with the \nsubmission of their claims. Those professionals who participate in the \nquality reporting program and voluntarily submit up to three quality \nmeasures that apply to their specialty will receive an additional 1.5 \npercent bonus incentive payment for services provided during the 6-\nmonth reporting period. I emphasize that that 1.5 percent bonus is on \ntop of our filling it in so that there is not the 5-percent cut that \nthe formula now applies for.\n  Ultimately, we should move toward rewarding quality through higher \nMedicare reimbursement for better health care outcomes. Once that \nprinciple begins to govern medical care, we will be able to better \nalign payment incentives throughout our health care system to reward \nfor quality of care. We are interested in quality because when doctors \nand hospitals and other health care professionals do it right the first \ntime, it is the least expensive way to have it done. If it is done \nwrong the first time, it is very expensive to send people back to the \ndoctor and the hospital a second time. We want to do in the Government, \nthrough the Medicare Program, what a lot of major corporations are \ndoing--being concerned about quality. With that quality, we can get \nbetter health care, but you are going to save a lot of money, whether \nit is for Ford Motor Company or for the taxpayers of the United States, \nunder a Federal Medicare Program.\n  In addition to reforming the manner in which Medicare pays for \nphysician services, this legislation will extend several expiring \nprovisions enacted in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 to help \nensure that beneficiaries will continue to have access to needed \nmedical care. This includes provisions applicable to rural payments to \nphysicians, continued direct payments to independent laboratories for \nphysician pathology services, and continuing Medicare reasonable cost \npayments for lab tests in small rural hospitals.\n  Our legislation also provides a 1-year extension of the therapy cap \nexceptions process that we included in the Deficit Reduction Act last \nyear to ensure that beneficiaries receive physical, occupational, and \nspeech language therapy services that they need.\n  We also give a 1.6 percent update for dialysis services effective \nApril 1, 2007, thus helping to ensure continued access for \nbeneficiaries who suffer from what is called end stage renal disease.\n  Our legislation also includes some new provisions to improve \nbeneficiary access and provide additional protections. We have included \nadditional reimbursement for important preventive medicine by \nreimbursing health professionals for administering vaccines covered \nunder the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. We also \ninclude a requirement for reporting anemia indicators in cancer \npatients receiving anti-anemia drugs to better manage these patients' \ncare.\n  We have established a new postpayment review process to ensure the \ntimely payment for drugs and biologicals that are delivered for patient \nuse under the Competitive Acquisition Program.\n  This legislation includes several provisions to improve \naccountability in Medicare. There has long been a concern that the \nprogram is vulnerable to fraud and abuse, and certainly experience has \nborne that out, with billions of dollars being wasted. Even more \nsignificant, the program has not been able to effectively detect when \nit makes payment errors. This legislation contains several provisions \nto address these concerns of ferreting out abuse and fraud.\n  The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program addresses fraud and \nabuse in the Medicare Program but has been funded at the same levels \nsince 2003 despite significant increases in its responsibilities.\n  In order to ensure that the Federal Government has sufficient \nresources to effectively combat health care fraud and abuse, this \nessential program will receive annual funding updates for the next 4 \nyears. And that investment has a good return. In other words, for a $1 \ninvestment, many dollars come back to the Federal Treasury from either \nrecouping fraud or preventing fraud.\n  This legislation also includes a provision that addresses payment \nerrors by adopting the Recovery Audit Contractor Demonstration as part \nof the Medicare Program and implements that program nationwide. Despite \nbeing implemented for a limited time in a limited number of States, \nthis demonstration has already shown enormous potential for the \nidentification of overpayments and underpayments and the recoupment of \noverpayments.\n  In fiscal year 2006, this demonstration has identified around $300 \nmillion in improper payments in just three States. By taking the \nrecovery audit program nationwide, up to $10 billion in Medicare \noverpayments will be recovered in the next 5 years.\n  By passing this legislation, we will also take a big step toward \nmaking sure that the Medicare Program does not pay for substandard care \nprovided to beneficiaries. The National Quality Forum has identified a \nnumber of serious and preventable adverse health care events called \n``never events.'' The HHS inspector general will be required to conduct \na study on Medicare payments for services related to never events and \nwill provide guidance for CMS in setting policy regarding payments for \nservices when never events are involved.\n  Let me explain never events. We are not going to pay when somebody is \noperated on and covered by Medicare if they cut off the wrong leg--and \nthis has happened--or the wrong arm or other things that were never \nintended to be done to a patient. We are sick and tired of paying for \nthings such as that.\n  This legislation will also promote more accurate hospital payments. \nOne aspect of Medicare hospital payments that has been subjected to \nmuch criticism is the area wage index. Many say that the current method \nof calculating the wage index does not reflect the hospital's actual \nlabor costs and is instead arbitrary in nature so that similarly \nsituated hospitals can receive significantly different wage index \nvalues.\n  Since the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement \nModernization Act of 2003, hospitals have been able to obtain relief \nfrom this unfair situation temporarily. But we shouldn't have to do \nthis every year in a temporary way. So this legislation will provide \nlimited extension of this relief. More significantly, major steps will \nbe taken toward comprehensively reforming the wage index classification \nsystem by requiring a report on alternatives to the current methodology \nfor calculating the Medicare wage index, as well as proposals for \nreforming this classification system so we don't have to mess with \nthese inequities.\n  This legislation also includes several provisions relating to the \nMedicaid Program. These include codifying the provider tax rate paid by \nMedicaid providers at 5.5 percent and extending the transitional \nmedical assistance and abstinence education programs. Throughout the \nyear, we have heard from nursing homes, hospitals, and managed care\n\n[[Page S11640]]\n\nplans that lowering the maximum provider tax rate would make it harder \nfor them to treat Medicaid recipients as States had to make up for lost \nrevenue. This provision protects health care access for some of the \nmost vulnerable in society.\n  While this legislation does not go as far as some would like, it \naccomplishes the goal of helping ensure the continuation of critical \nhealth care policies and programs.\n  I was disturbed when I heard one of my colleagues refer to this bill \nas an example of bad legislative practice. The critics imply that \npolitical defeat was somehow connected with this kind of legislative \npractice. With all due respect, these criticisms could not be more off \nthe mark. This legislation was based on popular expiring provisions \nwithin the jurisdiction of the tax writing committees, provisions that \nwere meant to expire so they are reviewed occasionally so we know the \nbest possible tax policy is being pursued by the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  The legislative business in this bill then is the people's business. \nThroughout the year, I pressed repeatedly to finish these matters. I \nwas thwarted by others who sought to leverage these items for other \npurposes. I firmly believe that if we had dealt with these issues in a \ntimely fashion, as was planned last May to do it in the pensions bill, \nwe would have been rewarded politically.\n  We are where we are, but we are here because of politics on both \nsides of the aisle getting in the way of processing these items in a \ntimely fashion.\n  I agree with the critics that this kind of omnibus bill is not the \nbest way to finish this legislative business.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of \nH.R. 4709 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4709) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to strengthen protections for law enforcement officers and \n     the public by providing criminal penalties for the fraudulent \n     acquisition or unauthorized disclosure of phone records.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n              telephone records and privacy protection act\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU: Mr. President, I support passage of H.R. 4709, the \nTelephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006. This bill gets to \nthe center of the practice known as ``pretexting''--a fraudulent \ntechnique to obtain access to confidential communications records--by \nimposing Federal criminal penalties on perpetrators.\n  There is one point that I would like clarification and assurance. \nThis bill adopts a very broad definition of an ``IP-enabled voice \nservice.'' That definition is broader than just replacements for \ntraditional telephone service, and sweeps in many potential new \napplications. In my view this definition would be inappropriate in many \nother contexts. For instance, the Commerce Committee crafted a narrower \ndefinition when considering S. 1063, the IP Enabled Voice \nCommunications and Public Safety Act.\n  It is my understanding--and I ask if the distinguished chairman \nshares this understanding--that this broad definition applies only to \nthis bill, and is not meant to be an indication of the Congress's view \nof the appropriate scope of voice-over-Internet-Protocol or VoIP \nservices for other purposes or to serve as precedent for future action. \nIt is certainly not meant to suggest that the FCC adopt this definition \nas it considers the appropriate views on VoIP services. Does the \ndistinguished chairman agree with my understanding?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. The definition of ``IP enabled voice service'' in \nthis bill is not meant to be the universal definition of ``IP enabled \nvoice service'' to be used in future legislation that involves other \ncontexts. And, it should not be interpreted as a signal to the FCC that \nit should alter or change the definitions of Interconnected or IP \nenabled voice services that it has used in other contexts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4709) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I wish to pause for a moment to pay respect \nto one man, Eric Ueland, my chief of staff. Tucked away in a corner of \nEric Ueland's office is a well-worn copy of the book ``Master of the \nSenate.'' This comes as no surprise to those of us who know him. In \nfact, my staff used to joke that he was reading his own biography.\n  Eric is gifted with a passion for history, a thirst for knowledge, \nand a high reverence for the Senate. These talents have made him a \nuniquely capable adviser and leader in the majority leader's office.\n  He contextualizes every Senate debate, recalls appropriate precedent, \nand draws parallels to moments in history. A nameplate is discretely \ndisplayed on his desk, and the name it bears: ``Information.''\n  As the press corps knows, information is his trade and the enigmatic \nquote his trademark. How do you pay tribute to a man who is the first \nto know of Britney Spear's pregnancy and Don Rumsfeld's resignation?\n  Eric delights in a secret and encyclopedic knowledge of popular \nculture. Copies of People magazine and the entertainment gossip columns \nare strewn in the back seat of his classic car. And he knows everything \nabout the media. Yet he doesn't have home Internet access or even cable \nTV. How does he do that?\n  Eric finds unique and, some would say, unusual pleasure in memorizing \nthe complex rules, the arcane precedents, and early history of the \nSenate. ``Chart 4--mere child's play.'' You would expect he would know \nthat combining his customary bow ties and beards could be a violation \nof the Senate Code of Conduct.\n  But his extraordinary talents are not what I have come to respect \nmost about Eric Ueland. He is a man of deep humility, a man of quiet \nfaith, a man of sterling character. He is a person true to his \nconvictions, both political and personal. He has maintained his \nintegrity in the rough and tumble of politics. His standards are high.\n  I know of no staffer who has had a more profound regard for the \ninstitution, our institution, the institution of the Senate. And, in \nturn, Eric has earned the gratitude and respect of so many who have had \nthe honor to serve here. Eric came to the Senate 17 years ago and \nworked for Senator Don Nickles at the Republican Policy Committee and \nthen as his chief of staff in the assistant Republican leader's office.\n  Senator Nickles writes:\n\n       I have had the pleasure of working with hundreds of \n     individuals throughout my Senate career and Eric stands out \n     in many ways. He is an exceptionally intelligent individual \n     with unequaled knowledge of the Senate. His knowledge of \n     Senate history, rules, process and customs, as well as the \n     individuals who have served in the body for the last couple \n     of decades, is remarkable. He has devoted much of his life to \n     the Senate and helped make the Senate function much more \n     effectively. He was a tremendous asset to me as well as a \n     valued friend.\n\n\n[[Page S11641]]\n\n\n  Eric has a beautiful and patient wife Kathleen and three wonderful \nchildren--Stephen, 13; Brigid, 11; and Charlotte, 6. Eric, as we all \nknow, puts in long hours in service to the Senate and it, again, as we \nall know, takes him away from his family. So I thank each of them for \ntheir service to his family, to their community and, thereby, to the \ncountry. But Eric is a devoted father and puts in many hours helping \nthem with homework and could often be found keeping score at one of \ntheir basketball games. The children's manners, their politeness, their \ndress all reflect that Kathleen and Eric are great parents.\n  Perhaps the highest tribute I can pay to Eric is simply to say his \nwork has honored the institution of the U.S. Senate, which he himself \nso highly honors. And in honoring the Senate and the democratic ideals \nit represents, he has, indeed, honored his country.\n  Well done, Eric, you have been a good and faithful servant of the \nSenate. You have been a good and faithful counselor and friend, and you \nhave served this Nation with distinction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't have prepared remarks, but I join \nthe majority leader in praising Eric Ueland. He is a bright guy. Very \nintelligent, gracious, and straight, someone I trust. I got to know him \nwith the leader over months, weeks, days, and hours. I thank him very \nmuch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11641-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN POMPER\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to recognize one key staff member \nwhose last day in the Senate is today and that is Brian Pomper. He has \nworked in my Senate office since March 2003. He has served as my chief \ntrade counsel over the past 2 years. In that time, Brian has been at \nthe center of each and every trade initiative that has passed through \nthis Congress. He has worked tirelessly and fairly with Members and \nstaff of both parties in both Houses, and he has bridged gaps that have \nseemed insurmountable. He is very intelligent, very conscientious, and \none of the most decent persons I have ever had the privilege to know. \nBrian Pomper will be sorely missed in the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at this time I would like to recognize \nBrian Pomper, chief trade counsel for the Democratic staff on the \nFinance Committee. Today is Brian's last day with the committee. Brian \nhas been a real asset to the Senate, and he will be greatly missed.\n  He has worked both with my staff and sometimes against my staff, but \nlet me tell you this: He is the sort of person who, whether he is with \nyou entirely or against you, is a wonderful person to work with. So at \nall times the lines of communication with him between our staffs always \nremained open, and it has always been a friendly relationship.\n  Brian is a very warm and decent person, and I wish him the best of \nluck in his future endeavors. It is my understanding that he is going \nto go into the private sector, the cold cruel world of the private \nsector. I hope he enjoys it, but I want to thank him for his \ncooperation with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11641-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11641-S11643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAX-HEALTH-TRADE EXTENDERS BILL\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and \nchairman, Senator Grassley, in bringing this package of needed tax, \nhealth, and trade matters to the Senate floor.\n  This is the last bill that Senator Grassley will manage as chairman \nfor at least a couple of years. And I want to take this opportunity to \nrecognize his leadership as chairman on the Finance Committee. He and I \nhave worked together as partners and we will continue to work together \nas partners in the Congress to come.\n  Mr. President, Goethe said: ``To rule is easy, to govern difficult.'' \nSurely, this bill is evidence of that.\n  The vast bulk of this bill is simply the business of governing. It \ncontinues needed tax, health, and trade law. These are things that we \nmust do if we are to govern effectively. But certainly this bill has \nbeen difficult to enact.\n  Much of this bill has been more than a year in the making. It \ninvolved negotiations between several Committees, two Houses, and \nbipartisan leadership teams. It suffered many deaths. And it enjoyed a \nfew resurrections. But through hard work and determination we are \nfinally able to present today, this bipartisan, bicameral agreement.\n  The provisions of this bill are overwhelmingly the business of \ngoverning. They reinstate tax laws that have been needlessly disrupted. \nThey protect health care coverage. And they continue free trade \narrangements that benefit consumers and the residents of some of the \nworld's poorest countries.\n  Let me first turn to the tax section of the agreement. The key tax \nprovisions of this bill are a host of popular tax incentives that \nexpired last December. They have languished all year.\n  The Finance Committee and the Senate passed legislation to extend \nthese credits on time. The Senate passed them in November of last year \nas part of the tax reconciliation bill. But the conference with the \nHouse kicked those tax cuts out.\n  Folks told us that the tax cuts would travel on the next tax bill, \nthe pension conference. But again , the conference committee with the \nHouse removed them to sweeten other bills. when coupled with other more \ncontroversial measures, they failed.\n  This is an unfortunate history. And it is one that I hope we will not \nrepeat. If this Senator has anything to say about it. This is not how \nwe will govern, in the next Congress.\n  Congress's delay in extending these tax provisions caused \nuncertainty. And the delay until now will have real consequences for \ntaxpayers. Just this week, I received a report of the contingency plan \nat the IRS for the 2007 filing season. The IRS identified about 60 tax \nforms and products that will be affected by this delay.\n  The Form 1040 has already gone to the printer. That happened back in \nNovember. More than 120 million taxpayers use that form. The IRS will \nnot reprint those forms.\n  Consequently, the IRS expects taxpayer confusion. IRS expects more \nphone calls to the IRS with questions. IRS expects delays in filing. \nIRS expects incorrect returns. And IRS expects more amended returns.\n  Further, the IRS will need at least 6 weeks to reprogram its systems \nto accommodate the changes. It is simply too late for the IRS to \nimplement the 2007 filing season on time. This means delays in starting \nto process and issue refunds. And it means money. It may cost the IRS \nmillions in additional costs because of our delay. And the cost to \ntaxpayers could be even greater.\n  In September, I brought a display of the draft Form 1040 for next \nyear. Already, the classroom teachers' deduction and the college \ntuition deduction were gone. Millions of families that normally take \nthose deductions, and other popular incentives like the state sales tax \ndeduction will wonder why those lines no longer appear on the Form \n1040. And, unless taxpayers are willing to get on the Internet and \nsearch, they may never know that we extended these incentives in the \nnick of time.\n  Governing may be difficult, but we must do better.\n  We must do better by our business taxpayers. Twenty thousand \nbusinesses who hire the hard-to-employ have continued to hire these \nworkers with only a hope that we would retroactively extend the Work \nOpportunity Tax Credit. I am pleased to report that the credit is \nretroactive to the beginning of this year and improvements will be \neffective beginning next year.\n  For the 16,000 businesses in this country that create high-tech jobs \nfor U.S. workers, we have retroactively extended the R credit to the \nbeginning of this year. We have provided for a new, enhanced credit for \nnext year. And, we have also provided a special rule for fiscal year \ntaxpayers. That will ensure these businesses can access the credit even \nthough their tax year has closed.\n  The agreement also provides a one-year extension of certain energy \ntax incentives that were due to expire next year. This package includes \nthe popular credit for electricity from alternative energy sources.\n  And this agreement extends expired individual tax incentives for 2 \nyears--2006 and 2007. These incentives include the college tuition \ndeduction, the state\n\n[[Page S11642]]\n\nsales tax deduction, and classroom teachers' deduction, among others.\n  This bill also has a substantial health component. The main \nattraction is an adjustment to the Medicare physician payment rate. \nThis will stave off a cut of more than 5 percent in what Medicare pays \ndoctors in 2007.\n  And we are going to reward doctors for reporting on their \nperformance. This will help move us toward paying for quality in the \nMedicare program. The information collected when doctors report on \nquality measures will be the foundation for paying for performance. We \nwill move toward rewarding outcomes rather than simply the number of \nprocedures.\n  This bill also extends important provisions from the 2003 Medicare \nModernization Act that are scheduled to expire at the end of this \nmonth. These provisions will help rural clinical laboratories, physical \nand occupational therapy patient, and pathologists.\n  The bill will ensure continued access to dialysis services for \npatients with kidney failure. And it will correct how vaccines are \nreimbursed under the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. This will \nmake vaccines even easier for seniors to get.\n  Fighting health care fraud and abuse is another important part of \nthis bill. A special fund, known as the Health Care Fraud and Abuse \nControl fund, was established years ago to help the Department of \nJustice work together to identify, deter, and prosecute health care \nfraud. Unfortunately, Congress has frozen the program's resources since \nfiscal year 2003. This bill would increase funding for the program each \nyear for the next 4 years to keep up with inflation.\n  We also provide the administration with another tool in fighting \nerroneous payments in Medicare. It would expand a demonstration program \nthat was included in the 2003 Medicare law to use recovery audit \ncontractors to identify and collect overpayments in Medicare.\n  In the Medicaid program, this bill codifies the maximum rate at which \nStates can tax health care providers under their Medicaid plans.\n  Another provision extends transitional medical assistance, or TMA, \nfor up to a year. TMA makes sure that low-income families do not lose \ntheir Medicaid health insurance when they move from welfare to work.\n  This bill has real benefits for real people. In my home state of \nMontana alone, the physician payment adjustment will make a difference \nof between $10 million and $13 million to Montana doctors in 2007. The \nclinical laboratories extension provision will mean an additional \n$900,000 for clinical laboratories in Montana. The therapy caps \nexception will mean an additional 1,700 Montanans will have access to \nphysical and occupational therapy services in 2007. And the Medicaid \nprovider tax provision means that Montana Medicaid nursing homes will \nget $112 million in additional revenues over the next 5 years, while \nthe State will have $36 million.\n  The provisions in this bill are good for beneficiaries. These are \ngood policies and they will help Medicare and Medicaid continue to \nprovide Americans with the kind of quality health care they deserve.\n  This legislation also ensures that two important trade programs, the \nGeneralized System of Preferences and the Andean Trade Preferences Act, \nwill not expire at the end of this year. Thousands of people's jobs \ndepend on these programs, both here and abroad.\n  The Generalized System of Preferences has been a part of American \ntrade policy for more than 3 decades. It has encouraged development in \npoor countries by granting duty-free access to the world's largest \nmarket.\n  But developing countries are not the only beneficiaries.American \nbusinesses benefit from the program. It allows them to source inputs \nand components duty-free. They can pass these benefits on to their \ncustomers in the form of lower prices and greater product variety.\n  Critics of the Generalized System of Preferences rightly point out \nthat the largest beneficiaries are middle income countries with strong \nexport sectors that may not need these preferences.\n  With this in mind, we have given the President authority to scale \nback benefits under the program if he determines that a country has \nbecome a competitive exporter. The President can examine the \ncircumstances unique to each beneficiary country and weigh them against \nforeign and economic policy priorities.\n  This bill will extend benefits under the Andean Trade Preferences Act \nfor another 6 months, and would make a beneficiary country eligible for \nbenefits for 6 more months if the United States and that country both \ncomplete their legislative processes to implement a free trade \nagreement.\n  This extension means that the Andean countries' current preferences \nwill not disappear abruptly at the end of this year. That would throw \nthousands of people out of work in the Andean region, and possibly \ndrive thousands more to coca cultivation and trafficking.\n  I continue to believe that a simple 1-year extension for both the \nGeneralized System of Preferences and the Andean Trade Preferences \nAct--without changes--is the best policy. A 1-year extension would \nallow us to maintain the status quo. That would give us breathing space \nto evaluate all our preference programs next year and determine whether \nand how they mesh with out trade and competitiveness goals.\n  That is not what this bill contains. but what this bill does contain \non these important programs is far preferable to the disruption that \nexpiration would engender for the thousands of people both here and \nabroad whose jobs rely upon these programs.\n  In the next Congress, I intend to examine our trade preference \nprograms, to explore whether and how they might be changed to address \nthe valid criticisms some of my colleagues have made. We should \nunderstand the effect these programs have on the U.S. image around the \nworld, our diplomatic efforts, and our trade priorities in the Doha \nRound and elsewhere.\n  And we should give those in the United States who rely upon our trade \npreference programs an opportunity to suggest how those programs might \nbe improved, and to explain how their interests might be affected by \nsome of the changes that have been proposed.\n  This bill also establishes a crucial 5-year trade preference program \nfor a country much closer to home--Haiti. Haiti, just 600 miles from \nour shores, is the poorest country in our hemisphere.\n  This program could help the people of Haiti to get back on a path to \nprosperity, opportunity, and long-term political stability. I commend \nthe tireless efforts of Senators Bill Nelson and Mike DeWine, former \nSenator Bob Graham, and incoming House Ways and Means Committee \nChairman Charlie Rangel to ensure that this Congress would extend this \nvital assistance.\n  This legislation also extends expiring third-country fabric \nprovisions for the least-developed African countries under the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. That Act has contributed to the creation of \nthousands of jobs and investment in Sub-Saharan Africa. It has been \ncredited with nearly tripling African apparel exports to the United \nStates. These exports, around $1.4 billion in 2005, are just a fraction \nof the U.S. apparel market. But they are very significant to the \ncompanies and workers supplying them.\n  This bill extends the third-country fabric provisions until 2012. I \nbelieve that if we give this program more time, more opportunities for \ninvestment and development will take root in southern Africa.\n  The bill before the Senate today will also deliver some much-needed \nhelp for American manufacturers who import products they can't buy in \nthe United States. This bill temporarily suspends duties charged on \nimported manufacturing inputs provided that no domestic company \nproduces those goods.\n  These duty suspensions mean jobs for American workers. They mean that \nSimms Fishing in Bozeman, MT can save money on the production of their \nworld-class fishing waders. And Sun Mountain Sports in Missoula, MT, \nwill get a break on the cost of manufacturing its high quality golf \nbags. While each duty suspension is worth less than $500,000, that \nmoney can mean a lot to small businesses around the country like Simms \nand Sun Mountain. The money they save can be reinvested in more jobs \nand further development right here at home.\n  Today the Senate also stands poised to accomplish a goal that has \neluded the United States for nearly 200 years--\n\n[[Page S11643]]\n\nnormal economic relations with Vietnam.\n  In April 1975, trade between America and Vietnam stopped. After the \nfall of Saigon, America imposed an economic embargo on the newly \nunified Vietnam. After years of painstaking diplomacy beginning with \nthe first President Bush, relations between the United States and \nVietnam improved. Trade between the two countries took off after the \ntwo sides began to implement a bilateral trade agreement in December \n2001. Trade was just $1.4 billion in 2001. Four years later, trade \nflows were 5 times as large, hitting $7.7 billion in 2005. Vietnam's \nimminent accession to the World Trade Organization as its 150th member \nwill accelerate this trend.\n  Economically, Vietnam has become a critical market for the United \nStates. Out of the rubble of a war that killed roughly a million of its \ncitizens, Vietnam has re-emerged as a country with more than 83 million \nsmart, energetic, hard-working men and women.\n  The terms of Vietnam's WTO accession are first rate. Farmers and \nranchers in Montana and across America will benefit from deep \nreductions in Vietnam's agricultural tariffs. Vietnam also committed to \ncut industrial tariffs to 15 percent or less for nearly all U.S. \nexports.\n  And Vietnam has further opened its market to our most competitive \nsector--the services industry--which employs 3 out of 4 Americans.\n  But to benefit from these and the rest of Vietnam's WTO accession \ncommitments, the United States must grant Vietnam permanent normal \ntrading relations. That is the small price that we have to pay: \ngranting Vietnam, on a permanent basis, the normal trade relations that \nwe already provide Vietnam on a renewable basis. Senator Smith and I \nintroduced a bill to do so in June--with Senators McCain, Kerry, Lugar, \nHagel, Murkowski, and Carper.\n  If we do not grant Vietnam PNTR, then America will be shut out of \nVietnam's market-opening commitments. If we do not, then the benefits \nof those commitments would instead flow to exporters in China, the \nEuropean Union, Japan, and elsewhere.\n  But Vietnam PNTR is not just about economics. As important, it makes \nhistory. It completes the process of normalization and reconciliation \nbetween two formerly bitter enemies.\n  Let us make history today and pass this bill to grant Vietnam PNTR.\n  Let us provide taxpayers with the tax relief they have been waiting \nfor all year. Let us ensure that harsh cuts do not drive doctors away \nfrom seeing Medicare patients. And let us take some small steps to \nfoster free trade.\n  This year, governing has been difficult. But let us conclude this \neffort. Let us do this work that needs to be done. And let us conclude \nthe work of this session of Congress so we can get on with next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I send a bill to the desk and ask unanimous consent for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4121) to provide optional funding rules for \n     employers in applicable multiple employer pension plans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, a year ago I raised the issue of the \nproblem of the small timber industry in Alaska, and we had an amendment \nto be offered to the tax bill. I was asked not to proceed then, and I \nreceived a commitment that this amendment would be included in the next \ntax bill as a technical correction. We thought it was going to be in \nthis year again, and I discovered it is not in the bill.\n  What this bill does, it deals with the problem created in the timber \nindustry in southeastern Alaska when a series of companies failed and \nthey left a situation where the pension plan is supported only by the \nsurviving companies. These companies have the obligation to pay the \npensions of those who retired from other companies that failed, prior \nto their demise, but they found they cannot do that and survive unless \nthe time within which the payments are to be made is extended. That \nwill be the purpose of this bill. The purpose of this bill is to extend \nthe time so that the surviving companies can pay not only their own \nemployer contribution for their own employees but for the employees of \nthe companies that failed.\n  I have been told today that this bill affects 600 to 1,000 jobs in \nsoutheastern Alaska now and up to 2,000 employees who already retired. \nUnless the time is extended, the surviving companies will fail and the \nexisting employees will lose their jobs and those who have already \nretired will not get their pensions.\n  I conferred with our friend, the chairman on the House side, Chairman \nThomas. I suggested the only way to deal with this now, since the House \nhas already passed this bill without the amendment in it, would be to \nhave this independent bill passed. I am grateful to all who have been \nconsidering this bill all day long. It has been an all-day-long \nproposition, and I do hope it will be passed now so that we may try to \nsee if the House can pass it before they adjourn.\n  I do urge immediate passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN MULTIPLE \n                   EMPLOYER PLANS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of an applicable pension \n     plan--\n       (1) if an eligible employer elects the application of \n     subsection (b), any liability of the employer with respect to \n     the applicable pension plan shall be determined under \n     subsection (b), and\n       (2) if an eligible employer does not make such election, \n     any liability of the employer with respect to the applicable \n     pension plan shall be determined under subsection (c).\n       (b) Election to Spin Off Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--If an eligible employer elects, within 180 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, to have \n     this subsection apply, the applicable pension plan shall be \n     treated as having, effective January 1, 2006, spun off such \n     employer's allocable portion of the plan's assets and \n     liabilities to an eligible spunoff plan and the employer's \n     liability with respect to the applicable pension plan shall \n     be determined by reference to the eligible spunoff plan in \n     the manner provided under paragraph (2). The employer's \n     liability, as so determined, shall be in lieu of any other \n     liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or to \n     the applicable pension plan with respect to the applicable \n     pension plan.\n       (2) Liability of employers electing spinoff.--\n       (A) Ongoing funding liability.--\n       (i) In general.--In the case of an eligible spunoff plan, \n     the amendments made by section 401, and subtitles A and B of \n     title I, of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 shall not \n     apply to plan years beginning before the first plan year for \n     which the plan ceases to be an eligible spunoff plan (or, if \n     earlier, January 1, 2017), and except as provided in clause \n     (ii), the employer maintaining such plan shall be liable for \n     ongoing contributions to the eligible spunoff plan on the \n     same terms and subject to the same conditions as under the \n     provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in effect \n     before such amendments. Such liability shall be in lieu of \n     any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation or to the applicable pension plan with respect to \n     the applicable pension plan.\n       (ii) Interest rate.--In applying section 302(b)(5)(B) of \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and \n     section 412(b)(5)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as \n     in effect before the amendments made by subtitles A and B of \n     title I of the Pension Protection Act of 2006) and in \n     applying section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii) of such Act (as in effect \n     before the amendments made by section 401 of such Act) to an \n     eligible spunoff plan for plan years beginning after December \n     31, 2007, and before the first plan year to which such \n     amendments apply, the third segment rate determined under \n     section\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\n     303(h)(2)(C)(iii) of such Act and section 430(h)(2)(C)(iii) \n     of such Code (as added by such amendments) shall be used in \n     lieu of the interest rate otherwise used.\n       (B) Termination liability.--If an eligible spunoff plan \n     terminates under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 on or before December 31, 2010, the \n     liability of the employer maintaining such plan resulting \n     from such termination under section 4062 of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 shall be determined in \n     accordance with the assumptions and methods described in \n     subsection (c)(2)(A). The employer's liability, as so \n     determined, shall be in lien of any other liability to the \n     Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or to the applicable \n     pension plan with respect to the applicable pension plan.\n       (c) Liability of Employers Not Electing Spinoff.--\n       (1) In general.--If an applicable pension plan is \n     terminated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     of 1974, an eligible employer which does not make the \n     election described in subsection (b) shall be liable to the \n     corporation with respect to the applicable pension plan (in \n     lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation or to the applicable pension plan with respect to \n     the applicable pension plan ) in an amount equal to the \n     fractional portion of the adjusted unfunded benefit \n     liabilities of such plan as of December 31, 2005, determined \n     without regard to any adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities \n     to be transferred to an eligible spunoff plan pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       (A) Adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities.--The term \n     ``adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities'' means the amount of \n     unfunded benefit liabilities (as defined in section \n     4001(a)(18) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974), except that the interest assumption shall be the rate \n     of interest under section 302(b) of the Employee Retirement \n     Income Security Act of 1974 and section 412(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect before the \n     amendments made by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, for \n     the most recent plan year for which such rate exists.\n       (B) Fractional portion.--The term ``fractional portion'' \n     means a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount \n     required to be contributed to the applicable pension plan for \n     the 5 plan years ending before December 31, 2005, by such \n     employer, and the denominator of which is the amount required \n     to be contributed to such plan for such plan years by all \n     employers which do not make the election described in \n     subsection (b).\n       (d) Other Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) Applicable pension plan.--The term ``applicable pension \n     plan'' means a single employer plan which--\n       (A) was established in the State of Alaska on March 18, \n     1967, and\n       (B) as of January 1, 2005, had 2 or more contributing \n     sponsors at least 2 of which were not under common control.\n       (2) Allocable portion.--The term ``allocable portion'' \n     means, with respect to any eligible employer making an \n     election under subsection (b), the portion of an applicable \n     pension plan's liabilities and assets which bears the same \n     ratio to all such liabilities and assets as such employer's \n     share (determined under subsection (c) as if no eligible \n     employer made an election under subsection (b)) of the excess \n     (if any) of--\n       (A) the liabilities of the plan, valued in accordance with \n     subsection (c), over\n       (B) the assets of the plan,\n     bears to the total amount of such excess.\n       (3) Eligible employer.--An ``eligible employer'' is an \n     employer which participated in an eligible multiple employer \n     plan on or after January 1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              SUSAN MCCUE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for 16 years I have had a woman working for \nme who has been outstanding. She has worked in my press department for \nthe last 8 years. She has been my chief of staff. Her name is Susan \nMcCue. She has a wonderful background. She is one of 10 children. She \nput herself through college working as a waitress, among other things. \nShe is a graduate of Rutgers University with a bachelor's degree.\n  Some people are born with the ability to jump high and throw balls a \nlong ways, and some people go to the finest business schools in the \ncountry to learn how to manage people. Susan has an innate ability, as \nif she were a skilled athlete, a skill to be an administrator. What she \ndid to develop my staff is something that I am sure someday will be \nused as a ``how you should hire a staff in Washington, DC.''\n  I have such great affection for Susan. She has worked so hard for me. \nShe has decided to leave after 16 years to go downtown and work, \nseeking not a job where she can make a lot of money but working in a \nprogram that will deal with poor people around the world. She will make \njust a little bit more money than she is being paid right here. But \nbeing the person she is, a kind, thoughtful, considerate person, she \nthought it was time for a change.\n  As hard as it is for me to let someone go who has done such a \nwonderful job for me, I must be as loyal and dedicated to her as she \nhas been to me.\n  I want everyone to know--and I especially want Susan to know--that \nher work on my behalf has been something that I and my family will long \nremember. I have never had anyone in my professional career as a \nlawyer, as a government worker, who has been more dedicated or more \nskilled than Susan McCue. I will miss her greatly. I know our paths \nwill cross, but I am a better person for having had her run my office. \nAnd poor people of the world will be well served with Susan McCue \nlooking after them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11644-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11644-S11645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I have spoken a lot \nin the last week, but I want to talk very briefly about the bill that \nwill be before the Senate in a few minutes, and speak about one \nparticular provision, the antitrade bill.\n  I thank Bill Thomas, I thank Bill Frist, Senator Grassley, Senator \nBaucus, Charlie Rangel, Kendrick Meeks. I thank the Chair, I thank \nSenator Durbin, the leadership in the House and the Senate of both \nparties, for including this provision in the bill.\n  Bill Thomas told me a moment ago, as I congratulated him and thanked \nhim, that this should have passed 4 years ago. I think it should have. \nWe worked on it for a long time.\n  The good news is that it will make a difference. It will create many \njobs in Haiti, a country that has about 70-percent unemployment, gross \nunderemployment, a country that Fran and I visited again last week, \nwhere we saw Paul Farmer's hospital in the central part of Haiti, with \nchildren who were grossly malnourished, children who do not have enough \nto eat, children who would have died but for getting into Paul's \nhospital, children whose hair was turning orange because of \nmalnutrition. When we went to Sisters of Charity in Port-au-Prince, we \nsaw twins who had been brought in by their dad who did not have enough \nto eat; they were clinging to life. That is replicated all over Haiti.\n  This bill will not solve all the problems of Haiti, but it will begin \nto do the one thing that is needed: Create jobs. The Haitian people are \nan industrious people. They are hard working. They line up for jobs. \nJobs in Haiti are what the country needs. It is what the new \nGovernment, that has been duly elected, needs--to be able to show some \nprogress, to be able to give the people of Haiti some hope.\n  I thank my colleagues. I thank all of them for including this \nprovision. I thank my friend Lindsey Graham and others who represent \ntextile interests. I know they had problems with this bill. We tried to \nwork out some of those problems. They represented their constituents \nwell. But they also had the heart for the people of Haiti.\n  This is not just a question about humanitarian concern; it is also \nabout our national interests. It is about our foreign policy. Haiti, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, being from Florida knows, is very close to \nMiami. It is probably an hour and 20 minute flight from Miami. Boat \npeople come up there time and time again. We have had\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\nUnited States Marines, United States troops in Haiti twice in the last \ndecade. It is a country that we need to care about. It is very \nimportant to us.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for including this \nprovision. It is a provision that will make a difference. It is a \nprovision that will save lives. I thank my colleagues for this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.J. Res. 102, which was \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 102) making further \n     continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2007, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I deeply regret that we will soon adjourn \nhaving adopted only 2 of the 12 fiscal year 2007 appropriations bills.\n  This year, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported all of the \nbills under its jurisdiction by July 20, the earliest that has been \ndone in 18 years. These bills were all within the budget allocation, \nand the total funding appropriated was lower in real dollars than last \nyear. I regret that the Senate was not allowed to consider these bills \nin time to complete action before the beginning of this fiscal year.\n  In this continuing resolution, which is now before the Senate, we \nhave made sure that the Department of Veterans Affairs has sufficient \nresources to provide all the benefits veterans are entitled to receive \nunder the law and that no veteran will be denied any benefit or receive \nanything less than the finest care available.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are now 69 days into the fiscal year and \nonly 2 of the 12 appropriations bills are public law. The Senate now \nhas before it a third continuing resolution that funds 13 of the 15 \nexecutive branch Cabinet departments through February 15.\n  When it comes to funding bills for domestic agencies, the majority \nleadership is apparently satisfied with a restrictive continuing \nresolution. Eight of the 12 bills were never even debated in the \nSenate. When it comes to caring for our veterans, the education of our \nchildren, the health of our elderly, and the ability of our \ndeteriorating infrastructure to sustain a growing economy, the majority \nleadership is satisfied with a rubberstamp continuing resolution, \nkicking the decisions down the road to the next Congress. This dismal \nperformance is not the result of the work of the Appropriations \nCommittee. The Appropriations Committee did its work and, on a \nbipartisan basis, reported all 12 of its bills by July 26. Chairman \nCochran did an outstanding job in leading the committee.\n  Sadly, the appropriations process, once again, has fallen prey to \npolitics.\n  Next year, the 110th Congress will have to complete the 2007 \nappropriations bills, a war supplemental, and the 2008 bills.\n  This will be a huge challenge. However, in the bipartisan tradition \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am committed to working with \nmy colleagues to meet this challenge.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the continuing resolution we are \nconsidering here today has a 6-week moratorium on a cost-of-living \nadjustment for Members of Congress. I support this provision because we \nshould not give ourselves a raise until we pass legislation raising the \nminimum wage.\n  It has been a decade since Congress last increased the minimum wage \nto $5.15 an hour. Since then, the real value of the minimum wage has \neroded by 20 percent, since--unlike Congress's pay raise--we did not \nincrease the minimum wage to keep pace with inflation.\n  Twenty-nine States have answered the call and raised the minimum \nwage. Illinois is one of those States--it has a minimum wage of $6.50, \nand in December the Governor is expected to sign recently passed \nlegislation raising the minimum wage to $7.50 in July.\n  But there are still 6 million Americans making $5.15 an hour.\n  We have been trying for nearly a decade to get the attention of the \nRepublican leadership that there are millions of Americans who go to \nwork every single day and can't make enough money to provide decent day \ncare for their kids, pay medical and utility bills, and provide food \nand other essentials that are just a part of every family's daily life.\n  A Low Income Housing Coalition study shows that, for the first time, \nthere was not one county anywhere in America in which a minimum wage \nworker could afford a one-bedroom apt. On average, workers have to make \nthree times the minimum wage to afford a one-bedroom apartment in this \ncountry. So people who are working full time for minimum wage literally \ncan't afford to keep a roof over their children's heads.\n  These hardworking Americans who work full time and make the minimum \nwage earn just $10,700 per year--$6,000 below the poverty level. In \nIllinois, $6.50 minimum wage workers currently earn $13,520. And now \nthere are 37 million Americans in poverty--a 5.4 million increase since \nPresident Bush took office.\n  While the Republicans in this town refuse to raise the minimum wage \nto help millions out of poverty, Congress has seen its pay increased by \n$31,600. Something is wrong here.\n  We hope to send a message to the Republican leadership in Congress \nthat these hardworking families deserve a raise too, because it's time \nfor a Congress that truly is sensitive to real family values.\n  Because one of those real family values is when you get up and go to \nwork every morning, doing your best for your kids and your family, you \ndeserve a decent pay check.\n  Democrats believe that, and that is why we support passing \nlegislation raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour over 2 years \nbefore we allow Members to receive a roughly $3,000 increase.\n  While some people may say that the amount of the automatic raise \nMembers are foregoing--$350--is only symbolic, keep in mind that \nminimum wage earners only earn $206 per week. To them, $350 isn't \nsymbolic, it is the equivalent of 68 hours worth of hard work.\n  Therefore, on behalf of 6 million Americans making the minimum wage, \nI urge Republicans to join with Democrats in passing a clean minimum \nwage bill in January before any automatic pay adjustment for Members \ntakes effect.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 102) was ordered to a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11647-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11647-S11658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\nSenate\n\n            NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH REFORM ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I am concerned about this \nprovision for two reasons: No. 1, the effect it will have on the \nMedicare Advantage program, and No. 2, the process by which it was \nincluded in this package.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank you for bringing this provision up for \ndiscussion. I have concerns as well.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Under current law, beneficiaries can decide to stay in \nthe traditional fee-for-service program or enroll in Medicare Advantage \nplans during the annual open period, which lasts from November 15 to \nDecember 31. They can also make certain changes one time between \nJanuary and March of the following year. I remember how much time and \neffort we spent designing these enrollment policies when we worked \ntogether on the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Wouldn't you agree \nthis provision is a significant policy change?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is an understatement. This provision would allow \nsome but not all types of Medicare Advantage plans to enroll \nindividuals throughout the year. Only those plans that do not offer \nprescription drug coverage will be given this special treatment. This \nmay sound like a small change because it only affects a certain type of \nMedicare Advantage plan. But it creates an unlevel playing field \nbetween plans with no drug coverage and Medicare Advantage plans that \nhave decided to offer prescription drug coverage.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is exactly my concern, too. I am also disappointed \nin the process that led to the provision being included in the final \nbill. We had an understanding that we would only include agreed-upon \nextensions and must-do health items in the package and not make major \npolicy decisions that had not gone through the regular process. This \nprovision does not meet that standard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, it does not. In fact, I soundly rejected the proposal \nduring the negotiations with our House colleagues. They were clearly \ninformed of my position on the matter. Our final agreement did not \ninclude this provision.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It disturbs me, that this major policy change--one that \ntreats some plans unfairly--was included at last minute by the House \nrules committee. I do not operate like that, and I know you do not, \neither. Unfortunately, we are stuck with this provision for the time \nbeing. But I assure of my commitment to working with you as soon as \npossible next year to revisit this provision.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my colleague and good friend from Iowa. I look \nforward to working with you next year on this and all of the business \nwe will have before our committee.\n\n\n                  children's health insurance program\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus, I would \nlike to begin by thanking you for your efforts to address the impending \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, shortfalls as part of this \nend-of-the-year package. As many as 17 States face the prospect of not \nhaving enough Federal CHIP dollars to cover the children currently \nenrolled in their programs. Estimates by the Congressional Research \nService and others indicate that these shortfalls will total \napproximately $920 million next year and could put the health care \ncoverage of as many as 630,000 children in jeopardy. This compromise, \nstruck between you, Congressman Barton, and Congressman Dingell, while \nnot 100 percent of what everybody wanted, takes a significant step \ntoward addressing that problem.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. We share an interest in \nmaking sure that States have adequate Federal funding to cover children \nthrough CHIP. No one wants to see children lose coverage, and we hope \nthe provisions in this bill will help States on a temporary basis until \nwe have time to work out a more permanent solution to the CHIP \nfinancing structure. Now I know that there are a lot of concerns about \nthis package. And I want to make it clear that Senator Baucus and I \nthought this was what we could pass right now. We are hopeful that we \ncan pass this package here in the Senate and then get House agreement \ntonight or tomorrow so that we can forestall these shortfalls for the \nfirst part of the year.\n  I want to make it clear, however, that nothing in this package binds \nus for CHIP reauthorization next year. There is discomfort with the \nCHIP provisions on both sides of the aisle. But Senators are willing to \ncompromise in order to get something done for children before we go \nhome. Therefore, we should put aside our differences and individual \ngripes in order to get something productive passed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to associate myself with the remarks of the \nchairman. This bill is so important, so vital to the lives of hundreds \nof thousands of children who need health coverage. I am so proud that \nthe Senate and the House were able to get together and work out a deal \nto get this done this year. I was disappointed we weren't able to \ninclude this in the tax extenders package that Senator Grassley and I \nworked on, so it is very gratifying to know we were able to do this. I \nwant to especially thank Chairman Grassley and his staff, Becky Shipp, \nfor their dedication to this effort and commitment to the program. I \nwould also like to thank Chairman Barton and his staff, Ryan Long, for \ntheir willingness to help in this process, and Congressman Dingell and \nhis staff, Bridgett Taylor and Amy Hall, for their dogged determination \nto get this done. I also agree with Chairman Grassley in his view that \nthe CHIP provisions in this bill will not set a precedent for \nreauthorization next year. Instead, this is a temporary fix--a \ndownpayment toward addressing a long-term problem of increasing demand \nfor CHIP and not enough Federal funds to go around. In an ideal world, \nSenator Grassley and I would have liked to put new money on the table \nto fully fund the shortfalls. However, we are operating under \nsignificant budget constraints. This package represents what we think \nwe can do now, despite those constraints. We know we will need to \nrevisit this issue next year, either as part of the reauthorization of \nthe CHIP program, or apart from that, to address the remaining CHIP \nshortfalls so that no State has insufficient funds to provide health \ncoverage for children. I am heartened by Senator Grassley's strong \ncommitment to the program that we will be able to work together in this \ncritical effort to shore up our Nation's safety net for low-income \nchildren.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Your comments are helpful because I think Members \nare concerned that accepting this CHIP shortfalls proposal means they \nwill be giving tacit approval to other provisions in the bill that they \ndon't really support--such as decreasing the CHIP allotment from 3 \nyears to 2\\1/2\\ years, or putting restrictions on how States can use \nthe redistributed money, for example. But what I hear both of you \nsaying, I think, is that the CHIP provisions in this package are \ncausing a little bit of pain for everyone, but that the benefits of \ngetting something done now far outweigh the downsides and that nothing \nin this CHIP package binds us as we move to reauthorize the program \nnext year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I understand the concerns of our colleagues. Certainly, \nthere are those who think we should have gone further in this proposal. \nThere are Senators who support going from a 3-year allotment structure \nto a 2-year allotment structure immediately. And there are Senators who \nwant to put greater limits on how CHIP dollars can be spent, to ensure \nprogram spending prioritizes children first. Senator Baucus and I \ndeveloped a CHIP proposal that is somewhere in between but is a \nproposal that meets our ultimate objective of keeping children covered. \nWe can have a policy debate about the merits of various proposals when \nwe reauthorize the program next year. Nothing in this package precludes \nus from doing that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I expect the Finance Committee to have a deliberative \nprocess on CHIP reauthorization early next year, where we can hear from \nMembers, Governors, CHIP directors, families and others about the CHIP \nfinancing structure, the allotment timeframe, populations covered and \nany other relevant issues of concern. As far as I'm concerned, we come \nto this process with a clean slate and we will have an honest dialogue \nabout the future of this vital program. For right now, however, I hope \nthat we can pass this legislation, so that no child loses coverage\n\n[[Page S11649]]\n\nbefore we have a chance to reauthorize the program next year.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleagues for their tireless efforts on \nbehalf of children, and I look forward to working with both of them to \naddress the remaining shortfalls early next year.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today the Senate has once again affirmed its \ncommitment to strengthen the National Institutes of Health and its \nimportant research to find better treatments and cures for all \ndiseases. Today, the Senate passed H.R. 6164, the National Institutes \nof Health Reform Act of 2006. This important piece of legislation \nprovides needed reforms to the crown jewel of the Nation's biomedical \nresearch enterprise, the National Institutes of Health.\n  This reauthorization builds upon the great initiatives and vision of \nDr. Zerhouni, the Director of NIH, by creating a common fund to support \ncross-cutting trans-NIH research initiatives, such as those initiated \nas part of Dr. Zerhouni's ``roadmap initiative''. This reform bill also \nbrings more transparency to the spending of this important agency. As \nwe recently doubled the NIH budget, it is important that the NIH and \nCongress can plan and evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of that \nspending.\n  NIH is the steward of this Nation's biomedical research enterprise \nand it is important we reevaluate the inner-workings of the agency to \nensure they are meeting this responsibility. The legislation passed \ntoday is a fulfillment of our critical obligation to evaluate, \nstrengthen, and improve the NIH so that they can shoulder this burden.\n  This bill also includes the substance of the NIH Foundation \nImprovement Act, which ensures the foundation has the resources and \nability to aid researchers in fulfilling NIH's mission to find better \ntreatments and cures for our most serious diseases. Most significantly, \nthese provisions clarify membership in the foundation's board of \ndirectors and assures that the foundation receives funds to support its \noperating expenses.\n  Every member of the House and Senate takes pride in the NIH and its \ngrantees. Through their work and vision, America has become the world \nleader in biomedical research, and Americans benefit from the fruits of \nthese labors every day. I am confident that this legislation will help \nNIH continue to be the engine that drives our understanding of \nbiomedical science and continue to be a source of pride.\n  Before closing, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge, \nthank, and congratulate the people who have worked hard to craft, \ndraft, and pass this legislation. First, I would like to thank my \ncolleagues in the House and their staff for their hard work in passing \nthis critical legislation. It is hard to overstate their dedication and \nwork in getting this bill done.\n\n  Specifically, Chairman Barton and Representative Dingell worked \ntirelessly crafting this legislation for months and getting the House \nto pass it nearly unanimously. They have continued to work for the last \n3 months to address every concern from Members here in the Senate. \nTheir staffs, Cheryl Jaeger, Katherine Martin, Ryan Long, John Ford and \nJessica McNiece, have worked patiently and persistently to reach \nconsensus that this bill is right policy at the right time. We \nappreciate their dedication and cooperative work.\n  Further, I would like to acknowledge the Senate and House Legislative \nCounsels, who worked hand in hand with staff to draft language as the \nHouse and Senate worked to accommodate concerns. They worked many long \nhours and all through the night last night to draft this language. In \nparticular, I would like to express my gratitude to Pete Goodlowe, \nWarren Berg, and Bill Baird for their dedication and hard work which \nenabled us to pass this bill.\n  I want to thank all the members of the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, especially my friend and ranking \nmember, Senator Kennedy, for his hard work and determination in seeing \nthis bill become law. I would also like to thank all of the staff, \nwithout whom much of our progress would not have been possible.\n  I would also like to thank David Noll, Derrick Scholls, Caya Lewis, \nand David Bowen of Senator Kennedy's staff for their hard work and late \nnights.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my own staff, including Katherine \nMcGuire, my staff director, Ilyse Schuman, Greg Dean, Stephen Northrup, \nDave Schmickel, and Shana Christrup for their diligence and \ndetermination as we worked to reach consensus on this important and \nessential bill.\n  We anticipate the House will pass this bill later today, after which \nit will be sent to the President's desk. I look forward to the exciting \nbiomedical breakthroughs that will result from the continued commitment \nof the NIH to critical, lifesaving research.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to comment briefly on the Tax Relief \nand Health Care Act of 2006. This bill includes a number of important \nprovisions, including tax relief and reforms to the Medicare system. I \nwish simply to highlight two sections for the record.\n  Section 103 contains an update of the composite rate component of the \nbasic case-mix adjusted prospective payment system for dialysis \nservices. The intent of this section is to provide an update of 1.6% \nfor a period of 1 year to the current composite rate for dialysis care. \nThis section does not address any other payment system modifications \nfor the ESRD Program. The GAO report is intended to explore the cost of \nhome dialysis and how to more effectively educate dialysis patients \nabout the possible advantages of home dialysis.\n  Section 110 relates to the reporting of anemia quality indicators for \nMedicare Part B cancer anti-anemia drugs. The intent of this section is \nto require the Secretary to develop a process through full notice and \ncomment rulemaking that requires providers to report hemoglobin or \nhematocrit levels for patients being treated with cancer chemotherapy. \nNothing in this section is intended to require the Secretary to change \nthe coverage or payment rules for any products under Part B.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns about \nsection 206 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. Under \ncurrent law, Medicare beneficiaries are only permitted to enroll in a \nMedicare Advantage plan from November 15 to March 31. This provision \nwould allow Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries to enroll in certain \nMedicare Advantage plans at any time during 2007 or 2008, but only into \nthose Medicare Advantage plans that do not cover prescription drugs. \nThis is a significant change in policy, and I am concerned that this \ncould provide incentives for seniors to join plans that do not offer \nprescription drug coverage. I am also troubled that this provision \ncould distort the thriving Medicare Advantage marketplace that is \nserving seniors well today.\n  I also am concerned about the process by which this provision was \nadded to the underlying legislation. While the vast majority of the \nMedicare provisions of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 were \ndiscussed and agreed to by the appropriate committees in the House and \nSenate, it is my understanding that this provision was added to the \nfinal package without the consent of the Finance Committee members who \nnegotiated on the Senate's behalf.\n  I want to make certain that our seniors are able to choose the \nMedicare option that best meets their health care needs and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure this provision does not \nharm our Nation's Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this bill covers a number of important \nareas. The so-called ``tax extenders'' provisions will continue a \nnumber of expired or expiring tax incentives that are important to our \neconomy. These include the critical tax credit for research and \ndevelopment done here in the U.S. The bill also extends the Welfare to \nWork and the Work Opportunity Tax Credits, which encourage employers to \nhire certain long-term family assistance recipients and members of \ntargeted groups such as high risk youth, families receiving food \nstamps, SSI recipients, and qualified veterans. Another important \nextension is the deduction for the out-of-pocket expenses of elementary \nand secondary school teachers of up to $250 for books and other \nsupplies. And there is a deduction of up to\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\n$4,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses. There is also a \nprovision to provide equity to the U.S.-flag ships operating in the \nGreat Lakes.\n  I am also pleased that this Congress is addressing the annual dilemma \nof appropriate reimbursement for physicians treating Medicare patients. \nThe current Medicare reimbursement system is flawed, and without \naction, doctors treating Medicare patients would have faced a 5% \nreduction in reimbursement. I am pleased that this legislation will \nhalt those cuts and I urge the 110th Congress to take a serious look at \noverall Medicare reimbursement so that we do not make this an annual \naffair. I am also pleased that this legislation contains a six month \nextension of the Medicare hospital wage index reclassification, \nbringing additional temporary financial relief to over 100 Michigan \nhospitals.\n  This bill also includes the permanent extension of Normal Trade \nRelations (PNTR) to Vietnam which Congress has been granting on an \nannual basis since December 2001. Vietnam is joining the WTO and the \nUnited States is obligated to grant Vietnam permanent normal trade \nrelations in order to receive the market opening commitments that were \nmade by Vietnam as a condition of joining the WTO. As a member of the \nWTO Vietnam will be subject to all of the WTO's international trade \nrules. Currently, the United States provides PNTR to most countries, \nbut not Vietnam.\n  I also support the inclusion of the provisions of S. 3711, the Gulf \nof Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, in this package. I supported \nthis bill when it passed the Senate because I believe we need to move \nforward to open up more areas for natural gas exploration to address \nthe increasingly tight natural gas supply in the U.S and its resulting \nhigh prices.\n  Over the past six years, the tight natural gas supply and increasing \ncosts of natural gas has had a significant impact on consumers and \nparticularly on the U.S. manufacturing sector, which depends on natural \ngas as both a fuel source and a feedstock and raw material. With U.S. \nnatural gas prices the highest in the industrialized world, many \ncompanies have made decisions to move their manufacturing operations \noffshore. Millions of manufacturing jobs have outsourced overseas \nduring this period.\n  Mr. President, I will support this bill because it contains many \nimportant provisions. I do hope, however, that in the next Congress we \ncan take up legislation in a timely manner allowing for more study and \ndeliberation on important far-reaching provisions and avoid these last \nminute omnibus packages. The process by which this omnibus package was \npulled together and unveiled at the eleventh hour is seriously flawed. \nPushing through an un-amendable, take-it-or-leave it package of \notherwise unrelated bills is not the way Congress should legislate. But \nat least we are finally coming to address a number of important \nprovisions that we should have dealt with long ago.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have been a longtime supporter of these \ntax credits and I am pleased that they are extended by this long \noverdue bill before us tonight.\n  The tax credits included in this bill are significant both for \nfamilies and for businesses; these credits will help families send \ntheir children to college, encourage businesses to hire individuals \nworking to get off welfare, and support research and development. The \nIRS indicates that 19 million taxpayers will benefit from this relief. \nOur economy benefits from these provisions and many taxpayers have \ngrown to rely on them. And those who benefit from these provisions need \ncertainty.\n  I am disappointed, however, by critical omissions and the inclusion \nof some provisions about which I have serious concerns.\n  For starters, this package does not address the Alternative Minimum \nTax, AMT; a tax provision that, with no Congressional intervention, \nwill affect 37.1 million tax returns by 2010. Households are more \nlikely to pay the AMT if they have children or live in a high-tax state \nbecause the AMT does not allow taxpayers to claim an exemption for \ndependents as an itemized deduction for state taxes. By 2010, nearly 90 \npercent of married couples with two or more children and incomes \nbetween $75,000 and $100,000 will pay the AMT.\n  The AMT is complicated, unfair, and no longer meets its intended \npurpose. That is why in her 2003 annual report to Congress, National \nTaxpayer Advocate Nina Olson identified the AMT as the most serious \nproblem encountered by taxpayers. According to Olson ``. . . that is \nhow the AMT appears to function--randomly, no longer with any logical \nbasis in sound tax administration or any connection with its original \npurpose of taxing the very wealthy who escape taxation. Congress must \naddress the AMT before it bogs down tax administration and increases \ntaxpayers' cynicism to such a level that overall compliance declines.''\n  Also, the bill includes many ill-conceived provisions. I strongly \noppose the bill's inclusion of an expanded voucher program for the \nDistrict of Columbia. There is no doubt that our nation's capital faces \nsevere educational challenges. However, this expansion is an \nunnecessary action that subverts the program's original intent to serve \nsolely low-income students, and continues federal government \nsubsidization of private and religious schools at the expense of public \neducation.\n  This is another attempt by the President and Republican leadership to \nexpand private school voucher programs, while reneging on our \nfundamental commitment to public schools, where 90 percent of American \nchildren receive their education. Instead of private school vouchers, \nwe should spend the dollars necessary to make the No Child Left Behind \nreforms work. We should be focusing on educational issues that touch \nthe lives of all American students, not just a select few.\n  Also inserted in the bill is a considerable expansion of Health \nSavings Accounts, HSAs. The provisions, which were never given full \nconsideration by either the Senate or House of Representatives, provide \nyet another mechanism for high income individuals to shelter taxable \nincome under the guise of health care. An August Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, report on tax filers who reported making \nHSA contributions had an average income of $133,000 in 2004. The annual \nsurvey of health care consumers by the Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute and the Commonwealth Fund found virtually no change in \nenrollment in HSAs, nor did they find any measurable impact on the \nrates of the uninsured in this country. While those who support these \nextensions, which will cost taxpayers close to a billion dollars over \nthe next decade, will argue that they will help expand these insurance \nproducts to more Americans, in reality they will benefit only those \nAmericans wealthy enough to take advantage of them.\n  The bill does contain some essential health-related provisions. \nSpecifically, it includes another temporary update in the reimbursement \nrate for physicians under Medicare. While this package reverses the \nprojected 5.1 percent cut for 2007, this Congress must take action next \nyear to bring greater stability and predictability to the Medicare \nphysician payment formula than currently exists. Nevertheless, this \nprovision ensures that elderly and disabled Medicare patients will \ncontinue to have access to their providers.\n  While this bill provides a 1-year extension of the moratorium on \nMedicare therapy caps, many other needed Medicare and Medicaid \nprovisions have been omitted. For instance, the bill does not include a \nmoratorium on impending reductions in reimbursements for imaging \nservices.\n  However, I would commend the architects of the legislation for \ncarving out unexpended monies available in the Medicare advantage \nstabilization fund to finance the provisions that were included instead \nof resorting to cuts in reimbursements to individual Medicare providers \ngroups.\n  I am further disappointed that this bill allows for exploration of \nthe outer continental shelf. This provision will not provide energy \nsecurity to the United States. Our nation needs a comprehensive energy \npolicy that reduces dependency on fossil fuels through increased energy \nefficiency, greater investment in renewable energy, and development of \nalternative fuels to replace oil. This provision is also unsound fiscal \npolicy. It would mandate that almost 38 percent of revenue from federal \nresources generated by new leases in the Gulf of Mexico be given to \nfour states--Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. These are \nrevenues\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\nthat currently would be provided to the United States Treasury for the \nbenefit of the Nation as a whole. Reducing revenue to the Treasury \nmeans that we, as a nation, will have fewer resources available in the \nfuture to respond to a call for help should there be another \ndevastating natural disaster or terrorism attack.\n  Unfortunately, the majority played political games to get us to this \npoint. We should have passed this legislation long ago. Instead, we are \nnow faced with passing a bill that contains important provisions but \nalso a number of others that I would have opposed had they been offered \non their own merits. Despite this bill's shortcomings, I will support \nit because it extends tax credits that will truly benefit countless \nAmericans and contains an important physician reimbursement fix. I will \nwork in the new Congress to address the bill's shortcomings.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the amendment at the desk be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5238) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 6164), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n\n                         statement of managers\n\n  Mr. GRASSEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a manager's \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Statement of Managers\n\n            DIVISION B--MEDICARE AND OTHER HEALTH PROVISIONS\n\n\n                   section 1. short title of division\n\n     Current law\n       No Provision.\n     Explanation of provision\n       This division may be cited as the ``Medicare Improvements \n     and Expansion Act of 2006''.\n\n        Title I--Medicare Improved Quality and Provider Payments\n\n\n         section 101. Physician payment and quality improvement\n\n     Current law\n       Medicare payments for services of physicians and certain \n     nonphysician practitioners are made on the basis of a fee \n     schedule. The fee schedule assigns relative values to \n     services that reflect physician work (i.e., the time, skill, \n     and intensity it takes to provide the service), practice \n     expenses, and malpractice costs. The relative values are \n     adjusted for geographic variations in costs. The adjusted \n     relative values are then converted into a dollar payment \n     amount by a conversion factor. The conversion factor for 2006 \n     is $37.8975.\n       The conversion factor is the same for all services. It is \n     updated each year according to a formula specified in law. \n     The intent of the formula is to place a restraint on overall \n     spending for physicians' services. Several factors enter into \n     the calculation of the formula. These include: (1) the \n     sustainable growth rate (SGR) which is essentially a \n     cumulative target for Medicare spending growth over time \n     (with 1996 serving as the base period); (2) the Medicare \n     economic index (MEI) which measures inflation in the inputs \n     needed to produce physicians services; and (3) the update \n     adjustment factor which modifies the update, which would \n     otherwise be allowed by the MEI, to bring spending in line \n     with the SGR target. In no case can the adjustment factor be \n     less than minus seven percent or more than plus three \n     percent.\n       The law specifies a formula for calculating the SGR. It is \n     based on changes in four factors: (1) estimated changes in \n     fees; (2) estimated change in the average number of Part B \n     enrollees (excluding Medicare Advantage beneficiaries); (3) \n     estimated projected growth in real gross domestic product \n     (GDP) growth per capita; and (4) estimated change in \n     expenditures due to changes in law or regulations. In order \n     to even out large fluctuations, MMA changed the GDP \n     calculation from an annual change to an annual average change \n     over the preceding 10 years (a ``10-year rolling average'').\n       The SGR target is not a limit on expenditures. Rather, the \n     fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in \n     meeting the target. If expenditures exceed the target, the \n     update for a future year is reduced. This is what occurred \n     for 2002. It was also slated to in subsequent years; however, \n     legislation kept this from occurring. Most recently, the \n     Deficit Reduction Act froze the 2006 conversion factor at the \n     2005 level. A negative 5% percent update is slated to occur \n     in 2007.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The conversion factor for 2007 would be the conversion \n     factor otherwise applicable for 2007 divided by the product \n     of: (i) 1 plus the Secretary's estimate of the percentage \n     increase in the MEI for 2007 (divided by 100), and (ii) 1 \n     plus the Secretary's estimate of the update adjustment factor \n     for 2007. These changes would not be considered in the \n     computation of the conversion factor for 2008.\n       The provision would also implement a voluntary quality \n     reporting system for Medicare payments for covered \n     professional services tied to the reporting of claims data. \n     Physicians and other eligible professionals (including \n     physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse \n     specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, \n     certified nurse-midwives, clinical social workers, clinical \n     psychologists, registered dietitians or nutritional \n     professionals as defined under current law, physical \n     therapists, occupational therapists, and qualified speech-\n     language pathologists) who report the quality information \n     would be eligible for a bonus incentive payment for services. \n     For 2008, the Secretary would address a mechanism whereby an \n     eligible professional could provide data on quality measures \n     through an appropriate medical registry (such as the Society \n     of Thoracic Surgeons National Database) as identified by the \n     Secretary.\n       For covered professional services furnished beginning July \n     1, 2007 and ending December 31, 2007, the quality reporting \n     measures are those identified as physician quality measures \n     under the CMS Physician Voluntary Reporting Program (PVRP) as \n     published on the CMS public website as of the date of \n     enactment of this provision. The Secretary may modify these \n     quality measures if changes are based on the results of a \n     consensus-process meeting in January of 2007 and if such \n     changes are published on the CMS website by April 1, 2007. \n     The Secretary may subsequently refine the quality measures \n     (without notice or opportunity for public comment) up until \n     July 1, 2007 by publishing modifications or refinements to \n     previously published quality measures but may not change the \n     quality measures.\n       Eligible professionals who (1) furnish services for which \n     there are established quality measures as determined by this \n     provision and (2) satisfactorily submit quality measures \n     would be paid a single additional bonus payment amount equal \n     to 1.5% of the allowed charges for covered professional \n     services furnished during the reporting period. The bonus \n     incentive payments would be paid from the Supplemental \n     Medical Insurance Trust Fund (Part B). These bonus incentive \n     payments would not be taken into account in the calculations \n     and determination of payments for providers in health \n     professional shortage areas or Physician Scarcity Areas, nor \n     would these bonus payments be taken into account in computing \n     allowable charges under this subsection.\n       The Secretary would presume that if an eligible \n     professional submits data for a measure, then the measure is \n     applicable to the professional. However, the Secretary may \n     validate (by sampling or other means as the Secretary \n     determines to be appropriate) to determine if an eligible \n     professional reports measures applicable to such professional \n     services. If the Secretary determines that an eligible \n     professional has not successfully reported applicable \n     measures, the Secretary would not pay that professional the \n     bonus.\n       Satisfactory reporting of data determines whether the \n     provider is eligible for the bonus payment. If there are no \n     more than 3 quality measures that are applicable to the \n     professional services furnished, the provider must report \n     each measure for at least 80% of the cases to meet the \n     criteria. If there are 4 or more quality measures that are \n     applicable, the provider must report at least 3 of the \n     quality measures for at least 80% of the cases.\n       The provision also places a limit on bonus payments. No \n     provider would receive payments in excess of the product of \n     the total number of quality measures for which data are \n     submitted and three times the average per measure payment \n     amount. The average per measure payment amount would be \n     estimated by the Secretary and would equal the total amount \n     of allowed charges under Medicare part B for all covered \n     professional services furnished during the reporting period \n     on claims for which quality measures are reported divided by \n     the total number of quality measure for which data are \n     reported during the reporting period under the physician \n     reporting system.\n       The Secretary would provide for education and outreach to \n     eligible professionals regarding these changes. The Secretary \n     would implement these provisions acting through the \n     Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     services.\n       This provision would allow no administrative or judicial \n     review, under the existing Medicare appeals process or \n     through a Provider Reimbursement Review Board as currently \n     codified in statute, of the determination of measures, \n     satisfactory reporting, payment limitation, or bonus \n     incentive payment. A determination under the provisions of \n     this section would not be treated as a determination under \n     current appeals processes for Medicare.\n       For 2008, the quality measures would be selected from \n     measures adopted or endorsed by a consensus organization \n     (such as the National Quality Forum or AQA, originally known \n     as the Ambulatory Care Quality Alliance) that includes \n     measures that have been submitted by a physician specialty \n     developed through a consensus-based process as identified by \n     the Secretary. Such measures shall\n\n[[Page S11652]]\n\n     include structural measures, such as the use of electronic \n     health records and electronic prescribing technology. The CMS \n     administrator would publish a proposed set of quality \n     measures for 2008 in the Federal Register no later than \n     August 15, 2007 with a public comment period. The final set \n     of measures appropriate for eligible professionals to use to \n     submit quality data in 2008 would be published no later than \n     November 15, 2007.\n       The Secretary would be required to establish a Physician \n     Assistance and Quality Initiative Fund which would be \n     available to the Secretary for physician payment and quality \n     improvement initiatives. Such initiatives may include \n     application of an adjustment to the update to the conversion \n     factor. The amount available to the Fund would be $1.35 \n     billion for 2008. The Secretary would be required to provide \n     for expenditures from the Fund for the obligation of the \n     entire amount (to the maximum extent feasible) for payment \n     for physicians services furnished in 2008. The specified \n     amount available to the Fund would be made to the Fund from \n     the Part B trust fund as expenditures are made from the Fund. \n     The amounts in the Fund are to be available in advance of \n     appropriations, but only if the total amount obligated to the \n     Fund does not exceed the amount available to it. The \n     Secretary may obligate funds from the Fund only if the \n     Secretary determines (and the CMS Chief actuary and the \n     appropriate budget officer certifies) that there are \n     sufficient amounts available in the Fund. If the expenditures \n     from the fund affect the conversion factor for a year, this \n     would not affect the computation of the conversion factor for \n     a subsequent year.\n       The Secretary would be required to transfer $60 million \n     from the Part B trust fund to the CMS Program Management \n     Account for the period of FY 2007, FY 2008, and FY 2009 for \n     the purposes of implementing this section.\n\n\n Section 102. Extension of floor on Medicare work geographic adjustment\n\n     Current law\n       Medicare's physician fee schedule assigns relative values \n     to services that reflect physician work (i.e., the time, \n     skill, and intensity it takes to provide the service), \n     practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The relative values \n     are adjusted for geographic variations in costs. The adjusted \n     relative values are then converted into a dollar payment \n     amount by a conversion factor.\n       The geographic adjustment factors are indices that reflect \n     the relative cost difference in a given area in comparison to \n     a national average. An area with costs above the national \n     average would have an index greater than 1.00 while an area \n     with costs below the average would have an index below 1.00. \n     The physician work geographic adjustment factor is based on a \n     sample of median hourly earnings in six professional \n     specialty occupational categories. Unlike the other \n     geographic adjustments, the work adjustment factor reflects \n     only one-quarter of the cost differences in an area. The \n     practice expense adjustment factor is based on employee \n     wages, office rents, medical equipment and supplies. The \n     malpractice adjustment factor reflects differences in \n     malpractice insurance costs. The Secretary is required to \n     periodically review and adjust the geographic indices.\n       MMA required the Secretary to increase the value of any \n     work geographic index that was below 1.00 to 1.00 for \n     services furnished on or after January 1, 2004 and before \n     January 1, 2007.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The requirement is extended for an additional year, for \n     services provided before January 1, 2008.\n\n\n Section 103. Update of the composite rate component of the basic case-\n     mix adjusted prospective payment system for dialysis services\n\n     Current law\n       The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required the Secretary to \n     establish a basic case-mix adjusted prospective payment \n     system for dialysis services furnished either at a facility \n     or in a patient's home, for services furnished beginning on \n     January 1, 2005. The basic case-mix adjusted system has two \n     components: (1) the composite rate, which covers services, \n     including dialysis; and (2) a drug add-on adjustment for the \n     difference between the payment amounts for separately \n     billable drugs and biologicals and their acquisition costs, \n     as determined by Inspector General Reports.\n       The Secretary is required to update the basic case-mix \n     adjusted payment amounts annually beginning with 2006, but \n     only for that portion of the case-mix adjusted system that is \n     represented by the add-on adjustment and not for the portion \n     represented by the composite rate. The DRA increased the \n     composite rate component of the basic case-mix adjusted \n     system for services beginning January 1, 2006 by 1.6%, over \n     the amount paid in 2005. For 2006, the base composite rate is \n     $130.40 for independent ESRD facilities and $134.53 for \n     hospital-based ESRD facilities. The total drug add-on \n     adjustment, with inflation, is 14.5%.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The composite rate component of the basic case-mix adjusted \n     system shall be increased by 1.6 percent above the 2005 rate, \n     for services furnished on or after January 1, 2006 and before \n     April 1, 2007. For services furnished on or after April 1, \n     2007, the composite rate component of the basic case-mix \n     adjusted system shall by increased by 1.6 percent, above the \n     amount of such rate for services furnished on March 31, 2007.\n       Not later than January 1, 2009, GAO shall submit a report \n     to Congress on the costs for home hemodialysis treatment and \n     patient training for both home hemodialysis and peritoneal \n     dialysis. The report shall include recommendations for a \n     payment methodology that measures, and is based on, the cost \n     of providing such services and takes into account the case \n     mix of patients.\n\n\n  Section 104. Extension of Treatment of certain physician pathology \n                        services under Medicare\n\n     Current law\n       In general, independent laboratories cannot directly bill \n     for the technical component of pathology services provided to \n     Medicare beneficiaries who are inpatients or outpatients of \n     acute care hospitals. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP \n     Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) \n     permitted independent laboratories with existing arrangements \n     with acute care hospitals to bill Medicare separately for the \n     technical component of pathology services provided to \n     inpatients and outpatients. The arrangement between the \n     hospital and the independent laboratory had to be in effect \n     as of July 22, 1999. The direct payments for these services \n     applied to services furnished during 2001 and 2002. MMA \n     applied the provision to services furnished during 2005 and \n     2006.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision is extended through 2007.\n\n\n   Section 105. Extension of Medicare reasonable costs payments for \n  certain clinical diagnostic laboratory tests furnished to hospital \n                    patients in certain rural areas\n\n     Current law\n       Generally, hospitals that provide clinical diagnostic \n     laboratory tests under Part B are reimbursed under a fee \n     schedule. MMA specified that hospitals with under 50 beds in \n     qualified rural areas (low density population rural areas) \n     would receive 100% reasonable cost reimbursement for clinical \n     diagnostic tests covered under Part B that are provided as \n     outpatient services. The provision applied to services \n     furnished during a cost-reporting period beginning during the \n     2-year period starting July, 1, 2004.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision is modified to apply to services furnished \n     during a cost-reporting period beginning during the 3-year \n     period starting July 1, 2004. The provision is effective as \n     if included in the enactment of MMA.\n\n\n       Section 106. Hospital Medicare reports and clarifications\n\n       (a) Correction of mid-year reclassification expiration\n     Current law\n       Section 508 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement \n     and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established a one-time-\n     only appeals procedure to provide relief for certain \n     hospitals that could not meet the existing reclassification \n     criteria used by the Medicare Geographic Classification \n     Review Board (MGCRB). The Section 508 reclassifications \n     appeals were heard by the MGCRB and were not subject to \n     further administrative or judicial review. The Section 508 \n     reclassifications are effective for 3 years, beginning on \n     April 1, 2004 and ending on March 31, 2007. Congress \n     allocated $900 million over 3 years to fund this provision. \n     Generally speaking, unless otherwise specified by law, the \n     MGCRB's classification decisions are required to have a \n     budget neutral effect in the inpatient prospective payment \n     system (IPPS).\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision would extend wage index reclassifications \n     that expire on March 31, 2007 until September 30, 2007. This \n     provision would not be implemented in a budget neutral \n     fashion.\n       (b) Revision of the Medicare wage index classification \n           system\n     Current law\n       As directed by Medicare statute, the amount of a hospital's \n     operating and capital payments will vary according to the \n     relative level of hospital wages in its geographic area \n     compared to the national average. The geographic areas or \n     hospital labor markets that have been used by Medicare are \n     urban areas as established by the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB). Essentially, a hospital's payment will depend \n     upon whether it is in an urban area (and if so, which one) \n     and the wage data reported by the hospitals in that area. \n     Counties that are not in an urban area are grouped into one \n     statewide rural labor market. Also, with modifications, the \n     hospital wage data are used to adjust for geographic cost \n     differences in Medicare's payment systems for other services, \n     such as inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), long-term \n     care hospital (LTCH), home health agency (HHA), skilled \n     nursing facility (SNF), and hospice care. Unlike these other \n     providers, IPPS hospitals have an administrative process, \n     through appeals to the Board (the Board), to reclassify to \n     different geographic areas. Other statutory provisions \n     affecting hospital's geographic designation also have been \n     established.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) would be \n     required to submit a report to Congress no later than June \n     30, 2007 on the wage index classification system used in \n     Medicare's prospective payment systems,\n\n[[Page S11653]]\n\n     including IPPS. This report would include recommendations for \n     alternatives to the current methods used to compute the wage \n     index. $2 million in funds in the Treasury would be \n     appropriated to MedPAC for FY 2007 for these activities. The \n     Secretary would be required to include in the proposed rule \n     making process for FY 2009 one or more proposals to revise \n     the IPPS wage adjustment, after taking into account MedPAC's \n     recommendations. The proposals would consider problems \n     associated with labor market definitions; modification or \n     elimination of geographic reclassifications and other \n     adjustments; the use of Bureau of Labor Statistics data to \n     calculate relative wages; minimizing variations in wage \n     index adjustments between and within metropolitan \n     statistical areas and rural areas; the feasibility of \n     applying all components of the proposal to other settings, \n     including HHAs and SNFs; methods to minimize the \n     volatility of wage index adjustments while maintaining the \n     budget neutrality; the effect on health care providers and \n     on each region of the country; implementation of proposal, \n     including the transition methods; and occupational mix \n     issues such as staffing practices, effect on quality of \n     care and alternative recommendations.\n       (c) Elimination of unnecessary report\n       The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress \n     that includes an initial estimate of the percentage update \n     (change factor) in the per discharge payment amounts. The \n     Secretary's estimate is required to take into consideration \n     the recommendations of MedPAC and may vary for hospitals in \n     different geographic areas.\n     Explanation of provision\n       This provision would eliminate the requirement that the \n     Secretary include recommendations with respect to the update \n     factors no later than March 1 before the beginning of the \n     fiscal year.\n\n\n        section 107. extension of payment rule for brachytherapy\n\n     Current law\n       The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established that \n     brachytherapy devices consisting of radioactive sources (or \n     seeds) would be paid on the basis of a hospital's cost for \n     such device (computed by reducing a hospital's charges to \n     costs) for services furnished starting January 1, 2004 until \n     January 1, 2007. The Secretary was directed to create \n     additional groups of covered OPD services that classify such \n     devices separately from other services (or group of services) \n     in a manner that reflects the number, isotope, and \n     radioactive intensity, including separate groups for \n     palladium-103 and iodine-125 devices. Starting January 1, \n     2007, CMS will continue to pay separately for brachytherapy \n     sources, but will base payment on the source-specific median \n     costs. CMS declined to create new brachytherapy source codes \n     to differentiate stranded from unstranded brachytherapy \n     sources.\n     Explanation of provision\n       This provision would extend payment for brachytherapy \n     sources on the basis of a hospital's charges adjusted to cost \n     until January 1, 2008. The provision also directs the \n     Secretary to create additional groups of covered OPD services \n     for stranded and nonstranded brachytherapy devices furnished \n     on or after July 1, 2007. These provisions may be implemented \n     by program instruction or otherwise.\n\n\nsection 108. payment process under the competitive acquisition program \n                                 (cap)\n\n     Current law\n       MMA revised the way Medicare pays for Part B drugs. \n     Beginning in 2005, payments for these drugs are based on an \n     average sales price (ASP) payment methodology, which sets \n     payments at the weighted average ASP plus 6%; the Secretary \n     has the authority to reduce the ASP payment amount if the \n     widely available market price is significantly below the ASP. \n     Alternatively, beginning in 2006, drugs can be provided \n     through a newly established competitive acquisition program \n     (CAP). The intent of the program is to enable physicians to \n     acquire certain drugs from an approved CAP vendor thereby \n     enabling them to reduce the time they spend buying and \n     billing for drugs.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision deletes the requirement that payments to CAP \n     contractors are conditioned upon the administration of the \n     drugs and biologicals. The provision specifies that payment \n     may only be made to the contractor upon receipt of a claim \n     for a drug or biological supplied by the contractor for \n     administration to a beneficiary. Further, the Secretary is \n     required to establish a post-payment review process to assure \n     that payment is made for a drug or biological only if it has \n     been administered. The process of postpayment review may be \n     established by program instruction or otherwise and may \n     include the use of statistical sampling. The Secretary is \n     required to recoup, offset or collect any overpayments \n     determined by the Secretary under this process.\n       The section further clarifies that nothing in this \n     provision is to be construed as requiring any additional \n     competition by entities under the CAP program. Further the \n     provision is not to be construed as requiring any additional \n     process for elections by physicians under the program or \n     additional selection by a selecting physician of a CAP \n     contractor. The provision applies to payments for drugs and \n     biologicals supplied on or after April 1, 2007. Additionally, \n     the provision applies on or after July 1, 2006 and before \n     April 1, 2007, for claims that are paid before April 1, 2007.\n\n\n  section 109. quality reporting for hospital outpatient services and \n                  ambulatory surgical center services\n\n       (a) Outpatient hospital services\n     Current law\n       Each year the hospital outpatient department (OPD) fee \n     schedule is increased by a factor that is generally based on \n     the hospital market basket (MB) percentage increase. In \n     certain years, the MB has been reduced by percentage points \n     as specified by statute.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Starting in 2009 and for each subsequent year, a hospital \n     paid under the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) \n     that does not submit required measures will receive an OPD \n     fee schedule increase of the MB minus 2.0 percentage points. \n     A reduction under this provision would only apply to payments \n     for the year involved and would not be taken into account \n     when computing the OPD fee schedule increase in a subsequent \n     year.\n       Each IPPS hospital is required to submit data on measures \n     under this section in the form, manner, and timing specified \n     by the Secretary. The Secretary would be required to develop \n     appropriate measures for the measurement of the quality of \n     care (including medication errors) furnished by hospitals in \n     outpatient settings and that reflect consensus among affected \n     parties. To the extent feasible and practicable, the measures \n     shall include those set forth by one or more national \n     consensus building entities. Nothing would prevent the \n     Secretary from selecting the IPPS quality measures or a \n     subset of such measures. The Secretary would be able to \n     replace any measures as appropriate, such as where all \n     hospitals are effectively in compliance or the measures have \n     subsequently been shown not to represent the best clinical \n     practice.\n       The Secretary would be required to establish procedures for \n     making the submitted data available to the public. These \n     procedures would ensure that a hospital has the opportunity \n     to review data prior to being made available to the public. \n     The Secretary would be required to report quality measures of \n     process, structure, outcome, patients' perspective on care, \n     efficiency, and costs of care on the Internet website of the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Other conforming \n     amendments would also be established.\n       (b) Application to ambulatory surgical centers\n     Current law\n       Presently, Medicare pays for surgery-related facility \n     services in an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) based on a \n     fee schedule. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, \n     and Modernization Act of 2006 (MMA) required the Secretary to \n     implement a revised payment system for ASCs no later than \n     January 1, 2008, taking into account recommendations issued \n     by a required report from the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO). The GAO report, which has just been issued, was \n     required to examine the relative costs of ASC services to \n     those in hospital outpatient departments. GAO was also \n     required to recommend whether CMS should use the outpatient \n     prospective payment system as the basis for the revised ASC \n     system. Total payments under the new system should be equal \n     to total projected payments under the old system.\n     Explanation of provision\n       In the revised payment system, the Secretary would be able \n     to provide for a reduction in any annual update of 2.0 \n     percentage points for failure to report required quality \n     measures. A reduction under this provision would only apply \n     to payments for the year involved and would not be taken into \n     account when computing any annual increase factor in \n     subsequent years. Except as otherwise provided by the \n     Secretary, the provisions of subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and \n     (E) of the newly established Section 1833(t)(17) concerning \n     the form and submission of data, the development of \n     outpatient measures, the replacement of measures, and the \n     availability of quality measures in a hospital outpatient \n     setting would apply to ASC services.\n       (c) Effective date\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The amendments made by the section would apply to payment \n     for services furnished starting January 1, 2009.\n\n\nsection 110. reporting of anemia quality indicators for medicare part b \n                        cancer anti-anemia drugs\n\n     Current law\n       Medicare Part B covers certain drugs used as anticancer \n     chemotherapeutic agents, and certain oral anti-emetic drugs \n     and biologicals used as part of an anticancer \n     chemotherapeutic regimen. Medicare also covers certain drugs \n     and biologicals to counter anemia for chronic kidney disease \n     and cancer patients. At present, Medicare Part B requires \n     hemoglobin or hematocrit levels to be reported only for \n     certain chronic kidney disease (dialysis) patients, but not \n     for cancer patients. MedPAC has recommended that the \n     hemoglobin or hematocrit levels be reported for patients \n     receiving anti-anemia drugs.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision requires that all Part B claims submitted for \n     drugs for treatment of\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\n     anemia in connection with cancer chemotherapy include the \n     hemoglobin or hematocrit levels for the individual. The \n     information is to be submitted in the form and manner \n     specified by the Secretary after full notice-and-comment \n     rulemaking as part of the physician fee schedule update rule \n     in 2007. The provision applies to drugs and biologicals \n     furnished on or after January 1, 2008.\n\n\n      section 111. clarification of hospice satellite designation\n\n     Current law\n       Section 1814(i)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act limits \n     total Medicare payment amounts to individual hospice \n     providers by an absolute dollar amount, or ``cap amount.'' \n     This amount is based on the number of Medicare patients the \n     agency serves and is calculated by dividing total payments to \n     a hospice per year by the total number of beneficiaries \n     served to get the per beneficiary payment amount. If the \n     per beneficiary payment amount does not exceed the cap \n     amount, the hospice may retain all payments. If the result \n     exceeds the cap amount, the hospice must repay excess \n     funds to the Medicare program. For purposes of calculating \n     whether or not a hospice exceeds the cap amount, \n     increasing the number of beneficiaries a hospice serves \n     reduces the per beneficiary payment amount. A lower per \n     beneficiary payment amount reduces the likelihood that a \n     hospice will exceed the annual hospice cap and be required \n     to repay excess funds to the Medicare program.\n     Explanation of provision\n       For purposes of calculating the hospice cap for 2004, 2005 \n     and 2006 and for hospice care provided after November 1, 2003 \n     and before December 27, 2005, this provision would designate \n     hospice with provider number 290-1511 as a multiple location \n     of hospice with provider number 29-1500.\n\n     TITLE II--MEDICARE BENEFICIARY PROTECTIONS\n\n\n Section 201. Extension of exceptions process for Medicare therapy caps\n\n     Current law\n       The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established annual per \n     beneficiary payment limits for all outpatient therapy \n     services provided by non-hospital providers. The limits \n     applied to services provided by independent therapists as \n     well as to those provided by comprehensive outpatient \n     rehabilitation facilities (CORFs) and other rehabilitation \n     agencies. The limits did not apply to outpatient services \n     provided by hospitals.\n       Beginning in 1999, there were two beneficiary limits. The \n     first was a $1,500 per beneficiary annual cap for all \n     outpatient physical therapy services and speech language \n     pathology services. The second was a $1,500 per beneficiary \n     annual cap for all outpatient occupational therapy services. \n     Beginning in 2002, the amount would increase by the Medicare \n     economic index (MEI) rounded to the nearest multiple of $10.\n       The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) suspended \n     application of the limits for 2000 and 2001. The Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act \n     of 2000 (BIPA) extended the suspension through 2002. \n     Implementation of the provision was delayed until September \n     2003. The caps were implemented from September 1, 2003 \n     through December 7, 2003. MMA reinstated the moratorium from \n     December 8, 2003 through December 31, 2005.\n       The caps went into effect again beginning January 1, 2006. \n     The 2006 caps are each $1,740. However, DRA required the \n     Secretary to implement an exceptions process for expenses \n     incurred in 2006. Under the process, a part B enrollee, or a \n     person acting on behalf of the enrollee, can request an \n     exception from the physical therapy and occupational therapy \n     caps. The individual may obtain such exception if the \n     provision of services is determined medically necessary. The \n     exceptions process only applies for 2006.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision extends the exceptions process through 2007.\n\n\n       Section 202. Payment for administration of part D vaccines\n\n     Current Law\n       Medicare Part B covers pneumoccoccal vaccine and its \n     administration, influenza vaccine and its administration, and \n     hepatitis B vaccine and its administration when furnished to \n     a high or intermediate risk individual. Medicare Part D \n     covers other vaccines licensed under the Public Health \n     Service Act.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision specifies that during 2007, the \n     administration costs for a vaccine paid under Part D are to \n     be paid under Part B as if it were the administration of a \n     hepatitis B drug covered under Part B. Beginning in 2008, \n     Part D coverage will include the administration costs.\n\n\n                 Section 203. OIG study of never events\n\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) in the Department \n     of Health and Human Services would be required to conduct a \n     study on the incidence of never events for Medicare \n     beneficiaries, including types of such events and payments by \n     any party, including beneficiaries, of such events. This \n     study would also include the extent to which Medicare paid, \n     denied or recouped payment for such services as well as the \n     administrative processes of the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services (CMS) to identify such events and to deny \n     or recoup associated payments. The OIG would be required to \n     audit a representative sample of claims and medical records \n     of the events; would be able to request access to claims and \n     records from any Medicare contractor; and would not be able \n     to release individually identifiable or facility specific \n     information. The OIG would be required to submit a report to \n     Congress no later than two years from enactment. This report \n     would include recommendations for legislative or \n     administrative action on the processes to identify, deny or \n     recoup payments for never events. The report will also \n     provide a recommendation on a potential process for public \n     disclosure of never events that ensures patient privacy \n     and permits the use of disclosed information for root \n     cause analysis. $3 million of funds in the Treasury will \n     be appropriated which will be available until January 1, \n     2010. Never events are those that are listed and endorsed \n     as ``serious reportable events'' by the National Quality \n     Forum as of November 16, 2006.\n\n\n        Section 204. Medicare medical home demonstration project\n\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The Secretary is required to establish a medical home \n     demonstration project in Medicare law for the purpose of \n     redesigning the healthcare delivery system to provide \n     targeted, accessible, continuous and coordinated, family-\n     centered care to high-need populations (i.e., those with \n     multiple chronic illnesses that require regular monitoring, \n     advising, or treatment).\n       Under the project, case management fees would be paid to \n     personal physicians, and incentive payments would be paid to \n     physicians participating in practices that provide ``medical \n     home'' services. Medical homes are physician practices in \n     charge of targeting beneficiaries for project participation. \n     They are responsible for: (1) providing safe and secure \n     technology to promote patient access to personal health \n     information; (2) developing a health assessment tool for the \n     targeted individuals; and (3) providing training for \n     personnel involved in the coordination of care.\n       The project is to operate for three years in urban, rural, \n     and underserved areas in up to 8 states and would include \n     physician practices with fewer than three full-time \n     equivalent physicians, as well as larger practices, \n     particularly in rural and underserved areas.\n       In addition to meeting Medicare requirements for \n     physicians, personal physicians who provide first contact and \n     continuous care for their patients must be board certified. \n     Personal physicians must also have staff and resources to \n     manage the comprehensive and coordinated health care of each \n     of their patients. Participating physicians may be \n     specialists or subspecialists for patients requiring ongoing \n     care for specific conditions, multiple chronic conditions \n     (e.g., severe asthma, complex diabetes, cardiovascular \n     disease, and rheumatologic disorder), or for those with a \n     prolonged illness.\n       Personal physicians must perform (or provide for the \n     performance of): (1) advocates for and provides ongoing \n     support, oversight, and guidance to implement a plan of care; \n     that provides an integrated, coherent, cross discipline plan \n     for ongoing medical care developed in partnership with \n     patients and including all other physicians furnishing care \n     to the patient involved and other appropriate medical \n     personnel or agencies (such as home health agencies); (2) \n     uses evidence-based medicine and clinical decision support \n     tools to guide decision-making at the point-of-care (based on \n     patient-specific factors); (3) uses health information \n     technology that may include remote monitoring and patient \n     registries; and (4) encourages patients to engage in \n     management of their own health through education and support \n     systems.\n       Payments for care management to personal physicians are to \n     be provided under a care management fee under section 1848 of \n     the Social Security Act. The Secretary would be required to \n     develop a care management fee code and a value for these \n     payments using the relative value scale update committee \n     (RUC) process.\n       Payments for a medical home shall be based on the payment \n     methodology applied to physician group practices under \n     section 1866A of the Social Security Act. Under this \n     methodology, 80% of Medicare reductions (determined by using \n     assumptions with respect to the reductions in the occurrence \n     of health complications, hospitalization rates, medical \n     errors, and adverse drug reactions) resulting from the \n     medical home participation (as reduced by the total project-\n     related care management fees), would be paid to the medical \n     home. Project payments are to be paid from part B.\n       The Secretary would be required to provide a yearly project \n     evaluation and submit it to Congress on a date specified by \n     the Secretary. In addition, the Secretary would be required \n     to submit to Congress a project evaluation no later than one \n     year after project completion.\n\n\n            Section 205. Medicare DRA technical corrections\n\n       (a) PACE clarification\n     Current law\n       The Secretary appropriated $10 million for FY2006 for the \n     outlier funds for rural PACE providers. Outlier costs are \n     those inpatient and other costs in excess of $50,000 incurred\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\n     within a given 12-month period by a PACE provider for an \n     eligible participant who resides in a rural area. These \n     appropriated funds would remain available for expenditure \n     through FY2010.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The amendment clarifies that the appropriated $10 million \n     would be applied to fiscal years 2006 through 2010, rather \n     than only for FY2006. It also specifies that the funds would \n     remain available for obligation, rather than for expenditure, \n     through FY2010.\n       (b) Miscellaneous technical corrections\n       (1) Correction of margin (section 5001)\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(b)(3)(B)), as amended by section 5001(a) of the \n     Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-171), is \n     amended by moving clause (viii) (including subclauses (I) \n     through (VII) of such clause) 6 ems to the left.\n       (2) Reference Correction (Section 5114)\n     Current law\n       This P.L. 109-171 provision modified the first sentence of \n     section 1842(b)(6)(F) of the Social Security Act to add a new \n     paragraph H to 1842(b)(6) so that a federally qualified \n     health center (FQHC) would be paid directly for FQHC services \n     provided by a health care professional under contract with \n     that FQHC.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Instead of modifying section 1842(b)(6)(F) to add paragraph \n     H, the amendment would modify section 1842(b)(6) of the \n     Social Security Act.\n       (c) Effective date\n       These amendments would become effective as if they had been \n     included in DRA 2005, enacted on February 8, 2006.\n\n\n Sec. 206. Continuous Open Enrollment into Certain Medicare Advantage \n                                 Plans\n\n     Current law\n       Individuals entitled to Medicare part A or enrolled in part \n     B can choose to receive Medicare benefits by enrolling in a \n     Medicare Advantage plan. Individuals enrolled in a Medicare \n     Advantage (MA) plan who also want to receive Medicare \n     prescription drug coverage may obtain prescription drug \n     coverage through that MA plan. MA enrollees may not also \n     enroll in a stand-alone prescription drug plan under part D, \n     except for: (1) enrollees in private fee-for-service MA plans \n     that do not offer qualified prescription drug coverage or (2) \n     enrollees in Medical Savings Accounts MA plans.\n       In general, individuals can make a coverage election during \n     the annual election period, which in 2006 and beyond, begins \n     on November 15 and ends on December 31. During this time, \n     beneficiaries can elect to receive benefits through original \n     Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program or an MA plan. \n     Individuals also can elect to enroll in a stand-alone \n     prescription drug plan or an MA plan that offers drug \n     coverage. Under certain circumstances, an individual may be \n     afforded a special election period outside of the annual \n     election period, during which time they can change their \n     coverage election.\n       Beginning in 2007, individuals can change their coverage \n     elections one time between January 1 and March 31. \n     Permissible election changes during this period include: FFS \n     to an MA plan; MA plan to FFS; MA plan to a different MA \n     plan; FFS with stand-alone prescription drug coverage to an \n     MA-PD; MA-PD to a different MA-PD; and MA-PD to FFS with a \n     stand-alone prescription drug plan. With respect to PFFS \n     plans, the permissible election changes include FFS with a \n     stand-alone PDP to a PFFS or MSA plan with the same stand-\n     alone PDP or FFS with a stand-alone PDP to a PFFS-PD. \n     Individuals who did not elect prescription drug coverage \n     during the annual election period cannot elect prescription \n     drug coverage during this one-time change period.\n     Explanation of provision\n       For 2007 and 2008, the provision modifies current law such \n     that an unenrolled fee-for-service individual can make a one-\n     time change to their coverage election on any date during the \n     year. An unenrolled individual is defined as an individual \n     who is receiving benefits under original Medicare FFS, is not \n     enrolled in an MA plan on such date; and as of such date is \n     not otherwise eligible to elect to enroll in an MA plan. \n     Permissible coverage election changes for an unenrolled \n     individual include: (1) FFS to an MA plan with no drug \n     coverage and (2) FFS with a stand-alone prescription drug \n     plan to an MA plan with the same stand-alone prescription \n     drug plan. As such, this provision effectively permits only \n     MA plans with no drug coverage to enroll individuals \n     throughout the year. MA plans that integrate prescription \n     drug coverage into their benefit packages would be kept under \n     the current law provision, that is, they would not be allowed \n     to enroll individuals throughout the year.\n\n             Title III--Medicare Program Integrity Efforts\n\n\nSection 301. Offsetting adjustment in Medicare Advantage Stabilization \n                                  Fund\n\n     Current law\n       The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 established a stabilization fund to \n     provide incentives for plans to enter into and to remain in \n     the Medicare Advantage regional program. Money in the fund is \n     available to the Secretary for expenditures from January 1, \n     2007 to December 31, 2013. Initially $10 billion is to be \n     provided to the stabilization fund and additional amounts are \n     to be added to the fund from a portion of any average per \n     capita monthly savings amounts. The secretary is responsible \n     for determining the amounts that may be given to MA plans \n     from this fund, based on statutory requirements. For example, \n     the national bonus payment will be available to an MA \n     organization that offers an MA regional plan in every MA \n     region in the year, but only if there was no national plan in \n     the previous year.\n     Explanation of provision\n       This provision would delay the initial availability of the \n     stabilization fund until January 1, 2012, and reduce the \n     amount of the fund to $3.5 billion.\n\n\n   Section 302. Extension and expansion of recovery audit contractor \n              program under the Medicare Integrity Program\n\n       (a) Use of recovery audit contractors\n     Current law\n       The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (PL 108-73) authorized a 3-year \n     demonstration project using recovery audit contractors to \n     identify both under- and overpayments made to Part A and B \n     Medicare providers and recoup overpayments in the Medicare \n     program. The demonstration is being conducted as part of the \n     Medicare Integrity Program, created by section 1893 of the \n     Social Security Act, which enables the Secretary to enter \n     into contracts with entities to carry out a range of \n     activities designed to prevent health care fraud and abuse in \n     Parts A and B of the Medicare program. The Medicare Integrity \n     Program was established by the Health Insurance Portability \n     and Accountability Act of 1996 along with the Health Care \n     Fraud and Abuse Control Program. The program is financed via \n     the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Section 302 would allow the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services (CMS) to continue using recovery audit \n     contractors to identify both under and overpayments made \n     under Medicare Parts A and B and recoup any overpayments made \n     to providers. To pay the contractors, the Secretary would be \n     required to use only those funds recovered by the \n     contractors. From these recoveries, the bill would require \n     the Secretary to pay the contractors in two ways: (1) on a \n     contingent basis for collecting overpayments; and (2) in \n     amounts that the Secretary may specify for identifying \n     underpayments. A portion of the recovered funds would be \n     available to the CMS program management account for \n     activities conducted under the recovery audit contractor \n     program. Any remaining recovered amounts--those recoveries \n     that are not paid to the contractors or applied to the CMS \n     program management account--would be used to reduce \n     expenditures under Medicare Parts A and B. It is also \n     expected that CMS will rectify any identified underpayments. \n     Each contract would be required to provide that audit and \n     recovery activities be conducted during the fiscal year \n     and retrospectively for not more than 4 fiscal years. The \n     Secretary would be allowed to waive Medicare statutory \n     provisions to pay for the services of the recovery audit \n     contractors.\n       By January 1, 2010, the Secretary would be required to \n     contract with enough recovery audit contractors to cover \n     Medicare activities in all states. When awarding contracts, \n     the Secretary would be required to contract only with \n     recovery audit contractors that have the staff with the \n     appropriate clinical knowledge of and experience with \n     Medicare payment rules and regulations, or recovery audit \n     contractors that will contract with another entity that has \n     the staff with the appropriate knowledge of and experience \n     with Medicare payment rules and regulations. The Secretary \n     shall give preference to entities with more than 3 years \n     direct management experience and a demonstrated proficiency \n     in audits with private insurers, health care providers, \n     health plans, state Medicaid programs or Medicare. Recovery \n     audit contractors cannot be fiscal intermediaries, carriers, \n     or Medicare Administrative Contractors, and the recovery of \n     overpayments by these contractors would not prohibit the \n     Secretary or the Attorney General from prosecuting \n     allegations of fraud and abuse arising from these \n     overpayments.\n       Finally, the Secretary would be required to submit a report \n     to Congress annually on the use of these recovery audit \n     contractors. Specifically the report would include \n     information on the performance of these contractors as it \n     relates to identifying over and underpayments and in \n     collecting overpayments. The report would also be required to \n     include an evaluation of the comparative performance of these \n     contractors and any Medicare savings that have accrued as a \n     result of their activities.\n       (b) Access to Coordination of Benefits Contractor database\n     Current law\n       The Coordination of Benefits (COB) Contractor consolidates \n     the activities that support the collection, management, and \n     reporting of other insurance coverage for Medicare \n     beneficiaries. The purposes of the COB program are to \n     identify the health benefits available to a Medicare \n     beneficiary and to coordinate the payment process to prevent \n     mistaken payment of Medicare benefits.\n     Explanation of provision\n       For the purpose of carrying out their audit and recovery \n     activities, the Secretary of\n\n[[Page S11656]]\n\n     HHS would provide recovery audit contractors with access to \n     the database of the Coordination of Benefits Contractors of \n     the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the \n     current fiscal year and for a period of up to 4 fiscal years \n     prior to the current fiscal year.\n       (c) Conforming amendments to current demonstration project\n     Current law\n       Section 306 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, \n     and Modernization Act of 2003 requires that the Secretary's \n     demonstration project using recovery audit contractors last \n     for no longer than 3 years. After the completion of the \n     program, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on \n     the project and its impact on savings to the Medicare \n     program.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision would continue the use of recovery audit \n     contractors under the demonstration until all contracts could \n     be entered into. The provision would also eliminate the \n     requirement that the Secretary submit to Congress a report \n     not later than 6 months after the project's completion on the \n     impact of recovery audit contractors' activities on Medicare \n     savings.\n\n\n   Section 303. Funding for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control \n                                Account\n\n       (a) Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice\n     Current law\n       The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n     1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-91) established section 1128C of the \n     Social Security Act, which authorized the creation of a \n     national health care fraud and abuse control program headed \n     by the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General. In section \n     1817(k) of the Social Security Act, HIPAA created an \n     expenditure account within the Medicare Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse \n     Control (HCFAC) Account. Within the HFCFAC account, the \n     legislation appropriated funds to HHS and DOJ at an amount of \n     $104 million in FY97 and for FY98 through FY03 at annual \n     increases of 15% above the preceding year. For each fiscal \n     year after 2003, the annual appropriation available to HHS \n     and DOJ was to be capped at the FY2003 level of $240.6 \n     million. The legislation also established a separate funding \n     stream within the HCFAC account to support activities \n     undertaken by the FBI. Funding for the FBI was increased from \n     $47 million in FY97 to $114 million in FY03. The legislation \n     capped FBI funding at the FY03 level for FY03 and beyond.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Section 303 would extend appropriations for the Health Care \n     Fraud and Abuse Control Program through FY06 and beyond. For \n     FY98 through FY03, the annual appropriation to HHS and DOJ is \n     the limit for the preceding fiscal year increased by 15%. For \n     fiscal years 2007 through 2010, the annual appropriation \n     would be the limit for the preceding year plus the percentage \n     increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers. \n     For each fiscal year beyond 2010, the legislation would \n     cap the appropriation at the FY10 level.\n       For the Office of the Inspector General of HHS, Section 303 \n     would extend the annual appropriation of $160 million through \n     FY06. For FY07, the bill would increase the FY06 \n     appropriation to OIG by the percentage increase in the \n     consumer price index. For fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, \n     the annual appropriation would increase by the limit for the \n     preceding year plus the percentage increase in the consumer \n     price index for all urban consumers. For each fiscal year \n     after FY10, the legislation would cap the appropriation at \n     the FY10 level.\n       (b) Federal Bureau of Investigations\n     Current law\n       The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n     1996 (HIPAA, P.L. 104-91) established section 1128C of the \n     Social Security Act, which authorized the creation of a \n     national health care fraud and abuse control program headed \n     by the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General. In Section \n     1817(k) of the Social Security Act, HIPAA created an \n     expenditure account within the Medicare Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund called the Health Care Fraud and Abuse \n     Control (HCFAC) Account. Within the HFCFAC account, the \n     legislation appropriated funds to HHS and DOJ at an amount of \n     $104 million in FY97 and for FY98 through FY03 at annual \n     increases of 15% above the preceding year. For each fiscal \n     year after 2003, the annual appropriation available to HHS \n     and DOJ was to be capped at the FY2003 level of $240.6 \n     million. The legislation also established a separate funding \n     stream within the HCFAC account to support activities \n     undertaken by the FBI. Funding for the FBI was increased from \n     $47 million in FY97 to $114 million in FY03. The legislation \n     capped FBI funding at the FY03 level for FY03 and beyond.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Section 303 would extend the annual appropriation to the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). For fiscal years 2007 \n     through 2010, the annual appropriation would be the limit for \n     the preceding year plus the percentage increase in the \n     consumer price index for all urban consumers. For each fiscal \n     year after 2010, the legislation would cap the appropriation \n     at the FY2010 level.\n\n\n                  section 304. implementation funding\n\n     Current law\n       No current law.\n     Explanation of provision\n       For implementation of provisions and amendments made by \n     this title and titles I and II of this division, other than \n     the section requiring the Inspector General in the Department \n     of Health and Human Services to conduct a study of newer \n     events, the provision would require the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services to transfer $45,000,000 to the CMS Program \n     Management Account for FY2007 and FY2008, from the Federal \n     Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Supplementary Medical \n     Insurance Trust, in appropriate proportions.\n\n             Title IV--Medicaid and Other Health Provisions\n\n\n  section 401. extension of transitional medical assistance (tma) and \n                      abstinence education program\n\n     Current law\n       States are required to continue Medicaid benefits for \n     certain low-income families who would otherwise lose coverage \n     because of changes in their income. This continuation is \n     known as transitional medical assistance (TMA). Federal law \n     permanently requires four months of TMA for families who lose \n     Medicaid eligibility due to increased child or spousal \n     support collections, as well as those who lose eligibility \n     due to an increase in earned income or hours of employment. \n     Congress expanded work-related TMA under Section 1925 of the \n     Social Security Act in 1988, requiring states to provide TMA \n     to families who lose Medicaid for work-related reasons for at \n     least six, and up to 12, months. The sunset date for Section \n     1925 has been extended a number of times, most recently \n     through December 31, 2006 by the Deficit Reduction Act of \n     2005.\n       Under Section 510 of the Social Security Act, federal law \n     appropriated $50 million annually for each of the fiscal \n     years 1998-2003 for matching grants to states to provide \n     abstinence education and, at state option, mentoring, \n     counseling, and adult supervision to promote abstinence from \n     sexual activity, with a focus on groups that are most likely \n     to bear children out-of-wedlock. Funds must be requested by \n     states when they apply for Maternal and Child Health Services \n     (MCH) Block Grant funds and must be used exclusively for the \n     teaching of abstinence. States must match every $4 in federal \n     funds with $3 in state funds.\n       A state's allotment of abstinence education block grant \n     program funding is based on the proportion of low-income \n     children in the state as compared to the national total. \n     Funding for the abstinence education block grant has been \n     extended a number of times, most recently through December \n     31, 2006 by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision would extend TMA under Section 1925 of the \n     Social Security Act through June 30, 2007. It would also fund \n     the abstinence education block grant program through June 30, \n     2007 at the level provided through the third quarter of \n     FY2006.\n\n\n    section 402. grants for research on vaccine against valley fever\n\n     Current law\n       Under existing National Institutes of Health (NIH) \n     authority, the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious \n     Diseases has supported projects to study coccidioidomycosis, \n     known as Valley Fever. Grants have included projects to study \n     the organism that causes Valley Fever; to improve the ability \n     to evaluate vaccine candidates; to support the clinical \n     development of potential drug therapies; and to support \n     acquisition of equipment and facilities for research on the \n     disease, among others.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The Secretary is required to conduct research on the \n     development of a vaccine against coccidioidomycosis, known as \n     Valley Fever. Grants may not be made on or after October 1, \n     2012. This does not have any legal effect on payments for \n     grants for which amounts appropriated under this section were \n     obligated prior to October 1, 2012.\n       To carry out this section, $40 million is authorized for \n     fiscal years 2007-2012.\n\n\n section 403. change in threshold for medicaid indirect hold harmless \n               provision of broad-based health care taxes\n\n     Current law\n       Under federal law and regulations, a state's ability to use \n     provider-specific taxes to fund their state share of Medicaid \n     expenditures is limited. If states establish provider \n     specific taxes, those taxes cannot generally exceed 25% of \n     the state (or non-federal) share of Medicaid expenditures and \n     the state cannot provide a guarantee to the providers that \n     the taxes will be returned to them. However, there is what is \n     referred to as a ``safe harbor.'' If the taxes returned to a \n     provider are less than 6% of the provider's revenues, the \n     prohibition on guaranteeing the return of tax funds is not \n     violated. Those taxes do not have to undergo the process, \n     defined in section 433.68 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations, of determining if a guarantee exists. The \n     President's FY2006 budget proposes to phase the 6% ``safe \n     harbor'' for provider taxes down to 3% although no new \n     regulation has been issued on this subject to date.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Beginning on the date of enactment, the provider tax ``safe \n     harbor'' upper limit is codified at 6%. For the fiscal \n     periods beginning on or after January 1, 2008 and ending \n     before October 1, 2011, the ``safe harbor'' percentage will \n     be reduced from 6% to 5.5%.\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\n     After October 1, 2011, the provider tax ``safe harbor'' \n     percentage will return to 6%.\n\n\n  section 404. dsh allotments for fiscal year 2007 for tennessee and \n                                 hawaii\n\n       (A) Tennessee\n     Current law\n       Tennessee operates its Medicaid program under a \n     comprehensive statewide waiver, the terms and conditions of \n     which have been negotiated by the state and CMS. Medicaid \n     demonstration waivers, authorized under Section 1115 of the \n     Social Security Act, allow states a great deal of flexibility \n     on how eligibility for Medicaid is determined, how Medicaid \n     services are provided, and what those services are comprised \n     of. States operating under a waiver are subject to a budget \n     neutrality requirement intended to hold program spending \n     under the waiver to estimates of amounts that would have been \n     spent in the absence of the waiver. Because Tennessee \n     receives its Medicaid funds under the provisions of the \n     waiver, it does not receive federal matching for Medicaid \n     payments to disproportionate share (DSH) hospitals nor do \n     they receive an allotment for DSH payments (state by state \n     allotments are calculated based on a formula in Medicaid law \n     and represent a federal cap on the amount that the federal \n     government will provide in DSH matching payments to any \n     state.) DSH payments, however, continue to be counted as a \n     component in Tennessee's budget neutrality calculation since, \n     in the period prior to the waiver approval, the state was \n     required to make DSH payments, and if the waiver had not been \n     granted, the requirement to make those payments would \n     continue to have applied.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision would establish a DSH allotment for the state \n     of Tennessee for fiscal year 2007 equal to the greater of the \n     amount that is reflected in the budget neutrality provision \n     for the TennCare demonstration year ending in 2006 and $280 \n     million. Federal matching payments to the state for DSH \n     hospitals for fiscal year 2007 would, however, be limited to \n     one-third of the DSH allotment. Those amounts would be \n     considered TennCare project expenditures and would be \n     subtracted from TennCare demonstration payments for Essential \n     Access Hospital supplemental pool payments. The sum of the \n     DSH payments and the Essential Access Hospital supplemental \n     pool payments would be prohibited from exceeding the \n     allotment amount. The state would be permitted to submit a \n     state plan amendment describing the methodology to be used to \n     identify DSH hospitals and to make payments to such \n     hospitals. However, the Secretary may not approve the plan \n     amendment unless the methodology is consistent with the \n     requirements under Section 1923 of the Medicaid Act for \n     making payment adjustments for DSH hospitals.\n       (B) Hawaii\n     Current law\n       Like Tennessee, Hawaii operates its Medicaid program under \n     a statewide waiver, the terms and conditions of which have \n     been negotiated by the state and CMS. The state does not make \n     DSH payment under their waiver program and does not have a \n     DSH allotment in Medicaid law.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision would set a DSH allotment for Hawaii for \n     fiscal year 2007 at $10 million. The Secretary shall permit \n     Hawaii to submit an amendment to its State plan under this \n     title that describes the methodology to be used by the State \n     to identify and make payments to disproportionate share \n     hospitals, including children's hospitals and institutions \n     for mental diseases or other mental health facilities. The \n     Secretary may not approve such plan amendment unless the \n     methodology described in the amendment is consistent with the \n     requirements under this section for making payment \n     adjustments to disproportionate share hospitals.\n\n\n        section 405. certain medicaid dra technical corrections\n\n       (a) Technical corrections relating to state option for \n           alternative premiums and cost sharing (sections 6041 \n           through 6043)\n     Current law\n       P.L. 109-171 allows states to impose premiums and cost-\n     sharing for any group of individuals for any type of service \n     (except prescribed drugs which are treated separately), \n     through Medicaid state plan amendments (rather than waivers), \n     subject to specific restrictions. Preferred drugs are defined \n     as those that are the least (or less) costly effective \n     prescription drugs within a class of drugs (as defined by the \n     state). Premium and cost-sharing rules for workers with \n     disabilities were not changed in P.L. 109-171.\n       Individuals in families with income below 100% of the \n     federal poverty line (FPL). Premiums and service-related \n     cost-sharing imposed under this option are allowed to vary \n     among classes or groups of individuals, or types of service. \n     Explicit rules are provided by income level for those with \n     income between 100-150% FPL and for those with income over \n     150% FPL.\n       States are allowed to condition the provision of medical \n     assistance on the payment of premiums, and to terminate \n     Medicaid eligibility on the basis of failure to pay a premium \n     if that failure continues for at least 60 days. States may \n     apply this provision to some or all groups of beneficiaries, \n     and may waive premium payments in cases where such payments \n     would be an undue hardship. In addition, the provision allows \n     states to permit providers participating in Medicaid to \n     require a Medicaid beneficiary to pay authorized cost-sharing \n     as a condition of receiving care or services. Providers may \n     be allowed to reduce or waive cost-sharing amounts on a case-\n     by-case basis.\n       For the purposes of cost-sharing, two income-related groups \n     are identified: (1) individuals in families with income \n     between 100 and 150% FPL, and (2) individuals in families \n     with income over 150% FPL. For both groups, the total \n     aggregate amount of all cost-sharing (including special cost \n     sharing rules for prescribed drugs and emergency room \n     copayments for non-emergency care) cannot exceed 5% of family \n     income as applied on a quarterly or monthly basis as \n     specified by the state.\n       Treatment of non-preferred drug cost-sharing. Special cost-\n     sharing for prescribed drugs is subject to the general 5% \n     aggregate cap on cost-sharing for individuals with income \n     between 100-150% FPL and for individuals with income over \n     150% FPL who are not otherwise exempt from service-related \n     cost-sharing.\n       Treatment of non-emergency cost-sharing. Individuals exempt \n     from premiums or service-related cost-sharing under other \n     provisions of P.L. 109-171 may be subject to nominal \n     copayments for non-emergency services in an ER, only when no \n     cost-sharing is imposed for care in hospital outpatient \n     departments or by other alternative providers in the area \n     served by the hospital ER. For non-exempt populations with \n     income between 100-150% FPL, cost-sharing for non-emergency \n     services in an ER cannot exceed twice the nominal amounts. \n     For non-exempt populations with income exceeding 150% FPL, no \n     cost-sharing limit is specified for non-emergency care in an \n     ER. Aggregate caps on cost-sharing (described above) still \n     apply.\n       Definition of non-emergency services. The term ``non-\n     emergency services'' means any care or services furnished in \n     an emergency department of a hospital that the physician \n     determines do not constitute an appropriate medical screening \n     examination or stabilizing examination and treatment required \n     to be provided by the hospital under Medicare law (Section \n     1867 of the Social Security Act).\n       Exemption from cost-sharing for newly eligible children \n     with disabilities. Section 6062 of P.L. 109-171 created a new \n     optional Medicaid eligibility group for children with \n     disabilities under age 19 who meet the severity of disability \n     required under the Supplemental Security Income program (SSI) \n     without regard to any income or asset eligibility \n     requirements applicable under SSI for children, and whose \n     family income does not exceed 300% FPL. (States can exceed \n     300% FPL, without federal matching funds for such coverage.) \n     Special premium and cost-sharing rules apply to this new \n     group of eligibles.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The definition of preferred drugs would be amended to \n     include those that are the most (or more) cost effective \n     prescription drugs within a class of drugs (as defined by \n     the state). In addition to separate cost-sharing \n     provisions for prescribed drugs, the amendment would \n     clarify that separate cost-sharing provisions also apply \n     to non-emergency services provided in an emergency room.\n       Individuals in families with income below 100% of the \n     federal poverty line (FPL). The provision would exempt from \n     the general cost-sharing rules in new Section 1916A (a) all \n     individuals in families with income below 100% of the federal \n     poverty line (FPL). However, Section 1916 of Title XIX \n     (nominal cost-sharing provisions) would still apply to this \n     income group, as would the comparability rule regarding \n     amount, duration and scope of available benefits (Section \n     1902(a)(10)(B)). States would still have the option to impose \n     the special cost-sharing rules for prescribed drugs and \n     nonemergency care provided in an emergency room to \n     individuals in families with income below 100% FPL.\n       The provision would exempt individuals in families with \n     income below 100% FPL from the provisions defining \n     enforceability of premiums and other cost-sharing. \n     Protections regarding payment of premiums and cost-sharing in \n     Section 1916(c)(3) and Section 1916(e) would continue to \n     apply to this income group.\n       The provision would apply the total aggregate cap of 5% of \n     family income to individuals in families with income below \n     100% FPL for applicable cost-sharing with respect to nominal \n     amounts (as defined in Section 1916), and prescribed drugs \n     and emergency room copayments for non-emergency care (as \n     defined in new Sections 1916A(c) and 1916A(e)).\n       Treatment of non-preferred drug cost-sharing. The \n     definition of preferred drugs would be amended to include \n     those that are the most (or more) cost effective prescription \n     drugs within a class of drugs (as defined by the state). In \n     addition to separate cost-sharing provisions for prescribed \n     drugs, the provision would clarify that separate cost-sharing \n     provisions also apply to non-emergency services provided in \n     an emergency room. The provision would clarify that no cost-\n     sharing for preferred drugs can be imposed on individuals \n     exempt from service-related cost-sharing under the general \n     cost-sharing provisions (identified in new Section 1916A(a)). \n     It would also clarify that no more than nominal cost-sharing \n     amounts may be imposed for non-preferred drugs on individuals \n     exempt from services-related cost-sharing under the general \n     cost-sharing provisions.\n       Treatment of non-emergency cost-sharing. The provision \n     would clarify that for non-exempt persons with income between \n     100-150%\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\n     FPL, cost-sharing for non-emergency care in an ER may not \n     exceed twice the applicable nominal amount (up to the 5% \n     aggregate cap). For persons with income below 100% FPL or who \n     are exempt from service-related cost-sharing, cost-sharing \n     for non-emergency care in an ER may not exceed the applicable \n     nominal amount when no cost-sharing is imposed by the \n     outpatient department or alternative providers. The 5% \n     aggregate cap on all service-related costsharing for all \n     income groups remains in effect.\n       Definition of non-emergency services. The provision would \n     strike the phrase ``the physician determines'' from the \n     definition of non-emergency services as provided in P.L. 109-\n     171.\n       Exemption from cost-sharing for newly eligible children \n     with disabilities. The provision would exempt this new \n     optional eligibility group for children with disabilities \n     established under P.L. 109-171 from the premium and service-\n     related cost-sharing rules under new Section 1916A.\n       Correction of IV-B References. Among the groups explicitly \n     exempted from the general cost-sharing provisions for \n     premiums and cost-sharing, the provision would change \n     references to Title IV-B to mean child welfare services made \n     available under Title IV-B on the basis of being a child in \n     foster care.\n       Effective Date. The provision specifies that all changes \n     made are effective as if included in the affected sections \n     and subsections of P.L. 109-171.\n       (b) Clarifying treatment of certain annuities (section \n           6012)\n     Current law\n       Under Section 6012(b) of P.L. 109-171, the purchase of an \n     annuity is treated as a disposal of an asset for less than \n     fair market value unless certain criteria are met. One of \n     these criteria is that the state be named as the remainder \n     beneficiary in the first position for at least the total \n     amount of Medicaid expenditures paid on behalf of the \n     annuitant or be named in the second position after the \n     community spouse or minor or disabled child and such spouse \n     or a representative of such child does not dispose of any \n     such remainder for less than fair market value.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision would strike the term ``annuitant'' and \n     replace it with ``institutionalized individual.'' This change \n     would become effective as if it had been included in DRA \n     2005, enacted on February 8, 2006.\n       (c) Additional miscellaneous technical corrections\n       (1) Documentation (section 6036)\n     Current law\n       Under Section 6036 of P.L. 109-171, states are prohibited \n     from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursement for an \n     individual who has not provided satisfactory documentary \n     evidence of citizenship or nationality. Documents that \n     provide satisfactory evidence are described in the law, as \n     are exceptions to the documentation requirement.\n       Section 6036(a)(2) of the law specifies that the \n     documentation requirements do not apply to an alien who is \n     eligible for Medicaid: and is entitled to or enrolled for \n     Medicare benefits; on the basis of receiving Supplemental \n     Security Income (SSI) benefits; or on such other basis as the \n     Secretary may specify that satisfactory documentary evidence \n     had been previously presented.\n       The provision applies to initial determinations and to \n     redeterminations of eligibility for Medicaid made on or after \n     July 1, 2006.\n     Explanation of provision\n       The provision would specify that the documentation \n     requirements do not apply to an individual declaring to be a \n     citizen or national of the United States who is eligible for \n     Medicaid: and is entitled to or enrolled for Medicare \n     benefits; and is receiving (1) Social Security benefits on \n     the basis of a disability or (2) SSI benefits; and with \n     respect to whom (1) child welfare services are made available \n     under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act or (2) adoption \n     or foster care assistance is made available under Title IV-E; \n     or on such basis as the Secretary may specify that \n     satisfactory documentary evidence has been previously \n     presented.\n       The provision would also make reference corrections. These \n     changes would be effective as if included in the Deficit \n     Reduction Act of 2005.\n       In addition, effective 6 months after enactment, the \n     provision would (1) require states to have procedures in \n     effect for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of \n     children in foster care under the responsibility of the state \n     under Title IV-E or IV-B of the Social Security Act and (2) \n     specify that in reviews of state programs under IV-E and IV-\n     B, the requirements subject to review shall include \n     determining whether the state program is in conformity with \n     the requirement to verify citizenship or immigration status.\n       (2) Miscellaneous technical corrections\n     Current law\n       Section 5114(a)(2). This P.L. 109-171 provision modified \n     the first sentence of Section 1842(b)(6)(F) of the Social \n     Security Act to add a new paragraph H to 1842(b)(6) so that a \n     federally qualified health center (FQHC) would be paid \n     directly for FQHC services provided by a health care \n     professional under contract with that FQHC.\n       Section 6003(b)(2). This P.L. 109-171 provision modified \n     Section 1927 of the Social Security Act by referencing \n     subsection (k) relating to Section 505(c) drugs.\n       Section 6031(b), 6032(b), and 6035(c). These sections \n     referenced Section 6035(e) of P.L. 109-171, which does not \n     exist, to provide exceptions to effective dates.\n       Section 6034(b). Section 6034 of P.L. 109-171 establishes \n     the Medicaid Integrity Program. It references modifications \n     made to the Social Security Act by Section 6033(a).\n       Section 6036(b). Section 6036 of P.L. 109-171 deals with \n     improved enforcement of documentation requirements. Section \n     6036(b) references Section 1903(z) of the Social Security \n     Act. This section does not exist.\n       Section 6015(a)(1). Section 6015 of P.L. 109-171 pertains \n     to continuing care retirement community admissions contracts. \n     It makes reference to clause (v) of Section \n     1919(c)(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Social Security Act.\n     Explanation of provision\n       Section 5114(a)(2). Instead of modifying Section \n     1842(b)(6)(F) to add paragraph H, the amendment would modify \n     Section 1842(b)(6) of the Social Security Act.\n       Section 6003(b)(2). Instead of referencing subsection (k) \n     of Section 1927 of the Social Security Act, the amendment \n     would reference subsection (k)(1).\n       Section 6031(b), 6032(b), and 6035(c). Instead of \n     referencing Section 6035(e), the amendment would reference \n     the effective date exception in Section 6034(e) of P.L. 109-\n     171.\n       Section 6034(b). Instead of referencing modifications made \n     by Section 6033(a) of P.L. 109-171, the amendment would \n     reference Section 6032(a).\n       Section 6036(b).

I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gregg be recognized \nin\n\n[[Page S11659]]\n\norder to make a point of order against the pending legislation; \nprovided that Senator Grassley then be recognized in order to move to \nwaive and that there then be 30 minutes equally divided, with the first \n15 minutes by Senator Grassley and the next 15 minutes by Senator \nGregg, for debate, equally divided in the usual form; provided further \nthat following that debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the motion \nto waive and that if the motion to waive prevails, the Senate then \nproceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture, notwithstanding the \nprovisions of rule XXII; I further ask that if cloture is invoked, the \nmotion to concur with an amendment be withdrawn and the Senate proceed \nimmediately to a vote on the motion to concur in the amendment of the \nHouse, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what we have just done is laid out a \nprocedure whereby a point of order will be made. Senator Grassley will \nmake a motion to waive. We will have a vote on the motion to waive the \npoint of order, a cloture vote, and ultimately passage. There will be \nthree votes. The first vote will be at approximately 12:30, 12:35.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time, under the unanimous consent \nagreement, I will make my point of order.\n  The pending bill violates three significant elements of the Budget \nAct. After I make the point of order, I know the Senator from Iowa, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, is going to move to waive it. And \nthen he has 15 minutes and then I will have 15 minutes and we will \nexplain the reasons for the issue.\n  So at this time, I make the following point of order.\n  The pending motion to concur violates section 302 and section 311 of \nthe Budget Act because it exceeds the Finance Committee allocation and \nbreaches the revenue floor set under the fiscal year 2006 budget \nresolution. It would also increase the deficit in excess of the pay-go \nlimit by $17.5 billion. I raise a point of order against the motion \nunder section 302 and 311 of the Budget Act and section 505 of the \nbudget resolution for fiscal year 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to waive the budget point of \norder on the appropriate sections of this pending legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered under \nthe unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. GREGG. If they have not been ordered under the unanimous consent \nagreement, I would ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes of debate on the motion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa, I understand, has \nthe first 15 minutes. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that the time now running is running against the time of \nthe Senator from Iowa; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the first 15 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want my colleagues to understand that \nif this budget point of order is not waived, this legislation that we \nhave been working on for a period of 8 months, and should have been \npassed in July--probably should have been passed in May, but for sure \nin July, and here we are still doing it--will not be passed.\n  I want to comment on why, without hearing my colleague yet--and going \nbefore him, but anticipating from some statements that have been in the \npress--why he is wrong about his point of order against this \nlegislation.\n  Earlier today, there were comments made by my Republican colleague \nregarding the tax extenders bill. I would like to take a few minutes to \nclarify the record regarding the tax extenders bill.\n  Three points:\n  First is the claim that tax cuts are a budget buster, that it is tax \ncuts that are putting us in the red. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. We have seen tax receipts going up by a record amount. From 2004 \nto 2005, receipts went from $1.8 trillion to $2.1 trillion. The \ncalculators at the Treasury needed new batteries to count the new \ndollars coming in this year, increasing from $2.1 trillion to $2.4 \ntrillion--an 11.8-percent increase. These tax receipts far outpace what \nwas projected in the budget, and, most importantly, the budget \nresolution we are currently operating under.\n  The bottom line: Taxpayers are sending checks to the Treasury well \nover $100 billion in excess of what was expected under the budget \nresolution. We are now taking action to prevent what is effectively a \ntax increase. I never thought I would hear a Republican advocating we \nought to have a tax increase. If we do not pass this legislation, 19 \nmillion people are going to have tax increases.\n  And let my colleagues absolutely be clear in understanding that \nfailure to pass this legislation, then, is not just about nothing, it \nis about allowing tax increases to go into effect. And they would go \ninto effect without even a vote of the Congress. Taxpayers, then, \nwill be writing checks even bigger than this unexpected amount of money \nthat is coming into the Treasury already, if this legislation does not \npass. Teachers, parents of college students, working families will all \nhave to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for out-of-control \nspending in Washington.\n\n  Taxes are pouring into the Treasury. As I said earlier, it is not for \nthe lack of tax receipts that we are seeing a deficit. It is because of \nthe inability to control spending. In my time here in Washington, DC, I \nhave never seen that the way to control spending is to keep taxes high. \nHigher taxes is a license to spend more money. And that is borne out by \nthe facts. While tax receipts have gone up 11.8 percent in 2005-2006, \nspending has increased 8.6 percent.\n  It is important for my colleagues to also understand that much of the \ntax cuts that are in the tax extender package were expected to be \nincluded in the $70 billion tax cuts passed in the budget resolution--\nthe budget resolution out of the Budget Committee.\n  I find it extremely frustrating that those who come to the floor and \ndecry this bill fail to note it is because we made room for other \npriorities, priorities they championed, such as capital gains and \ndividend cuts in the tax reconciliation bill, that we were unable to \ninclude the tax extender provisions in that reconciliation bill last \nspring. And it is for that reason that we now have to consider an \nextender bill.\n  It reminds me of the fellow who complains about not being able to get \na BLT sandwich after he ate all the bacon. And speaking of bacon, one \nof the major pork products, I would now like to turn to the second \npoint: the discussion on the floor earlier about earmarks.\n  I know my colleagues who serve on the Appropriations Committee have \nfamiliarity with the term ``earmark.'' Earmark is something that goes \nto one individual or one company. That is not what this bill is about. \nBut they have tried to characterize it that way. This bill provides tax \nrelief, and these provisions provide tax relief that is not for one \nindividual or one company. They are not earmarks.\n  For example, the deduction for tuition will help--let me take a State \nat random. Let's take New Hampshire as an example. It helped 23,124 \ntaxpayers in the year 2004. These tax policies, then, are not earmarks \nwhen you are helping 23,000 taxpayers in New Hampshire. And failure to \nextend the tax extenders means that these taxpayers are going to have \nan increase in taxes.\n  Earlier we heard on the Senate floor discussion about a tax provision \nthat benefited songwriters. Again, this is not an earmark. As most \nMembers who have been to a record store recently are aware, there is \nmore than one songwriter in this country. But I raise the songwriter \nprovision to respond to another point, which is that there are \nprovisions in this bill that because of the Senate rules, Members will \nbe prevented from effectively raising concerns.\n\n[[Page S11660]]\n\n  The songwriter provision, supported by several Members on both sides \nof the aisle, was voted on by Members earlier this year in the tax \nreconciliation bill. It already passed the Senate. The extenders bill \nis now making that provision permanent. Members had ample opportunity \nto raise concerns about this provision when it was considered 6 months \nago. Not a discouraging note was heard. In fact, colleagues who \ndiscussed this provision earlier today actually voted for the \nlegislation that contained the songwriter provision. Talk about saying \none thing and doing another. So I think those who sang the first verse \nearlier in the year should be cautious about complaining that we are \nnow singing the second verse.\n  Finally, I want to comment about the point raised on the sales tax \ndeduction. Again, you call that an earmark, when people in nine States \nwho would not be able to deduct their State sales tax from their \nFederal income tax have the opportunity to do it? It is affecting 10 \nmillion people, and that is an earmark? I find the statements made \nabout the sales tax to be of concern and a misrepresentation of policy.\n  First, my colleagues earlier heard complaints about the cost of the \nsales tax provision but then in the same breath complain that the sales \ntax provision does not cost enough, that the sales tax provision's flaw \nis it should be expanded to both itemizers and nonitemizers, which then \nwould cost billions more.\n  The easy answer is that the intent is to roughly mirror the deduction \nfor State income tax that residents of the rest of the States have. The \nState income tax deduction is only for itemizers. So why would you want \nthe sales tax deduction to be expanded to include nonitemizers?\n  Second, the deduction for sales tax is only allowed in lieu of a \ndeduction for the income tax. So the benefits that it provides to \nresidents of States such as New York and California, who have both a \nState income tax and sales tax, is limited. But it does certainly \nprovide real benefits to taxpayers who live in States without a State \nincome tax but do have a State sales tax.\n  The provision means that the Federal Tax Code will not treat \nsimilarly situated taxpayers differently based on how the State decides \nto raise revenue. The Finance Committee has seen no evidence that \nStates have responded to this provision by raising the sales tax.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to clear the record and separate facts \nfrom fantasy when it comes to this tax extender bill. These are \nimportant provisions that we need to act on now to ensure that \ntaxpayers can properly file their tax returns and receive much-needed \ntax relief.\n  Finally, the Congressional Budget Office has scored the total health \npackage as costing $1.7 billion over 5 years. The $1.7 billion stems \nfrom the cost the Congressional Budget Office has attributed to making \nthe Recovery Audit Contractor Demonstration a permanent part of the \nMedicare Program and implementing it on a nationwide basis.\n  The 3-year demonstration project was authorized in the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Act of 3 years ago and requires the Center for \nMedicare Services to contract with the recovery audit contractors to \ndetect Medicare overpayments and underpayments and to recoup \noverpayments. Typical overpayments involve improper coding or billing \nfor services for which there is no medical necessity. Also, Medicare \ninadvertently pays for services when another payer, such as a worker's \ncomp or auto insurance, should be a primary payer.\n  Despite being implemented for a limited time in three States, this \ndemonstration has already shown enormous potential for the \nidentification of overpayments and underpayments and the recoupment of \noverpayments. In fiscal year 2006, this demonstration identified around \n$300 million in improper payments in three States. It is estimated that \nimplementing this program on a permanent basis nationwide would result \nin approximately $8 billion in recovered funds being returned to the \nMedicare trust funds over 5 years. And somebody is bellyaching about \ninvesting $1.7 billion to bring back $8 billion.\n  CBO has assigned a cost to this provision because of a budget scoring \nrule--some scoring rule that somebody ought to do something about--\ncalled rule 14, which says that ``no increase in receipts or decrease \nin direct spending will be scored as a result of provision of a law \nthat provides direct spending for the administration or program \nmanagement activities.'' As a result, even though they are real and \nsubstantial, savings from this program will not be recognized for \nbudget purposes.\n  Despite the potential of a budget point of order, we have included \nthis provision in the package because it is simply good policy. It will \nrecover billions that would otherwise be wasted in the Medicare \nProgram--some of it fraudulently wasted. For all these years, Medicare \nhas not been able to effectively detect payment errors. The nationwide \nadoption of this program will result in real savings for the Medicare \nProgram and, ultimately, the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk briefly about the issue of Red Cross \nreform. The Red Cross is one of the great institutions in this country. \nIt is supported by millions of Americans with their volunteer work and \ncontributions. Americans have a right to expect the best from this \nproud organization.\n  On Monday, I shared with leadership staff on both sides of the aisle \nas well as interested members copies of legislation that brings much \nneeded reform to the governance of the Red Cross. The Red Cross is \ncongressionally chartered and therefore any reforms to the governance \nrequire changes in statute.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been active in oversight of the \nRed Cross since problems came to light with the organization after the \ntragedy of 9/11. However, it was after the Katrina hurricane that it \nbecame evident that fundamental change was needed in how the \norganization was managed and governed.\n  In response to my oversight, the Chairman of the Board Ms. Bonnie \nMcElveen-Hunter called for an Independent Governance Advisory Board. I \nthank her for her leadership and responsiveness to the concerns raised.\n  This board recently issued its report ``American Red Cross Governance \nfor the 21st Century'' which can be found on their website. This report \nis based on the fine work of its Chair, Karen Hastie Williams as well \nas Peter Clapman, Professor Charles Elson, Margaret Foran, Professor \nJay W. Lorsch, Patricia McGuire and Professor Paul Neuhauser. I thank \nthem all for their service.\n  The legislation that I shared with colleagues on Monday is based on \nthe findings of the report from the Independent Governance Advisory \nBoard which was approved by the Red Cross Board of Governors and \nreleased to the public on October 30, 2006.\n  The legislation deals with such vital issues as the size and role of \nthe board; the characteristics of who should serve on the board; the \nrole of cabinet members in Red Cross governance; the creation of an \nombudsman; the responsibilities of the Government Accountability Office \nand many other important matters.\n  However, while the statutory changes are important, much of the hard \nwork of changing the culture and governance of the Red Cross will have \nto be done by the management and board of the Red Cross. I expect them \nto look to the findings of the report as a close guide for their \nactions on the details.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation, which has the support of the Red \nCross, can be passed by unanimous consent quickly so that we can have \nin place a Red Cross that has effective and modern leadership for this \nNation.\n  However, I am deeply discouraged that despite the fact that this \nlegislation has been cleared for several days on the Republican side it \nstill has not been cleared on the Democratic side, and this despite the \nfact that the legislation has been originally cosponsored by Democrat \nSenators Kennedy, Landrieu and Akaka as well as Senators on this side \nof the aisle, Santorum, Enzi, Isakson, Martinez and Dole. As my \ncolleagues all know, Senator Dole was the former President of the Red \nCross. I am pleased to have all their support.\n  But I am very frustrated that I have received no response or \ncourtesies from the Democrat leadership of why this commonsense and \nneeded legislation cannot be passed.\n\n[[Page S11661]]\n\n  I have been informed that staff in the other body have stated to Red \nCross officials that they do not want to pass this legislation because \nthey want it to be an early victory for the new Congressional \nleadership. I do not want to believe that that is the reason why there \nis no action on these reforms.\n  The failure to act on these reforms is having a very real and very \nnegative impact on the vital work of the Red Cross. I met with the \nChairman of the Board of the Red Cross just two days ago and she \ninformed me that the failure to pass this legislation quickly is \nhurting their efforts to successfully recruit and bring into place a \nnew CEO. In addition, the needed changes to the governance structure at \nthe Red Cross are also frustrated by the failure to make the necessary \nstatutory changes.\n  We saw with Katrina the need for strong leadership and governance at \nthe Red Cross. The Red Cross has taken the right steps to make reforms, \nreforms that will lead to better service for the American people in \ntimes of need. The Democrat leadership should be placing those same \npriorities first. I call on them to allow us to go forward with passing \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in connection with H.R. 6111, the Tax \nRelief and Health Care Act of 2006, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation has made available to the public the following document: Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, Technical Explanation of HR. 6408, The ``Tax \nRelief and Health Care Act of 2006,'' as Introduced in the House on \nDecember 7, 2006--(JCX-50-06)--December 7, 2006. This technical \nexplanation expresses the Senate Finance Committee's understanding of \nthe tax and other provisions of the bill and serves as a useful \nreference in understanding the legislative intent behind this important \nlegislation.\n  Senator Domenici wants a few minutes. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator can have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise tonight to remind the Senate that \nin this bill is something we can all be proud of, especially on this \ncold night. The American people are using more and more natural gas in \ntheir homes, and they will soon be getting bills--or they already \nhave--with the increases in the cost of natural gas beginning to show \nup. Many companies have already closed their doors because natural gas \nprices are so high.\n  For the first time, we will have passed a production-oriented bill \nwith reference to natural gas and crude oil. In this bill is the Gulf \nof Mexico Energy Security Act--passed by bipartisan votes in the \nSenate--which establishes some precedent because, for the first time, \nwe are now going to do some deepwater drilling. We held that in \nabeyance for about 25 years and acted as if we didn't need any, just \nleave it there. It is American, but we won't use it.\n  Well, we are going to start now. That will open other States which \ncan look at this bill and say: We ought to join up and begin to let \ndrilling take place off of our coast, because they will share in the \nproceeds--the second good precedent that is made in this bill.\n  It will produce large quantities of natural gas over the next decade \nand a small amount of crude oil--1.2 billion barrels. With reference to \nnatural gas, it will produce gas for millions of homes and thousands \nupon thousands of businesses. It will be American-owned business, \ndrilled by American companies, supplied to Americans by Americans, with \nAmerican dollars involved for everybody along the way.\n  What a good thing to say tonight in the cold parts of America and in \nthe coldness of tonight--that we have done something to produce natural \ngas and hold the price of natural gas where it is or reduce it because \nof the new supply. It is very important and should be something \neverybody in this Chamber is proud of. A lot of things we are not so \nproud of tonight. It takes too long to get some things done. We have \nnot gotten a lot of them done on time. We have not governed quite \nproperly. But this is a good one. I am thankful to those on this \nconference for putting it in.\n  I thank Senator Grassley, and I thank his counterpart here. On the \nHouse side, they had to accept it exactly as we put it in because if it \ncame here differently, we would never get it passed. That happened. \nThank you.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will give 4 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me join my colleague from New Mexico \nin thanking the leaders of this bill, Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus, for their acquiescence to put this very important measure, \nwhich over 70 Senators voted earlier in the year to do, but to put it \non this measure to make sure it passed.\n  Mr. President, you have not been in this Chamber long, but you know \nthis has been a debate which has gone on around Louisiana and the gulf \ncoast for almost 60 years--literally since President Truman was \nPresident of this country and offered 37.5 percent to the State of \nLouisiana for a new industry. Well, that deal was never struck 60 years \nago. Tonight, that arrangement, that compromise, that deal is being \nstruck in the Senate. It is a good deal, a square deal for the people \nof Louisiana, Mississippi, the gulf coast, and the people of the United \nStates, and it is going to open up 8.3 million acres of new \nopportunity--enough gas, as the Senator from New Mexico said, to fuel \n1,000 chemical plants for 40 years. That is a lot of gas. We need that. \nWe need it right now. We need it today to preserve jobs in America and \nto keep our industries competitive. Those jobs are in every State in \nthe Union, not just on the gulf coast. We are proud to be the \nproducers, but people use this gas in industries all over the Nation.\n  In addition, as you know--and the Senator from New Mexico has heard \nthis story literally a hundred times--the great delta that supports \nthis extraordinary resource for the Nation is literally washing away \ninto the Gulf of Mexico, not just because of the channels that have \nbeen dug in some cases for the industry--that has had a minor impact--\nbut the damming of the Mississippi River, the leveeing of that river \nstopped its natural overflow, and a delta that took a thousand years or \nmore to create, which is the home of hundreds of communities and \nliterally tens of millions of people in this country, is at risk.\n  We saw the pain, suffering, and the death in Katrina and Rita. This \nbill will help because that money is dedicated to that source.\n  Finally, because of Senator Salazar and Senator Alexander, primarily, \na portion has been set aside for the first time in the Nation for \nconservation royalty, so that the land and water conservation fund \nstateside is fully funded. All 50 States can use these great revenues \nwhich come in for parts of the greenspace.\n  I thank Senators Martinez and Nelson from Florida. Without their help \nand patience, this bill never could have come together. The buffer of \nprotection has been provided for Florida. They have chosen a different \nway, but the gulf coast is working together as a unit. Some of us are \ndrilling, some are not, but we are all working toward the benefit of \nAmerica.\n  To all of the Senators along the gulf coast, including Senator Vitter \nfrom Louisiana, and particularly Senator Trent Lott, who put in \ncountless hours to help us negotiate this bill, I thank him for his \ngreat and steady leadership.\n  To Senator Frist and Senator McConnell, who kept this issue steady, \nit is really a testament to their leadership.\n  So the people of Louisiana and the gulf coast are grateful that this \nprovision is in the final package. It has been a long and tough battle \nbut one of which we are very proud.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for yielding.\n\n\n                          capital gains income\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a tax policy \nmatter that is important to several Senators. Although it is not a \npriority for me, I pursued the issue for those Senators during the \n``trailer'' bill negotiations. On my side of the aisle, the interested \nSenators included Senators Smith, Lott, Cornyn, Dole, Graham, and \nVitter. I know Senators on the other side of the aisle have similar \ninterests, including Senators Lincoln, Pryor, Landrieu, Cantwell, and \nMurray.\n\n[[Page S11662]]\n\n  Under current law, the tax treatment of capital gain income from \ntimber activities varies. The variance depends to a great degree on the \nform of the business entity that holds the timber. The top individual \ncapital gain rate of 15 percent applies to capital gain from timber if \nthe timber is held by pass-through entities. By contrast, capital gains \nfrom timber held by regular ``C'' corporations are taxed at the top \ncorporate rate of 35 percent.\n  Senators Smith and Lincoln filed an amendment for the Finance \nCommittee reconciliation tax relief markup last year. The amendment \naimed at addressing the differential treatment of timber capital gains \namong entities. A form of that amendment was included in the first \nround of negotiations on the trailer bill. The final form of the \ntrailer bill agreement did not include the timber capital gains \namendment.\n  Since this issue was not fully resolved, and many Members remain \nstrongly interested in the issue I would like to ask my friend, the \nranking Democrat and incoming chairman, Senator Baucus, if he plans to \nfurther examine the issue in the next Congress.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the timber tax proposal has the support of \nsome Senators, but it is not included in the Tax Relief and Health Care \nAct of 2006. I have concerns about the proposal. I am sympathetic with \nthe basic policy concern motivating the bill's supporters--to make it \nmore feasible for timber companies to remain in corporate form if that \nis the best way for them to maintain their competitiveness. However, I \nbelieve that we need to do further work to make sure that we have an \nappropriate long-term solution.\n  I understand this may be a time-sensitive issue. As chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee during the next Congress, I plan to work with \ninterested Senators and with forest products companies to closely \nexamine this issue and determine the appropriate long-term solution. It \nis my hope and expectation that this work can be concluded in a timely \nmanner so that appropriate action can be taken to address the long-term \ncompetitiveness of the timber industry.\n\n\n                                 haiti\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Haiti Hope Act, incorporated into the package that we \nare debating today, poses a serious threat to the American textile \nindustry. This bill has had no hearings in the Senate, no opportunity \nfor discussion, no opportunities for amendments, and the industry that \nthis bill affects most has had no official opportunities to voice their \nconcerns. While it is questionable as to how everyday Haitians will \nbenefit from this deal, there is no doubt the deal will only exacerbate \nthe problems the U.S. textile industry faces today.\n  The provisions of this legislation will be difficult if not \nimpossible for Customs to enforce. This could open the door to the \ntransshipment of Chinese goods into the United States duty free. In \norder to ensure that Customs can enforce this legislation, Senator \nDole, Senator Sessions and I request that the Senate Finance Committee \nhold a hearing prior to the President certifying that Haiti has met the \nrequirements set forth in the legislation at which representatives of \nthe textile industry can voice their concerns over the impact of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I believe the Senators' request can be accommodated.\n  Mrs. DOLE. I agree that it is outrageous that the Haiti bill in this \npackage was never considered by any committee in the Senate, never \nproperly debated in a committee or on the Senate floor. No Member has \nbeen given an opportunity to offer amendments to improve this \nlegislation, and the U.S. industry that has most to lose from this bill \nwas never given an opportunity to formally make its case before this \nbody. I have long supported increased assistance for Haiti, and support \nmeasures to expand trade between Haiti and the United States, but this \npoorly designed bill would cause serious harm to the U.S. textile \nindustry, potentially putting many North Carolina textile workers out \nof jobs. I believe this Haiti trade package needs to be thoroughly \nevaluated.\n  Senator Graham, Senator Sessions, and I would also like to propose a \nchange to the length of time in which the administration must certify \nthat Haiti has met the conditions to receiving benefits under the act. \nI request that the senior Senator from Montana agree to work with us to \npass legislation to amend the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 to \nprovide the President up to 1 year to certify that Haiti has made \nsufficient progress in meeting the conditions in the act. This change \nwill in no way preclude the President from certifying that Haiti has \nmet the requirements of this legislation prior to 1 year from now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would be happy to work with my colleagues to make this \nchange. Let me add that I have spoken with the incoming chairman of the \nHouse of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means, Mr. Rangel, and \nhe supports your requests as well.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Once again we are at the end of a Congress. It is late \nat night. The result is a vote tonight on legislation that people refer \nto simply as the ``tax extender'' bill.\n  Much of it doesn't have anything to do with tax credits. The Haiti \nFree Trade Agreement is in this bill. The Vietnam Free Trade Agreement \nis in this bill. I have very real concerns about both of these \nprovisions.\n  They are important issues. They deserve careful study. These trade \nagreements deserve a hearing and thoughtful debate on the Senate floor. \nFrom what I know of these measures, I don't support them.\n  Instead of treating these important provisions in the manner they \ndeserve, we are forced to take a yes or no vote on the whole package. \nThat means you have to take the good with the bad. We wonder why \npolitics has such a bad name, and I would suggest we are looking at the \nreason right here tonight.\n  We have worked to make sure that some of our concerns regarding these \nmeasures are addressed and believe they will be. Based on the \nassurances that we have received, I am going to vote in favor of this \nmeasure. The good of the bill is so important it outweighs the bad.\n  I thank my fellow Senators who have worked hard to achieve some \nassurances that could lead to important improvements to the Haiti trade \nprovisions. Clearly, the better approach would have been to bring these \ntrade agreements up separately, allowing for full debate.\n\n\n                treatment of sioux city, iowa buildings\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have been seeking a small change in the \ntax law that would simply undo a provision in the 1986 tax bill, \neliminating the special treatment given to a few buildings in Sioux \nCity, IA, allowing them to be treated like any other property under the \ngeneral laws.\n  The desire is to rehabilitate one of those buildings, an old historic \nhotel. It has long been boarded up. The goal is to renovate it for use \nas affordable elderly housing, an adult respite care facility and \nperhaps other uses. I believe the Finance Committee has been aware of \nthe technical tax issues involved for a long time. The provision is of \nno or minimal cost to the Treasury. And, as I noted, the property's \nowners are not asking for special treatment but, unusually, are asking \nthat they be treated like other taxpayers with a similar property.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I am familiar with this \nproblem and it is unfortunate that this provision has not been included \nin one of the recent tax measures. It is my intention to include this \nmeasure in a tax bill to be considered. And I expect to see it become \nlaw in the coming year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Haiti trade \nprovisions in this legislation. And I want to respond to some of the \ncriticisms leveled at these provisions.\n  Right now over two-thirds of Haitian apparel exports to the United \nStates are made from fabric made in either the United States or a \nbeneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.\n  Under the bill, it is true that Haiti can use fabric from third \ncountries to produce apparel exports for duty-free entry into the \nUnited States.\n  But to be eligible for such duty-free treatment, at least 50 percent \nof the value of the apparel must be attributable to Haiti, the United \nStates, or another regional qualifying country.\n  If, for example, Chinese-origin fabric is used to manufacture apparel \nin Haiti, only the value of the cutting and sewing counts toward the \n50-percent\n\n[[Page S11663]]\n\nvalue-added requirement. The value of the Chinese fabric itself does \nnot count toward the requirement.\n  And because fabric generally accounts for more than 50 percent of the \nvalue of a garment, the 50-percent value-added requirement will often \nmean that qualifying apparel must be made from fabric produced in a \nregional qualifying country to be eligible for preferential treatment.\n  Moreover, the benefits are capped in the first year at 1 percent of \nUnited States apparel imports, which is less than current apparel \nimports from Haiti and equal to only 20 percent of the total level \nprovided under the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  Now, the bill does include a tariff preference level, but it is \nlimited to woven apparel, not knits. And the level of the tariff \npreference level is equal to only 0.23 percent of United States apparel \nimports.\n  The Commissioner of Customs wrote a letter to Chairman Thomas of the \nHouse Committee on Ways and Means stating that Customs remains \ncommitted to enforcing all textile trade laws. The Commissioner further \nindicated that Customs can, and will, enforce the textile provisions in \nthis bill if they become law.\n  The bottom line is that the Haiti trade provisions in this bill will \nhelp to spur economic growth and prosperity in the most impoverished \ncountry in this hemisphere. At the same time, these provisions do not \nthreaten to significantly impact our domestic industry in an adverse \nmanner.\n  In addition, these provisions have been endorsed by a number of non-\ngovernmental organizations, including Oxfam America and the \nInternational Policy Committee of the United States Conference of \nCatholic Bishops.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Haiti legislation, as well as the \nother trade provisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be printed at \nthe appropriate place in the Congressional Record, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on this \nessential piece of legislation commonly referred as tax extenders.\n  This is, in many ways, also an energy security bill that is worth \nbeing proud of.\n  There are a host of important tax items here, many of which were \nimplemented under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Now we extend many of \nthese items through 2008.\n  There are extensions of credit for electricity produced from \nrenewable resources until December 31, 2008. This is clean energy \nproduced from wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower. It is critical \nto our Nation's future and these tax credits will play an important \nrole in our energy security over the next decade.\n  There are extensions of credits to holders of clean renewable energy \nbonds. There are extensions of credits for energy efficiency for homes \nand for commercial buildings.\n  And, there are extensions of reduced excise tax rates for ethanol. \nThe Energy bill of 2005 has helped in bringing about an economic boom \nto rural America. Analysis suggests that new biorefineries will result \nin 30,000 new jobs and will add $114 billion to the bottom lines of \nAmerican households. These extenders help continue that momentum.\n  All of these items and many more help move us closer to achieving \nenergy security.\n  Then, there is the big one. After much hard work and after hours of \nnegotiations, Congress came together and crafted a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. We passed that bill with 71 votes in August and we pushed \never since to get that bill through the House and to the Senate. We \nfought for energy relief for the American people.\n  The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act provides such energy relief, \nand I am thrilled that it is included in this tax extenders package.\n  I thank the House Ways and Means chairman, Bill Thomas, and the House \nleadership, specifically Majority Leader John Boehner for showing \ninterest in and moving this important piece of legislation. Also, \nimportantly, I thank the Senate leadership on both sides of the aisle \nand Chairman Chuck Grassley for recognizing that this legislation is \nessential to the American consumer.\n  It's cold outside and natural gas prices are rising as we heat the \nhomes we live in and the buildings we work in. So me tell you what this \nvote on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act does.\n  This vote says that Congress win not sit by and watch natural gas \nprices climb by 400 percent. We will act.\n  We will not sit back and accept the closing of scores of our chemical \nmanufacturing plants. We will act.\n  And, we will not sit back and watch as we continue to depend more and \nmore on foreign oil while producing less and less domestic oil. We will \nact.\n  And act we did. And relief is on the way.\n  This legislation is critically important to American consumers and \nour economy. While the oil resources in this region are impressive, the \nvast reserves of natural gas are the real bonanza.\n  Tens of thousands of feet under the sea-bed in this 8.3 million acre \narea that we open for leasing, American ingenuity will produce American \noil and American natural gas for the American people.\n  This area contains nearly 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and \n1.26 billion barrels of oil.\n  I believe that there is enough natural gas in lease sale 181 and \nlease sale 181 south areas to heat 6 million homes for 15 years.\n  Because of this, the Wall Street Journal has called this OCS bill \n``an easy victory for the U.S. economy.'' And, on the other side of the \npolitical spectrum, the New York Times wrote that this bill meets ``an \nimmediate need'' and is ``a reason to drill in the Gulf.''\n  And, in this bill we recognize the will of the people in our energy \nproducing States. We recognize the sacrifices made by the Gulf States \nin being America's energy coast for so many years. And, we recognize \nprotections important to the people of Florida.\n  This bill strikes the right balance. It is a blockbuster. It is a \nvictory for this Congress, but more importantly, it is a victory for \nthe American energy consumer.\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke recently said that rising \nenergy prices is posing a risk to our Nation's economic activity.\n  I say, that with this vote, we help to lessen that risk. What we have \ndone here is the most important thing we can do in the near term to \nreduce the price of natural gas and to boost our Nation's domestic \nenergy supply.\n  For that, the American people win tonight. \n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 6111, \nthe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. This important tax relief \nlegislation includes a number of provisions that are extremely \nimportant to my constituents in Wyoming. It deserves to be passed, and \nI am urging all of my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  First and foremost among the provisions that I am supporting is a \nprovision to reauthorize the Abandoned Mine Land, AML, Trust Fund for \n15 years. I have been working to reauthorize the AML trust fund since I \nwas first elected to the Senate in 1996. As it currently operates, the \nAML trust fund does not work as intended and does not treat my home \nState fairly.\n  The Federal Government has hijacked more than $550 million that was \npromised to Wyoming from a tax on coal produced in my State. We have \nlegislation before us to correct this problem and to fix it so that \nWyoming receives its fair share of funding in the future.\n  This legislation has been a long time in the making, and it has broad \nsupport. Over the past year, I have worked with Senators Rockefeller, \nSantorum, Specter and Byrd to build a coalition that can support this \nimportant bill. The bill is supported by the coal industry. It is \nsupported by the United Mine Workers of America, UMWA. It is supported \nby members from the eastern United States and members from the western \nUnited States. All of the stakeholders are in agreement that the AML \nreauthorization language that is included in this bill is the best \nlanguage to fix the problem and move the issue forward.\n  The legislation has many provisions that are important to my State. \nIt returns the $550 million that was hijacked by the Federal Government \nover a 7-year period. I am pleased that it\n\n[[Page S11664]]\n\ndoes so in a way that allows Wyoming's legislature to determine their \npriorities for how that money should be spent.\n  The legislation also ensures that Wyoming will continue to receive \nfunding in the future for mining activities that occur within our \nState's borders. It does all this at the same time we direct more money \ntoward reclamation in States where the reclamation work is needed.\n  Finally, I wanted to see a reduction in the tax charged to Wyoming's \ncoal companies. Some of the companies in my State do not have the \nproblems associated with abandoned coal mines, nor do they have the \norphan miner liability that is held by some companies. Those companies \nagreed not to fight an extension of the tax if it was reduced, and this \nlegislation includes a slight reduction in the fee.\n  The priorities of other members are also included in this bill, \nincluding provisions that shore up health care for orphan miners who \nfall into the Combined Benefits Fund. Those priorities include the \naddition of health care coverage for members who fall into the 1992 \nfund and the 1993 Fund. Although the shoring up of those three funds \nwas not a priority for me, this represents compromise legislation.\n  Some opposition to this legislation comes from members who claim that \nit is too expensive. I would argue to my colleagues who are concerned \nwith the cost of the bill that it is not as expensive as it appears at \nfirst glance. Money will continue to come in from collections of the \nAML fee, which will help to offset the cost. The Federal Government \nwill also continue to receive significant revenues from coal production \non Federal lands.\n  However, unlike past monies that have been sent to the Treasury and \nthat have been spent outside the act, this legislation will ensure that \nthe funding is used for its intended purposes. Money that is supposed \nto go to the States will no longer be hijacked and spent on unrelated \nprograms. Instead of those unrelated programs, the money that is \nintended to do reclamation will actually be used to further our \nreclamation goals. Money that is supposed to go back to the States will \nactually be sent to the States. Coal money will actually be used to \nhelp fix a coal problem.\n  For those who do not like the health care portions of this bill, I \nshare your heartburn. Wyoming does not have a significant number of \norphan beneficiaries. However, it should be noted that the Federal \nGovernment has been spending Federal dollars to help provide these \nhealth care benefits for years, and there is nothing to suggest that we \nwill stop funding these benefits. The Senators who represent the \nfamilies who receive this health care continue to make sure the \nfamilies receive it. Since miners' health care continues to be funded, \nwe needed to find a way to fulfill the promise to the States. This \nlegislation was such a fix.\n  When a program is broken, we need to fix it. The AML program has been \nbroken for years, and this legislation is an opportunity to fix it. It \nwill send more money to reclamation and will return money to States \nthat those States are owed.\n  This is a good bill, and I am so pleased that we were able to include \nthis reauthorization in H.R. 6111.\n  AML reauthorization is not the only important section of this \nlegislation. The bill also includes the extension of the State and \nlocal sales tax deduction. The State and local sales tax deduction, \nwhich is crucial for the residents of States without a State income \ntax, was included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. However, \nthis deduction expired this year. Because this deduction has expired, \nit is crucial that Congress act now to extend this important deduction. \nThe State and local sales tax deduction is an issue of fairness. \nResidents who live in a State without a State income tax should not \nhave to pay more in Federal taxes simply because they cannot take \nadvantage of the State income tax deduction. While I would like to see \nthis deduction become permanent, I am pleased that the option to deduct \nState and local sales taxes will be extended an additional 2 years \nthrough this legislation.\n  In addition, I want to take a few moments to express my support for \nthe extension of the New Markets Tax Credit program through 2008. This \nis a highly successful program that stimulates investment in low-income \ncommunities. Multiple communities within Wyoming have been able to take \nadvantage of this tax credit. I am hopeful that with this extension, \nadditional cities and organizations in Wyoming will be able to utilize \nthis tax credit. I am also pleased that this legislation includes a \nmodification to the New Markets Tax Credit program to guarantee that \nnonmetropolitan communities receive the proper allocation of qualified \nequity investments. This change in law is welcome news for the smaller \ncommunities throughout Wyoming.\n  The final tax provision I will discuss today is the extension of the \nresearch credit. This credit has played a vital role in encouraging \ncompanies throughout the United States to expand their research \nefforts. Innovation and advancements in technology are critical to the \nprogress of the United States. This research credit encourages \ncompanies to spend more of their financial resources on the discovery \nof new and innovative products and ideas. Without the ongoing research \nand development of American businesses, the overall economic outlook of \nour Nation would greatly diminish. It was crucial that this credit be \nextended and I am pleased that this legislation includes such an \nextension.\n  Finally, I am pleased that H.R. 6111 includes a section to increase \nour domestic energy production. We need to increase our domestic energy \nproduction to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. \nDomestic energy production is akin to economic and national security. \nThe Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, provision included in this act is \nbased on S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act which the \nSenate passed in a bipartisan way on August 1, 2006.\n  The OCS has tremendous untapped potential to meet the energy needs of \nour Nation. Energy that we need to heat our homes and energy that we \nuse in manufacturing can come from this region. The OCS has energy that \nwill help secure our food supply by lowering prices for farmers and \nranchers who produce that food.\n  The entire OCS is composed of 1.76 billion acres and there are 8,000 \nactive lease areas producing oil and natural gas. This production \ntranslates to approximately 20 percent of our domestic oil production \nand approximately 30 percent of our domestic natural gas production. \nYet, of the 1.76 billion acres of potential production area, 85 percent \nof the coastal waters around the lower 48 States currently is off \nlimits to energy development.\n  Under this provision the Secretary of the Interior is directed to \noffer mineral leases in a specified area within 1 year of enactment. \nThis action has the potential of producing 1.26 billion barrels of oil \nand 5.8 trillion cubic feet of domestic energy. This bill will provide \nenough natural gas to heat 6 million homes for 15 years, and so I am \npleased that it was included in this bill.\n  I thank my colleagues who worked on this important tax relief \nlegislation. Specifically, I thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member \nBaucus for their efforts. I thank Senators Rockefeller, Byrd, Santorum \nand Specter for their hard work and dedication on the AML bill. This \nimportant legislation deserves to pass, and so I will be voting to move \nthe legislation forward.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to support the \nlegislation before the Senate today. As often happens at the end of a \nCongress, the leadership has negotiated a large and complicated bill to \ntie up many loose ends. And I believe that on balance this is a very \ngood bill. While I am disappointed in some aspects of this agreement, I \nunderstand that, when legislating, hard compromises sometimes have to \nbe made. I recognize how difficult it was for us to get this far.\n  I want to thank the leadership, and especially Senator Grassley, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Baucus, our ranking \nmember and incoming chairman, for working so hard and so long to \nprotect the Senate's interests in very difficult and often frustrating \nnegotiations. They were fierce negotiators, and they made sure that we \nwould be voting on a bill that a substantial majority in the Senate can \nsupport. It was no easy feat given the circumstances and sometimes \nbitter disagreements between the two Houses, and at times, between\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\nMembers. The leaders of the Finance Committee deserve enormous credit.\n  This bill includes a critical Coal Act and AML reform provision. And \nI would like to take just a few minutes to explain to my colleagues \nwhat this provision is all about. It is about protecting the health \nbenefits of tens of thousands of retired coalminers and their widows \nwho were promised lifetime health benefits by their companies and by \ntheir Government. It is about keeping a promise to the men and women \nwho have sacrificed themselves to fuel our Nation's economic growth and \ncontinued prosperity.\n  Historically, coal miners have bargained for their health benefits at \nthe expense of other pension benefits and salaries because they have \nlong known the grave toll that coal mining takes on a person's health \nand safety. This year's tragic and record string of mine deaths shows \nthat remains true today. More than 50,000 coal miner retirees and their \naged widows, average age of nearly 80, are counting on the health \nbenefits that are protected in the Coal Act and AML reform provision. \nThese coal miner retirees live in nearly every State of the Union, and \nthey still believe that the promise of their health benefits will and \nshould be kept. So do I.\n  This reform will stabilize the coal miners' health funds and give \nretired miners some peace of mind that they will not face cuts in the \nhealth benefits on which they depend. That means the world to me. And \nDixie Woolum, and the thousands and thousands of other retired miners \nand widows in West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Illinois, \nand Indiana--all across this Nation--deserve that peace of mind. They \nhave had to bear so much in the coalfields, for so long. They deserve \nthis peace of mind. They earned it.\n  Specifically, the coal miners' health funds--the combined benefit \nfund, the 92 fund and the 93 fund--will receive annual transfers of \nmonies from the interest on the AML trust fund, paid for by the coal \ncompanies. I think that is only fair. Before these changes, only the \ncombined benefit and 92 fund could receive AML interest money to help \ncompensate for its shortfalls--and the administration wrongly \ninterpreted the original Coal Act to cap that amount. That \nmisinterpretation of the original Coal Act provision has been fixed in \nthis bill. The new provisions helping the 92 fund and the 93 fund are \nphased in over time, but the CBF will get a needed infusion of money \nnext year.\n  The AML/Coal Act provision is also about protecting the environment \nand health of communities where mining has left environmental scars--\nmany of which continue to pose significant health risks. This proposal \nreauthorizes the AML program for 15 more years, at a slightly reduced \nrate, and gives States back their unappropriated balances while more \nfairly distributing funding for historic coal production States like \nWest Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The AML program \nwas part of the bargain when we reformed surface mining back in the \nlate 1970s. We created a trust fund that is paid into by the coal \ncompanies that mine the land to ensure there would be money available \nto reclaim old mine sites. Hundreds of these sites remain unreclaimed. \nStates have waited patiently for Federal dollars that have been \nparceled too slowly in the past. This provision will deal with the \noutstanding problem of AML reform at the same time it helps miners \nwhose blood and sweat built up the AML trust fund in the first place.\n  Today marks the culmination of a long, long fight--14 years now--to \nmake sure that Congress lives up to its responsibilities to retired \nminers and their families. And I won't recap all of the ups and downs \nof the past 10-plus years, but I do need to personally thank a few \npeople who finally made this possible.\n\n  I am grateful to my distinguished leader and dear friend Senator \nReid. As the son of a hardrock miner, Senator Reid appreciates what \nminers go through to bring us the natural resources that make our \neconomy and standard of living possible. He has worked tirelessly to \nget these provisions passed. He is a trusted friend and an \ninspirational leader.\n  I also need to thank the leaders of the Senate Finance Committee. \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus have an excellent relationship, \nbuilt on working together and keeping their word. I know that they had \nto fight very hard to protect the AML provision, and they did so \nbecause they gave their word. That means a great deal to me. A great \ndeal. I am very grateful for their efforts. I know that the same spirit \nof bipartisan respect and cooperation will continue under Senator \nBaucus' able leadership next year. I look forward to his tenure. I will \nnot mention each of the superb Finance Committee staff members by name, \nbut I must at least thank them as a whole. They are extraordinarily \nbright and hard working, and I know that today's victory would not have \nbeen possible without their absolute dedication.\n  I also want to thank my friend and colleague on the HELP Committee, \nChairman Enzi, who seized this issue when tax extenders were debated in \nthe pension conference which he chaired. He has never given up on \ngetting this done in this Congress, even when procedural tactics by \nsome put it in dire jeopardy. He just never gives up when it comes to \nfighting for his State. I admire that very much. I am indebted to him \nfor his work on this measure, as I have been for his efforts on mine \nsafety. He is tireless and yet with a demeanor that never rankles. I \ncannot fail to mention the support of my longtime, dear friend Senator \nKennedy. He was always on my side on this issue as well--as he is \nalways on the side of our Nation's working men and women, whether our \nNation's coal miners or anyone who puts in a hard day and struggles to \nmeet the challenges of raising a family. He was there to help make this \nhappen. This has been a true bipartisan effort. The way legislation \nshould be done.\n  I also need to thank my good friend and colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd. He has been my constant partner on West Virginia mining \nissues. As a leader of the Appropriations Committee, he has saved the \nday for many years, by appropriating funds to prevent benefit cuts to \nretired miners and their families.\n  Finally, I cannot go without thanking the Senators from Pennsylvania, \nMr. Santorum and Mr. Specter. From the beginning they have worked with \nme to make today's victory a reality. Senator Santorum reintroduced \nthis proposal early this year, and even after a very difficult and \nhard-fought election, Senator Santorum continued to work hard for his \nconstituents and pushed to make sure that his leadership did not give \nup on this provision. I know that our Nation's coal-mining families \nappreciate their hard work and dedication as much as I do.\n  Now, obviously, this bill contains many more items than just the AML \nprovision. Many of these provisions I have voted for several times \nalready, and I am very happy to see that they will finally be enacted \ninto law--the tax deductions for tuition expenses or teachers' \nclassroom expenses, the research and development tax credit, the \nwelfare-to-work tax incentives. These provisions should never have been \nallowed to expire, and I am pleased that Congress is done using them as \na political football and will finally extend them as we should have \ndone last year.\n  This bill will also create new tax incentives to promote investment \nin mine safety equipment and the training of rescue teams that can help \ntrapped miners. There is some work that remains to be done to make \nthose incentives work as they should in the coalfields, and you can be \nsure I will be back to finish the job. Also, after years of inequity, \nthis bill finally provides capital gains tax relief to members of the \nintelligence community who serve their country away from home. Both of \nthese provisions are very important to me even though both need a \nlittle more work.\n  For the record, I also need to point out that this bill has some \nserious shortcomings. Most notably, I am concerned about the potential \nconsequences of some of the health savings account provisions that were \nincluded in this bill. In general, I believe that HSAs will make the \nproblems with our health care system worse, not better. They do not \nincrease access to health care for our large uninsured population, and \nworse, they threaten to undermine the risk-sharing on which our current \nsystem depends. I hope that the 110th Congress will take a serious look \nat how to really increase access to health care. I intend to push very \nhard on that front.\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\n  But as I said at the beginning, Mr. President, I believe that on \nbalance, this is a good bill. I am grateful to my colleagues who have \nbeen relentless in negotiating this bill, and I am pleased to support \nit.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the legislation to \nextend various provisions of the Nation's tax laws which is now before \nthe Senate includes a 2-year extension of the $250 tax deduction \navailable to teachers who incur out-of-pocket expenses to purchase \nclassroom supplies. This extension builds upon the $250 tax deduction \nestablished by legislation which became law in 2001 as part of that \nyear's tax relief package. The tax relief provided by that bill was \nlater extended through the end of last year. I was proud to author that \nlegislation, along with my good friends, Senator Warner and Senator \nLandrieu.\n  Providing this deduction for teachers who buy classroom supplies is \nwarranted by the facts. So often teachers in Maine and throughout the \ncountry spend their own money to improve the classroom experiences of \ntheir students. While many of us are familiar with the National \nEducation Association's estimate that teachers spend, on average, $400 \na year on classroom supplies, other surveys show that they are spending \neven more than that. Indeed, I have spoken to dozens of teachers in my \nhome State who tell me they routinely spend far in excess of the $250 \ndeduction limit--a few even as much as $1,000--on materials they use in \ntheir classrooms. At every school I visit, I find teachers who are \nspending their own money to improve the educational experiences of \ntheir students by supplementing classroom supplies. One such teacher is \nDebra Walker, who teaches kindergarten and first grade in the town of \nMilo, ME. She has taught for more than 25 years. Year after year, she \nspends hundreds of dollars on books, bulletin boards, computer \nsoftware, crayons, construction paper, tissue paper, stamps and \ninkpads. She even donated her own family computer for use by her class. \nShe described it well by saying, ``These are the extras that are needed \nto make learning fun for children and to create a stimulating learning \nenvironment.''\n  Another example is Tyler Nutter, a middle school math and reading \nteacher from North Berwick, ME. After teaching for just 2 years, Tyler \nincurred substantial ``startup'' fees as he built his own collection of \nneeded teaching supplies. In his first years on the job, he spent well \nover $500 out of pocket each year, purchasing books and other materials \nthat are essential to his teaching program. This tax deduction is, in \nTyler's words, ``a nice recognition of the contributions that many \nteachers have made.''\n  The teacher tax relief we have made available since 2001 is a small \nbut significant way of helping teachers shoulder the expenses they \nincur to do their jobs well. Extending this provision for another 2 \nyears demonstrates our gratitude and sends the right message to our \nNation's teachers.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to see H.R. 6111, the \nTax Extender Act before us today. This legislation includes some very \nimportant provisions that extend retroactively several expired tax \nbenefits that have been instrumental to keeping our economy growing and \nhelping to provide tax equity to certain members of our society.\n  Many of my colleagues on the Finance Committee have joined me in \nsupporting Chairman Grassley's tireless efforts this year to extend \nthese provisions since even before they expired on December 31 of last \nyear. Unfortunately, our several attempts to do so were thwarted by \ndifficult political circumstances that required that the extender \npackage be deferred until now.\n  It is amazing to me, and undoubtedly very puzzling to Utahns and \nAmericans across the country, that a set of provisions that enjoys \nnearly universal support in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives should be so difficult to pass. However, I am very glad \nto see that we have finally been able to push the extension of these \nimportant tax benefits across the finish line.\n  First and foremost on the list of expired tax provisions that are \nextended in this bill is the credit for increasing research activities. \nThe so-called research credit has been instrumental in this country in \nnot only providing incentives for conducting an increasing amount of \nR among American companies, but also in keeping that research \nactivity in this country in an environment where incentives to move \nresearch offshore are proliferating.\n  Because so many of our trading partners are now offering generous tax \nand other incentives in an attempt to lure away U.S.-conducted \nresearch, extending the research credit is of paramount importance just \nso we can keep ahead of the competition.\n  Some may question the value of a retroactive extension of the \nresearch credit, particularly when it has been expired for nearly a \nyear. After all, it is difficult to argue that a retroactively provided \nincentive can have any real incentive effect, since the activity it is \ndesigned to induce has already taken place. I am very happy that my \ncolleagues have recognized there is another important factor at work \nhere.\n  Practically all of my colleagues agree with me that the research \ncredit would be more effective if it were made permanent. Senator \nBaucus and I and others of our colleagues have long worked and argued \nfor making the credit permanent. Indeed, in 2001 the Senate passed a \npermanent research credit, but it was unfortunately dropped in \nconference with the House.\n  However, because we have almost always extended the research credit \nseamlessly, it has become a sort of de facto permanent credit. And \nwhile a de facto permanent research credit is not as good as a de jure \npermanent research credit, there are certain benefits that we get from \nhaving even an expiring credit always available. I believe that because \nthe credit has been retroactively extended every year, except for one, \nit is more effective in inducing research activities. I also believe \nthat businesses in Utah and all over America have come to depend on the \nresearch credit being extended each year without a gap. Therefore, I \nbelieve that it is important to once again retroactively extend the \ncredit to keep the faith that we have allowed to be built up around \nthis tax benefit. Therefore, I am very pleased to see that the credit \nhas once again been extended, retroactive to its expiration date last \nyear.\n  The legislation before us also includes the extension of some other \nimportant expired tax provisions. One important provision included in \nthis bill is the retroactive extension of the deduction for school \nteachers for classroom expenses that they incur. As a major proponent \nof this legislation for many years, I was extremely pleased to see this \nprovision included in the final bill.\n  Our public school teachers are some of the unheralded heroes of our \nsociety. School teachers labor in often difficult and even dangerous \ncircumstances. A historic turnover is taking place in the teaching \nprofession. Unfortunately, these professionals receive an unfair tax \ntreatment under our tax law. Specifically, teachers find themselves \ngreatly disadvantaged by the lack of deductibility of professional \ndevelopment expenses and of the out-of-pocket costs of classroom \nmaterials that practically all teachers find themselves supplying. \nFurthermore, almost all teachers find themselves providing basic \nclassroom materials for their students. Because of tight education \nbudgets, most schools do not provide 100 percent of the material \nteachers need to adequately present their lessons. As a result, \ndedicated teachers incur personal expenses for copies, art supplies, \nbooks, puzzles and games, paper, pencils, and countless other needs. If \nnot for the willingness of teachers to purchase these supplies \nthemselves, many students would simply go without needed materials.\n  I am pleased to see that this bill includes an extension of a \nteacher's tax credit which will help teachers, in some small way, to \ncope with these challenges and inequities. I believe much more must be \ndone. That is why, earlier this year, I introduced the Tax Equity for \nSchool Teachers Act of 2006, S. 4027. S. 4027 will not only expand the \ntax credit teachers can take for school supplies, but also provide them \na tax credit which will defer some of the increasing cost of training. \nI am hopeful we will be able to act on legislation similar to S. 4027 \nnext Congress, but I am very pleased to see this basic tax credit for \nteachers extended once again this Congress.\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\n  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to address this issue today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I also applaud \nthe leadership for including a retroactive extension of the provision \noffering a 15-year cost recovery period for certain leasehold and \nrestaurant improvements. Failure to do so would mean an effective tax \nincrease on many thousands of small businesses. Likewise, I am pleased \nto see that this bill has the foresight to include an extension of some \nenergy tax provisions that have not yet expired. Some of these, \nincluding the credit for electricity produced from geothermal energy \nsources, are very important to my home State of Utah. It is refreshing \nto see that we are being a little more proactive and extending \nprovisions before they actually expire. This represents a much more \nresponsible public policy approach than waiting to act until the \nprovisions have already expired.\n  I would now like to highlight some of the health care provisions that \nare included in this legislation. First, I have been a strong proponent \nof ensuring that patients continue to receive access to quality health \ncare by addressing the scheduled reduction in the Medicare physician \nreimbursement for 2007. This legislation prevents physician payment \ncuts in 2007 by freezing payments for physician services, and, as a \nresult, doctors will receive a 0 percent update next year instead of a \n5 percent reduction. The bill also provides a 1.5 percent bonus-\nincentive payment to doctors who report on quality measures in 2007. \nFinally, the provision provides a fund to promote physician payment \nstability and quality initiatives in 2008.\n\n  I also am a proud advocate for providing Medicare patients continued \naccess to needed therapy. More specifically, this legislation provides \na 1-year extension of the exceptions process established in the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005 to allow Medicare beneficiaries to apply for \nadditional physical, occupational and speech language therapy services \nif their treatment is expected to exceed the annual cap on therapy \nservices. I am pleased that this provision was included in the \nlegislation we are considering today.\n  In 2003, I introduced legislation that was included in the Medicare \nModernizations Act of 2003 to change the formula for Medicare \nreimbursement to physicians, since the previous formula penalized those \npracticing in rural States like Utah. The bill extends the new formula \nthrough 2007, which will continue to raise payments in certain rural \nareas.\n  In addition, I fought to extend the availability of the Program of \nAll-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, PACE, program, which is of interest \nto those providing long-term, acute care for frail elderly in rural \nareas, including Grand County in Utah. The legislation before the \nSenate would ensure that funds for the rural PACE grants are available \nthrough 2010.\n  Another important component of this bill is the payment for \nadministration of Medicare Part D vaccines. The legislation specifies \nthat during 2007, the administrative costs for a vaccine covered by \nMedicare Part D are to be paid under Medicare Part B. However, \nbeginning in 2008, the Medicare Part D coverage will include the \nadministrative costs for vaccines covered under Medicare Part D. \nSeveral months ago, I brought this matter to the attention of the \nAdministrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and I \nam pleased that this issue will be addressed through this bill.\n  Also, the legislation includes a feasibility study on how to create a \nnational database to collect data on elder abuse. Let me make it clear \nthat I am extremely disappointed that the Elder Justice Act was not \napproved for the second Congress in a row. This legislation was passed \nunanimously by the Senate Finance Committee in both the 108th Congress \nand the 109th Congress. I want to let my colleagues know that I will \ncontinue to fight for passage of this legislation during the 110th \nCongress and it is my hope that my House colleagues will be more \nwilling to work with me next year in passing this bill. We expect more \nthan 78 million baby boomers to retire over the next three decades and, \nin my opinion, we owe it to our seniors to be more informed about elder \nabuse. Passing the Elder Justice Act is the first step toward \naccomplishing that goal.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have repeatedly voted in favor of \nfree trade. Most economists agree that free trade is not only in the \nUnited States best interest but in the interest of developing nations \nthroughout the world. One of the most efficient ways that we can lift \nmillions out of poverty is through free trade.\n  However, since the end of the Second World War, the United States \nhas, on a number of occasions, accepted nonreciprocal trade concessions \nin order to further important Cold War and post-Cold War foreign policy \nobjectives. Examples include offering Japan and Europe nonreciprocal \naccess to American markets during the 1950s and 1960s in order to \nstrengthen the economies of our allies and prevent the spread of \nCommunism. Other examples of this type of initiative include the \nGeneralized System of Preferences, the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct and the Andean Trade Preferences Extension Act.\n  In the past, we have afforded these unilateral trade preferences \nbecause of the strength of American exports. But times have changed. \nOur nation has not enjoyed a trade surplus since 1975 and last year's \ndeficit widened to a record $726 billion, increasing to 5.8 percent of \nthe gross domestic product from 5.3 percent in 2004 and 4.5 percent in \n2003.\n  This is not say that I do not support the renewal of the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the \nAndean Trade Preferences Extension Acts. I do support their renewal.\n  However, I share the concerns of the Chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, that blanket renewals are not in our \nNation's best interest, especially when countries with rapidly \nexpanding economies, such as India and Brazil, can avail themselves of \nthe unilateral preferences granted in the Generalized System of \nPreferences. I am also very concerned that the Andean Trade Preferences \nExtension Act will be renewed for nations like Ecuador, whose \ngovernment has nationalized American-owned corporations without paying \njust compensation.\n  Therefore, I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and the \nin-coming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, in \norder to better tailor our preference systems so that we help \ndeveloping nations lift their populations out of poverty and craft a \ncomprehensive strategy that will return American exports to the surplus \ncolumn.\n  Another issue included in this trade portion of this bill is the \ngranting of Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, for Vietnam. For \nyears, I have been very concerned regarding the religious freedom of \nthe Vietnamese people. That was one of the major reason why in 2001, I \nvoted against the Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. However, I have \nbeen encouraged by a series of reforms that have occurred that \nculminated in the agreement on religious freedom between our two \ncountries, in which Hanoi agreed to take steps that were designed to \nimprove conditions for people of faith, particularly in the Central \nHighlands, which includes the Montagnards. Therefore, I will support \nPNTR for Vietnam but I pledge eternal vigilance to ensure that the \nVietnamese Government lives up to its commitments and ensure the basic \nrights of its people.\n  As to the economic benefits of granting PNTR for Vietnam, it is true \nthat Vietnam currently enjoys a $5.3 billion trade deficit over the \nUnited States. However, it should be noted that Vietnam has been an \nimportant customer of high-value goods, especially aircraft. This \nincludes being a launch customer for what promises to be one of the \nUnited States premiere export products of this century the 787 \nDreamliner.\n  The adoption of the Vietnam PNTR will not assist in remedying the \ntrade deficit between our two countries. The reason being, that unlike \nsome free trade agreements that the United States has entered into, the \nUnited States does not grant Vietnam unilateral preferential access to \nUnited States markets. However, under the agreement Vietnamese tariffs \non many U.S. agricultural products will be reduced from 27 percent to \n15 percent or less. The agreement also calls for the elimination of 96 \npercent of the tariffs on scientific equipment. Scientific\n\n[[Page S11668]]\n\nequipment is a significant export for my home State of Utah.\n  Therefore, I will support the Vietnam PNTR as a means for American \ncompanies to have greater access to this burgeoning market and as a \nmeans of closing the trade deficit with this Nation.\n  Finally, I support the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through \nPartnership Encouragement Act. This is of course a matter which has \nbeen brought to our attention, in part, through the hard work of my \nfriend Senator DeWine. I understand that with the enactment of this \nlegislation tens of thousands of Haitians will find employment in their \ncountry. This is something that we must do. Haiti is the poorest nation \nin the Western Hemisphere, we must do all that we can to assist this \nnation, which is only 600 miles from our border, lift the heavy hand of \npoverty and begin to provide for a better life for its people.\n  I would like to thank all of those involved in getting this important \npiece of legislation through both Congressional bodies and saving \nAmerican taxpayers from an enormous tax increase next year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. To begin with, I believe the time of the Senator has \nexpired, unless I cannot count.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I should have 2 minutes left. I gave the Senator from \nLouisiana 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Under the unanimous consent agreement, I believe the \nSenator from Iowa had 15 minutes, then I have 15 minutes. I believe the \ntime has run against the Senator from Iowa; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Can the Senator from \nIowa reserve time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you.\n  This is an embarrassing situation. It is embarrassing to be chairman \nof the Budget Committee in the Republican Party and have a bill brought \nto the floor of the Senate which does such a grievous harm to the \nbudget, to the deficit, and to our obligations and responsibilities of \nfiscal fairness to our citizens.\n  The budget was set up in a manner that would have allowed all the tax \nextenders the Senator from Iowa has so aptly and appropriately \npraised--and which I support--to have been put in place without any \nbudget points of order against them. In fact, it was a result of \nefforts on my part that we created $106 billion of room within the \nbudget so that we could do tax extenders dealing with things such as \nthe R tax credit, dividends, and capital gains because I consider \nthem to be extremely important, as does the vast majority of our \nconference.\n  But what has happened here is that wasn't enough. This bill, which \ncould have been done within the terms of the budget, now comes to us \nwell over what were the original proposals, not only in the area of tax \nlaws--and you may be able to defend some of the tax policy--but in the \nend, it is a spending policy. This is an omnibus spending bill. There \nis a lot of spending initiative in this bill that is inappropriate and \nnot authorized. That is why we have a Budget Committee to step up and \nsay: Listen, you want to put $4 billion in to move the responsibility \nfor health care on certain coal mines from the coal mining companies to \nthe taxpayers, and it is supposed to go through the authorizing \ncommittees and come to the floor; it is not supposed to be stuck in a \nbill like this.\n  If you want to set up a phony mechanism to fund what should be done, \nwhich is a quick fix, a phony mechanism, if properly scored it would \nrepresent about $36 billion of new spending over the next 5 years. But \nbecause they set it up as a 1-year item, they were able to get around \nthat. There is a budget point of order against that type of action.\n  You want to do earmarks--and yes, there were earmarks. Regrettably, \nthe Senator from Iowa misrepresented--if he was referring to me--my \nrepresentation of what the earmarks were. I don't consider the sales \ntax to be an earmark. I consider it to be bad policy. I don't even \nconsider it to be a budget issue.\n  The Finance Committee has every right to stick that in the bill \nwithin the terms of the budget as long as they meet the budget \nrequirements. It is a matter of policy. They chose that policy. I \ndisagree with that policy. I think it puts States that don't have a \nsales tax at a disadvantage and puts low-income Americans at a \ndisadvantage because they cannot deduct it. That is not an earmark. I \nnever said that. To represent that I said that is inaccurate.\n  What I said was that you shouldn't bring a bill to the floor that is \nso inappropriately over what the budget set out as the proper role for \nthis committee in the area of tax policy and what the Congress voted \nfor and which has spending in it which hasn't been authorized and which \nactually creates new mandatory programs which nobody even knows about \nor spent any time thinking about, which is going to cost us billions of \ndollars in the outyears. You shouldn't bring that type of bill to the \nfloor to begin with as the Republican Party because it is wrong, \noutside of fiscal discipline, which is what we are supposed to stand \nfor--at least you shouldn't bring it to the floor in a manner in which, \nsay, you are not going to allow it to be amended, you are not even \ngoing to allow motions to strike to lie against it. You are going to \ncause us to vote on a message from the House? A message from the \nHouse--we are going to concur in a message from the House.\n  We are not going to vote on the underlying substance of the bill. We \nare not going to be allowed to amend the underlying substance of the \nbill even though it adds $39 billion to the deficit. We are not going \nto be allowed to strike earmarks in this bill--and there are earmarks \nin this bill--such as the $150 million for the District of Columbia, \nthe rum excise revenue sharing proposal for Puerto Rico, the special \ndepreciation for ethanol, the extension of the tariff on ethanol coming \ninto this country from Brazil, and the earmarks go on.\n  We are not going to be allowed to vote on any of those items. A \nmotion to strike, the most simple right any Senator should have on any \nmajor vehicle coming before the Senate is being denied to us.\n  This is an omnibus bill that violates three sections of the Budget \nAct which were not put in place for arbitrary or technical reasons. \nThey were put in place to try to deliver fiscal discipline to the \nFederal budget so that we don't pass on to our kids a lot of debt for \nexpenditures which we want to do today.\n  That is the basic problem we have as a Congress. We continue to do \nthings around here so that we can claim back home that we made these \ndecisions which spend money today, and then we take that bill and we \ngive it to our kids who are not even born, our grandchildren who are \nnot born. The purpose of the Budget Act is to keep us from doing that.\n  These are real budget points of order. There are some budget points \nof order which I totally agree are technical. The Senator from Iowa has \npointed out one about which he has a very good case. I will be happy to \nwork with him to try to correct that situation. But these are not \nthose.\n  There is spending in this bill which is an affront to anybody who \ngenuinely believes that we should be fiscally disciplined. It creates a \nnew mandatory program of $4 billion which will take money, which should \nhave been paid by the coal companies to support the health care of \npeople who are harmed or going to be harmed, and put that cost on to \nthe American taxpayers. It is called coal in the stocking, I think, in \nthe Christmas season.\n  There is this doctors' fix. I am 100 percent for the doctors' fix. \nObviously, we should pay doctors fair compensation to keep them in the \nMedicare Program, but the understanding was we would but pay for it \nwith real dollars, not some phony mechanism that came out of the House \nin the dying days of the House session, a phony mechanism which, if \ncarried out to its natural extreme, will cost $36 billion over 5 years. \nWe don't score it that way because they use an extra little mechanism \nto make sure it doesn't happen, saying it\n\n[[Page S11669]]\n\nwill only be for 1 year, even though we know we will have the same \nproblem next year.\n  We should not have a bill on the floor of the Senate that cannot be \namended that is filled with earmarks that exceed the budget. One can \nargue that maybe earmarks may make sense, and they do make sense in \nsome instances, and as long as they are within the budget, because you \nare not spending more, you are not adding to the deficit. But this bill \ndoes spend more, as I have pointed out.\n  I have said it on occasion that the job of the budget chairman is a \ntouch thankless. In this instance, as I said, it is embarrassing \nbecause it is sort of that old Pogo line: We've met the enemy and he is \nus. The only people responsible for this is the party that is still in \nthe majority. Sure, the other side is an accomplice. They understood it \nwas being done; they were for most of this stuff. As I said, when they \nobtain power, I suspect their activities are going to be much more \negregious in the area of spending discipline. Maybe they won't be. If \nwe look at the record, I suspect one can argue that.\n  But, quite honestly, the only people who are to blame in this little \nexercise are us. I just sort of thought that after the last election we \nmight have said to the American people: Yes, we understand. You think \nwe are supposed to be the party of fiscal discipline, and we haven't \nbeen. We are going to try to be now. We are going to try to correct \nthat.\n  We have been given another opportunity, those of us who were not up \nfor election or survived reelection. We are going to try to do it a \nlittle better. We are not doing it better. We are just doing the same \ndarn thing: spending money we don't have that our children are going to \nhave to pay for.\n  I regret it. My job is to point it out. I intend to do that. I \nrecognize I am going to lose this point of order, probably \noverwhelmingly, but my job is to point it out.\n  There are three points of order against this bill, and every one of \nthem is real. Every one of them deals with money. Even the Senator from \nAlaska should probably support them.\n  One is a 302-point of order that deals with the fact that it is \nbillions of dollars over the allocation of the committee. Another is \nthe fact that it spends more than the committee is allocated. And the \nthird, ironically, is the pay-go point of order that we have heard so \nmuch about from the other side.\n  It is an interesting situation we confront here. As we close this \nCongress, I hope we will show a little fiscal discipline and vote for \nthese points of order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the outrageous manner in which this tax \nextender bill is being handled proves the Republican leadership did not \nhear the clear message that the American people sent on November 7. The \nRepublicans are still concocting special interest deals behind closed \ndoors. They are still pursuing their agenda to further enrich the \nwealthy few while neglecting the needs of working families. And they \nare still denying members a meaningful opportunity to debate and amend \nmajor legislation.\n  For months, the Republicans have been holding the extension of \nimportant tax provisions that benefit families and businesses hostage \nto their special interest agenda. Many of these tax extenders are \nessential to the continued growth of our economy and the well-being of \nAmerican families. Unfortunately, most of these tax incentives have \nalready expired. Unless they are reinstated before the end of they \nyear, millions of individuals and businesses will face a substantial \ntax increase when they pay their 2006 taxes. That would be terribly \nunfair.\n  What do these tax incentives actually accomplish? The tuition tax \ncredit helps more than 3\\1/2\\ million families each year afford a \ncollege education for their children. The work opportunity and welfare-\nto-work tax credits encourage businesses to create jobs for \neconomically disadvantaged workers. The research and development tax \ncredit enables businesses to develop innovative new products and stay \ncompetitive. The new markets tax credit generates investment in \nunderdeveloped areas across the country. If Congress does not renew \nthese tax incentives now, real people who depend on the opportunities \nthese tax benefits provide and the jobs they create will be hurt.\n  Let me describe the impact some of these tax provisions have had on \nmy own State of Massachusetts.\n  Over 97,000 Massachusetts families have benefited from the tuition \ntax deduction. For some of these students, this provision makes the \ndifference between being able to afford a higher education and being \ndenied the opportunity to fulfill their potential. For all of them, it \nprovides valuable financial assistance to cope with the rising cost of \ntuition and other school expenses.\n  According to the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, over 1,100 \ncompanies in our State--small and large--rely on the R tax credit. It \nhelps provide the financial resources for them to become leaders in \ninnovation, to create well-paying new jobs, and to compete more \neffectively in global markets.\n  In Massachusetts, investors like Bank of America and Citizens Bank \nare taking advantage of new markets credits to reinvigorate our \ncommunities. The revenue from these tax credits are used to turn vacant \nbuildings into thriving retail developments and even to rehabilitate \nendangered historic buildings. The Massachusetts Housing Investment \ncorporation has used its tax credits to finance the renovation of the \nhistoric Colonial Theatre in Pittsfield that will become a new \nperforming arts center. And in downtown Holyoke, the corporation \ninvested almost $19 million in the conversion of three historic \nbuildings into a new community health center providing primary care \nservices to the uninsured. These tax credits translate into real \nphysical improvements in our communities and improve the lives of our \ncitizens.\n  For nearly a year the Republican leadership has been holding the \nextension of these tax provisions hostage to their special interest \nagenda. First, the tax extenders were removed from budget \nreconciliation legislation to make room for capital gains and dividend \ntax breaks. Next, the extenders were tied to the virtual elimination of \nthe inheritance tax on multimillionaires' estates. Republican leaders \nvowed that the tax extenders would never pass unless the Senate \nacquiesced in their irresponsible estate tax scheme. Fortunately, that \ndid not work. Even now, after a decisive repudiation of their agenda by \nthe voters in last month's election, the Republicans are still \ninsisting on attaching special interest tax breaks to this ``must pass \nlegislation.'' They are now demanding an expansion of tax subsidies for \nhealth savings accounts that only the wealthy can afford to use. These \naccounts do nothing to help struggling families that cannot afford \nhealth insurance. Instead, HSAs are just one more tax avoidance scheme \nfor the wealthy created by this Republican Congress.\n  Had the leadership allowed a straightforward extension of these tax \nprovisions for working families and businesses to come to the Senate \nfloor, it would have passed with near unanimity months ago. But they \nwould not.\n  Health savings accounts already have the most preferential treatment \nin the tax code today. Unlike most other types of accounts, \ncontributions are not taxed, savings grow tax-free, and withdrawals are \ntax-free if they are used for health costs.\n  Health savings accounts largely benefit the healthy and wealthy. \nAccording to the Government Accountability Office, those using health \nsavings accounts disproportionately have high incomes. The average \nincome of those with HSAs was $133,000, almost three times the income \nof the average tax filer. GAO also found that those with higher incomes \nmade larger contributions to their accounts. The majority of those with \nHSAs did not withdraw any funds from them and many opened the accounts \nbecause they were a good way to shelter money from taxes.\n  But apparently the current HSA tax break was not a big enough tax \nloophole. The Republicans want to let the wealthy shelter even more \nmoney under the guise of health savings accounts.\n  The new provisions demonstrate that the real purpose of these \naccounts is to give the wealthy yet another vehicle to avoid paying \ntaxes. They allow people to ``overfund'' their accounts--to deduct more \nfrom their taxes than they\n\n[[Page S11670]]\n\nactually pay in medical expenses. It takes away the provision under \ncurrent law that limits HSA contributions to the annual amount of \nmedical expenses the insured must pay before his health insurance \ncoverage kicks in. It would actually encourage account holders to \nshelter more money than they expect to spend on medical expenses.\n  Deductibles for family health coverage that can be used in \nconjunction with an HSA today range from $2,100 to $10,500. A family \ncan put funds up to the threshold of their insurance coverage or \n$5,450, whichever is lower, into their account on a tax-free basis. \nThis bill delinks account funding from the amount of the health \ninsurance deductible, making it easier for wealthy persons to shelter \nfunds beyond what they need for health care. Under the new HSA language \ninserted in this bill, someone with a $2,100 deductible health plan \nwill be able to put $5,450 in their account and let it grow on a tax-\nfree basis.\n  The bill also will allow the one-time transfer of some funds from \nindividual retirement accounts into a health savings account without \nany taxes or penalty owed. This will allow wealthy individuals to shift \nfunds from retirement accounts whose distributions are treated as \nordinary income and subject to taxes into a health savings account \nwhose distributions are not taxed. This will offer another new tax \nbreak to the wealthy.\n  Health savings accounts may work well as tax shelters for the \nwealthy--and they will work even better with these new provisions--but \nthey do not work for low- and moderate-income families. While these \nfamilies may have a high-deductible health plan because it is all their \nemployer offers or because it is all they can afford, they rarely have \nthe means to fund a health savings account up to even the current \nlimit.\n  Make no mistake about it, the HSA provisions are meant to help \nwealthy individuals and the banks and investment vehicles that make \nmoney off their accounts. These are the people who will gain from the \nexpansions of HSAs, not the uninsured.\n  I also want to express some concerns I have about the trade \nprovisions that are included in this package. While trade brings \nenormous benefits to our economy, we need to ensure that free trade is \nfair trade. A provision in this bill regarding the Andean countries \nseverely limits the process for the free-trade agreements currently \nbeing negotiated and creates pressure to accept the inadequate \nagreements negotiated by the Bush administration.\n  Time and again this administration only requires countries to enforce \ntheir own labor laws and not live up to international standards. This \nis a serious problem where laws are weak. Peru has consistently denied \nworkers the right to form unions and to enforce their rights. In \nColumbia, labor advocates are blacklisted and even murdered for trying \nto exercise their democratic rights.\n  Ensuring that all countries meet basic labor standards benefits our \neconomy and American working families--it also strengthens the \neconomies in developing nations. U.S. workers should not be undermined \nby unfair competition with countries that do not honor worker rights. \nAnd the working people of Columbia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador deserve \nto have an agreement that is thoughtful and gives serious consideration \nto the significant issues of labor and human rights.\n  This is no way to conduct a trade policy. The United States can and \nmust do better.\n  I am also concerned that this bill will expand the District of \nColumbia voucher program, which is a program that diverts resources for \npublic schools and lacks accountability for student performance. Unlike \npublic schools, which are subject to the No Child Left Behind Act's \ndemanding accountability system, this program has little accountability \nfor improving student performance. It was authorized under very \nspecific guidelines designed to create a 5-year demonstration program \nfor low-income students. A provision expanding eligibility for the \nprogram was inserted in this bill by the House at the last minute. This \nprovision detracts from the program's focus on low-income families and \nshould be rejected. At a minimum, it should be proposed in a context \nopen to debate on its merits.\n  Because of the urgency of extending the important family and business \ntax benefits I discussed earlier, we must approve this legislation, \ndespite the special interest provisions that the Republican leadership \nhas attached to it. However, there will be a new Democratic Congress \ntaking office next month, and the outrageous provisions added by the \nRepublicans in the dark of night can be repealed in the light of day.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose this measure. In addition \nto containing some questionable policy provisions, such as the \nprovisions relating to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and granting \nVietnam permanent most-favored-nation trading status, the bill before \nus contains expensive entitlement spending and tax cuts that have not \nbeen fully offset. As a result, the legislation will increase the \ndeficit by $40 billion over the next 5 years.\n  I can count votes as well as the next person, and it is obvious that \nthis measure will pass and pass by a large margin and with bipartisan \nsupport. That is disappointing, because while Members of my own party \nhave rightly called for a return to the budget rules requiring that tax \ncuts and increased entitlement spending be offset, some are \nnevertheless pushing for the enactment of this measure without any \nserious effort to require such offsets.\n  One might wonder why that is. At least two reasons come to mind. \nFirst, there are reasons to believe that some in my party are anxious \nto get this bill through this year because they know full well that the \nnew incoming Democratic majority in the House and Senate would bristle \nat some of the trade provisions in this proposal. Those who have \nsupported the trade policies of the past several years understand that \nthis may be their last chance to pass questionable trade measures.\n  If that is the reason, I have little to say other than thank goodness \nthe 110th Congress is just around the corner. I am not sure the country \ncould withstand another week of the kind of trade policy that we have \nseen promoted by both members of both parties since the early 1990s.\n  It was during the session following the 1994 elections that a \nlameduck Congress passed legislation implementing the GATT trade \nagreement that established the World Trade Organization. The trade \nmodel that the GATT and NAFTA established has been devastating to \nthousands of communities across our country. We can only hope that the \naction taken by this lameduck Congress will mark the end of a \ndisastrous period of deeply flawed trade policies. And there is some \nhope because the November elections did result in dozens of new Members \nin both Houses who reject that ruinous trade model.\n  Beyond the trade issues, I have heard indirectly that some may want \nthese bills to go through during the 109th Congress so that their cost \nwould be assigned to the current budget rather than to a budget that \nthe new Democratic majority will craft next year. I certainly hope that \nthis scuttlebutt is unfounded because it reflects a cynical view of \ngoverning that we should reject. It certainly won't help those future \ngenerations of taxpayers who will be stuck with the additional debt \nthat will result from this bill.\n  The bill also includes a fiscally irresponsible provision that will \nresult in Outer Continental Shelf drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Just \na few months ago, the Senate approved this same misguided policy, which \nwill redirect billions of dollars in Federal revenues to just four \nStates. While I support efforts to provide needed assistance to those \naffected by Hurricane Katrina, we should not do so by creating a \nmassive and long-term new entitlement for a handful of States.\n  This measure has also been used to jam through a provision to expand \nthe income eligibility of the District of Columbia school voucher \nprogram. I oppose school vouchers because such programs funnel taxpayer \nmoney away from the public schools and instead direct Federal dollars \nto private schools that do not have to adhere to the same Federal, \nState, and local accountability provisions, civil rights laws, and \nregulations that apply to public schools.\n  However, as is the case of nearly any bill of this size, there are \nsome good provisions in it. This bill provides relief for physicians \nwho would have seen\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\na reduction in payment of 5.1 percent in the absence of legislative \naction, and it goes a step further to provide payments for physicians \nwho report quality-of-care data. This is a first step toward \nimplementing some kind of pay-for-performance in Medicare, and I think \nthis is something that should be pursued. Quality improvement is \ncertainly something that the State of Wisconsin has been a leader in, \nand I am happy to see that there are Federal incentives for quality \nimprovement.\n  I am especially pleased to see that this bill includes a measure that \nis very important to Wisconsin and other rural States--an extension of \na provision enacted in the Medicare Modernization Act, MMA, that will \nkeep physicians in rural States paid at a comparable level to those in \nother States. Under current Medicare law, Wisconsin physicians are paid \nless than physicians in other areas of the country, even though the \nwork they do is identical. This provision helps address this inequity \nso that physicians who practice in States with large rural areas will \nnot be at a disadvantage. I am pleased to see that Congress has taken \nthe right steps to ensure that Medicare dollars are more fairly \ndistributed throughout the State of Wisconsin and our Nation.\n  These fixes for physician payment will be paid for with the Medicare \nslush fund that provided ``bonus'' payments to insurance companies. \nThese payments were unnecessary and simply provided a cash flow of \ntaxpayer dollars to an industry already awash in money. I have long \nadvocated for elimination of this fund, and I am glad to see it used in \na way that actually benefits the American people rather than big \nbusiness.\n  There are other good measures in the health portion of this bill. \nThese include technical corrections to the so-called Deficit Reduction \nAct, an extension of a provision to help Medicare beneficiaries have \nbetter access to physical therapy, and a provision to help protect \nState Medicaid budgets. These are all important to the health care of \npeople in our country, and are policies that I support.\n  It is unfortunate that this bill does not include a measure agreed to \nin the proposed Senate bill that would have preserved children's health \ncare in our country. This measure was budget neutral, a good policy, \nand the right thing to do, but the other body would not agree to this \nprovision that would have prevented budget shortfalls in State \nChildren's Health Insurance Programs, SCHIP, in 14 States in fiscal \nyear 2007. Wisconsin is one of the States that will see a shortfall \nnext year, and I will work aggressively to see that this shortfall is \naddressed before it harms children in Wisconsin. It is shameful that \nCongress will add $40 billion to our deficit for tax breaks, but we \ncannot agree to a budget-neutral measure to provide health care to \nchildren who would otherwise not have it.\n  Despite some worthy provisions, this bill, on balance, is fiscally \nirresponsible, and I cannot support it. Perhaps the most telling gauge \nof this bill's cost is that it even violates the lax budget rules set \nforth in the last budget resolution adopted by this Congress, the 2005 \nbudget resolution. That is right,this bill violates the loose fiscal \nrules adopted by Congress 2 years ago.\n  In some ways, this bill is a fitting end to the 109th Congress. It is \na fair summary of the fiscal recklessness in which the White House and \nthis Congress have engaged. I very much hope that when they take their \nseats in the 110th Congress, the new majority will govern in a more \nfiscally responsible manner, adopt tough, commonsense budget rules, and \nput an end to this kind of budget-busting, debt-swelling legislation.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I regret that I cannot support the tax \nextender bill before us today.\n  I have long worked to ensure the passage of several of the provisions \ncontained in this bill. In particular, I strongly support the extension \nof the tax provisions and the OCS drilling provisions. In fact, I have \nvoted for enactment of both of these pieces of legislation a number of \ntimes this year. I am very saddened that these provisions are presented \nbefore the Senate today coupled as a part of a larger package that I \ncannot favor.\n  I want to make it clear to my constituents and to American families, \ntaxpayers and businesses that I recognize the immense importance of the \ntax extender provisions and will do all that I can to ensure that they \nare enacted as soon as possible.\n  Likewise, I am a cosponsor of Senator Domenici's original Senate bill \nregarding OCS drilling and I look forward to the day these provisions \nbecome law. This bill is a first step in providing domestic energy that \nwill bring down prices while decreasing our dependence on Middle \nEastern oil. I will continue to work toward expanded access in the Gulf \nof Mexico and with any other states who would like to pursue offshore \ndrilling.\n  Despite my strong support for many provisions of this bill, I must \noppose it because I have a number of fundamental concerns about it.\n  First and foremost, I object vehemently to the inclusion of \nlegislation granting permanent normal trade relations status, PNTR, to \nVietnam in this bill. The decision of whether to grant PNTR status to \nVietnam is a very important decision that will have consequences well \ninto the future and it deserves to be debated on its own merits by both \nthe House and Senate. It is inappropriate for legislation of this \nmagnitude to be attached to other relatively noncontroversial \nlegislation in an attempt to quiet any objections and ensure its \nenactment.\n  I have spent a lot of time contemplating whether I should support the \ngranting of PNTR status to Vietnam. I serve on the Senate Finance \nCommittee and I was disturbed by a number of issues that were raised \nduring committee consideration of this issue. I voted ``Present'' when \nthis legislation was approved by the committee because I wanted to have \nmore time to examine these issues more in depth. What I have found has \ndisturbed me and made it impossible for me to support such a measure at \nthis time.\n  I believe that access to free markets should depend on access to \nother freedoms such as political freedom and human rights. Despite \nincreased diplomatic ties between the United States and Vietnam over \nthe past 15 years, we must not forget that Vietnam is still a Communist \ncountry. A country made up of only one political party that continues \nto deny its citizens the basic freedoms of speech, press, and religion.\n  Now some of my colleagues would argue that we should grant permanent \nnormal trade relations, PNTR, to Vietnam because the State Department \nrecently removed them from their list of ``Countries of Concern'' for \nsevere violations of religious freedom. Vietnam has been on this list \nfor the last ten years but was removed this year--just one day before \nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation--APEC--Leaders Meeting in \nVietnam. I believe that they were removed more for diplomatic reasons \nthan anything else. Evidence presented to me by the International \nCommission on Religious Freedom shows that Vietnam has done very little \nto warrant such a removal.\n  Vietnam's record on human rights and religious freedom is abysmal--\nabsolutely abysmal. Hundreds of political and religious prisoners \nremain behind bars in a country that lacks any sort of a real judicial \nsystem. Arrests and detentions of religious leaders continue daily. \nThey are often arrested for no other reason than the practice of their \nreligion or for possession of nongovernment-mandated religious \nmaterials such as Bibles.\n  Forced renunciations of faith also continue on a daily basis. While \nthis is prohibited by Vietnamese law there is no criminal penalty for \ncarrying out this practice--so it continues. In this practice, \nreligious followers are detained, threatened, and beaten in order to \nforce them to recant their faith or stop their religious activities. I \nask my colleagues to imagine what it would be like to have your faith \nliterally beaten out of you? I find such a practice perverse.\n  Aside from beatings and renunciations of faith, churches are often \ndestroyed, property is seized and people are continually placed under \nhouse arrest. Religious materials and charitable activities are also \nseverely restricted by the government. They even retain the right to \nappoint all Catholic bishops and seminarians; a right that is reserved \nsolely for the Vatican. In the past year, Vietnam has done very little \nto help strengthen its relations with the Vatican and still refuses to\n\n[[Page S11672]]\n\nallow them to build a seminary in their country.\n  Vietnam has acknowledged the fact that these abuses occur. Last year \nthey even went so far as to enter into agreement with the State \nDepartment to try to end such abuses, but unfortunately little if any \nreal progress was made especially in the rural areas of the Central and \nNorthwest Highlands. While there was a great deal of talk of reform, \nthere was little action. This is at a time when Vietnam is seeking to \nmore fully participate in the global economy and international \ncommunity. I find that unacceptable.\n  I fear that in granting Vietnam permanent normal trade relations, \nPNTR, we would take away a key incentive for them to implement any type \nof real reform.\n  Vietnam is on its best behavior while it is under the international \nspotlight, but what will happen after this trade deal is signed? I fear \nthat the consequences of this would be too great.\n  In addition to my opposition to the inclusion of the Vietnam trade \nprovisions in this legislation, this package also includes a health \ncomponent that primarily deals with the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. \nI am extremely disappointed that the negotiators on this bill decided \nto take money from the Medicare stabilization fund to pay for other \nspending in the bill.\n  When Congress created the new Medicare drug benefit in 2003, it was \nvery important to me and other Members that all Medicare beneficiaries \nhave access to Medicare managed-care plans. The stabilization fund was \ncreated to provide incentives for managed care plans to remain or enter \nthe Medicare Advantage program, thereby ensuring that beneficiaries in \nrural areas of this country--including many parts of Kentucky--had \naccess to Medicare managed care plans.\n  Some people argue that the stabilization fund is not necessary. Quite \nhonestly, however, it is too early to tell if this fund is necessary. \nThe Medicare Advantage program has only been up and running for 1 year. \nAt this point, we don't know what will happen to the Medicare Advantage \nprogram 5 or 10 years down the road, and we shouldn't be spending the \nmoney from the stabilization fund before we do.\n  This fund was supposed to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have \nequal access to managed care plans, and it is irresponsible for \nCongress to view this account as a piggy bank to fund other spending.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the budgetary \nimpact of this bill. As Chairman Gregg of the Senate Budget Committee \nhas already pointed out, this bill is a budget buster. It will break \nthe budget by at least $17 billion. The bulk of the cost of this bill \nis not found in the tax extenders--they represent less than a third of \nthe cost. The cost of this bill is in the extraneous items that were \nadded to the bill--many, I suspect, in order to ensure its passage \ntoday.\n  I am sorry to see that some of my colleagues are more interested in \nquickly going home rather than working to draft legislation that falls \nwithin our budget and is more than the Christmas tree we have here. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and to continue to work \nto find another solution on how to pass some of the good provisions in \nthis package.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor, and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. The question is on agreeing \nto the motion to waive the Budget Act.

Without objection, the Senate concurs in the \nHouse amendment to the title.\n  Mr. FRIST. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RAMONA LESSEN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I say hello to her as I come to the office \nevery morning. And I say goodbye to her after I have closed the Senate \neach evening. The ``her'' is Ramona Lessen, my gatekeeper, my jailer, a \ndistinguished member of my staff.\n  Twelve years ago, I was a newly elected Senator, a brandnew Senator \nwho got lost trying to find his way to this place called the Russell \nBuilding. My chief of staff was just as green, just as new as me. We \nwere all learning the ropes of the Senate together. But one member of \nour staff at least was not new. She took us under her experienced wing, \nand we took off on what has been a magical flight.\n  That person is Ramona Lessen, my executive assistant, who became very \nquickly the geographic and operational commander and controller of the \nFrist office.\n  Little did I realize when I first brought Ramona onboard that she \nwould sit right outside--right outside--my office door, for not the \nnext year or 2 years or 3 years or 4 years, but for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, \n11, 12 years. As many of my colleagues know, I am a pilot, and I have \nflown a long time. I love to fly. And nothing is more comforting when \nyou are flying an airplane close to a thunderstorm, and you are there \nalone, but you are talking to an air traffic control tower, and the \nvoice on the other end is somebody who is reassuring, somebody who is \ncalm, somebody who gets the big picture, who knows what is at stake and \nultimately can vector you right around that thunderstorm.\n  And that is Ramona. Ramona, who is the expert in terms of scheduling, \nin terms of that coordination, who keeps the flights landing safely and \nkeeps those flights landing on time. She prioritizes literally hundreds \nof meeting requests with flexibility and efficiency. And when someone \nputs a last-minute kink in the schedule, which as we all know occurs \nall too often, she works hard to correct it. She handles it with \nperfect aplomb.\n  When other staff members are out traveling with me or at committee \nmeetings or monitoring the floor, Ramona is back in that office holding \ndown the fort. She is always working behind the scenes to make our \nlives run as smoothly as possible. It gets hectic. Everybody here knows \nthat. Everybody wants something all the time. And I know there are many \ndays when she is--and these are her words--``hanging on by her \nfingernails.'' But despite the intense pressures of her job, the stress \nof juggling that busy schedule and responding to untold invitations and \nmeeting requests, not to mention working for a demanding--not so \ndemanding, but a demanding--boss, Ramona not only maintains her cool, \nbut she keeps the office upbeat and literally fun.\n  Her talents take many forms. She is a professional pianist, \nprofessional at least in my eyes. You will find her playing at our \nChristmas parties, at the Bible study groups we have here, at her \nchurch, and even in the studios in Music City USA, Nashville, TN.\n  She is a formidable athlete. She runs a little slow but a formidable \nathlete. She led the Frist staff softball team to winning seasons--\nchampionship seasons really; but we will say winning seasons--for 4 \nconsecutive years, pitching with a changeup that baffled even the most \nexperienced batters.\n  She does have an infectious laugh, that endearing cackle that we all \nknow and have come to love. She treats the staff to doughnuts on many a \nFriday. She keeps me posted on the whereabouts of former staff members, \nMembers who worked with us 12 years ago and 10 years ago and 8 years \nago. And if you go into her office back in the majority leader's \noffice, she has a baby board with candid photos of our staff and their \nchildren.\n  She frequently carpools in with her beloved husband Joe, who is \nalways at her side, who has also spent many a late night out front \nwaiting for her, as we finished business. And most people know we \nfinish fairly late.\n  She gave us daily updates when her son Robert was proudly serving in \nIraq, representing freedom, and their son\n\n[[Page S11674]]\n\nJonathan was proudly serving in Afghanistan--a family proudly serving \nthis country.\n  Ramona is the glue of the Senate Frist staff family, and she is an \nextension of my own family. When we first moved to Washington, she \nreached out, she helped Karyn and me and our three boys, Bryan, \nJonathan, and Harrison settle into a new city, a new city we had spent \nno time in at all. She has watched my three sons grow from three young \nboys to three young men.\n  Ramona, you have kept my life organized for 12 years. You have \nfaithfully served your country in the Senate for 27 years--27\\1/2\\ \nyears. And you have done a tremendous, tremendous job.\n  Thank you, Ramona, for sticking with us all these years. Thank you, \nand we love you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11674-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THANKING STAFF WHO WORKED ON THE GULF OF MEXICO SECURITY LEGISLATION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to just take a minute. I spoke \nbefore the vote and thanked many of my colleagues for their \nextraordinary work on passing the Gulf of Mexico security bill, which \nSenator Domenici led and so many of us helped. But I did not have an \nopportunity at that time to thank so many staff people who put their \nheart and mind and spirit into this action, which is really a historic \naccomplishment for the State of Louisiana and the gulf coast.\n  This effort goes back 9 years, and there are many staff people who \ncontributed. I want to read into the Record and mention some of the \nEnergy staffers who worked with me over the years, and legislative \ndirectors and chiefs of staff who have helped make this possible: \nDionne Thompson, Ben Cannon, Jason Schendle, Tom Michels, Elizabeth \nCraddock, Kathleen Strottman, Jason Matthews, Janet Woodka, Adam Sharp, \nRich Masters, Norma Jane Sabiston, and my current chief of staff, Ron \nFaucheux.\n  There were many other staffers on the committees, from both sides of \nthe aisle, who helped to make this bill possible. But in the Landrieu \noffice, none of this would have gotten done without the people who just \nworked tireless hours, year after year, through victory and defeat, \nthrough disappointments and setbacks, to keep their eye on the ball to \nmake this historic bill that is going to do so much to help the \nsouthern part of our State, the entire State, and the whole southern \npart of the United States, to gain its footing, to rebuild, to restore \nthese wetlands, and protect some great infrastructure for America.\n  So I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Frist and \nSenator Reid, for their work in guiding us to victory tonight. Thank \nyou.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11674-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11674-S11677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               POSTAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, shortly, the Senate will consider H.R. \n6407, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. As the Presiding \nOfficer is very well aware, since he has been a key player in molding \nthis important legislation, this postal reform legislation has been a \nlong time coming. And it is great news for the U.S. economy.\n  This legislation represents the culmination of a process that began \nback in 2002 when a group of constituents came to me, sat down with me \nin Maine, and taught me the importance of the Postal Service to the \nviability of their businesses and to the employees they had.\n  This coalition of groups included a Maine catalog company, a paper \nmanufacturer, a printer, a local financial services company, and a \npublisher. They all came together and it was from them that I learned \njust how vital the Postal Service is to our economy.\n  So shortly after that meeting in the summer of 2002, I introduced a \nbill to establish a Presidential commission charged with examining the \nproblems of the Postal Service and charged with developing specific \nrecommendations and legislative proposals that the Congress and the \nPostal Service could implement.\n  The President appointed the members of the commission. They worked \nvery hard. They came up with an excellent report which provided, in \nmany ways, the basis for the landmark legislation that I believe we \nwill finally clear tonight.\n  During the next 4 years, the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, which I had been privileged to chair, worked very \nhard to craft the most sweeping changes in the U.S. Postal Service in \nmore than 30 years.\n  Senate passage of this legislation will help the 225-year-old Postal \nService meet the challenges of the 21st century.\n  As a Senator representing a large rural State, I want to ensure that \nmy constituents, whether they live in the northern woods or on our \nislands or in our many small rural communities, have the same access to \nPostal Services as the people of our cities. If the Postal Service were \nno longer to provide universal service and deliver mail to every \ncustomer, the affordable communications link upon which many Americans \nrely would be jeopardized. Most commercial enterprises would find it \nuneconomical, if not impossible, to deliver mail and packages to rural \nAmericans at the affordable rates charged by the Postal Service.\n  But for several years now, the Postal Service has clung to the edge \nof an abyss. Under the business model in which it has been forced to \noperate, the Postal Service has been at great financial risk. In fact, \nthe Government Accountability Office aptly describes it as a potential \ndeath spiral in which escalating rates lead to lower volume, which in \nturn leads to even higher rates, which in turn causes the Postal \nService to lose more business.\n  The Postal Service faces the challenge of the electronic age. It also \nhas been saddled with more than $90 billion in unfunded liabilities and \nobligations, which has included debt to the Treasury, nearly $7 billion \nto workers' comp claims, $5 billion for retirement costs, and as much \nas $45 billion to cover retiree health care costs. The Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States, David Walker, has cited these figures to \npoint to the urgent need for ``fundamental reforms to minimize the risk \nof a significant taxpayer bailout for a dramatic postal rate \nincrease.'' And it is telling, indeed, that the Postal Service has been \non GAO's high-risk list since April of 2001.\n  With this landmark reform legislation, we will put the Postal Service \non a firm financial footing. We endorse the principle of universal \nservice, of affordable, predictable postal rates. This legislation will \nmodernize the Postal Service's rate-setting process and provide much-\nneeded rate predictability for postal customers. Without this reform, \npostal ratepayers would have faced billions of dollars in higher--much \nhigher--rates over the next several years.\n  The 750,000 career employees of the Postal Service often labor \nwithout anyone really knowing who they are, but their efforts play an \nabsolutely essential role in the American economy. The Postal Service \nis the linchpin of a $900 billion mailing industry that employs 9 \nmillion people in fields as diverse as direct mailing, printing, \ncatalog companies, paper manufacturing, publishing, and financial \nservices. The health of the Postal Service, therefore, is essential to \nthe vitality of thousands of companies and the millions of employees \nthey serve.\n  This bill represents years of hard work. As chairman of the committee \nwith jurisdiction, I held a series of eight hearings, including a joint \nhearing with our House colleagues, during which we reviewed the \nrecommendations of the President's commission and we heard from a wide \nrange of experts and stakeholders, including representatives of the \npostal employees unions, the Postal Service itself, administration \nofficials, mailers, the postmasters, postal supervisors, publishers--a \nwide variety of groups. In fact, there is a broad coalition supporting \nthis bill, including many nonprofit mailers, which rely on affordable \npostal rates.\n  There are many people who have worked very hard to craft the very \ndelicate compromise that is before us tonight. I particularly thank \nSenators Carper, Coleman, and Lieberman for\n\n[[Page S11675]]\n\ntheir assistance but also our House colleagues. I will have more to say \nabout them later.\n  The compromise legislation before the Senate replaces the current \nlengthy and litigious rate-setting process with a rate cap-based \nstructure for products such as first class mail, periodicals, and \nlibrary mail. For 10 years, the price changes for market-dominant \nproducts like these will be subject to a 45-day prior review period by \nthe Postal Regulatory Commission. The Postal Service will have much \nmore flexibility, but the rates will be capped at the CPI. That is an \nimportant element of providing 10 years of predictable, affordable \nrates, which will help every customer of the Postal Service plan.\n  After 10 years, the Postal Regulatory Commission will review the rate \ncap and, if necessary, and following a notice and comment period, the \nCommission will be authorized to modify or adopt an alternative system.\n  While this bill provides for a decade of rate stability, I continue \nto believe that the preferable approach was the permanent flexible rate \ncap that was included in the Senate-passed version of this legislation. \nBut, on balance, this bill is simply too important, and that is why we \nhave reached this compromise to allow it to pass. We at least will see \na decade of rate stability, and I believe the Postal Rate Commission, \nat the end of that decade, may well decide that it is best to continue \nwith a CPI rate cap in place. It is also, obviously, possible for \nCongress to act to reimpose the rate cap after it expires. But this \nlegislation is simply too vital to our economy to pass on a decade of \nstability. The consequences of no legislation would be disastrous for \nthe Postal Service, its employees, and its customers.\n  Among other highlights of the compromise, the bill will reform the \nPostal Service workers' compensation system to require a 3-day waiting \nperiod. This is consistent with every State workers' compensation \nprogram. The bill introduces new safeguards against unfair competition \nby the Postal Service in competitive markets, prohibits subsidization \nof competitive products by market-dominant products, and requires an \nallocation of institutional costs to competitive products.\n\n  I note that we looked at competitive issues with UPS and FedEx, and I \nthink we have come up with the right balance here. The bill transforms \nthe existing Postal Rate Commission into the Postal Regulatory \nCommission with enhanced authority to ensure that there is greater \noversight of the Postal Service as its management assumes greater \nresponsibility.\n  The bill reaffirms postal employees' rights to collectively bargain. \nIt changes the bargaining process only in small ways and only in ways \nthat have been agreed to by both the Postal Service and the four major \nunions.\n  Another significant provision amends the current law to essentially \nfree up $78 billion over 6 years. This is a complicated issue. It has \nto do with the responsibility for paying for the military retirement \ncredits of postal employees and also money that was put into an escrow \naccount to compensate for an overpayment into the civil service \nretirement system. These savings will be used to pay off debt to the \nU.S. Treasury, to fund health care liabilities, and to mitigate future \nrate increases.\n  This compromise is not perfect and, indeed, earlier tonight, there \nwere issues raised by the appropriators--legitimate issues--that \nthreatened at one point to derail the bill again. It has been a \ndelicate compromise to satisfy all of the competing concerns. Everyone \nhas had to compromise, but I think we have come up with a good bill. \nThis compromise will help ensure a strong financial future for the U.S. \nPostal Service and the many sectors of our economy that rely on its \nservices, and it reaffirms our commitment to the principle of universal \nservice that I believe is absolutely vital to this institution.\n  Finally, there are so many people both within Congress, within the \nadministration, and among the stakeholders who have worked very hard to \nbring this legislation to a successful conclusion. I cannot name them \nall, but I want to name some of them.\n  Senator Carper and his staffer, John Kilvington, have been here every \nstep of the way. Senator Carper was the original cosponsor of the bill \nand has worked very hard to bring the compromise about.\n  Senators Lieberman, Coleman, Akaka, and Voinovich also have played \nvery important roles.\n  Our leaders, Senator Frist and Senator Reid, have been vitally \ninterested and have helped us get this job done.\n  In the House, Chairman Tom Davis and the ranking Democrat Henry \nWaxman of the Government Reform Committee, also worked hard to produce \na bill and to work with us to bring about the compromise.\n  A true hero of this effort, a person who worked on postal issues for \na decade, is Congressman John McHugh.\n  The administration has played an absolutely critical role in bringing \nus to where we are today. The administration often doesn't get credit \nfor that, and they deserve credit. They have worked with us to come up \nwith solutions on the financial issues in this bill, and without the \nstrong support of the administration, we would not be here tonight.\n  I want to particularly salute OMB Director Rob Portman; Michael Bopp, \nmy former staff director, who is now working at OMB and brought his \nexpertise to bear on this issue; Jess Sharp and Candi Wolff of the \nWhite House staff; and of course the staff of the Postal Service \nitself, which was always there with expertise, particularly Kim Weaver.\n  But most of all, I thank Ann Fisher of my staff, who has worked for \nyears on this bill. This has been an issue which has meant a great deal \nto her, and she has been working on postal issues for a long time. She \nis a recognized expert, and without her expertise, we would not be here \ntonight.\n  I finally also want to thank the committee's new staff director, \nBrandon Milhorn, for bringing his judgment to bear on this issue.\n  There are so many people who have worked so hard, but the collective \neffort of everyone has produced a bill of which we can be proud.\n  It is not a perfect bill, but I am convinced it will put the U.S. \nPostal Service on a sound financial footing for years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I concur with many of the remarks the \nSenator from Maine has made. She has listed a host of people who played \ncritical roles in the adoption of the legislation, hammering out a \ndifficult compromise over the last 4 years. I salute her for her \nleadership and thank her for her leadership.\n  I especially say thank you to Ann Fisher, who has served for Senator \nCollins and really for us, for the great work she has done in the \ncourse of this effort.\n  I have been blessed with my own staff and a young man named John \nKilvington from New Castle, DE, who came here with me 6 years ago and \nbecame an expert of his own with respect to postal reform, and has \nworked long and hard, even into this night, to bridge our differences \nand to get us over one last hurdle.\n  There is a reason why we only do postal reform once every 36 years, \nand the reason is that it is tough to do. There are so many competing \ninterests--mailers large and small in areas rural and urban, the labor \nunions involved trying to do their best to represent hundreds of \nthousands of postal employees; there are competitors, UPS and FedEx, \nthat didn't exist a number of years ago.\n  In fact, if you go back in time to 1970 when the current business \nmodel for the Postal Service was created by then junior Senator Ted \nStevens, who today is our President pro tempore and one of the most \nsenior Senators in the Senate, he provided the leadership in 1970 to \ncreate the U.S. Postal Service.\n  At the time and for many years thereafter, it was the right business \nmodel for providing postal service to the people of this country. But a \nlot has changed since 1970. In 1970, I was a lieutenant JG on the other \nside of the world in Southeast Asia the year the Postal Service, as we \nknow it, was born.\n  One of the things different--I think of the current war that many of \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are waging--in the Vietnam \nwar, we didn't have any e-mails. We had mail call. It was one of the \nhighlights of our day every day. We had no cell phones\n\n[[Page S11676]]\n\nwith which to communicate with our loved ones. We had no bank by phone. \nWe had no electronic banking. Direct deposits were new. There was no \nsuch thing as a FedEx or UPS to provide the kind of competition the \nPostal Service faces today, and no threat of anthrax in the mail.\n  The world has changed dramatically, and also the way that we exchange \ninformation, the way we communicate with one another has changed \ndramatically, too. The Postal Service needs to change as well. With the \nadoption of this legislation, it will.\n  I extend my heartfelt thanks to our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives with whom we have served and worked on this challenge, \nparticularly Congressman McHugh who led the fight for a decade or more, \nCongressman Davis who chairs the relevant committee in the House, and \nalso Congressman Henry Waxman, with whom I served years ago in the \nHouse, entered the fray and helped, along with Congressman Davis and \nothers, to get us to the finish line.\n  I don't want to belabor what this bill does or does not do, but it \nacknowledges this is not 1970 anymore; this is 2006. We will still have \nuniversal delivery for the mail. We will still receive that mail 6 days \na week. The Postal Service will still be expected, when somebody builds \na new house or starts a new business, to deliver mail to those places.\n  I am told during the course of the year at least a million new \ncustomers come online for the Postal Service, and the Postal Service \nwill be there through rain, sleet, and snow to deliver the mail to all \nthose customers.\n  The Postal Service under the legislation we have is going to act more \nlike a business. They will have an opportunity to price their products \nmore competitively and overall can put together a whole slew of postal \nproducts. Overall, the price of those products cannot go up in a given \nyear by more than the rate of inflation, but individual products can. \nProduct A can go up more than product B and product C more than product \nD. Over the next 10 years, the overall increase in the cost of postal \nproducts can rise above the cost of living. That will provide a measure \nof stability to the huge industry that relies on the post office and a \ngood postal service.\n  For those who compete with the Postal Service--and there are very \nstrong and good competitors; UPS and FedEx are among those--they will \nhave the opportunity to continue to compete, but I think they will be \non a playing field that is a bit more level where the first-class mail \nthe Postal Service will continue to enjoy a monopoly on will not be \nable to underwrite the cost of their competitive products with \ncompanies such as UPS and FedEx.\n  One of the things I am happiest about--and I give Senator Collins the \ncredit on this for convincing the administration to agree on two \npoints: One, folks who served in the military to come to work in the \nPostal Service and eventually earn a postal pension. The mailers, \npeople who buy stamps, mailers large and small shouldn't have to pay \nfor the military service that later accrues to those same individuals \nwhen they retire from the Postal Service. It is not fair to the \nmailers. It is not fair to the public. Those costs should be borne by \nthe Treasury, and under this bill they will be.\n\n  And secondly, for many years folks thought the Postal Service was \nunderpaying its pension costs for its employees. A couple years ago the \nOffice of Personnel Management did a study and found that rather than \nunderpaying pension obligations, they are overpaying, and if they \ncontinue at the rate they are going, they will be making a big \noverpayment in the years to come.\n  This legislation corrects that situation. It says that in the future, \nthe Postal Service, 10 years out, will have access to a fair amount of \nmoney that would have gone into overpayments. In the meantime, a lot of \nmoney is going to be used to pay down the unamortized cost of health \ncare. Tens of billions of costs will be paid off, and that will put the \nPostal Service in stronger financial shape going forward.\n  Lastly, I want to mention the administration. I know Senator Collins \nhas as well. In the negotiations that lasted for years on this \nlegislation, the administration, particularly in the last weeks, \nespecially played a constructive role. I single out among those Michael \nBopp, who previously served on the staff for Senator Collins, and his \nhelp was critical, as was that of Rob Portman and a number of others in \nthe administration.\n  Our people said this is perfect legislation. I am not aware of any \nperfect legislation I have been associated with. This was a hard one to \nput together. My dad used to say that the hardest things to do are the \nthings that are worth doing. If that is any indication, this is \nsomething worth doing. I am grateful to all who played a part.\n  The hour is late, about 2:20 in the morning. I am ready to call it a \nday, and I know we will have other business to do.\n  Again I thank my colleagues, those within the mailing public, the \nPostal Service, Jack Porter, our Postmaster General, and all who worked \nto get us to this point in time, and particularly to Patty Murray who \nworked with us tonight to get past a real tough spot.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while the chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee is on the floor, I want to say congratulations, \nthrough the Chair, to her for a tremendous success on the Postal \nAccountability and Enforcement Act which will be passed shortly. It was \na tremendous accomplishment and one she and I have been in touch with a \nlot by e-mails in the middle of the night, as it came to my mind how \nimportant this particular bill is. I will say a few remarks about that.\n  I did want to congratulate her for a tremendous success on a bill \npeople said was impossible to pass, and 6 months ago people said it was \nimpossible to pass, and a month ago people said it was going to be a \nchallenge, and even 3 days ago saying it was a challenge. But in a \nbipartisan way coming together, bicameral--the House and Senate--it is \na tremendous accomplishment.\n  For more than 225 years, America's postal system has kept Americans \nconnected. We depend on the Postal Service to keep in touch with family \nand friends, to send birthday greetings, ship care packages--and a \nlittle taste of home--to our students, pay the bills, and even to learn \nwe might win a million dollars if we act right now.\n  The U.S. Postal Service operates on a single, deep-rooted principle: \nEvery person in the United States--no matter who, no matter where--has \nthe right to equal access to secure, efficient, and affordable mail \nservice.\n  Today, that translates into serving 7.5 million customers daily in \nover 37,000 post offices, providing stamps at more than 27,800 vending \nmachines, nearly 25,500 commercial retail outlets, nearly 15,300 \nbanking and credit union ATMs, and 2,500 automated postal centers, and \ndelivering 212 billion pieces of mail annually to over 144 million \nhomes, businesses, and post office boxes in virtually every city and \ntown in the country.\n  But the Postal Service we know today is vastly different than our \nancestors knew 225 years ago or even 75 years ago or 50 years ago. \nBefore there were ZIP codes and mail carriers with home delivery \nroutes--before Priority Mail and Express Mail, before air mail--the \nPostal Service was an informal network that kept settlers and colonists \nin touch with each other and their homelands.\n  The U.S. Postal Service's history is a story of transformation from \nthe steamboats and the pony express in the 19th century, to delivery \nconfirmation and online package tracking of the 21st century.\n  But in order for the Postal Service to take the next step, in order \nfor the Postal Service to continue delivering on the promise of its \nfundamental operating principle, Congress must act, and tonight we will \ndo just that.\n  The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act enables the Postal \nService to maintain its competitive edge. It streamlines the rate-\nsetting process for market-dominant products,\n\n[[Page S11677]]\n\nsuch as first-class mail, periodicals, and library mail.\n  It removes the redtape and increases the efficiency of the rate-\nsetting process by granting new authorities to the Postal Regulatory \nCommission and the Postal Service Board of Governors.\n  It introduces new safeguards against unfair competition by the Postal \nService in competitive markets. It transforms the Postal Rate \nCommission into the Postal Regulatory Commission and grants the new \nbody enhanced authorities to ensure appropriate oversight of postal \nmanagement.\n  It ensures increased financial transparency by requiring the Postal \nService to file certain financial disclosure forms in detailed annual \nreports.\n  It reaffirms USPS employees' right to collectively bargain by \ninstituting changes already agreed upon by the Postal Service and the \nfour major unions.\n  It brings continuation of payrolls into lines already established by \nevery State's workers compensation program, and it increases the \nfairness of USPS employees' pension benefits.\n  This bill is comprehensive in the scope and depth of the reforms it \ninstitutes. But these changes are necessary and essential to helping \nthe U.S. Postal Service continue its more than 225 years of reliable \nand efficient mail service. I once again congratulate Chairman Susan \nCollins, and I do thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting this \nvery important measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11677-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11677-S11678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GULF OF MEXICO ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on another issue, one of the most \nsignificant components of the legislation we passed about 30 minutes \nago is the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. This measure \nwill open more than 8 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to domestic \nenergy production. In doing so, it will help to make America more \nenergy independent. It will lower oil and natural gas prices for \nAmerican consumers, and it will help to preserve jobs right here in \nAmerica--jobs that have been migrating overseas due to high natural gas \nprices. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, since \nthe year 2006, more than 3 million highways and manufacturing jobs have \nbeen lost due to high energy prices.\n  The area opened up under this bill is estimated to contain a \nremarkable 1.26 billion barrels of oil and over 5.8 trillion cubic feet \nof natural gas. That is roughly the same amount of oil as the proven \nreserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma combined and more than six times our \ncurrent imports of liquefied natural gas each year.\n  These estimates could be the tip of the iceberg. This fall, the \nChevron discovery in a nearby area found an estimated 3 to 15 billion \nbarrels of oil, the largest discovery in a generation. This find alone \ncould boost U.S. domestic oil reserves by 50 percent.\n  Efforts have been underway to try to open this area in the Gulf of \nMexico for more than a decade. In November 1996, the Clinton \nadministration Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt proposed opening the \nso-called Lease Area 181 to oil and gas production. Yet, for various \nreasons, the area has not been leased and America has not been \nbenefiting from the energy resources we know it contains--until now.\n  In a post-9/11 world, energy security is a matter of national \nsecurity. We must take steps, real steps, meaningful steps to reduce \nour dependence on foreign sources of energy, particularly from \ncountries hostile to the United States. Now, more than ever, America \nneeds America's energy. That is what this provision does: It brings \nmore American energy to American consumers.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort all along the way. The Senate \npassed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act on August 1 by a vote of \n71 to 25. Chairman Domenici led the way on the issue in partnership \nwith Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter, and the entire gulf coast \ndelegation. I do want to salute their efforts and also to thank the \nassistant majority leader, Senator McConnell, for spearheading this \nissue on behalf of leadership.\n  I also thank the tremendous staff, bipartisan staff who helped \nshepherd this issue through both the House and the Senate. In \nparticular, I thank on my own staff Libby Jarvis, who represented \nleadership at the table throughout these negotiations.\n  I truly believe this is one of the most significant accomplishments \nof the 109th Congress which will have a lasting impact on American \nconsumers and on our economy. I am very pleased we were able to get it \nover the finish line as part of this important package.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, and as an original cosponsor and a \nprinciple architect of S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, \nI wanted to rise today to offer my perspective on the bill. This bill \nis now part of a broader package that was considered today in the House \nH.R. 6111. The package passed by a vote of 367-45. I sincerely hope and \nbelieve that the Senate will pass this historic legislation later \ntonight or sometime this weekend and that if it is tonight or tomorrow, \nit will be a historic occasion.\n  The legislation will open 8.3 million acres of the U.S. Outer \nContinental Shelf in the central Gulf of Mexico to leasing for oil and \nnatural gas exploration and production. This area is located more than \n125 miles from the closest point in Florida on the Florida Panhandle \nand more than 300 miles from the southern gulf coast of Florida. The \narea is closest to Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi and most of the \nexploration and production activities are likely to be staged from \nports along the gulf coast, and from the ports in my state located in \nsoutheast Louisiana.\n  The U.S. Department of the Interior estimates that the area contains \nat least 1.3 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. To put this in perspective, that is enough natural gas to \nheat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years.\n  In addition to opening up 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to \nnew oil and natural gas leasing, this legislation will prohibit leasing \nwithin 125 miles of the State of Florida in the new eastern Gulf of \nMexico planning area until June 30, 2022. Additionally, it prohibits \nleasing within 100 miles of the State of Florida in the new central \nGulf of Mexico planning area, and east of the western boundary of the \n181 area until June 30, 2022. Similarly, under the provisions of S. \n3711, no oil and natural gas leasing, preleasing and other activities \neast of the military mission line may occur until June 30, 2022. This \nwas done to accommodate the military training missions that occur from \nmilitary installations located in Florida. After 2022, the Department \nof Defense may veto leasing plans if such would interfere with these \nexercises.\n  Under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, 50 percent of the \nreceipts resulting from the collection of bonuses, rents, and royalties \nfrom leases in the new areas will be deposited in the general fund of \nthe U.S. Treasury. The other 50 percent will be spent, without further \nappropriation action, for payments to States and to provide financial \nassistance to States in accordance with section 6 of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act of 1965--16 U.S.C. 460l-8. Of this amount, 25 \npercent will provide financial assistance to States in accordance with \nsection 6 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965--16 \nU.S.C. 460l-8--the ``state-side'' of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. The other 75 percent of this amount will be disbursed by the \nSecretary of the Interior, without the need for appropriation, to the \nfour Gulf producing states of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and \nMississippi. These amounts are not subject to appropriation or further \nauthorization.\n  It is the intent of this legislation that the State of Louisiana and \nall of the recipient States shall have the immediate capacity to bond \nanticipated future revenues they expect to receive from that portion of \nthe Outer Continental Shelf Federal revenues to which they will be \nentitled to under this act and to allow the States, if they so decide, \nto get immediately underway hurricane and coastal protection projects \nwithin the scope of this act pursuant to such financing. There is \nnothing in this act that is intended to prohibit or impede the right of \nthe four recipient States to bond anticipated future revenues they \nshall receive from this act.\n  The receipts that derive from the leasing in areas newly opened by \nthe\n\n[[Page S11678]]\n\nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act will be allocated among the four \ngulf producing States of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi to \neach state in amounts based on a formula established by the Secretary \nby regulation--that are inversely proportional to the respective \ndistances between the point on the coastline of each gulf producing \nState that is closest to the geographic center of the applicable leased \ntract and the geographic center of the leased tract. Thus, for each \nlease, the Department of the Interior will determine the distance from \nthe center of that lease to the nearest point on the coast of each of \nthe four producing states and allocate the qualified revenues derived \nfrom that lease according their respective distances with the farthest \ngetting the least and the closest getting the most, but with none \nreceiving less than 10 percent.\n  A detailed example will help to illustrate how this will work in \npractice. Imagine that OCS lease A that is producing $10,000 in \nqualified--shared--revenues each year. The distance from lease A to the \nnearest points in the four gulf producing States is: 260 miles to \nTexas, 80 miles to Louisiana, 100 miles to Mississippi, and 90 miles to \nAlabama. The sum of these distances is 530 miles. The inverse \nproportion of the distance from the lease to each State's shore is: for \nTexas 530/260, for Louisiana 530/80, for Mississippi 530/90. Therefore, \nthe States revenues from that lease would be allocated as follows: 10 \npercent or $1,000 for Texas, 33 percent or $3,300 for Louisiana, 27 \npercent or $2,700 for Mississippi, and 30 percent or $3,000 for \nAlabama. In this example Texas is precisely far enough away to receive \n10 percent of the total under the formula. However, if Texas were \nsomewhat farther away, it would still receive 10 percent of the total \nbecause of the provision in S. 3711 that guarantees a minimum share to \neach gulf producing State.\n\n  This process is repeated for every new lease located in the areas \nopened for leasing by this legislation. The totals for each state are \nadded up. 20 percent of each state's allocable share and is disbursed \ndirectly to coastal counties, parishes or political subdivisions in the \nmanner outlined under section 384 of the Energy Policy Act of 2006, \nPublic Law 109-58.\n  Under the legislation, the Gulf energy producing States of Texas, \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi will 37.5 percent of the receipts \nthat derive from new leasing in areas of the Gulf of Mexico where oil \nand gas production occurred prior to enactment. Those receipts will be \nallocated among the states based on the amount of leasing and oil and \nnatural gas production that has taken place over historically off each \nState's coast. The more leasing and production of oil and gas that has \noccurred off your coast, the greater your share of these receipts will \nbe.\n  The task of determining each State's share is not an easy one. The \nMMS will examine every lease tract in the central and western Gulf of \nMexico, determine the revenues derived from its leasing and any \nensuring production and add up the totals for each tract. Then, the MMS \nwill determine the distance from the center of every lease tract that \nhas been let since October 1, 1982, to the nearest point on the coast \nof each of the four producing States.\n  Then the MMS will divide the total revenues generated by each lease \nby the proportional according to their respective distances, allotting \nthe least to the farthest, and the most to the closest, but with none \nallotted less than 10 percent.\n  After completing this exercise, the MMS will total up the amount \nallotted to each State. Each State's total will determine the \nproportional share of the new revenues from the gulf leases from areas \nwhere leasing has been allowed.\n  Again, an example may help to clarify what is an admittedly complex \nformula: Imagine that 500 leases in this area had cumulatively produced \n$100 million since 1982. Then imagine MMS going through the process \noutlined above with each of these leases. When all is settled, \nLouisiana would be allotted $50 million, Texas $25 million, Mississippi \nand Alabama would both be allotted $12.5 million. Those allotments then \nbecome each State's proportionate share--Louisiana's allotment was 50 \npercent of the total, so Louisiana would receive 50 percent of the \nshared revenues from every new lease located in the already-opened \nareas after the date of S. 3711's enactment. Texas would receive 25 \npercent, Alabama 12.5 percent, and so on. Each year, each gulf State's \nallocation will be adjusted by the amount of leasing and production \nthat took place near its shore in the preceding calendar year.\n  And, as with the revenues shared from newly opened areas, at the end \nof each year, the totals for each State are tallied and 20 percent of \neach State's allocable share is disbursed directly to coastal counties, \nparishes or political subdivisions in the manner outlined under section \n384 of the Energy Policy Act of 2006, Public Law 109-58.\n  Starting in 2017, this legislation would provide additional direct \nspending authority encompassing 50 percent of the receipts derived from \nnew OCS oil and gas leases, purchased after the date of enactment, in \nthe areas of the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico that were made \navailable by the 2002-2007 Proposed Final Outer Continental Shelf Oil \nand Gas Leasing Program. Beginning in 2016, the bill would limit total \ndirect spending under the bill in any year to no more than the sum of \nthe receipts from the new areas plus $500 million.\n  Additionally, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act will offer \nmonetary credits to firms that hold OCS leases located in areas that \nwill be subject to the temporary moratorium on new leasing activity \nnear Florida. These credits may be used for the purchase of a new lease \nin the Gulf of Mexico. The credits will be equal to the sum of the \noriginal bonus bid paid for the held lease and the rentals paid for the \nlease as of the date that the lessee notifies the Secretary of the \nInterior of the decision to exchange the lease or leases. Based on \ninformation from the Department of the Interior, the Congressional \nBudget Office has estimated that those credits would be worth $84 \nmillion and would be redeemed soon after they were made available.\n  In general, revenues shared with the coastal energy producing States \nunder the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act should be treated in \nexactly the same ways as are revenues shared with States under the \nMineral Lands Leasing Act 30 U.S.C. Sec. 181-287. These funds are not \ngrants by any definition. Rather, they constitute income for the \nState--simply the State's fair share of revenues generated seaward of \nits coast. States have, in at least two occasions; used funds provided \nunder the Mineral Lands Leasing Act as cost-share for other Federal \nprograms. At this time in Louisiana's recovery, I envision this as a \nvery much needed avenue for the State of Louisiana, as its citizens \nregain their feet following the destruction of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11678-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11678-S11680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SUSAN BUTCHER\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this past August, Alaska lost a great \nhero and the Stevens family lost a cherished friend. Susan Butcher was \nthe four-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race Champion and the first and \nonly woman to mush her team to the summit of Mt. McKinley--with her \nfriend and Iditarod race founder, Joe Redington, Sr. She is the reason \nwe say ``Alaska--where men are men and women win the Iditarod.'' Susan \nleft behind her husband David Monson and daughters Tekla and Chisana, \nand friends and admirers everywhere.\n  In the solitude of the unforgiving Arctic terrain, this tough, \nfocused, intelligent woman traveled and ran many thousands of miles \nwith her dog teams over the years--a distance greater than a trip \naround the world. In David's words, she was the most driven woman on \nthe face of this earth.\n  Susan's skill as a musher was matched only by her great and abiding \nlove for her dogs. If her dogs were happy, Susan was happy.\n  Whether on the trail or at home, Susan always took care of her \nhuskies before tending to her own needs. With\n\n[[Page S11679]]\n\nonly her ax and a parka, she once fended off a moose attacking her team \nalong the trail. The moose killed two dogs and stomped 13 others. In \nanother harrowing experience, she was rescued by her dogs when her sled \nbroke through the ice on a remote river in the Wrangell Mountains. \nAfter that escape, Susan said she looked at every moment of her life as \na gift. Susan did it all--living a life without many regrets and always \ngreat humor.\n  Susan was blessed with a wonderful partner when she married fellow \nmusher and lawyer David Monson. He gave her the love, laughter and \nrelentless support that carried her through their years together. They \nexpanded their family beyond their 100 huskies with the birth of their \ndaughters Tekla and Chisana. Susan embraced motherhood with even \ngreater passion, energy and devotion than she had in her life as a \nmusher. And the girls blossomed in a home and cabin filled with books, \nmusic, Native Alaskan culture, and, of course, dogs.\n  In December 2005, Susan was diagnosed with leukemia and began the \ntoughest fight of her life. At the time, her husband David said ``We're \ngoing to do everything we can to make sure she has the best care. She \ndoes have the best attitude. Someone said this might be a tough \ndisease, but this leukemia hasn't met Susan Butcher yet.'' Throughout \nher treatment in Seattle, Susan actively campaigned to help others by \nincreasing donations to the National Marrow Donor Program and support \nfor leukemia and lymphoma research.\n  Over the past 20 years, Susan often traveled to Washington--bunking \nwith our family--sled dogs, cat, kids and all. Presidents Reagan and \nGeorge Bush, Sr., invited her and her lead dogs to the White House. She \ndrove her team in the inaugural parades--the last time in 2001, with \nboth her daughters in the sled. With her lead dog, Granite, she was \nwelcomed by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to her Supreme Court chambers, \nand to the Pentagon by her friend General Colin Powell, then chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Susan had a gift for inspiring others to never give up, to test their \nlimits, to see their way through to the finish line, and to always try \nthe path less traveled. It is no wonder her favorite poem reflected her \nNew England roots--Robert Frost's ``The Road Not Taken.''\n  On a winter day in 1994, near her home in Eureka, AK, the reporter \nSkip Hollandsworth watched Susan and her dogs: ``She whispers a \ncommand, and in unison the dogs pull forward. The sled slips across the \nsnow. Soon, Butcher and her dogs are like a mirage in the distance. A \nfew moments later, the cold, silent land swallows them up.'' \n``Sometimes when she leaves,'' David says, ``I wonder if she ever wants \nto return home.''\n  Some day in the years ahead, Susan and David's beautiful daughters \nTekla and Chisana will graduate from high school. We hope they and \ntheir friends will find the same inspiration to challenge themselves as \nSusan's words instilled in our daughter Lily's Holton Arms class in \n1999.\n  Mr. President, Alaska lost one of its brightest stars when Susan \nButcher passed away. We will always remember this remarkable and \ncourageous woman.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Butcher's commencement address to \nthe Holton Arms School be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Holton-Arms School Commencement Address--June 1999\n\n       Thank you very much. I'm very honored and excited to be \n     speaking here today. And thank you to the class for asking \n     me. It's especially exciting for me to be here because of my \n     great friend, Lily Stevens, who I watched grow up since she \n     was just a tiny little girl.\n       I certainly would be surprised to hear if any of you were \n     going to follow me in my chosen occupation as a dog musher. \n     So I don't think that's why you have asked me here. I live in \n     Alaska about a hundred miles south of the Arctic Circle. I \n     own a hundred dogs, and I travel about 6,000 miles a year by \n     sled and dog team. So my life is very different from what we \n     see here. I thought, when I was asked to speak on \n     achievement, that it would be easy to do. But getting to the \n     soul of what motivates a person to excel cuts to the core of \n     each person's dreams, desires and beliefs. Sometimes it goes \n     beyond words. So I will speak for myself, and try and tell \n     you how and why things have worked for me.\n       It's really exciting to see such youth and promise before \n     me. And it certainly takes me back to my high school \n     graduation in 1972, when I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I \n     was very good in math and sciences. But I am dyslexic, so I \n     struggled very hard in school. My strong loves were the \n     wilderness, animals, science, and sports. I had a hobby for \n     the last couple of years of working with my two Alaskan \n     huskies, trying to teach them to be sled dogs. I feel that I \n     was very lucky because even at that young age, I knew my true \n     passion. It was to live in the wilderness and work with \n     animals. But what sort of a career was that? So I started \n     with veterinary medicine, which I also loved. I moved to \n     Colorado where I went on with further schooling, and to \n     enhance my career. By then, my mushing was becoming more than \n     just a hobby. I had eight dogs and was starting to run in \n     smaller races.\n       In those days though, the Iditarod race didn't even exist. \n     There was no such thing as a professional musher. And yet my \n     dream still was to go and live in the wilderness with my \n     dogs. Shortly after I turned 20, the Iditarod was run for the \n     first time, and I said ``that's for me.'' I packed up my \n     dogs, my cats, and my Volkswagen Bug, and I drove up to \n     Alaska--all my belongings and against all parental advice, \n     but not without their blessings--I lived way out in bush \n     Alaska, teaching myself the art of dog mushing. Still at that \n     time I had no clue that I was going to be able to make this \n     passion into a career and a livelihood. In the summers I \n     supported myself working on a musk ox farm and through \n     fishing for salmon.\n       I can only say that when I reached Alaska and was working \n     out there, I knew this was perfect for me. I was content in \n     my soul. I knew that I had found my dream. The relationship \n     that I was able to develop with my dogs was deeper and \n     stronger than anything that I could have possibly imagined. \n     Perhaps I can describe that to you a little bit in this \n     story. I worked very hard to try and develop a trust with \n     each one of my dogs individually. And a number of years ago, \n     when I was with my dog team in the Wrangell Mountains and I \n     traveling on a trail that I had been using all year long that \n     crossed a frozen river, my lead dog at the time kept veering \n     off to the right. I kept calling her back to the left, \n     telling her ``haw''--that's the command we use. But she kept \n     going off to the right. She had never disobeyed me before, so \n     I couldn't understand. So I let her have her lead, and just \n     as she pulled myself and the team off to the side of the \n     trail, the entire river collapsed. She had a sixth sense \n     that saved us from drowning. It's this mutual trust--mine \n     and their guidance, and their ability and instinct in the \n     wilderness--that has not only gotten us to the finish line \n     many times, but has also saved our lives.\n       Success did not come easy for me at all. I struggled for \n     many years with barely enough money to feed myself and my dog \n     team. I was working seven days a week, at least twelve-hour \n     days, trying to train myself and the dogs for the races. I \n     did fairly well in many of the races that I entered, but it \n     took me nine years before I was able to win. I lived alone \n     for nine years in a 16' x 19' log cabin. Today my husband and \n     I have built quite a complex, and we have a couple of diesel \n     generators now. But back then I had nothing. I had no \n     electricity, no phone. I hauled my water from the creek, and \n     I had very few neighbors. In fact, there were only eight \n     people in 2,500 square miles. So this was my childhood dream \n     come true!\n       I was absolutely dedicated to the care and the training of \n     my dogs. All my focus was on becoming the best long-distance \n     sled dog racer in the world. I had put together a great team \n     that was very fast and well cared for. But I kept coming in \n     second in more races than I cared to remember. Clearly, some \n     essential element was missing. It was vision--the winning \n     spirit. I didn't actually see myself as a winner. I believed \n     wholeheartedly that someday I would win the Iditarod, but I \n     didn't see myself as a winner today. I often finished with \n     the strongest, fastest team--in second place. I often \n     finished an hour or--in two instances, a split second--behind \n     somebody else. In 1986, I learned how to pull together. I \n     told myself that not only could I win, but that I deserved to \n     win, and that I would win today. I saw myself crossing the \n     finish line, and I lived and breathed that vision for a year. \n     I told myself the 1986 race was mine. I was able to hold that \n     image eleven days into the Iditarod, when with just 44 miles \n     to go, I was neck-and-neck in a sprint for the finish with a \n     musher named Joe Gamey. I had slept less than 20 hours in 12 \n     days. I had run up every hill between Anchorage and Nome. I \n     was exhausted. Joe made a big push and he passed me, gaining \n     a 2-minute advantage. I was demoralized. I said to myself, \n     ``Well, I guess second place isn't that bad.'' But then, \n     through the blur of fatigue, I again saw myself winning the \n     race. I got off my sled and I ran, pumped with one leg, and \n     pushed the sled until I was able to pass Joe and win my first \n     Iditarod. Once I learned that lesson, I won a lot of races.\n       I quit fishing and musk ox farming, and I dedicated myself \n     solely to my dogs all year 'round. To maintain consistency \n     and excellence, you are always looking over the horizon, past \n     the finish line, to the next race and the next record time. I \n     found that it wasn't enough to just say to myself ``Well, I \n     want to win again.'' I had to reach deep within and challenge \n     myself. No racer had ever run in four long-distance races in \n     a year. So in 1990\n\n[[Page S11680]]\n\n     I decided to try to attempt to run in five. I set my goal to \n     win all of them, and to win them in record time. All of these \n     were between 300 and 1,100 miles in length. And some of them \n     were as close as just five days apart. I ended up winning \n     four in record time and coming in a close second in the \n     fifth. So I didn't reach my ultimate goal, but by challenging \n     myself like that I was able to set four new world records. I \n     try to examine each race that I run, even the ones that I \n     have won, to see what little steps I can take to keep getting \n     better.\n       Let me speak now of failure, because I have had very many \n     of them and each one of you will. It's how you deal with \n     these failures and your setbacks that's the most important \n     thing. In 1991, I was at the top of my game. My team was said \n     to be the best team in the history of the Iditarod that \n     year. I ran a very aggressive race. Mother Nature threw \n     every curve at me and my team that she possibly could. For \n     over 500 miles, me and my team broke trail through storms, \n     leading all the other mushers, until we finally reached \n     the village of White Mountain an hour in front of our next \n     competitor. We were only 77 miles from Nome. The awesome \n     power of nature is very humbling and it must be respected. \n     I went out first into an Arctic blizzard for six hours, \n     losing the trail, regaining the trail, searching to make \n     it through to Nome and win another race, until finally I \n     knew that I could ask my team for no more. Because I \n     continually challenge myself to win, I know that sometimes \n     I must fail. As I tried to become the best, I know that \n     there will be setbacks along the way. This is the essence \n     of competition--that there will be both winners and \n     losers. But I have learned at looking at losing, it's just \n     another step to attaining my final goal. Many times, the \n     pain of failure is very raw for me. But I have great faith \n     in myself, that I will turn my defeats into something \n     positive. I have learned many valuable lessons from my \n     defeats. But I think the best thing was summed up in the \n     words of an old Athabaskan Indian. He told me, ``There are \n     many hard things in life, but there is only one sad thing. \n     And that is giving up.'' So I know that in the future, I \n     will continue to try very hard, and in the end--I will \n     prevail.\n       Adversity is a very large part of life, and learning to \n     overcome it can be very difficult. When I started racing, I \n     believed that I would win when I made everything run \n     perfectly, when I was able to train all year round, when I \n     didn't get lost or break my sled. So when I would have \n     trouble, I wouldn't completely give up, but I would often \n     settle for second place. Now I know that winning is \n     overcoming adversity. I don't win because I run a perfect \n     race. I win because I deal with the problems that the dogs \n     and I encounter better than my fellow competitors.\n       I have actually learned to love adversity. In 1988, I had \n     every type of trouble that you could ask for. My sled broke \n     five times. I got lost and I ran into ground storms of 80 \n     miles an hour as I crossed the frozen Bering Sea. I could \n     hardly see my lead dog in front of me, let alone the next \n     trail marker. But I won the race despite all the problems the \n     dogs and I encountered. We finished fourteen hours in front \n     of the second place musher, who couldn't make it through the \n     storm. So I learned that no matter what the obstacles, I \n     always had the chance of winning and should never give up.\n       It is true that I raced in a totally male-dominated sport. \n     I was a pioneer for women in long-distance racing. But you \n     won't hear me talking very much about that. I think the most \n     important thing was that I saw no gender barriers. And anyone \n     who tried to put me in that box and say, ``well, Susan is the \n     best woman racer,'' I would quickly correct them. I was not a \n     woman racer, I was a racer. It was my plan to be the best \n     musher, and I did that.\n       Perhaps I have been able to say something here today that \n     will strike a chord with each of you, or some of you. Many of \n     my lessons have been learned from my heroes--my dogs. I'd \n     like to share the story of one of my animals. Twenty years \n     ago, I had a puppy born to my kennel, who didn't look like he \n     was going to be much of a dog. He had a very poor hair coat. \n     He had cowhocked legs, which is basically knock-knees in the \n     back end, and he had no confidence whatsoever. Most mushers \n     would have given up on this puppy and just sold him to \n     someone as a pet dog. But on my runs in the woods with he and \n     his littermates, I saw a special spark in this dog that was \n     not yet ignited. It was a challenge that I couldn't resist to \n     try and make him into a champion sled dog. So I worked with \n     him very hard physically to bring him around, through \n     special nutrition and training. But mostly I concentrated \n     on his lack of confidence. I gave him a strong name--\n     Granite. He soon learned to draw from my strength and \n     confidence, and we became a very powerful team. Granite \n     grew into a 58-pound, deep-chested dog who compensated for \n     his cow-hocked legs with a very powerful gait. All that \n     extra work paid off because he not only turned into a good \n     sled dog, but a great leader. He ended up leading me to \n     victory in the 1986 and 1987 Iditarods, both of those in \n     record time, along with countless other races between 300-\n     500 miles in length. In October of 1987 while we were \n     training for what we hoped would be his third consecutive \n     victory, he became very seriously ill. I had to rush him \n     down to Anchorage to a veterinary hospital to try and save \n     his life. We set up a cot next to his kennel so that I \n     could sleep with him there, day and night, tending him and \n     willing him to live. After two weeks, the veterinarians \n     told me I could take him home, but that he was never going \n     to be able to run again, that he had permanent damage to \n     his heart and liver and kidneys along with damage to the \n     hypothalamus in the brain, which controls body \n     temperature. But Granite had grown to be a magnificent \n     canine athlete who loved to run and race, and all the dogs \n     loved competition. They understand when they have won. \n     They have as much pride as any human athlete. Granite was \n     determined to get back on the team. Every time I would \n     take other dogs out on runs, he would cry and howl, \n     wishing that he could go out with us. Slowly but surely, \n     his test results started showing improvements that the \n     veterinarians were astounded at. They decided to let him \n     start training with me and the puppies on little 2-mile \n     runs. He soon advanced to running with the yearlings on \n     10-mile runs. And finally, by January, he was once again \n     running with the main team, and the veterinarians okayed \n     him for a 200-mile race. He towed that young team to \n     record-setting victory. Then, 1\\1/2\\ months later he went \n     on to do the impossible. He led me to victory in the \n     Iditarod. And he did it by pulling me through a blinding \n     snow storm that stopped all my competitors. So we finished \n     14 hours in front of the second place musher, as I told \n     you--through that storm. That made Granite the only lead \n     dog ever to win three consecutive Iditarods.\n       All of us will fall on hard times, and it's often hard to \n     find the key to help us with our problems. But if we can draw \n     from our inner strength and desires as Granite did, we can \n     overcome incredible odds. It's always important to look \n     around us and see that there are those whose problems are far \n     greater than ours. It's important to take time to give back \n     to your community, to youth, and to those less privileged. As \n     I am now a mother and a dog sled racer, I have taken more \n     time to contemplate my past Iditarod years. So I want to \n     leave you with one last story that sort of sums up what I \n     think of my career.\n       I always felt that there was a division of duties between \n     myself and the dogs. The dogs were definitely better in the \n     wilderness, such as being able to sense thin ice or where \n     there were wild animals around us, and helping me through the \n     storms. But I was better when we were in Anchorage starting \n     out and there were cars and traffic lights and all sorts of \n     things in any of the villages, and I was also better at \n     strategy and understanding competition. In 1989 I was racing \n     towards the half-way point in the Iditarod. They give you a \n     prize of $5,000 for being the first into that checkpoint, and \n     nothing for being second, so it's quite coveted. Joe Runyon \n     and myself were the best two teams in the race that year, and \n     we had been vying for first place for miles. We had just left \n     the checkpoint of Ophir, and it was about a 90-mile run over \n     to the abandoned gold mine town of Iditarod. Throughout the \n     day, Joe and I had passed each other. You have got to imagine \n     that these are just two mushers out in the middle of nowhere, \n     so when you pass each other--even though you're very \n     competitive with each other--you definitely talk. And when \n     you see each other and pass, you will have a little \n     conversation. So just as it was getting dusk, I had put on my \n     headlight so that I could see through the darkness--a \n     battery-powered headlight, as had Joe--he put his new young \n     lead dog, Rambo, up in lead. He came flying by me. He \n     stopped--I had out my map and compass. He said, ``Where do \n     you think we are?'' I said, ``I think we have just passed the \n     Deshka River. Here it is on the map, so we must be about five \n     miles from the town of Iditarod.'' He said, ``That's what I'm \n     thinking too,'' and he passed me. I was using my lead dog, \n     Tolstoy, at the time. I starting pumping with one leg and \n     encouraging my dogs, saying ``Come on, let's get going.'' \n     They just were flat. They were not going to pick up and go as \n     fast as Joe's team. So I took Granite, who was in the team, \n     and I put him up in lead. I encouraged him, and I encouraged \n     the rest of the team. Still, they didn't respond. Five miles \n     should have taken us about thirty minutes. We went hour after \n     hour after hour. Three hours later, we were still on the \n     trail. I could see Joe's headlight--it's very hilly country \n     there--going up and down the hills, just a little ways ahead \n     of me. All of a sudden, Granite turned around and he looked \n     at me and he went, ``Now!'' And he kicked it into gear, all \n     the dogs immediately responded to him, and he passed Joe 100 \n     yards from the finish line at Iditarod and we won the half-\n     way prize. So I learned that not only do I not know as much \n     about the wilderness as my dogs, but I don't know anything \n     about competition. And it is my job to love the dogs, care \n     for them, feed them and nurture them, and hold on for dear \n     life.\n       So in parting, I want to say to each and everyone of Holton \n     Arms' 1999 graduating class, I hope very dearly that each one \n     of you is able to find your dream. And when you do--love it, \n     nurture it, and hold on for dear life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11680-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11680-S11681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JOHN MARK LACOVARA\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I call to the \nattention of my colleagues the recent passing of one of our most loyal \nand hardworking former Senate staff members, John Mark Lacovara.\n  Mark, as he was called by his family and friends, was part of a \nCapitol Hill\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\nfamily, joining both his father and sister in holding staff positions \nin the U.S. Senate. Mark began his Senate career in 1969. He worked his \nway up the ranks in a number of jobs, starting first as an elevator \noperator, then as an enrolling clerk, and finally capping his career as \nthe Senate journal clerk.\n  Those of us who knew him admired his tireless and cheerful dedication \nto this body. Often he would be the last one to leave his office at \nnight and the first to arrive in the morning, no matter how late the \nprevious session had ended. He truly loved his job, but due to health \nreasons, he resigned in 1997.\n  Mark was born in Washington. He grew up in Rockville and graduated \nfrom Richard Montgomery High School. Attending night school while \nmaintaining his full-time Senate duties, he received a bachelor's, \ndegree in political science with a minor in American history from the \nUniversity of Maryland. He served as a member of the U.S. Air Force \nReserve for many years.\n  Mark Lacovara passed away on October 3, 2006. Mark was the son of the \nlate John Lacovara, administrative assistant to the Senate Sergeant at \nArms, and Mrs. Patricia Lacovara Ingold of Springfield. My colleagues \njoin me in extending our deepest sympathy to her and Mark's sisters, \nDale Monno, a retired lieutenant with the Capitol Police, and Joyce.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the accomplishments of \nBob McGowan, the Washoe County assessor. After more than 24 years in \noffice, Bob will retire this year as the longest serving elected \ndepartment head in the county. His personable demeanor and dedication \nto service will be missed.\n  Bob has been a resident of Nevada for more than 38 years. After \nworking in the Nevada Attorney General's office, Bob made the first of \nmany successful runs for elected office. In 1982, the citizens of \nWashoe County elected him as their county assessor. For more than two \ndecades, Bob has presided over the growth of Washoe County. From the \nrising real estate values at Lake Tahoe to the rapid development in the \ncity of Reno, Bob has sought to provide fairness for Washoe County \nresidents.\n  Most importantly, Bob has never forgotten that the goal of elected \noffice is service. After his election in 2002, he told the Reno-Gazette \nJournal: ``From the first day I went in office, we've always been a \npublic service organization, not just a property appraisal.'' Under \nBob's guidance, the assessor's office has become more responsive to \nWashoe County Residents. For example, Bob moved the assessor's office \ninto the digital age, and residents of Washoe County can now access \nmany forms online. Bob has also worked to save the taxpayers money, \ntrimming his own budget to return more than $2 million to the Washoe \nCounty general fund.\n  As the county assessor, Bob has always been in tune with the issues \nof Washoe County. He has navigated controversies over rising property \nvalues with ease, taking the time to talk with people he serves. To \nthis day, residents are amazed that Bob is so approachable and \naccessible. He can quickly put a visitor at ease with his humble \ndemeanor and his frequent jokes. In fact, I cannot recall a time that I \nhave met with Bob when he hasn't told me a funny anecdote or story.\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Bob is a dedicated \npart of his community. He has served as president for Habitat for \nHumanity and as an executive board member of the alumni organization \nfor the University of Nevada, Reno. Additionally, as the president of \nKeep Truckee Meadows Beautiful organization, he led an effort to \nprotect the pristine areas surrounding Lake Tahoe. While working to \nimprove Washoe County, Bob also raised three wonderful children in \nReno. A few years ago, I had the privilege to host his daughter Megan \nin my Washington office as an intern.\n  Mr. President, Bob McGowan has been an important part of northern \nNevada for more than two decades. His retirement will leave large shoes \nto fill, but I am confident that Bob will continue to improve Washoe \nCounty for many years to come. It is my great pleasure to offer my \ncongratulations to Bob and the McGowan family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11681-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RALPH E. WALZ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I recognize the outstanding \nservice of a remarkable Kentuckian, Mr. Ralph E. Walz. Mr. Walz is the \nexecutive liaison officer for the Louisville District of the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers. He will retire from the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers on January 3, 2007, with over 34 years of dedicated service \nto our Nation as a member of the U.S. Army (1969-1972) and as a civil \nservant.\n  A native of Louisville, KY, Mr. Walz is a graduate of Western \nKentucky University. As a young man in the 1960s, Ralph Walz served \nwith the U.S. Army in Vietnam as an enlisted infantryman. Performing \nhis duty on the front lines as a non-commissioned officer, facing the \ndaily dangers of active combat, he bravely and honorably served his \ncountry.\n  Mr. Walz began his distinguished civil service tenure with the \nLouisville District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in 1977. He began \nhis career in the Comptroller's Office, later named Resource \nManagement, where he participated in numerous efficiency reviews, \norganizational studies, and business-process analysis. During this \ntime, Mr. Walz was instrumental in the transfer of Smithland Lock and \nDam to the Louisville District.\n  In 1981, Mr. Walz helped develop the proposal that resulted in the \nmilitary construction mission being reinstated at the Louisville \ndistrict, making it a full-service district whose impact is felt \nworldwide.\n  In 1990, Mr. Walz was chosen as the executive liaison Officer and \nassigned to the Executive Office. In that capacity, he has been \ninstrumental in coordinating many significant events that showcased our \ngreat Commonwealth, including National Society of American Military \nEngineers Conferences which included military personnel and civilians \nfrom all over the United States and overseas.\n  Mr. Walz has also been a champion of quality-of-life initiatives. He \nhelped implement the Uncle Sam's Child Care Center and initially served \nas board chairman. He served as board chairman and as a member of the \nboard of directors for his local credit union. And he was chairman of \nthe Kentucky Federal Agency Tourism Council, among many other volunteer \nactivities.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Mr. Walz is a good neighbor and valued \nsteward of our natural resources and defense assets. He will be long \nremembered for his patriotism, leadership, mentorship of others, and \nservice to his Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. On the occasion \nof his retirement, I wish to extend my best wishes to Mr. Ralph Walz, \nhis wife, Mary Lou, and their children, Matthew (Matt) and Jake, and I \nask my colleagues to salute this esteemed Kentuckian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11681-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11681-S11682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID MORGAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nKentuckian, Mr. David Morgan, for his service to the Commonwealth and \nhis commitment to the preservation of Kentucky's historic landmarks.\n  For the past 29 years Mr. Morgan has worked on preserving Kentucky's \nheritage, helping cities and towns utilize and revitalize their \ndowntowns and historic sites.\n  On Sunday, December 3, 2006, the Louisville Courier-Journal published \nan article highlighting Mr. Morgan's many years of service to Kentucky. \nI ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record \nand that the entire Senate join me in thanking this beloved Kentuckian.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Dec. 3, 2006]\n\n                     Preservationist Bids Farewell\n\n                           (By Chris Poynter)\n\n       Most Kentuckians likely do not know David Morgan.\n       But they have certainly seen his work.\n       If you drive along Paris Pike--the road between Paris and \n     Lexington lined with famous thoroughbred farms--you've seen \n     the historic stone fences and picture-perfect rolling \n     landscapes that he helped protect when the road was widened.\n       If you've strolled the Main Streets of Kentucky's \n     downtowns--and marveled at the historic buildings--you can \n     thank Morgan for helping revive them.\n\n[[Page S11682]]\n\n       And if you've seen the old trolley barn in western \n     Louisville that is slowly being transformed into the Kentucky \n     Center for African-American Heritage, Morgan deserves part of \n     the credit.\n       After 29 years with the Kentucky Heritage Council--the \n     agency that oversees historic preservation for the state--\n     Morgan is retiring and moving to Washington, D.C.\n       Morgan, 54, and his wife, Marcia, have bought a historic \n     home just blocks from the Capitol. They have a son, Ned, 18.\n       Morgan has spent his entire professional career at the \n     heritage council, rising from a staff planner in November \n     1977 to executive director, a position he's held since 1984, \n     when then-Gov. Martha Layne Collins appointed him.\n       He survived through Republican and Democratic \n     administrations, which friends and co-workers say is a \n     testament to his effectiveness, and he's been at the \n     forefront of saving historic properties from Paducah to \n     Pikeville.\n       His interest in preservation began as a child in Oxford, \n     Ohio, the son of a college professor and a stay-at-home \n     mother who sold antiques.\n       On a fourth-grade class trip to Yellow Springs, Ohio--named \n     for a spring that supposedly had curative powers--a young \n     Morgan lamented the demolition of the old Neff House hotel.\n       ``It is important to know how America was settled,'' Morgan \n     wrote in a school essay he still keeps. ``If you tore down \n     everything that was historical, people would forget how \n     America was settled.''\n       Morgan laughs at his simple six-paragraph essay now--but \n     the lessons he learned on that field trip are woven \n     throughout his life.\n       Preservation--though it began as a movement of upper-crust \n     white women--has expanded and matured and become more \n     inclusive. Morgan has changed the heritage council's mission \n     with that evolution.\n       He helped create the African-American Heritage Commission, \n     the Native American Heritage Commission, and the Military \n     Heritage & Civil War Preservation Program. He and his agency \n     worked to raise awareness about Rosenwald Schools--one-room \n     schoolhouses for black children that at one time dotted \n     Kentucky and the South--and he has helped preserve 60 Civil \n     War sites across the state.\n       In 1979, while still in his 20s, he started the Main Street \n     program to help revive Kentucky's decaying downtowns. The \n     program now includes 110 cities and towns across Kentucky and \n     is credited with helping breathe new life into desolate city \n     centers.\n       And he pushed to get Kentucky buildings and properties on \n     the National Register of Historic Places. Kentucky now has \n     41,000 properties and 3,200 historic districts, such as Old \n     Louisville, on the register.\n       That's the fourth-largest number of any state in the \n     nation, according to the National Park Service, which keeps \n     the register.\n       Though he's had many successes--including persuading state \n     transportation leaders to make historic preservation a key \n     component of the Paris Pike widening--all has not been \n     positive, Morgan admits.\n       He hasn't persuaded the state legislature to commit more \n     money for preservation.\n       ``We don't have the ability to give grants out, to start \n     projects on the local level,'' Morgan said.\n       He also laments that grassroots preservation groups have \n     been slow in forming. It's those organizations, such as \n     Preservation Kentucky, run by citizens, that have the power \n     to effectively lobby the legislature, Morgan said.\n       ``A lot of people don't consider themselves \n     preservationists,'' he said. ``But people who live in Old \n     Louisville in an old house, for example, are great \n     preservationists.''\n       Helen Dedman, whose family owns and operates the Beaumont \n     Inn in Harrodsburg, a restaurant, hotel and tavern housed in \n     an 1845 building, said Morgan had done much for Kentucky out \n     of the public eye.\n       ``He has touched people and places over the whole state,'' \n     she said.\n       Dedman met Morgan when they were students at Centre \n     College.\n       ``He was the first person that I knew that really knew \n     about antiques,'' she said.\n       The two kept in sporadic touch over the years, but it \n     wasn't until 15 years ago that she and Morgan closely \n     reconnected because of newfound activism in preservation.\n       Dedman helped organize a tour of historic homes and found \n     herself ``falling in love with these old homes,'' she said. \n     She, along with others, formed the non-profit James Harrod \n     Trust to advocate for preservation in Harrodsburg and Mercer \n     County.\n       ``David has never lost his passion,'' Dedman said. ``It \n     didn't matter who you were, what class you were, what color \n     you were--if you had just a little bit of interest in his \n     preservation, he was your cheerleader, he was on your side.''\n       Historic preservation leaders from across Kentucky gathered \n     for a dinner in downtown Louisville last month to honor \n     Morgan. The location was befitting--inside the old Henry Clay \n     Hotel, a 1924 building that is being renovated into housing \n     and commercial shops.\n       Morgan has been an advocate of saving the structure, \n     commonly called the old YWCA.\n       Friends and co-workers roasted Morgan--poking fun at his \n     big nose, bushy eyebrows and black mustache--while viewing \n     pictures of him over the decades, with former governors and \n     first lady Laura Bush. Bush visited Louisville in 2004 and \n     praised Morgan and the heritage council for their work on the \n     ``Preserve America'' federal program.\n       Morgan, whose replacement will be named next year, said he \n     one day hopes to return to Kentucky. For now, he plans to \n     enjoy his free time and will likely find a job in \n     preservation in Washington.\n       ``Leaving this job is the hardest thing,'' he said. ``I've \n     put my whole life into it. There's not an inch of Kentucky in \n     the last 29 years I've not seen.''\n       ``It's an incredible place,'' he said, ``and its greatest \n     asset are its people.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11682-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JEANE KIRKPATRICK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I today pay tribute to Will Edd Clark, \nwho is the general manager of the Western Dark Fired Tobacco Growers' \nAssociation in Murray, KY. Will Edd has served in this role for 27 \nyears, and during that time, he has been a tireless advocate for \ntobacco farmers in western Kentucky.\n  The Western Dark Fired Tobacco Growers' Association was established \nin 1931 and has helped administer the Federal tobacco program as well \nas represent the interests of tobacco growers in nine counties in \nwestern Kentucky, plus three counties in Tennessee. In 2004, the \ntobacco quota buyout program was signed into law, which dismantled the \nFederal tobacco program that had been in place since the 1930s. Will \nEdd realized the benefit that the association's growers would receive \nfrom this historical piece of legislation, and he played a vital role \nin securing its passage.\n  Now that the tobacco quota program is gone, the Western Dark Fired \nTobacco Growers' Association has decided to close its operations at the \nend of 2006. Although the association will no longer be in existence, \nthe association's historical papers will be kept by Murray State \nUniversity, which will preserve the legacy of Will Edd as a true \nsupporter of Kentucky's tobacco industry. I ask unanimous consent that \nan article which appeared in the Murray Ledger & Times on December 1, \n2006, detailing the association's history and Will Edd's record of \nservice be printed in the Record. I ask my fellow Senators to join me \nin thanking Will Edd Clark for his service to the people of Kentucky.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Despite Closure, Tobacco Association's History, Efforts Will Be \n                               Preserved\n\n                            (By Greg Travis)\n\n       Murray's Western Dark Fired Tobacco Growers' Association is \n     closing its operations after serving the people of western \n     Kentucky and west Tennessee since 1931. An absolute auction \n     of the association's business office and warehouses was held \n     Thursday for the 4,048 brick, business office complex at 206 \n     Maple Street and property consisting of 55,599 square feet of \n     three commercial warehouses located at Poplar and Elm \n     streets.\n       ``We appreciate everyone's interest in the auction. \n     Naturally, we would liked to have seen them bring more but we \n     had to sell them. We had no choice,'' Association General \n     Manager Will Edd Clark said, adding that the combined totals \n     realized from the sale was just over $400,000.\n       ``Those bidding knew this was an absolute auction. We're \n     proud for them. They got some good buys today.''\n       He said the office went to Rick Hixon and the warehouses \n     were purchased by Keith Brandon.\n       He said that as a result of the tobacco buyout program, \n     directors of the association decided there was no need or \n     purpose for the association to continue.\n       ``The association came about as a result of low prices that \n     were being realized from the\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\n     early 1900s to the 1920s. Farmers were looking for security \n     in their production of tobacco,'' Clark said. ``The tobacco \n     industry as we know it today did not exist. There were Night \n     Riders in the area and other situations that influenced the \n     production of tobacco for many growers.''\n       He said the tobacco business that most people are familiar \n     with existed from the 1930s until the tobacco quota buyout \n     that was included in the America Jobs Creation Act of 2004 \n     terminated the federal tobacco price support and supply \n     control programs.\n       He said the program that had been in place until then \n     worked well and was one of the best farm programs. ``But \n     everything has a life span. With the anti-tobacco feelings in \n     the country today it's hard to generate changes in the \n     program,'' he said.\n       He said the local organization had a lot of local history. \n     ``Tobacco will continue to play a major role in this region. \n     It will still be here for many years to come, but you have to \n     change with the changes, and our changes will really start to \n     be felt with the new owners of our properties.''\n       Clark said that once the properties are disposed of and all \n     the business issues are settled, the association will go back \n     and return those assets to the association's members.\n       He added that James R. Cash of Mayfield, who is a member of \n     the association, offered to conduct the auctions at no fee \n     charge. ``He said that, as a member, he has been fortunate to \n     assist other members with auctions of land and equipment and \n     that he wanted to conduct this auction with no fees,'' Clark \n     noted. ``This will be a great benefit to the association and \n     its members.''\n       Clark said the association will still maintain a presence \n     in the community for some time. He said, as with any industry \n     of its size, there are still business-related issues that \n     will require time and attention. He estimated that his final \n     days on the job would probably be in a few months. ``The \n     association had a good run. There have been lots of directors \n     and I have no regrets for my time here.''\n       The association has approximately 1,000 members, it was \n     reported.\n       He noted that, over the years, tobacco has paid billions of \n     dollars in taxes and those dollars collected have paid for \n     many things. ``Tobacco has meant so much to so many people \n     and it has impacted everyone. Our forefathers thought it was \n     important enough that there are tobacco leaves on the facades \n     of many important buildings. Tobacco has saved many farmers, \n     helped families and sent many children to school.''\n       Throughout the years the local association has administered \n     the tobacco program and lobbied for the growers in the nine \n     counties of the Jackson Purchase and the Tennessee counties \n     of Henry, Weakley and Obion.\n       ``Since there will not be a tobacco program or a price \n     support system, then there really isn't a need or purpose for \n     our association any longer,'' Clark said. ``We have been \n     working to get things in place for the closure.''\n       Clark said he has arranged with Murray State University to \n     take over some of the association's historical papers.\n       ``This will be a big benefit for residents of the \n     community. MSU's people will have to go through the old \n     papers and catalog all of those items before they are \n     available to the public,'' he said. ``We have old records, \n     papers and even the minute books from the first meetings. \n     Many papers date back to 1931. And there are old floor sheets \n     on tobacco that went to pool. There's lots of information and \n     names.''\n       He said the vintage documents will be of interest to a lot \n     of people.\n       ``One of the very first things I did when I came to work \n     here was to go back and read through all of the old minute \n     books. It really helped me to know where we were as an \n     association and it helped to plan for the future,'' he noted.\n       Clark is only the fourth or fifth manager since the \n     association began. He said he was unsure what he would do, \n     but he added, ``something will come along.''\n       Association President Jim Kelly said the sale was the end \n     of a long era in Calloway County. ``Lots of farmers were \n     helped through the association. Things are just different \n     now. Farmers are contracting with companies and that's where \n     most of the farmers are at these days. The pool was a safety \n     net that would grade and process tobacco until somebody \n     needed it,'' he said.\n       Kelly, who farms 76 acres of burley and dark-fired tobacco, \n     said more farmers were going for larger acreage and many of \n     the smaller farmers were dropping out the businesses. ``With \n     the costs of farming nowadays, it's just not something that \n     people get into the way they used to do.''\n       He said farmers were basically at the mercy of what the \n     companies would pay for the tobacco. But even then, there are \n     pluses and minuses to the situation.\n       He added that the association was in a shut-down phase and \n     assets would eventually be returned to its members.\n       ``There hasn't been any tobacco stored in those warehouses \n     in a long time. It's sad to see it all come to a close,'' he \n     remarked.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11683-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEFINITION CLARIFICATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss a very \nimportant issue facing American workers--millions of whom will be \nbarred from organizing or exercising their labor rights unless Congress \nintervenes.\n  Eight million workers will no longer be able to join a union or fight \ncollectively for better pay and working conditions--including those \nalready in a union, who will be forced to leave when their current \ncollective bargaining agreements expire.\n  This includes more than 800,000 nurses--40,000 nurses in my home \nState of Illinois alone.\n  This will happen because the Bush administration's National Labor \nRelations Board recently decided which types of workers are considered \n``supervisors.'' By law, if you are considered a ``supervisor,'' then \nyou are not allowed to join a union.\n  In a series of rulings, the NLRB has decided the fate of America's \nworkers, and it did so behind closed doors. These changes--some of the \nbiggest decisions in years have stripped millions of American workers \nof their rights under the National Labor Relations Act.\n  This flies in the face of what Congress intended more than 60 years \nago.\n  Moreover, at a time when several states are suffering from nursing \nshortages, this will further worsen the nursing crisis. More than 72 \npercent of hospitals experience nursing shortages, and 1.2 million \nnursing positions need to be filled within the next decade. By denying \n800,000 nurses the right to collectively bargain, pay will surely \ndecrease and nurses' working environment will deteriorate, thereby \ndriving even more nurses out of the profession and discouraging people \nfrom becoming nurses.\n  Clearly, this law must be clarified so that American workers receive \nthe labor law protections that Congress envisioned.\n  Many courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have \nstruggled with how to apply the definition of ``supervisor.'' It is \ntime for this Congress to step up and make clear that the American \nworker has the right to organize.\n  Therefore, early in the next Congress, I hope that every Senator will \njoin Senators Dodd, Kennedy and myself in introducing legislation to \namend the National Labor Relations Act to clarify the definition of \n``supervisor.''\n  The legislation we envision will use a commonsense definition of the \nterm that is faithful to Congress's intent in 1947, to delineate the \nrelationship between supervisors and employees.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in the 110th Congress to pass this much-needed legislation so \nthat millions of working Americans will be able to retain their right \nto join a union and collectively bargain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11683-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11683-S11684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MATERNAL MORTALITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about what should be \na moment of great joy: the birth of a child. But for millions of women \nin the world, childbirth is a deadly game of Russian roulette.\n  Over 500,000 women died last year in childbirth or from complications \nduring pregnancy. Another 10 million were injured or disabled, often \npermanently. During her lifetime, a woman in Angola has a 1 in 7 chance \nof dying in childbirth or from complications stemming from pregnancy--1 \nin 7. In Sierra Leone, the risk of dying is 1 in 6. That number is the \nsame in Afghanistan--a 1 in 6 chance of dying from pregnancy or \nchildbirth. In developed countries, such as ours, the risk of dying in \nchildbirth is 1 in 2,800. Every such death is a tragedy, but it is hard \nfor us to even imagine that we would lose 1 of every 6 or 7 of our \nmothers, wives, sisters, or daughters.\n  That statistic, the chance of dying from childbirth, represents one \nof the widest chasms separating rich and poor countries.\n  That gap is wider than differences for life expectancy and wider than \ndifferences in child mortality, even though the health of the mother \nand her baby are deeply intertwined.\n  As Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations has stated, \n``In some countries, getting pregnant is the most dangerous thing a \nwoman can do.'' We have an obligation to change that state of affairs.\n  Earlier this fall, William Kristof wrote in the New York Times, \n``These women die because they are poor and female and rural--the most \noverlooked and disposable people throughout the developing world.''\n\n[[Page S11684]]\n\n  Kristof did a pair of columns on the subject of maternal mortality.\n  In the first column, he described how a young woman in Cameroon named \nPrudence Lemokouno was desperately ill. Her baby was already dead and \nshe was dying, her uterus ruptured. After 3 days of labor, her family \nhad managed to get her to a hospital, but the doctor initially refused \nto operate, saying he needed both money and blood. The family did not \nhave the money, and the nearest blood bank was 50 miles away. Kristof \nand his associate provided the money and donated the blood. They hoped \nit would be enough, but the doctor still did not operate immediately. \nLater, Mr. Kristof wrote a second column. In it, he told us that the \nyoung woman had died. In describing her struggle, he wrote, ``It was \nobvious that what was killing her wasn't so much complications in \npregnancy as the casual disregard for women like her across much of the \ndeveloping world. . . . It's not biology that kills them so much as \nneglect.''\n  We cannot continue to overlook these women. No one should be \ndisposable. And today's devastating statistics do not have to be \ntomorrow's realities. We cannot make childbirth risk free; it is not. \nThere are sometimes factors and conditions that doctors cannot in the \nfinest hospitals in the world cannot prevent.\n  But women and girls in developing countries die at such tragically \nhigh rates during pregnancy and childbirth primarily for some basic and \npreventable reasons. And many of the solutions are both simple and cost \neffective.\n  Millions of deliveries in the world take place without a skilled \nbirth attendant--that means no doctor, no nurse, no midwife, no one \nwith any medical training at all. In fact, millions of women literally \ngive birth alone.\n  The shortage of health workers handicaps the world's fight against \nHIV/AIDS and every other global health challenge. That is equally true \nof the struggle against maternal mortality. Training community health \nworkers, nurses, midwives, and doctors is part of the battle. But it is \nalso critical to help countries better distribute their health \nworkforces and better manage their health systems.\n  Malawi, for example, has one of the highest maternal mortality rates \nin the world. But 25 percent of its nurses and 50 percent of its \nphysicians are concentrated in 4 central hospitals. And yet the \npopulation of Malawi is estimated to be 87 percent rural.\n  We address the maternal mortality crisis in part by building health \nworkforces to provide prenatal care and to be there during delivery, in \nrural areas as well as cities.\n  We also help countries address this crisis by getting them to take a \nsecond look at child marriage. In developing countries, girls aged 10 \nto 14 who become pregnant are 5 times more likely to die in pregnancy \nor childbirth than women aged 20 to 24. These same young mothers are \nalso at higher risk of obstetric fistula. Fistula is a devastating \ncondition that can result from prolonged labor without medical help. In \nthe end, as a result, babies are most often stillborn and women and \ngirls are left with gaping holes in their bodies that leak feces and \nurine. They are then often abandoned by their families.\n  Even if their mothers escaped this brutal, prolonged labor and its \nterrible consequences, infant mortality rates for the babies of these \nchild mothers are also much higher than for the children of older \nwomen. Yet an estimated 25,000 girls are married each day in the world, \nsome of them as young as 7 or 8 years old.\n  We save lives not by demanding that countries ban child marriage in \nfact, child marriage is officially illegal in most nations. We save \nlives by convincing communities to keep their daughters in school \nrather than marrying them off. Many parents believe that marrying their \ndaughters early is the best way to keep them safe from sexual predators \nand other dangers. We can help their communities find better ways to \nkeep their daughters safe.\n  Senator Hagel and I have introduced a bill, the International Child \nMarriage Prevention and Assistance Act, to help countries take such \nsteps. We plan to reintroduce this bill when Congress reconvenes for \nthe new session in January and work toward its enactment.\n  Women and girls also die during pregnancy and childbirth because they \nare cut off from access to health care. There is a direct link between \nlack of transportation and high maternal mortality rates. That is one \nof the many links between poverty and maternal mortality. Being poor \nshould not be a death sentence.\n  Rural development is critical to solving this problem, and reducing \nmaternal mortality will enhance economic development. We can and should \ntrain more health workers, encourage communities to end child marriage, \nand build better transportation networks.\n  But those aren't the only factors that affect maternal mortality and \nour response to it. Politics is another cause of death. Of all the \nfactors that contribute to the deaths of mothers, and often their \nbabies, this is the easiest one to fix and the most unforgivable to \nallow to persist.\n  The United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, is an organization that is \ndoing lifesaving work. They help to promote reproductive health, \nincluding, for example, providing safe delivery kits. What is a safe \ndelivery kit? It is often just a plastic sheet, a bar of soap, a razor \nto cut the umbilical cord, and a string to tie it. Imagine being on the \nverge of giving birth or knowing that your wife is about to deliver and \nlacking even these most basic supplies.\n  UNFPA provides family planning assistance in countries where they are \nwelcomed. In those countries, they provide this help to families who \nask for it. They also have a well developed program to prevent and \ntreat obstetric fistula, that terrible condition which I described \nearlier that results from prolonged labor without medical assistance.\n  So each year, Congress appropriates money to support UNFPA's efforts \nto help countries and families who want their assistance. Yet every \nyear the Bush administration has withheld that money. The \nadministration does so because it claims that since UNFPA works in \nChina, that UNFPA is supporting or participating in coercive abortions \nor involuntary sterilization, practices which the Chinese Government \nhas long carried out.\n  In fact, UNFPA works to do exactly the opposite. UNFPA promotes \nvoluntary family planning and opposes abortion as a form of family \nplanning.\n  The United States sent a fact finding mission to China in 2002 to \ninvestigate this matter. It found no evidence of wrongdoing by UNFPA \nand recommended that the funds Congress appropriated for UNFPA be \nreleased. Studies have shown that abortions decrease in areas where \nUNFPA operates--and so do maternal and child mortality.\n  False accusations that UNFPA supports abortions in China are cutting \noff funding that could help save the lives. Yet, on September 13, for \nthe fifth year in a row, the Bush administration announced that it was \nwithholding the $34 million appropriated by Congress for UNFPA.\n  Every minute, a woman in the developing world dies from treatable \ncomplications of pregnancy or childbirth. That is a terrible tragedy. \nBut the fact that politics are making this tragedy worse is an \nabomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11684-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11684-S11685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to honor SSG \nJeremy W. Mulhair of Omaha, NE.\n  Sergeant Mulhair will be remembered as a brave and committed soldier, \na dedicated husband, and a loving father. His family says it was \nSergeant Mulhair's dream to serve his country as a soldier, inspired by \nhis father's, Jerry Mulhair, service in Vietnam, his uncle's service in \nthe Navy, and a cousin's in the Marines.\n  Sergeant Mulhair was originally born in Michigan but grew up on a \nfarm in a rural area northwest of Omaha. He attended Horace Mann Junior \nHigh School and Omaha Central High School. He later earned an \nequivalency degree before enlisting in the Nebraska Army National \nGuard. Sergeant Mulhair served with the Army in Korea in addition to \ntwo tours in Iraq.\n  On November 30, 2006, while serving in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom with A Troop, 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Calvary \nDivision, of Fort Hood, TX, Sergeant Jeremy\n\n[[Page S11685]]\n\nMulhair passed away when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle in \nTaji, Iraq. He was 35 years old and had been serving in Iraq since \nOctober.\n  Giving his life in service to our country, Sergeant Jeremy Mulhair is \nthe paradigm of courage and selflessness. He is survived by his wife \nSuzie and three children, Celina, Jeremy, and Maybel, of Fort Hood, TX; \nhis parents, Jerry and Mildred, of Kimballton, IA; his brother, Robert \nMulhair, of Mead; and his sisters, Tammy Lines and Dixie Heisner, both \nof Omaha.\n  I offer my prayers and thoughts to Sergeant Mulhair's family. He made \nthe ultimate sacrifice to ensure that his children and others realize a \npeaceful and free world.

He graduated from Lincoln High School \nin 2002, where teachers and classmates knew him for his easygoing \npersonality and intelligence. He was also interested in cars, \nparticipating in a local car club, Camaros, Inc.\n  Friends say Corporal Scholl had dreamed of serving as a marine since \nhe was young. When he enlisted it was only after being denied at first \nbecause he was diagnosed with a kidney condition as a toddler. His \nability to overcome this obstacle set the precedent for his reputation \nas a reliable, courageous marine. Corporal Scholl's company commander \ntold Scholl's family that the corporal had saved his life during a \nbattle in October.\n  Corporal Scholl met his wife Melissa on a beach in Hawaii while \ntraining there. The couple married before his overseas assignment in \nAfghanistan. A few weeks after his deployment to Iraq, Melissa gave \nbirth to their daughter, Addison. Sadly, Scholl was never able to see \nhis infant daughter.\n  On November 14, 2006, while serving with the Marine Corps' 2nd \nBattalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, III Marine \nExpeditionary Force based out of Kaneohe Bay, HI, Corporal Scholl \npassed away from wounds received from a roadside bomb in Haditha, Iraq. \nHe was 21 years old.\n  In addition to his wife and daughter, Cpl Mike Scholl is survived by \nhis mother and stepfather, Debora and Jackson Chandler of Lincoln, and \nhis father and stepmother, Steve and Donna Scholl of Friend.\n  Sacrificing his own life so that others could live, Corporal Scholl \nwas the embodiment of bravery and the finest example of selflessness. I \nextend my deepest condolences to Corporal Scholl's family and friends. \nHis unfaltering patriotism and his dedication to his family will remain \na source of hope and inspiration for all Americans. Corporal Scholl was \na man of exceptional honor, and we will not forget what he gave for our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11685-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Sergeant First Class Scott E.

JONES, U.S. MARINE CORPS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend GEN James L. Jones and to congratulate him on his retirement. \nGeneral Jones has served this country through landmark events, \nincluding the Cold War and September 11, with consistent skill and with \ndedication, energy and intelligence. The country has greatly benefited \nfrom his service, and his clear-eyed counsel will be greatly missed.\n  I have known Jim Jones for almost 30 years. I was immediately \nimpressed with his calm manner and obvious intellect when I first \nencountered him as a major in the Senate's Marine Corps liaison office. \nI had heard of his distinguished background to that point, which \nincluded service in Vietnam, where he earned a Silver Star, and years \nas a company commander, motivating his marines with his steadfastness.\n  Over the years, I, along with all of my colleagues in the Senate, \nhave watched Jim Jones grow into a stellar leader. There are two sides \nto military service--the field operations and the administrative side. \nWhile each presents its own challenges, both are absolutely essential \nto a strong Marine Corps. Jim Jones has been simply superb in both \nroles.\n  I remember encountering then Colonel Jones in northern Iraq after the \nfirst gulf war during Operation Provide Comfort, which sought to \nprovide food and supplies to the Kurds. At one point, I accompanied him \ninto the town of Zaku. While you would think that this would be one of \nthe more dangerous places, with multitudes of refugees and harassing \nIraqi forces, I must admit I have never felt safer as Marine helicopter \ngunships, Air Force A-10s, and well-orchestrated groups of marines \nprovided cover. General Jones was utterly comfortable, and completely \nconfident, in that environment.\n  Yet he was just as at home in the conference rooms at Corps \nHeadquarters, at the Pentagon, and walking the historic Halls of \nCongress. Serving as the 32nd Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, \nGeneral Jones provided remarkable leadership to the Corps before and \nafter the September 11 attacks. The marines under his command took on \ncritical counterterrorist activities, forging strong ties with our \nspecial operations forces. General Jones' leadership led to the Marine \nCorps' successful operations in southern Afghanistan. Always a \npersuasive advocate for adequate resources for the Corps, he was an \nequally outstanding contributor to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he \ncould only ``partly'' wear his service hat.\n  For someone with such multifaceted talent, skill and experience, it \nis little surprise that General Jones performed in equally spectacular \nfashion in his last, two-pronged position as Commander of U.S. European \nCommand and as the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. The 14th Supreme \nAllied Commander, he has encouraged our NATO allies to take on greater \nmilitary responsibilities outside of Europe, including more leadership \nin ongoing operations in Afghanistan. His clear, well-spoken manner and \nobvious credibility have made General Jones an invaluable asset.\n  Through it all, General Jones has had no greater partner, confidant, \nand friend than his wife Diane. The commitment that they have shown in \nthe good and bad times, to their children and to all who know them, is \nsimply remarkable, and it is inspiring.\n  I join with my wife Marcelle, my fellow Vermonters, and all Americans \nin expressing our deep thanks to General Jones and his family. We owe \nthis outstanding American, great marine, and dedicated representative \nof the very\n\n[[Page S11686]]\n\nbest aspects of our Nation, a debt of gratitude that can never be \nrepaid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11686-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LANDMINES IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as someone who has been concerned about the \nproblem of landmines for nearly two decades, I was heartened when every \nnation in this hemisphere, except, regrettably, the United States and \nCuba, joined the Ottawa Treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. Many of \nthem had experienced the human misery and economic hardship that \nlandmines cause. Today most people in Central and South America can \nwalk in safety thanks to the treaty and thanks to the efforts of the \nOrganization of American States, with assistance from the U.S. \nGovernment, to remove the mines in those countries.\n  Today Colombia is the only country in Latin America where landmines \nare still being used. They are a persistent problem in almost every \ndepartment, including some of Colombia's richest coffee-growing areas. \nAccording to the 2006 Landmine Monitor report, landmines in Colombia \nclaim an average of three new victims a day. Colombia has the third \nhighest incidence of mine victims in the world, behind only Cambodia \nand Afghanistan.\n  In Colombia the mines are used by rebel and paramilitary groups, and \nthey are rudimentary in design. They kill or maim whoever comes into \ncontact with them, whether it is a soldier or a young child. Many of \nthe victims live in remote areas, hours or days from any medical \nservices, so there is a high risk of bleeding to death.\n  Several initiatives are under way to help Colombia's mine victims \nwith artificial limbs and rehabilitation and vocational services. Among \nthem are the Polus Center for Social and Economic Development, the \nColombian Coffee Federation, the OAS, Centro Integral de Rehabilitacion \nde Colombia, the Observatorio de Minas Antipersonnel, and the Colombian \norganization TECNOVO.\n  In addition, the Colombian organization United for Colombia has been \nworking on a shoestring budget, and recently with assistance from the \nU.S. Government, to bring Colombian soldiers who have been grievously \ninjured from landmines to the United States for reconstructive surgery.\n  I applaud the efforts of organizations that are working to assist \nvictims of landmines in Colombia.\n  It is tragic that any of this is necessary. Landmines are inhumane, \ninherently indiscriminate weapons which should be relegated to the \ndustbin of history. The FARC rebels and AUC paramilitaries who use \nmines should be condemned. The use of these weapons is a gross \nviolation of human rights and a crime against humanity.\n  On December 3, 2007, the world will mark the 10th anniversary of the \nsigning of the Ottawa Treaty. Great progress has been made during the \npast decade in ridding the world of landmines. Let us hope that those \nwho continue to insist on their right to use these indiscriminate \nweapons--in Colombia and in other parts of the world including the \nUnited States--will finally recognize that too often their victims are \ninnocent people and that this cannot be justified.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11686-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FIGHTING MALARIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year, the widely read, widely \nrespected Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly launched his Nothing \nBut Nets campaign after learning that thousands of Africans--including \nabout 3000 children--die each day from malaria and that simple mosquito \nnetting could save many of these lives.\n  When I saw recently that his readers had kicked in more than $1.2 \nmillion for this effort--enough to buy 150,000 nets--I had to give that \ndollar total a double-take before it sunk in. His campaign has \ncollected enough to buy thousands and thousands of nets, enough to save \nthousands and thousands of lives. Those nets, distributed by the United \nNations Foundation and the World Health Organization, already are \naccomplishing that.\n  What Rick Reilly's crusade shows is that if you give Americans a \nclear and worthy goal, just about anything is possible.\n  Government and private relief agencies should be taking notes--and a \nlesson--from Rick Reilly. There are so many other devastating diseases \nthat we could control or even conquer, if we summon the will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Rick Reilly's column about this project \nbe printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was \nordered to be printed in the Record.\n\n                  [Sports Illustrated, Nov. 28, 2006]\n\n                           Nothing But Thanks\n\n                            (By Rick Reilly)\n\n       Seven months ago you and I found out that each day 3,000 \n     African children die of malaria for the very sad reason that \n     they can't afford mosquito nets over their beds. Didn't seem \n     right to us. Sports is nothing but nets--lacrosse nets, \n     cutting down the nets, New Jersey Nets. So SI started the \n     Nothing But Nets campaign. Doctors guaranteed that if you \n     sent in $20, you'd save at least one kid's life, probably \n     two.\n       It was the alltime no-brainer. Skip lunch; save a life. Buy \n     the Top-Flites instead of the Titleists; save a life. Don't \n     bet on the Redskins; save a life. Nothing to research. No \n     government to topple. No warlords to fight.\n       Bless your little hearts, all 17,000-plus of you who \n     chipped in more than $1.2 million--enough to buy 150,000 \n     nets, which the United Nations Foundation and the World \n     Health Organization started hanging all over Nigeria, where \n     kids younger than five are getting murdered by mosquitoes \n     that come out only at night.\n       I know, because I saw the nets. Just got back. Feel a \n     little bad about going without you. After all, it was your \n     money. So let's pretend it was you who made the trip, not me.\n       Remember? Everywhere you went, people mistook you for King \n     Tut. Women got down on their knees and kissed your hand. \n     Whole towns threw festivals. The king in every ward summoned \n     you to his one-room, one-lightbulb palace. One pointed his \n     horsehair scepter at you and pronounced, ``Thank you for dee \n     nets. All my wives use dem!'' Turns out he has four wives and \n     23 kids, and they're all under the nets, which is a good \n     thing because the open sewer that runs right outside his \n     shack is a kind of one-stop malaria center.\n       Everywhere you went, 40 people followed: doctors and nurses \n     and random government suits and guards with AK-47s and vice-\n     kings. You rode in an eight-truck caravan past unimaginable \n     squalor, vans on fire and guys selling caskets on the \n     street--a very good business in Nigeria, where the average \n     life span is 47. And every time you opened your car door, two \n     drummers beat a skull-busting welcome. You'd pull into a \n     school, and the principal would hang a ribbon around your \n     neck and say something you couldn't hear. ``What?'' you'd \n     holler over the drums.\n       \"We humbly fumalk apoplia!''\n       And you'd shrug, and he'd gesture to the 200 kids behind \n     him, who were chanting something over and over, their faces \n     beaming. Later you'd find out it was, ``Thank you, white \n     person!''\n       And they'd play a soccer game in your honor that featured \n     nine-year-olds who played like 14-year-olds in the U.S., on \n     fields full of weeds and trash, with goals made of tree \n     branches. In three games the closest thing you saw to a boy \n     with shoes was a set of brothers who wore one sock each.\n       And they'd hand you the mike, and you'd try to say how \n     blown away you were and how you wished you could raise 100 \n     times more in donations, because already one hospital in \n     Nigeria is saying that since the nets went up, outpatient \n     cases of malaria have dropped from 80 a month to 50. But \n     they'd all put their hands to their ears and go, ``What?''\n       When you bribed the drummers into taking a union break, you \n     finally met the people you'll never forget: the mothers. \n     Turns out they're nothing but nuts about the nets. In fact, \n     so many mothers want the nets that to get one, the World \n     Health Organization requires them to bring their kids in for \n     a measles vaccination. How often do you get two for one on \n     diseases?\n       You met a mother who walked half a day to get a net. You \n     met a woman who sleeps with her four kids under her net, \n     maybe because she knows that three out of every 10 child \n     deaths in Nigeria are from malaria.\n       In the fetid slums of Lagos you met a woman named Shifawu \n     Abbas who's had malaria twice. ``Everybody wants the nets \n     here, everybody!'' she said, beaming. ``My sister visited \n     from the country and tried to steal it from me!''\n       Still, as you were climbing back into your air-conditioned \n     SUV, she yanked back your hand and begged, ``Please? Can I \n     come with you?''\n       Sorry, you said.\n       On the last day you met Noimot Bakare, a mother whose \n     youngest child died of malaria. She was so grateful that she \n     trembled as she spoke. ``Malaria is killing our children,'' \n     she said, holding her toddler. ``There is so much need here. \n     God will bless you for the work you are doing.''\n       Please go to NothingButNets.net and keep it up.\n       For that, we humbly fumalk apoplia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11686-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11686-S11687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INDIAN GAMING LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. McCAIN. The 109th Congress ends with many missed \nopportunities, and among them is the opportunity to enact necessary \namendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA.\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\nIGRA has not been significantly amended since its enactment in 1988, \nalmost 20 years ago. When IGRA was enacted, Indian gaming was a $200 \nmillion dollar industry. Today, the industry earns $23 billion a year. \nThe industry is no longer just bingo; instead, the lion's share of \nrevenue--at least 80 percent--is generated by what IGRA calls class III \ngaming; that is, slot machines and other ``Las Vegas'' style casino \ngames. This explosive and unanticipated growth in Indian gaming has \ncreated a changed environment that cries out for modifications in the \nlaw. Yet Members of this body have blocked getting needed legislation \npassed. They have done so at the cost of good public policy.\n  During the 2 years that I have served as chairman and Senator Dorgan \nhas served as vice chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, we held \nseven hearings on Indian gaming. After four of those hearings and based \non testimony received, in November 2005, we introduced S. 2078. After \nthe bill's introduction, we held three more hearings to continue \noversight over the Indian gaming industry. These hearings revealed, \namong other things, that a court decision had decimated the Federal \nregulatory agency's authority and that, meanwhile, new large Indian \ncasinos were threatening to appear in all areas of the country. Based \non the hearings and responses from interested parties, I offered a \nsubstitute amendment, which was successfully reported out of committee \nwith bipartisan support. However, when we sought unanimous consent for \npassage of the bill, holds were placed on it. These holds were placed \nby Senators with concerns that the bill was not restrictive enough and \nby those who thought it too restrictive. Understandably, these concerns \nwere mostly prompted by constituent interests. We then worked in a \nbipartisan effort to modify the bill to answer our colleagues' concerns \nwhile balancing the need to provide real oversight over the industry. \nSome of our Members' constituents, however, simply do not want Federal \noversight. Some took the position that there must be no change in IGRA \nbecause opening up IGRA would send a signal that Indian gaming was not \nperfect and no one was to speak that truth. It seems that these people \nassumed that ignoring the problems is a better policy than confronting \nthem.\n  And there are problems. Through S. 2078, I sought to confront these \nproblems while at the same time honoring the rights of Indian tribes to \nconduct gaming, a right guaranteed by the Supreme Court in the \nCalifornia v. Cabazon decision. I will continue to believe that \neffective regulation--including effective Federal regulation--of Indian \ngaming is critical to tribes' continued success.\n  A critical problem we have left unsolved is the hole left in \nregulation of class III gaming; that is, slots and other casino games. \nOn August 24, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia issued its decision in Colorado River Indian Tribes v. NIGC, \n``CRIT'', ruling that the National Indian Gaming Commission, NIGC, did \nnot have jurisdiction to issue class III Minimum Internal Controls \nStandards, MICS. That ruling was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia in October of this year.\n  Until the court's decision, the NIGC had been regulating class III \ngaming through MICS since 1999. The regulations applied both to class \nII gaming--that is, bingo and games similar to bingo--and to class \nIII--gaming including slot machines and table games--which represents \nthe source of four-fifths of all revenue in Indian gaming. Following \nthe CRIT decision, however, tribes have increasingly challenged NIGC's \nauthority to issue or enforce the MICS over class III gaming. This \nleaves Federal oversight only over class II gaming, which is a small--\nand with increasing numbers of States entering into compacts, a \ndiminishing--source of Indian gaming revenue. It leaves class III \nregulation up to the terms of the compacts negotiated between tribes \nand States. But States' roles in regulating and enforcing class III \nregulation varies widely among State-tribal compacts. While some States \ntake a rigorous role in regulation, many simply do not have the \nexpertise or resources to regulate Indian casino games. These States \nhave typically relied on NIGC to provide regulations. As a result of \nthe CRIT decision, however, tribes are increasingly refusing to allow \nfor NIGC access to or oversight of their gaming facilities. These \ntribes are, in effect, now free to regulate themselves.\n  I do not believe that self-regulation without oversight is real \nregulation. By failing to enact legislation that overturns the CRIT \ndecision, we have left the lion's share of a huge industry in its own \nhands. This is not a small matter. Indian gaming in 2006 is a \nnationwide industry. More than 220 tribes operate gaming facilities \nthroughout the United States, from Connecticut to California. Indian \ngaming is no longer simple bingo parlors on rural Indian reservations. \nFor a nationwide industry that generated $23 billion dollars a year and \nis growing, uniform Federal standards are necessary and vigorous \nenforcement of those standards are imperative to making sure that the \nmoney that customers put into Indian gaming machines finds its way \nsafely from the casinos to the tribal governments, which through IGRA \nare directed to use the money to strengthen the social and economic \nfabric of their tribes. The failure of this Senate to pass this bill \nwill leave Indian gaming radically less protected than it was before \nthe 109th Congress convened and the CRIT decision was issued. What we \nhave now is the triumph of individual self-interests over the public \ngood and it sorrows me to leave Indian gaming in that condition.\n  Failure to pass this bill also leaves a well-documented hole in \nFederal oversight of gaming contracts. While the NIGC has told us that \nmanagement contracts are not the only source of overreaching by \ncontractors, we have left the agency with the authority to approve or \ndisapprove only management contracts. Similarly, while we all know that \nIndian gaming is spreading beyond the confines of reservations, by not \npassing this bill, we have also failed to amend IGRA to limit ``off-\nreservation'' gaming and the growth of casinos where local people could \nnever have foreseen their arrival. In 1988, when we first enacted IGRA, \nwe provided a general prohibition against conducting gaming on land \nacquired after 1988; in the interest of fairness, several exceptions to \nthis ban were provided. Unfortunately, exploitation of these \nexceptions, not anticipated in 1988, has led to a burgeoning practice \nby unscrupulous developers seeking to profit off Indian tribes \ndesperate for economic development.\n  S. 2078 would have eliminated the ability of tribes to establish \ncasinos outside of their reservations and provided a process whereby \nlocal communities can voice their concerns regarding impacts of casino \ndevelopment. Finally, it would have prevented attempts to create \nreservation land, specifically for casinos, through so-called land \nclaims unless Congress actually approved legislation to that effect.\n  It is my hope that the next Congress will leave Indian gaming better \nregulated and more responsive to present-day realities than this \nCongress has left it. This is my hope for tribal members, who depend on \nhonestly tracked revenue from gaming establishments for their \ngovernment services. This is my hope for local communities who are \nfacing the prospect of huge casinos in their hometowns where they could \nnever have anticipated them. I am hopeful that we will choose to put \nthe good of the American people above special interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11687-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11687-S11688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NORTH KOREA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I think we all can agree that North \nKorea remains one of the greatest challenges to our country's foreign \nand national security policy, and it is clear that approaches to date \nhaven't been successful. This year saw Kim Jong Il launch seven \nballistic missiles into the sea of Japan and successfully detonate a \nnuclear device, defying the clear will of the international community \nand forcing us to confront the reality of a nuclearized North Korea.\n  The Bush administration's policy on North Korea has been a complete \nfailure. The 1994 Agreed Framework which this administration inherited \nwas not perfect, and the North Koreans cheated by pursuing uranium \nenrichment. But the collapse of the framework, which had kept North \nKorea's fuel rods under IAEA supervision, has been a disaster.\n\n[[Page S11688]]\n\nAs the Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet testified \npublicly in 2004, ``the IC judged in the mid-1990s that North Korea had \nproduced one, possibly two, nuclear weapons. The 8000 rods the North \n[now] claims to have processed into plutonium metal would provide \nenough plutonium for several more.''\n  But that is the past; our problem now is to find a way forward. For \nfar too many months we have been waiting on the sidelines, hoping, \npassively, that conditions will turn our way. We have been distracted \nby Iraq--it took a series of missile launches and the actual detonation \nof a nuclear device for us to get fully engaged again. And still we \nwait for the Six Party Talks to reconvene.\n  I welcome the news that North Korea has agreed to come back to the \nSix Party Talks. That is a good starting point, but it cannot be the \nend point; the Six Party process has dragged on for years now, and the \nonly objective result has been that Kim Jong Il now has nuclear \nweapons. There must be results that come from these talks, and we must \nhave in place benchmarks for what success means. I hope that we can \nconvince Kim Jong Il to give up his nuclear weapons, but history does \nnot provide a great deal of reassurance on that score. At a minimum, we \nshould seek steps in that direction, such as partial dismantlement or a \nfreeze on further production of fissile material, as a starting point.\n  Ultimately, North Korea needs to be brought back into the \ninternational fold. Unfortunately, we can't do that if we signal that \nour true desire is ``regime change'' and we continue to refuse to \nconsider other options, such as direct negotiations. When dealing with \nsuch an important matter to our national security, we should not keep \nany option off the table. It is high time for a change of course in \nPresident Bush's North Korea policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11688-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11688-S11689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments regarding the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, or County \nPayments Act as it has been nicknamed.\n  As this session comes to an end, I want to express my disappointment \nthat this Congress did not act to reauthorize County Payments and to \npublicly reaffirm my commitment to finding resolution for this issue.\n  In 2000, the Congress passed Public Law 106-393 to address the needs \nof the forest counties of America. It created a new cooperative \npartnership between citizens in forest counties and our Federal land \nmanagement to develop forest health improvement projects on public \nlands and simultaneously stimulate job development and community \neconomic stability.\n  The act has been an enormous success, not just achieving but \nsurpassing the goals of Congress. This act has restored programs for \nstudents in rural areas and prevented the closure of numerous isolated \nschools. It has been a primary funding mechanism to provide rural \nschool students with educational opportunities comparable to those \nenjoyed by suburban and urban students. More than 4,400 rural schools \nreceive funds because of this act.\n  Next, the act has allowed rural county road districts and county road \ndepartments to address the severe maintenance backlog. Snow removal has \nbeen restored for citizens, tourists, and school buses. Bridges have \nbeen upgraded and replaced, and culverts that are hazardous to fish \npassage have been upgraded and replaced.\n  In addition, over 70 Resource Advisory Committees, or RACs, have been \nformed. These RACs cover our largest 150 forest counties. Nationally, \nthese 15-person diverse RAC stakeholder committees have studied and \napproved more than 2,500 projects on Federal forestlands and adjacent \npublic and private lands. These projects have addressed a wide variety \nof improvements drastically needed on our national forests. Projects \nhave included fuels reduction, habitat improvement, watershed \nrestoration, road maintenance and rehabilitation, reforestation, \ncampground and trail improvement, and noxious week eradication.\n  RACs are a new and powerful partnership between county governments \nand the land management agencies. They are rapidly building the \ncapacity for collaborative public land management decisionmaking in \nover 150 of our largest forest counties in America and are reducing the \ngridlock over public land management, community by community.\n  The legacy of this act over the last few years is positive and \nsubstantial. This law should be extended so it can continue to benefit \nthe forest counties, their schools, and continue to contribute to \nimproving the health of our national forests.\n  I could go on and on about the merits of this act, but the truth is \npolitics got in the way of funding any extension.\n  Some of my colleagues proposed to fund this measure through a \nsweeping new 3-percent withholding on all payments made by Federal, \nState, and local governments. This proposal would impose significant \nburdens on businesses. In most cases, businesses make substantially \nless than a 3-percent profit on their contracts and sometimes turn no \nprofit at all. The withholding requirement will effectively withhold \nentire paychecks--interest free--thereby impeding the cash flow of \nsmall businesses, eliminating funds that can be used for reinvestment \nin the business, and forcing companies to pass on the added costs to \ncustomers or finance the additional amount. In addition, the cost to \nthe Federal, State, and local governments to administer and implement \nthe new withholding requirement will be substantial. The Congressional \nBudget Office called the provision an unfunded mandate on State and \nlocal governments because its expected costs exceed the allowable $50 \nmillion annual threshold. In short, this proposal would hurt many of \nthe same people we are trying to help.\n  The administration also proposed a few ideas, one being the selling \nof public lands. I have always supported the exchange or sale of small \nparcels of public land that improve land management for wildlife \nhabitat, recreation, and access. I oppose selling those public lands \nthat are America's treasures such as national parks, wilderness lands, \nor national monuments. I also oppose selling public lands for the sole \npurpose of generating funds for the U.S. Treasury.\n\n  All of the ideas I brought to the working group encouraged \nresponsible resource development and further promoted the relationship \nof our resource dependant communities and our public lands. I have \nencouraged the working group to look at expediting oil and gas leases, \nthus generating additional revenue through increased royalty payments. \nNext, I asked that the working group consider streamlining NEPA for \nsalvage logging and other timber-related projects. My hope was to build \non the success of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003 and \nreunite our communities with our public lands.\n  Let me assure you that these ideas I have just described were only \nthe tip of the iceberg. No stone was left unturned, and in many cases \nthe rock was flipped several times in hopes of shaking a new idea \nloose. Unfortunately, none of the ideas could garner enough bipartisan \nsupport. Again, it is upsetting to me to see an issue that has built \nits reputation on nonpartisan success fall victim to partisan politics.\n  If we do not work to reauthorize this act, all of the progress of the \nlast 6 years will be lost. Schools in timber-dependant communities will \nlose a substantial part of their funding. These school districts will \nhave to start making tough budget decisions such as keeping or \ncanceling afterschool programs, sports programs, music programs, and \nother programs that serve the basic educational needs of our children. \nIn addition, many school districts will have to determine if and how \nmany staff members they can retain for the next school year. Next, \ncounties will have to reprioritize road maintenance so that only the \nessential services of the county are met because that is all they will \nbe able to afford. Since most school districts and counties operate on \na fiscal year that begins July 1, many of these critical decisions have \nto be made sooner rather than later.\n  I have always viewed that this act as a temporary measure to help \ncommunities transition from historical payments to the reality of \ntoday. Unfortunately, our communities have not come far enough in the \nlast 6 short\n\n[[Page S11689]]\n\nyears. I want to work with my colleagues to help counties expedite \ntheir transitions and feel that the first step is to address how much \nfunding is associated with the reauthorization.\n  With the beginning of the next Congress, I will encourage my \ncolleagues to recall why we are working on this reauthorization, the \nrelationship between our public lands, schools, and counties. And I \nwill be asking for their commitment in working in a bipartisan fashion \nto address this critical issue expeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11689-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE DC COMMISSION FOR WOMEN\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the contributions \nthat the DC Commission for Women has made to the lives of the \ndisenfranchised in our Nation's Capital. Of particular note has been \nthe commission's focus on homeless women and children who are often \nforgotten and neglected in the District of Columbia.\n  I am particularly pleased that the commission will serve as a partner \nin the ``big read'' program, sponsored by the national endowment for \nthe arts. This program provides books for low-income ``at-risk'' \nchildren. The DC Commission for Women is also a national model for \neducating the public on domestic violence prevention and women's health \nand safety issues.\n  My remarks are coming on the eve of Mayor Anthony Williams' \ntransition from pubic service into private life. It is befitting that \nthe commission is paying tribute to Mayor Williams' mother, Virginia E. \nHayes Williams, a member of the commission and a strong advocate for \nchildren and women. It is not coincidental that the tribute will be \nheld at the Saint Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Church for Mrs. \nWilliams, like Constantine the Great's mother, Helen, advised her son \non religion and affairs of the state.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the commission's chair, Dr. \nChristine M. Warnke, whose leadership has brought international \nresources and visibility to the commission. She has expanded the \ncommission's programs and forged global partnerships which promote \nreligious and cultural tolerance.\n  As we move into the 110th Congress, I look forward to working with \nthe Commission for Women on these important issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11689-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                            VOICE OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as the people of Serbia approach a \ncritical national election on January 21, 2007, I pay tribute to the \njournalists and broadcasters who have worked to provide an antidote to \nforces of extremism in the country. I especially congratulate the Voice \nof America's Serbian Service and recognize the 10-year anniversary of \nits first television broadcast. VOA's long-running work in Serbia has \nplayed a valuable role in the country's evolution and provided an \nimportant source of information during the darkest periods of Serb \nhistory. This contribution has been particularly evident as Serbia has \nundergone profound changes in the last 10 years.\n  Open Studio, VOA's first daily television newscast, was launched on \nDecember 11, 1996, in the wake of massive demonstrations to protest the \ninvalidation of election victories by opponents of Slobodan Milosevic. \nIn the face of public outcry, the Milosevic regime worked quickly to \nsilence independent media outlets in Serbia, including a small, vibrant \nradio station called B92. The student-run station had distinguished \nitself by broadcasting hard news about the wars in the former \nYugoslavia and engaging in relentless criticism of the Government. \nVOA's Serbian Service responded to the Milosevic regime's attacks on \nmedia freedom by expanding its broadcast and providing extensive \nreports on the international reaction to the protests in Serbia. On the \nday Serb authorities finally shut down B92, VOA requested permission to \nhelp the station reach its audience via VOA radio waves. As a result, \nVOA Serbian launched a media solidarity project and began broadcasting \nreports prepared by B92 stringers. The solidarity project received \nwidespread international attention, including press coverage by the New \nYork Times, Washington Post, CNN, and many other respected media \noutlets.\n  After VOA began providing assistance to B92, the Milosevic Government \nrelented and permitted the station's radio service to resume \nbroadcasting. B92's chief editor, Veran Matic, credited VOA's \nassistance and international pressure on the Milosevic Government with \ngetting his station back on the air. B92 quickly became a symbol of \nfreedom and resistance to ultranationalism during the balance of the \nMilosevic era. Today, the station is one of the most respected radio \nand television broadcasters in Serbia.\n  VOA's Open Studio program has built on its early success and is now \ncarried by 53 television stations in the region; 45 in Serbia and \nMontenegro, 6 in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 1 each in Kosovo and \nMacedonia. VOA is the leading international broadcaster in Serbia and \nMontenegro today, reaching 16 percent of the country's population each \nweek through its radio and television programming.\n  By presenting American values to an audience that was predominantly \nanti-American, the Voice of America Serbian Service has been an \nimportant public diplomacy tool and helped promote United States \nforeign policy objectives in Southeast Europe. In keeping with the best \ntraditions of the service's 60-year history, VOA has helped guide Serbs \ntoward greater freedom and openness, and encouraged the country to come \nto terms with the difficult legacy of the Yugoslav wars. VOA's \nobjective, comprehensive reporting and analysis has provided reliable, \noften indispensable information to the region's Serbian population.\n  Events in Serbia during the last decade provide compelling evidence \nof how courageous journalism can serve as a catalyst for democratic \nchange. As the region prepares to deal with new challenges, including \npotential political changes in Belgrade and Kosovo, there is an ongoing \nneed to provide Southeast Europe with reliable information. Along with \nthe important work of B92 and other brave Serb partners, I applaud the \nefforts of the Voice of America to convey the facts and represent the \nUnited States to the people of Serbia. I look forward to the VOA's \ncontinued success in its next decade of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11689-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about World Trade \nMonth. I have always been a free trader, and I am very proud of the \nmany Oregon companies that are active in international trade and are \npioneers in breaking into new markets and tearing down ancient barriers \nto commerce and cooperation. As advances in technology and \ntransportation shrink our world, the international trade of goods and \nideas becomes more and more vital to our economy.\n  In May 2006, the Commerce Department's Office of Export Assistance \norganized a very timely and useful program that focused on Asian \nmarkets\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\nbeyond China. Oregonians who pay attention to trade realize the \nimportance of China as a market for goods and services from the Pacific \nNorthwest, but we also have a long and robust history of trade \nrelations elsewhere in Pacific Rim Asia. As a result of this, I have \nled the Senate's effort to normalize our trade relations with Vietnam \nand increase trade with the least developed countries in the Asia-\nPacific region.\n  As a businessman, I have seen how trade can raise standards of living \nboth in America and around the world. International commerce creates \nnew growth opportunities for our manufacturers and agricultural \nproducers, and WTO membership for Vietnam will help ensure that \neveryone's playing by the same rules. It will also mean that Oregon \nfarmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service providers will enjoy \ngreater access to a market of more than 83 million new customers.\n  During the Commerce Department's conference, Deputy Assistant USTR \nJeri Jensen provided a very insightful keynote address, which, without \nobjection, I would like to have printed in the Record. I believe this \nspeech is worth examination by my colleagues interested in trade policy \nand export markets for U.S. goods and services.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Expanding Trade With the Pacific Rim\n\n                        (Remarks of Jeri Jensen)\n\n       Want to thank the Portland USEAC and Scott Goddin in \n     particular. Before coming to USTR, I spent about 20 years at \n     the Commerce Department, working trade promotion and policy \n     issues. I've known Scott most of that time, and can say \n     without a doubt how lucky Portland is to have him.\n       Also want to thank companies that are here today, for their \n     interest in the region and their support for our trade agenda \n     more broadly. Companies like Intel, Nike, Tektronix, HP, \n     Infocus and Colombia Sportswear are the reason why we work as \n     hard as we do at USTR to increase our footprint in the Asia \n     Pacific region. We look forward to your support next year \n     when we seek Congressional approval for our trade agenda.\n       What I want to accomplish today is for you to come away \n     with the clear sense that there really is no other region in \n     the world now where we are more economically engaged than the \n     Asia Pacific. We have a vision to continue to get you in on \n     the ground floor of these economies, which you all know are \n     the fastest growing economies in the world.\n       This is good news to Oregon, because you all are the \n     seventh largest state exporter to Asia, (Washington is \n     third--but Scott assures me that its only forty planes and \n     some Microsoft software that separates Oregon from Washington \n     when it comes to trade with the Asia Pacific).\n       Exports from your state to Asia have averaged about $5 and \n     a half billion over the last 5 years, and as most of you \n     know, have been concentrated in the high tech sector and \n     agriculture. Eight of your top twelve trading partners, or \n     more than 60 percent of Oregon's trade, is with countries in \n     the Asia-Pacific region.\n       This tracks with the overall significance of U.S. trade \n     with Asia. Asia accounts for one-third of total U.S. trade--\n     up almost 70 percent over the past 10 years. U.S. investment, \n     also has more than tripled in the region over same period.\n       As we can see from the number of companies in the room, few \n     major U.S. companies do not have an Asia strategy, and many \n     have chosen some of our FTA partners like Malaysia and \n     Singapore as hubs for their regional supply chains.\n       What I want to do today is give you a snapshot of where we \n     are with our trade policy efforts in the region, but before I \n     do, let me provide some context and say a word about some of \n     the recent economic dynamics in the region.\n       First, it wasn't that long ago when our trade policy was \n     all about our rising trade deficit with Japan. Now, the \n     challenge and opportunity is dealing with the commercial and \n     strategic influence of China.\n       Second, along with China's new economic might, we've seen \n     unprecedented economic growth and political reform in the \n     rest of Asia. And, we are now the largest or second largest \n     trading partner of most of these fast-growing economies.\n       Third, most of the countries in the region are developing \n     unique visions of how they intend to compete and integrate \n     their economies into the global trading system. Some want to \n     move quickly, some more slowly.\n       Fourth, we are well aware of the fact that we are not the \n     only country that is thinking strategically about this \n     region. Virtually every country in Southeast Asia has or is \n     negotiating an FTA or regional agreement. There are now about \n     14 trade agreements in SE Asia. China has 3 now and is \n     negotiating 17 more. ASEAN has an FTA with China and is \n     negotiating FTAs with Korea and now the EU.\n       None of them are as comprehensive and deep as those the \n     U.S. negotiates. But they clearly affect the competitive \n     landscape, and China's influence in the region.\n       So the question we try to answer every day is how to deepen \n     our economic ties with each of these countries in a way that \n     supports their unique efforts toward economic and political \n     reform, and yet recognizes the commercial and strategic \n     significance of the region, and the fact that our competitors \n     are not standing still?\n       We are answering that question, as Ambassador Portman has \n     said, by walking and chewing gum at the same time.\n       We are working to build relationships regionally in APEC \n     and ASEAN. Indeed, we are all going to the APEC Trade \n     Ministerial next week, and we are in the midst of negotiating \n     a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with ASEAN.\n       But most of our efforts are focused on an aggressive \n     bilateral agenda. We believe this approach will accomplish \n     the most, in light of our Congressional requirements, the \n     different levels of development in the region, and the needs \n     of U.S. companies for genuine market access that goes beyond \n     just tariff reductions to include non-tariff measures like \n     IPR, remedies for investment disputes, trade facilitation, \n     transparency, and other barriers that plague many of the \n     markets in SE Asia.\n       This approach is working for U.S. companies. We are \n     increasing our exports and are opening the markets that \n     matter most to our exporters.\n       If you were to take all of our current FTA partners, while \n     they may represent only 14 percent of the world economy, they \n     buy about 50 percent of U.S. goods exports and are about the \n     size of our third largest market.\n       And if you look at the exports of our FTA partners, they \n     are growing at a clip of about twice as fast as our exports \n     to the rest of the world.\n       We have five FTAs in the Asia-Pacific region which we have \n     recently negotiated or are about to negotiate. When all five \n     are complete, Oregon companies will have better access to a \n     $2 trillion market, and the sixth largest market worldwide.\n       Our agreement with Singapore in 2003 was one of the first \n     FTAs President Bush announced under Trade Promotion Authority \n     and the first FTA between the U.S. and an Asian country.\n       Since we implemented the agreement, U.S. exports have \n     increased almost 25 percent and our trade surplus with \n     Singapore has tripled. Most of those increases have come in \n     sectors where Oregon companies are globally competitive, like \n     info technology equipment and chemicals.\n       Singapore, by the way, at our urging, has developed one of \n     the strongest intellectual property rights regimes in Asia. \n     Over the last 2 years they have even gone beyond their FTA \n     commitments, amending their laws in all IPR areas.\n       Based on those amendments, just last month Singapore's \n     courts imposed its first fine (of about $20,000) on a \n     copyright-infringing design firm after police discovered \n     illegal installations of Microsoft, Adobe, and Autodesk \n     software.\n       Our FTA with Australia was completed 1 year after \n     Singapore's. We have referred to it as ``the manufacturing \n     FTA'' because 99 percent of our manufactured goods exports \n     gained immediate duty free access. All U.S. agricultural \n     exports received immediate duty-free treatment as well.\n       One year later we can already see the benefits. U.S. \n     exports are already up 10 percent; U.S. agriculture exports \n     are at record levels, and when the data comes in we expect to \n     see gains in services as well.\n       Let me turn to our ongoing FTA negotiations in the region. \n     First, regarding Thailand, we have had six rounds of FTA \n     negotiations, and have made progress in a number of areas.\n       However as many of you know, this February the Thais called \n     for snap elections in April. Since then, the Thai government \n     has had no mandate to negotiate and our negotiations have \n     been on hold.\n       Two weeks ago, the Thai courts invalidated the results of \n     the April elections and new elections will now be held, \n     probably this Fall. Once a new government is in place, we \n     will determine, in consultation with the Thai government, \n     where we go from there.\n       But our negotiations with Malaysia are poised to begin in \n     three weeks in Penang. This agreement holds particular \n     promise for Oregon companies because you are the third \n     largest exporter to Malaysia, beating out Washington who \n     comes in at a mere 12th.\n       Few people realize we export more to Malaysia than we do to \n     India, Russia, Chile, Singapore, Brazil or Thailand. Malaysia \n     is our tenth largest trading partner, with $44 billion in \n     two-way trade, and a consistently strong growth rate \n     averaging about 5 percent for the last decade.\n       Two-thirds of our trade with Malaysia is in electronics and \n     high-tech products, and is tied to a number of U.S. company \n     supply chains, which may explain Oregon's interest. Financial \n     services and autos, where entry barriers are high, will also \n     likely benefit from an FTA.\n       We will also begin our negotiations with Korea next month. \n     This will be a huge opportunity for U.S. companies, as the \n     most commercially significant bilateral free trade agreement \n     launched by the U.S. since NAFTA 15 years ago.\n       Korea is the third largest market in Asia, after China and \n     Japan, and the world's tenth\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\n     largest economy. Like Malaysia, it has consistently high \n     growth of about 5 percent a year over the last 10 years. It \n     is a high-income economy with per capita income about \n     $20,000/year.\n       And it is a major world trader--the world's seventh largest \n     goods and services exporter. We are already Korea's second \n     largest trading partner.\n       But we are under no illusions about the challenge ahead. As \n     with Malaysia, we have about a year to complete the \n     agreement, which will be no small feat in light of the size \n     of the Korean economy and the number of non-tariff measures \n     unique to Korea. But because of the extensive preparatory \n     work that was done and the political commitment on both \n     sides, we believe it is achievable.\n       We also have an active bilateral agenda that's distinct \n     from our FTA negotiations.\n       At about the same time we were concluding the Singapore \n     FTA, President Bush announced the Enterprise for ASEAN \n     Initiative in 2002. This is really the strategic framework \n     for our trade relationship with the ASEAN countries.\n       It's a vision for a network of FTAs with those ASEAN \n     economies that have demonstrated an ability to resolve \n     bilateral trade issues, build strong support in the U.S. \n     business community and in the Congress, and are ready to meet \n     our comprehensive FTA commitments.\n       TIFAs--Trade and Investment Framework Agreements--are \n     really just a fancy acronym for an ongoing trade dialogue. \n     TIFAs are one of many possible bilateral vehicles that can \n     work to take a trade relationship to the next level.\n       The point is that we are broadening and deepening our trade \n     relationships throughout the region, and the shape that takes \n     for each country depends on each country. Indeed, precisely \n     because the region is so dynamic, there is no ``one size fits \n     all'' for trade agreements here.\n       We have TIFAs with 7 countries in Asia.\n       Our TIFA discussions with the Philippines and Indonesia are \n     great examples of the breadth of issues that can be covered.\n       The Philippines have lifted its ban on U.S. beef, opened \n     its market to U.S. poultry and modified their decision to \n     increase auto tariffs. There have also been major \n     accomplishments on IPR, including stronger legislation and \n     increased coordination among IP agencies.\n       Indonesia's Trade Minister Pangestu was just in town in \n     March for TIFA discussions. She and Ambassador Portman \n     announced a customs cooperation agreement and an MOU on \n     textiles. They also announced their intention to negotiate a \n     bilateral investment treaty and the first agreement ever on \n     illegal logging and illegal trade in endangered species.\n       As a major exporter of forest products that compete with \n     illegal logs, this should be of interest to Oregon. We hope \n     the agreement will be a model for other countries who have an \n     interest in protecting their land and sensitive habitats from \n     illegal logging, while making sure they have access to \n     legally produced timber.\n       We are particularly excited about the agreement in \n     principal we reached with Vietnam May 14 on bilateral market \n     access that will pave the way for Vietnam to enter the WTO.\n       This is a major accomplishment, considering that it wasn't \n     that long ago--just a little more than a decade--that France \n     was Vietnam's major trading partner and Vietnam was a state-\n     controlled economy.\n       Now the U.S. is Vietnam's major partner and it's clear \n     Vietnam recognizes its future is tied to the global economy, \n     through broad-based economic reform.\n       You can see this in the stats: its growth rate last year \n     alone was 8.4 percent, the fastest in Southeast Asia. Its \n     imports have grown dramatically. Last year our exports to \n     Vietnam were up 24 percent. Two-way trade with the U.S. has \n     grown to more than $8 billion, which is an increase of more \n     than 400 percent since 2001.\n       Our bilateral agreement will result in real market access \n     for U.S. companies when Vietnam accedes to the WTO.\n       About 94% of Vietnam's imports from the United States will \n     face duties of less than 15%. Major U.S. exports like \n     construction equipment, pharmaceuticals and aircraft will \n     face duties of less than 5%.\n       Vietnam will join the Information Technology Agreement, \n     implement low duties on nearly all medical equipment and to \n     harmonize its chemicals tariffs.\n       About three-fourths of U.S. agricultural exports to Vietnam \n     will face duties of less than 15%. And, Vietnam will open up \n     telecom, distribution, financial, insurance and energy \n     services to foreign participation.\n       The next step is for Congress to grant Vietnam Permanent \n     Normal Trade Relations (PNTR), so that U.S. companies can \n     take advantage of all of the benefits I've just described. We \n     believe there is bipartisan support for PNTR, and are \n     consulting with the Hill to highlight the benefits of the \n     agreement.\n       Last but certainly not least, let me say a few words about \n     Japan and China.\n       Japan of course is our 4th largest trading partner. And the \n     question that is always posed is why aren't we negotiating an \n     FTA with Japan? And the answer is, as with all of our FTAs, \n     we always seek a fully comprehensive agreement that covers \n     all industry sectors, including agriculture. And the reality \n     is that Japan is not yet interested in negotiating this kind \n     of fully comprehensive agreement.\n       That said, Japan certainly is one of our most important \n     trade relationships. We already have an advanced approach to \n     working with Japan, under our Joint Economic Partnership for \n     Growth, which includes work across a number of important \n     areas--including regulatory reform, financial services, \n     express delivery and investment.\n       And we are looking at new ways to integrate our markets \n     more, particularly in the area of IPR, both through APEC and \n     bilaterally.\n       And then there is China. Thirty years ago China accounted \n     for less than one percent of the world's economy. Today, it \n     is four percent of global economic activity, with almost $1 \n     trillion in foreign trade annually, one third of which is \n     with the U.S.\n       It is one of the world's fastest growing economies, with \n     almost 10 percent growth in 2005, the third largest economy \n     in the world in terms of purchasing power, and our second \n     largest trading partner.\n       What is often overlooked in our relationship with China is \n     the opportunity--the fact that it is our fastest growing \n     export market and that U.S. companies are doing quite well \n     there.\n       Exports to China have increased at a clip of about 20 \n     percent a year for the past five years. What's even more \n     impressive is that in the first 3 months of this year we \n     almost doubled that rate, with our exports increasing 39%, 2 \n     times faster than our exports to Japan and more than double \n     the growth rate of U.S. imports from China during the same \n     period.\n       And, China is not a market just for large, sophisticated \n     companies. The number of small and medium-sized enterprises \n     (SMEs) exporting to China rose faster than to any other major \n     market in the last ten years, with the total number of firms \n     exporting to China quadrupling.\n       But as with any complex relationship, there are challenges. \n     In February, USTR unveiled a top-to-bottom review which \n     concluded that, while the U.S. has clearly derived \n     substantial benefits from U.S.-China trade, the relationship \n     has not been sufficiently balanced.\n       We are entering a new phase in our relationship with China. \n     We are treating it as a mature trading partner and drawing \n     upon the full set of tools available to us to make sure China \n     complies with its commitments.\n       You may have noticed that we were just joined by Canada and \n     the EU in bringing a case to the WTO over China's unfair \n     barriers to imported auto parts. Of particular concern has \n     been its WTO commitment to enforce intellectual property \n     rights.\n       We've had two recent opportunities to strengthen this \n     relationship. The Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, or \n     JCCT, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce and the USTR, met \n     in April as it does each year to discuss our bilateral trade \n     agenda. And then there was President Hu's visit to see \n     President Bush ten days later.\n       At the JCCT, the Chinese made a number of commitments to \n     strengthen their enforcement of intellectual property, resume \n     trade in U.S. beef, improve access to China's telecom market, \n     sign the WTO government procurement code and take steps on \n     transparency and export controls.\n       During his remarks on the South lawn, (just before the \n     Falun Gong protester made her remarks, President Hu \n     reiterated the key commitments China made during the JCCT, \n     such as boosting domestic demand and increasing imports, \n     improving market access and strengthening intellectual \n     property protection.\n       And President Bush impressed upon Vice Premier Wu Yi that \n     the value of these commitments was in the follow-through. We \n     are currently working with our Chinese counterparts to turn \n     these commitments into reality.\n       So we believe our relationship with China is on track.\n       To sum up, there are really just three points.\n       First, the transformation of the Asia-Pacific region from a \n     center of low-cost manufacturing to what has become the \n     growth engine for the world economy has been truly \n     remarkable;\n       Second, we ``get'' at USTR that for Oregon's companies--and \n     all U.S. companies--to stay innovative and globally \n     competitive, they have to be integrated into the fabric of \n     the Asia-Pacific;\n       And third, we have a strategy to do just that, one that \n     contemplates the economic diversity of the region and employs \n     a variety of tools matched to the potential, capacity and \n     willingness of our trading partners.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11691-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11691-S11692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENRICHED URANIUM\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, last year after many years of effort, \nthe Congress finally passed a bipartisan energy bill, the Energy Policy \nAct, which I was very pleased to work on and support. I believe, as I \nknow many of my colleagues believe, that abundant, stable and \naffordable energy is one of the most fundamental challenges the United \nStates faces in terms of job creation and our ability to compete in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  In order to best meet these challenges, I believe we need to develop \nand nurture all forms of energy--including\n\n[[Page S11692]]\n\ncoal, oil, natural gas, renewables and clean, safe nuclear energy. In \ndoing so, we need to promote energy diversity and conservation.\n  I commend the Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman of the \nSenate Energy Committee for their outstanding work on the bill. In \nparticular, I applaud their work in promoting new nuclear generation, \nand in fact helping to launch a nuclear renaissance in the United \nStates.\n  According to the Energy Committee, the bill will have a dramatic \neffect:\n\n       Because of the provisions in the energy bill, including the \n     loan guarantee authority, the production tax credits, and the \n     insurance protection against licensing delays and litigation, \n     electricity generating companies and consortiums across the \n     United States are preparing applications for permission to \n     build up to 25 new nuclear power plants.\n\n  The committee further states that if all 25 plants are built: they \nwould generate between 20,000-25,000 megawatts of new electricity, \nenough to power 15 million households; they would create between 40,000 \nand 45,000 construction jobs; and they would create approximately \n10,000 high paying, high-tech plant operation jobs.\n  As my colleagues also know, one of our often stated but not yet \nachieved priorities is to foster energy independence. I must point out \nto my colleagues that at present our country is threatened not only by \nour current dependence on foreign oil, but also by a possible future \ndependence on Russian uranium needed to fuel U.S. nuclear reactors.\n  Earlier this year, when President Bush traveled to Russia for the G8 \nsummit, I was pleased to join in a letter led by Senators Domenici, \nBingaman and DeWine that expressed our concern about further expansion \nof Russian uranium into the domestic marketplace. We wrote of our \nconcern that any changes proposed in either the Highly Enriched \nUranium, HEU, Agreement or the Suspension Agreement would have the \npotential of making the U.S. more dependent on foreign sources of \nnuclear fuel at a time when domestic sources are being developed. \nFurther, the letter stated that additional Russian access to the U.S. \nmarket at this time is likely to result in market destabilization \npotentially jeopardizing resurgence of the nuclear-related industry.\n  Frankly, I am concerned not only based on our goal being secure in \nour energy needs, but because of concerns regarding our national \nsecurity. Russia is the largest single supplier of uranium enrichment \nservices to U.S. utilities, providing 45 percent of the domestic \nmarket.\n  Unfortunately, a recent decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal Circuit has created a possible loophole in U.S. antidumping law \nthat could further expose the U.S. to a greater reliance on Russian \nuranium. This decision is important because the United States \ngovernment is currently engaged in negotiations with Russia over \npossible changes to the U.S.-Russian Suspension Agreement, with \ncritical meetings to take place this month and in January.\n  Unfortunately, this possible loophole may compromise the \nadministration's negotiating position because Russia now believes it \ncan simply terminate, rather than renegotiate, this agreement, and \nsubsequently exploit this possible loophole to avoid any dumping \nliability on its low enrichment uranium exports. Under this decision, \nthe Russians can designate their uranium fuel as a ``service'' and \nbypass the U.S. trade restrictions that are in place to regulate the \nimport of ``goods''.\n  I had planned to offer a narrow amendment expressing concern over \npossible Russian plans to export more uranium and to support \nmaintaining the existing Suspension Agreement and HEU Agreement between \nthe United States and Russia. In fact, I have a communication from the \nNational Security Council that states the administration's support for \nlanguage similar to the amendment I had drafted.\n  The basis for my concerns for our national security is this: should \nthe Russians back out of the Suspension Agreement in an effort to \nobtain direct access to the U.S. nuclear fuel market, this could \nundermine and disrupt the HEU Agreement. The bottom line is the \nSuspension Agreement and the HEU Agreement have a direct relationship. \nIt is clear to this Senator that changes to the Suspension Agreement \nwould have significant consequences to the HEU Agreement, and there is \nno doubt that ensuring uninterrupted execution of the HEU Agreement is \nabsolutely in the U.S. national security and energy security interests.\n  That being said, I understand there is concern with addressing the \nissue at this time, and I have decided to withhold further action. \nWhile I am disappointed that there is not enough time in this Congress \nto deal with this important issue, it is my hope that this situation \ncan be quickly addressed in the 110th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11692-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Allen, the following statements were ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I speak in support of legislation \nthat passed the Senate unanimously last evening to establish the CAPT \nJohn Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail.\n  This House legislation, championed by my Virginia colleague, \nCongresswoman Jo Ann Davis, and supported by many in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed, is the companion to S.2568, introduced by Senators Sarbanes, \nAllen, Mikulski, Carper, Biden, Santorum, Specter, and myself. It \nestablishes the first all-water trail in the National Park Service \ntrail system. This trail commemorates Captain John Smith's 2,300-mile \nvoyages to explore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries in 1607-1609, \nand will become an important component of our national ceremonies next \nyear to mark the 400th anniversary of the establishment of Jamestown in \n1607.\n  Events to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Jamestown, the first \npermanent English settlement in America, will remind Americans that \nJamestown was the birthplace of representative democracy, religious \nfreedom, free enterprise, and as distinguished by the voyages of John \nSmith, the spirit of exploration. The cornerstone of this year-long \ncommemoration is to tell the complete story of the convergence of three \ncultures at Jamestown between Europeans, Native Americans, and African \nAmericans.\n\n[[Page S11693]]\n\n  Central to understanding the first encounters between the English and \nVirginia native tribes, and the bounty of the bay that sustained the \nearly settlers are John Smith's diaries. It is those diaries that give \na first-hand account of the interaction of the English with Native \nAmerican tribes throughout the bay during Smith's journeys. Captain \nSmith also wrote in vivid detail about the living resources of the bay, \nthe abundance of shellfish, finfish, and other species, as his small \ngroup traveled in their 28-foot shallop.\n  Many people and organizations deserve credit for their work to \nadvance the concept of a national water trail. Principal among these \nare Patrick Noonan, chairman emeritus of the Conservation Fund, and \nGilbert Grosvenor, chairman of the board of the National Geographic \nSociety. They had the vision to see that a new national trail to mark \nJohn Smith's travels of the Chesapeake bay would foster renewed \ninterest in early colonial history, highlight the importance of \ngeography and the bay's natural resources in sustaining life, broaden \nour understanding of the contributions of Native American tribes, \nstimulate heritage tourism, and expand educational efforts to restore \nthe Bay's ecosystem.\n  The Conservation Fund and the National Geographic Society's steadfast \nsupport, and dedication of resources to this effort created a \npartnership that ensured our success. I speak on behalf of all \nVirginians, and lovers of the bay to say a warm and heartfelt thank \nyou.\n  I also thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation, and \nextend my personal appreciation to my friend and colleague, Senator \nSarbanes, for his leadership on this issue and for the many courtesies \nhe has extended to me over the years. He has been an effective working \npartner over the years as we have worked on issues important to the \nMetropolitan Washington region.\n  As America prepares for the 400th anniversary of Jamestown, this new \nnational trail will connect Americans to one of the earliest chapters \nof our heritage, allowing us to retrace the paddle strokes and \nfootsteps of CAPT John Smith, to relive what he experienced some 400 \nyears ago, and to give us a new avenue to enjoy and preserve the \nBay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11693-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RESIGNATION OF AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

He built \nconsensus among our allies on the need for Iran to suspend the \nenrichment and reprocessing of uranium.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the achievements \nof an outstanding and accomplished young Vermonter. Last February, \nHannah Teter of Belmont made her family, her friends, and her fellow \nVermonters proud as she won the Olympic gold medal in the women's half \npipe event in Turin, Italy. While this accomplishment alone deserves \ncongratulations, Hannah has, perhaps more impressively, reached beyond \nher athletic success and used her national--and international--\nrecognition to forge one of the most creative charitable endeavors I \nhave seen in quite some time.\n  Just 19 years old, Hannah has enjoyed immense success on the \ninternational snowboarding circuit, winning nine titles and medals in \nthe last 2 years alone. In the summer of 2005, ESPN recognized her with \nan ESPY Award for Excellence in Sports Performance. Realizing how \nblessed she was with the opportunities that gave her the chance to make \nher mark in snowboarding, Hannah was inspired to give something back. \nShe has seized this opportunity to demonstrate to other young people \nthat they have the power to make a difference.\n  Upon her return from Turin earlier this year, Hannah enjoyed the \nlimelight that her Olympic successes brought her. But it wasn't long \nbefore her altruism opened the door to a creative way to help others to \nbenefit from her success. Raised in a family where maple syrup \nproduction was an annual event, Hannah drew on her childhood \nexperiences and, together with her mother, conceived ``Hannah's Gold.'' \nThe bottles of maple syrup, produced on a neighbor's farm, are sold to \nbenefit World Vision, a charitable organization that provides aid to \nstruggling people in Africa. Proceeds from each bottle of syrup will go \ntoward alleviating hunger and the AIDS crisis in impoverished areas.\n  Hannah's efforts are just one example of the long legacy of service \nand charity in which we Vermonters take so much pride. She is truly an \nexample to the many young people who look at her achievements with \ndreams of their own.\n  The Boston Globe recently published a superb account of Hannah's \nstory, ``Teter's Syrupy Story is Worth Telling,'' profiling Hannah and \nher charitable venture. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There being no objection, the material was \nordered to be printed in the Record.\n\n                   [The Boston Globe, Oct. 26, 2006]\n\n                 Teter's Syrupy Story Is Worth Telling\n\n                      (By Bob Duffy, Globe Staff)\n\n       Belmont, VT.--At the crest of a spiraling dirt road, \n     fronting the private pond and the greenhouse attached to the \n     small wooden home, on the outskirts of this splotch of a \n     village amid the amphitheater of the Green Mountains--at the \n     peak of her universe--Hannah Teter stands in the ramshackle \n     wooden shed and explains how you make really good maple \n     syrup.\n       You collect enough logs to suffocate a room, like the one \n     behind the elongated brick-and-steel oven she's pointing to. \n     You jam the wood under the oven until you have a small \n     inferno.\n       You let the sap from the maples creep agonizingly along a \n     tubular labyrinth--you do this for hours upon hours--until it \n     achieves a viscous state.\n       You fill bucket after bucket with it. You dump each bucket \n     into a huge vat on the bed of a truck. You drive the load to \n     the processing plant.\n       Then you pour it all over the world.\n       Granted, the standard recipe doesn't include this last \n     ingredient. But Teter likes to think big. She's in a position \n     to, as she has been since she won the Olympic halfpipe \n     snowboarding gold medal at Turin in February.\n       Standing atop the podium, she was transported to another \n     perch--the large rock in the field at the bottom of her \n     street, where she used to sit and muse.\n       ``I was doing all this traveling for snowboarding then,'' \n     she says. ``I'd think about how much I was doing, how lucky \n     and blessed I was, and I wanted to reach back, give something \n     back.''\n       In the hubbub of triumph, she found an Olympic torch of \n     inspiration.\n       ``The fire was still burning,'' says Teter. ``I thought, \n     `This is my big chance to do something to help people.' ''\n       It was still a vague notion. Teter wanted something special \n     to express her charitable inclinations, but she had no clue \n     about what it should be. She turned to her mother, Pat, whose \n     brainstorm became Hannah's Gold.\n       Hannah's Gold is marketing metallurgy. Its intent is to \n     provide nourishment in the truest sense. The proceeds from \n     each $15 bottle of Vermont maple syrup, produced by Mapleside \n     Manufacturing, go to the charitable organization World Vision \n     to alleviate the hunger and AIDS crises in Africa's most \n     impoverished towns.\n       It's personal. It's indigenous. It's pure, well, Hannah.\n       ``Maple syrup made me what I am today,'' she says.\n       All right, so it isn't actually snowboarding's answer to \n     Popeye's spinach. Give the kid a break; she's only 19. And \n     maple syrup sweetens an abundance of her childhood memories.\n       Out in the shed, Hannah and some combination of her four \n     brothers--Amen, Abram, Elijah, and Josh--would sit transfixed \n     on a discarded truck seat overlooking the oven where their \n     father, Jeff, made syrup every spring. He'd let them pour the \n     buckets into the vat. And after they'd driven it around town \n     for processing, she couldn't wait to eat it. Before she got \n     into the house, if necessary.\n\n[[Page S11694]]\n\n       ``Snow syrup,'' says Teter, her eyes sparkling at the \n     recollection. ``Nothing like it.''\n       Such was the flavor of her youth on this 10-acre plot--\n     simple, ineffable pleasures. With an extended family that she \n     estimates includes ``about 50 cousins,'' she'd swim and canoe \n     and skate on the pond. She'd skateboard on a homemade ramp. \n     She'd play volleyball at the net that stood in the side yard. \n     She'd jump from an upstairs bedroom window onto a trampoline \n     in front of the house--when her parents were away, of course. \n     And after she became a globetrotting snowboarding prodigy, \n     following her apprenticeship at the local ski area, Okemo \n     Mountain, she'd miss all that.\n       ``Not being here for maple syrup season,'' says Teter, ``is \n     like missing Christmas.''\n       Now she's trying to turn maple syrup season into Christmas.\n       ``I wondered where the money would help the most,'' says \n     Teter. ``I thought of Africa. I read up all I could on it. I \n     read about the AIDS and the hunger and I thought this would \n     be the best place to start.''\n       ``Start'' is the operative word. Hannah's Gold has raised \n     only about $5,000 so far, but it was launched just a couple \n     of months ago, and Teter's grasp is of a much grander scale. \n     She'll appear on Jimmy Kimmel's late-night TV show Dec. 15 to \n     promote Hannah's Gold. She has agreements from Okemo and \n     Burton Snowboards to donate $1 each per bottle of Hannah's \n     Gold sold.\n       This is only the ground floor, anyway. Teter now lives in \n     the limelight; she's based in South Lake Tahoe, Calif., but \n     most of the time she's ordering room service on a \n     transcontinental whirlwind on behalf of sponsors Motorola, \n     Burton, and Mountain Dew. ``They keep me pretty busy,'' she \n     says.\n       But she wants to do the majority of her cashing in for \n     charity.\n       ``People know me as a snowboarder,'' she says, ``but I want \n     to branch out to different avenues, really reach out and \n     raise money. Hannah's Gold is the first step. I plan to do \n     more, keep building.'' The ideas are like mountain snow right \n     now, more kinetic rush than specifically targeted, but even \n     as a novice fund-raiser, Teter intends to be more than a \n     mouthpiece.\n       ``I plan to go over to Africa soon to see where and how the \n     money is being spent,'' she says. ``I don't just want to lend \n     my name to these projects.''\n       No matter how modest a start her altruism is off to, Teter \n     won't be shortchanged on enthusiasm and optimism.\n       ``Hannah's Gold has only been out so long,'' she says. \n     ``It's really flying. It's going uphill, the way I go in \n     snowboarding. I hope it goes with me. No, I know it will.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11694-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     A TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY J. ZAGAMI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on January 3, 2007, a longtime employee of \nthe Congress and the Legislative Branch will retire from public \nservice. After 40 years of service, Anthony J. ``Tony'' Zagami will \ndepart as the longest serving general counsel in the history of the \nU.S. Government Printing Office.\n  Tony Zagami began his career as a young Senate Page in the mid-1960s. \nI first met him during my first term in the Senate representing the \ncitizens of Vermont. At that time, Tony was working in the Senate \nDemocratic cloakroom while completing law school. He spent a total of \n25 years in various positions on Capitol Hill before leaving in 1990 to \nbecome the general counsel for GPO, the agency responsible for printing \nand distributing the Congressional Record and almost all other \nGovernment publications.\n  Years ago, my wife Marcelle and I invited Tony over for an evening at \nour house in McLean. Also joining us was Henry Chapin, who gave us a \nperformance that showed us why he is known as a great balladeer. I will \nalways remember that night of music, laughter, and friends fondly.\n  Throughout his career both here on the Hill and later with GPO, Tony \nwas known for his dedication and hard work on behalf of the American \npeople. He leaves with a lengthy and very distinguished record of \npublic service. I thank my friend Tony Zagami for that service, and \nMarcelle and I wish him well as he departs to begin a new chapter in \nhis life.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the end of the year, a longtime public \nservant who is a former congressional staff member will retire after 40 \nyears of distinguished Government service to the Nation. Since 1990, \nAnthony J. Zagami has been general counsel of the Government Printing \nOffice, the longest serving general counsel in the agency's history, \nand I welcome this opportunity to commend him for his long and \noutstanding career.\n  Tony has been general counsel at GPO for the past 16 years. Before \nthat, he had worked ably with us in a variety of positions in the \nSenate. I first met him in the 1970s, when he was an impressive young \naide in our Senate Democratic cloakroom.\n  At the time, Tony was also earning his law degree from George Mason \nUniversity School of Law in Arlington, and his strong commitment to \npublic service impressed us all.\n  He later became general counsel of the Congressional Joint Committee \non Printing, our oversight committee for GPO, and he served there for 9 \nyears. When he moved to GPO in 1990, Tony became an essential part of \nthe ongoing effort to guide the agency in the digital age.\n  I have enjoyed working with Tony very much over the years, and I have \nalways had great respect for his ability and dedication. On the \noccasion of his retirement, I thank Tony for all he has done so well, \nand I extend my best wishes to him and to his family for the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11694-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SERGEANT FIRST CLASS ROBERT LEE ``BOBBY'' HOLLAR, JR.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to SFC Robert Lee \n``Bobby'' Hollar, Jr. Sergeant First Class Hollar was an exemplary \nsoldier, respected U.S. Postal employee, and a loving family man.\n  Before deploying for Iraq, Sergeant First Class Hollar dropped by \nCrescent Elementary School in Griffin, GA, to visit a class of \nstudents. In the classroom, Sergeant First Class Hollar fielded \nquestions about where he was headed, what he would be doing there, and \nwhen he would be coming home. He encouraged the students to write and \npromised he would do the same.\n  On September 1, 2005, on a road south of Baghdad, an IED ended the \nlife of Sergeant First Class Hollar. As word of his death reached the \nclassroom where he had stood just months before, the children began to \ncry. You see, Sergeant First Class Hollar taught them something else: \nhe taught them that our freedom is not free.\n  This week, the Senate passed S. 4050, a bill naming the post office \nin Thomaston, GA, as the Sergeant First Class Robert Lee ``Bobby'' \nHollar, Jr. Post Office Building. For the children at Crescent \nElementary School, this building will serve as a lasting memory of \ntheir pen pal and hero. For the rest of us, this building will serve as \na reminder that our freedom is not free.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the numerous people in Georgia who \nhelped to make this possible as well as the U.S. Postal Service and my \nfellow Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11694-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11694-S11697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INDIAN TRUST REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN: Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, I rise today to speak in vigorous support of S.1439, \nthe Indian Trust Reform Act of 2005, a bill I introduced in July 2005, \nwith Senator Dorgan as an original co-sponsor, to address a broad range \nof Indian trust asset issues and trust management policies and \npractices. As introduced, this bill was intended only as a starting \npoint for an extended dialogue with interested parties in Indian \ncountry and in the Government that would lead us, eventually, to \nlegislation that brings real and lasting improvements in the way Indian \ntrust assets are managed and that resolves the 10-year old class action \nlawsuit against the United States known as Cobell v. Kempthorne. I want \nto begin by extending my thanks and great appreciation to Senator \nDorgan, who is vice-chairman of the committee and will soon be its \nchairman in the 110th Congress, for the extraordinary, tireless effort \nthat he and his staff have made in working on this bill over the course \nof the past 2 years. In accordance with a long-standing tradition of \nbipartisanship within the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Dorgan \nand his staff have worked hand-in-hand with me and my staff in our \nattempt to reform the way in which Indian trust lands and resources are \nmanaged and to settle the Cobell lawsuit.\n  By no means did trust reform begin with this bill. I myself have \nintroduced similar legislation in prior Congresses, including S. 1459 \nin the 108th Congress; in 2004 the Congress enacted the Indian Probate \nReform Act, which brought significant reforms to the laws applicable to \nthe probate of individual Indian trust and restricted land; and 10 \nyears before that the American Indian Trust\n\n[[Page S11695]]\n\nFund Management Reform Act of 1994 was enacted into law, which, among \nother things, created the Office of the Special Trustee for American \nIndians. While I truly believe that as a result of these and other \nenactments, and reform initiatives within the Department of the \nInterior--in part in response to court orders in the Cobell case--there \nhave been improvements in at least some areas of trust management, we \nstill have a very long way to go before the business of Indian trust \nreform is complete.\n  I will not even try to recount here the difficult history of the \nrelationship between the United States and its native peoples. But I am \npleased to say that the past 25 years have brought significant \nadvancements in the lives of many Indian people as a result of better \naccess to education, health care and housing, and because of economic \ndevelopment in some parts of Indian Country. However, there are still \nmany unacceptable disparities between conditions in many Indian \ncommunities and those of non-Indian communities in this country. S. \n1439 represents an attempt to address one particular component that \naffects the economic well-being of many Indian people: the way in which \nIndian trust and restricted assets--land, minerals, water, timber, \ncrops, and the revenues derived from these resources--are managed by \nthe United States.\n  The performance of the United States over the past 125 years in its \ncapacity as trustee and manager of Indian trust and restricted lands is \nnot something to be proud of. The policy of allotting Indian tribal \nlands, which had become the general Federal Indian policy in the 1880s, \nwas one of several federal ``experiments'' in Indian matters that have \nhad regrettable results both for the Indian tribes and for the \nGovernment. This policy of the 19th Century has come back to haunt us \nnow in the form of fractionated ownership of allotted lands--where some \nparcels of land are owned by dozens, often hundreds and in some cases \neven over a thousand different individual Indian owners. This \nfractionation of ownership has led to a proliferation of individual \nIndian money accounts, ``IIM accounts'', which now number in the \nhundreds of thousands of separate accounts and many of which have very \nsmall balances and annual income, all of which the Federal Government \nhas a trust obligation to track and manage--at considerable expense.\n  The staggering number of tiny fractionated interests--along with \ndecades of mismanagement on the part of Government officials--\ncontributed to the conditions that led to the filing of the Cobell \nclass action here in the District of Columbia. A lot has happened in \nthat litigation since it was filed 10 years ago, much of it reported in \nnewspapers across the country, but I think it is fair to say that one \nthing the case has shown is that the United States has not lived up to \nits duty as a fiduciary to the thousands of Indian beneficiaries of \ntrust lands and funds.\n  Between 1993 and 2006, the Committee on Indian Affairs has held at \nleast 17 hearings on the matter of Indian trust reform or \nreorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1994, Congress \npassed into law the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, \n25 U.S.C. Sec. 4001, et seq., to reform the management of Indian \nassets, accounts, and resources held in trust and managed by the United \nStates. The 1994 Act was not the final word on trust reform, even in \nthe limited context of Indian trust funds management. Two years after \nthat Act was passed, a class action based in part on the requirements \nof the Act was filed in the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia: the case of Cobell v. Babbitt--redesignated \nCobell v. Norton with the appointment of Gale Norton as Secretary of \nInterior, and again Cobell v. Kempthorne with the appointment of Dirk \nKempthorne as Secretary.\n  In November 2001, in response to the Cobell litigation, the \nDepartment of Interior submitted a reprogramming request to the Senate \nand House Appropriations Subcommittees on Interior and Related Agencies \nto establish a new ``Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management'', BITAM, \nwithin the Department to be administered by a new appointed official, \nan ``Assistant Secretary--Indian Trust Asset Management.''\n  The BITAM proposal was very poorly received by Indian country, and \nsoon thereafter the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and \nRelated Agencies asked the Department to resubmit its reprogramming \nrequest at a later date pending further consultation and further review \nof the management and organization of the Department's trust program.\n  Over the course of 2002, the Department convened and participated in \na series of consultations and other meetings with Tribal officials and \nrepresentatives across the country to discuss Indian trust asset \nmanagement and reform. The principal mechanism for this consultation \nwas a ``Joint Tribal Leader/Department of Interior Task Force on Trust \nReform'' composed of Tribal leaders from around the country and \nDepartment officials. The joint task force reviewed and documented \ntrust asset management functions and processes at all levels within the \nBureau, and eventually identified numerous features of the Bureau's \ntrust system and organization that required reform. The joint task \nforce also studied several restructuring proposals developed by Indian \ntribes around the country.\n\n  Ultimately, the joint task force reached an agreement in principle on \na restructuring proposal that would create a new position of Under \nSecretary for Indian Affairs. The Under Secretary would report directly \nto the Secretary of Interior and have authority over all aspects of \nIndian affairs within the Department, including the management of \ntribal and individual Indian trust assets, including both financial and \nnatural resource trust assets. Under this proposal, the Office of the \nSpecial Trustee would eventually be phased out. However, although \nTribal leaders and Department officials on the task force also reached \nagreement on other significant matters relating to trust reform and \nrestructuring, they were unable to agree on certain key elements of the \nlegislative proposal. In October of 2002, the joint task force was \ndisbanded.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could say that our efforts in the 109th \nCongress bridged all of the gaps between the Government, the tribes and \nindividual Indians, but I cannot. That does not mean that we did not \nmake significant progress. In the course of the past 18 to 20 months \nall parties have acquired a much better understanding of the issues and \nof each other's positions. The Committee and its staff have also \nacquired a better understanding and appreciation of the issues as well. \nAgain, I want to thank Senator Dorgan for his insights, efforts, and \ncommitment of time and staff in this truly bi-partisan effort. The \nmajority and minority staff of the Committee on Indian Affairs met \nextensively with representatives of Indian tribes, tribal organizations \nand individual Indian organizations in an effort to get a solid \nunderstanding of what Indian country wants to get out of trust reform. \nThe staff of both sides of the committee also met and conferred \nextensively with various components of the administration and \nrepresentatives of the plaintiffs in the Cobell case to discuss S. 1439 \nand the settlement of claims in the lawsuit. I know this outreach and \nthe information it produced will be extremely useful to this body as \nthe Indian trust reform initiative goes forward in the 110th Congress.\n  One significant outcome of our efforts during this Congress is the \nfact that the administration made a counter-proposal in October of this \nyear which spells out its views of what should be done to reform the \nmanagement of Indian trust assets, and I am submitting a summary of \nthat proposal along with this statement. Their proposal has four major \ncomponents: consolidation of ownership of fractioned tracts within the \nnext 10 years; a transition to beneficiary-managed ownership of trust \nlands within the next 10 years; resolution of tribal trust claims--in \naddition to individual Indian trust claims; and some limitations on the \nliability of the Government for claims that may arise during and after \nthe 10 year transition period to a system of beneficiary management.\n  Not surprisingly, the reaction of Indian country to the \nadministration's proposal was, for the most part, quite negative. Much \nof the opposition focused on the timing of the proposal: it\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\nwas made with only weeks of legislative days left in our calendar, not \nnearly enough time to consider, debate or even understand the far-\nreaching implications of the administration's ideas.\n  On the other hand, while many tribes and individuals criticized the \nproposal taken as a whole, many were not completely opposed to all \naspects of the proposal and, indeed, some even agreed with certain \naspects of the administration's ideas. For example, there was \nwidespread acknowledgment that fractionated ownership of individual \nIndian lands has been a real, ever-worsening problem that has plagued \nthe system for many decades--one that Indian country must confront and \ndeal with now and not later--and that dealing with the problem will \nrequire solutions that are not altogether pleasant. And even though \nsome commentators seemed to oppose any system of beneficiary-driven \nmanagement decisions for trust lands, others recognized that the Indian \ntribes and Indian landowners can and will make better decisions \nregarding the use of their own lands than the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nif they are given the appropriate resources to do so. I am also \nsubmitting for the record a copy of a recent editorial that appeared in \na widely read Indian periodical, Indian Country Today. The editorial \nsuggests that certain aspects of the administration's proposals are in \nfact reasonable, including the idea that Indian beneficiaries will make \ngood managers of their land, and it challenges Indian country to engage \nwith the administration on its ideas and ``come back with an improved \nset of proposals based on them'' rather than just reject them out of \nhand.\n  So indeed, Mr. President, while I am disappointed that S. 1439 was \nnot passed into law, I am also encouraged by the progress we have made \nin our understanding of trust management problems and in the \nwillingness of the Indian tribes, individual Indians, representatives \nof the class action plaintiffs and the administration to engage in \nmeaningful discussions on how to fix this system. I am hopeful that in \nthe 110th Congress the Committee begins where we left off in this bill \nand that it will not shy away from the difficult issues of Indian trust \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the aforementioned documents be printed in \nthe Record. The documents follow.\n\nNewly Proposed Provisions for Senate Bill 1439 The Indian Trust Reform \n                                  Act\n\n       Senate bill 1439, the Indian Trust Reform Act of 2005, \n     would resolve the Cobell v. Kempthorne case and make reforms \n     to the way the United States manages Indian trust funds and \n     assets. The bill was introduced in July 2005 and Committee \n     staffs have been meeting with representatives from the \n     plaintiffs, the Administration, and Indian tribes to decide \n     what changes, if any, should be made to the bill. This paper \n     highlights several proposals that have come out of some of \n     those discussions.\n       To gain support for a multi-billion dollar bill, it may be \n     necessary to incorporate significant changes to the \n     management system for Indian trust assets. As proposed, these \n     changes would not remove the trust status of Indian lands, \n     but would reallocate significant decision-making authority \n     and legal responsibility from the Federal government to the \n     Indian tribes and individuals. The proposed changes are \n     generally described below.\n       The Chair and Vice-Chair of the Committee have not approved \n     these proposed changes to S. 1439, but have asked their \n     respective staff to seek input from Indian Country before \n     they make a decision on these proposals and how to proceed \n     with the bill.\n     Land fractionation--consolidate all 128,000 individual Indian \n         allotments into ownership of no more than 10 individuals \n         per tract of land within 10 years\n       The highly fractionated nature of many individual Indian \n     lands has made it difficult for the United States to manage \n     these lands and the revenues generated from them. There are \n     currently 128,000 individual Indian allotments and 3.6 \n     million fractionated interests. One proposal to address this \n     issue has been to develop aggressive mechanisms to \n     consolidate all allotments into 10 or fewer owners for each \n     tract of land within the next 10 years.\n       All land would remain in Indian title with individual \n     Indian or tribal owners.\n       Consolidation would include voluntary and involuntary \n     mechanisms, but large interest owners would have a first \n     opportunity to buy out the smaller interest owners would have \n     a first opportunity to buy out the smaller interest owners \n     before an entire tract is put up for sale to either the tribe \n     or a member of that tribe.\n       Consolidation of tracts with 100 or more owners would be \n     prioritized.\n       Funding for the proposed consolidation mechanisms would be \n     assured by inclusion in the funding levels of the bill.\n     Beneficiary-managed trust--transition of all individual \n         Indian and tribal land to a beneficiary-managed trust \n         system within 10 years\n       After fractionated lands are consolidated, it is proposed \n     to convert the current management system for all individual \n     Indian and tribal land into a new system within a 10 year \n     timeframe. The lands would remain in trust and not be subject \n     to taxation, but the individual or tribal owner of the lands \n     would have most of the privileges and responsibilities of \n     property management.\n       The landowners would make nearly all decisions on land use \n     within certain broad parameters.\n       All revenues generated from the land would go directly to \n     the landowners (direct pay).\n       The landowners would negotiate their own long-tern leases \n     and land use agreements, without Secretarial approval.\n       The BIA would provide ``management'' financial support and \n     technical assistance during a transition period to assist \n     owners in becoming efficient property owners and managers.\n       The federal government would remain responsible for: \n     preventing involuntary alienation of land; approving \n     transfers of land title; maintaining land title records; and \n     probating trust estates.\n     Resolution of tribal claims related to the mismanagement of \n         trust funds, lands and resources\n       In addition to resolving all individual Indian claims \n     related to the United States' mismanagement of trust funds, \n     lands and resources, it has been proposed to resolve all \n     tribal claims for the same matters. Possible suggestions for \n     addressing this issue include:\n       All mismanagement claims for tribal monies, lands, and \n     resources would be resolved and settled.\n       A settlement fund would be established and each tribe would \n     receive a distribution based on a formula that would take \n     into account the amount of land a tribe owns and the amount \n     of revenues that were generated from that land for a \n     specified period of time.\n       All historical accounting claims against the United States \n     would be settled.\n       Account balances for Indian trust accounts would be deemed \n     accurate as of the date of passage of Senate bill 1439.\n       The bill would not settle takings claims for land or \n     related resources, claims to establish the right to possess \n     or the ownership of tribal land, or claims arising under \n     Federal environmental laws.\n     Limitation on liability of the United States during and after \n         transition period\n       In order to facilitate the proposed reforms, it has also \n     been proposed that during the period of time for land \n     consolidation and transition of the trust management system \n     into a beneficiary-managed trust there would be some \n     limitations on the liability of the United States in regard \n     to the management of trust resources.\n       After the transition period, the Federal government would \n     remain responsible for correcting errors, but without damage \n     claims against the government for its residual \n     responsibilities.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From Washington Watch, Nov. 30, 2006]\n\n     Trust Funds Settlement Should Not Be Left to the Fossil Record\n\n       The Individual Indian Money trust remains a troubled realm, \n     and it is likely to stay that way well into the next \n     Congress.\n       Indian country was right to reject the case settlement \n     concepts offered by the administration. But as spelled out by \n     the next Senate Committee on Indian Affairs chairman, Sen. \n     Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., failure to resolve the IIM litigation \n     ``overhangs everything else'' in federal Indian affairs, on \n     the funding front above all.\n       That overhang, 10 years in the making, isn't likely to get \n     any less severe under a Democratic Congress over the next \n     couple of years. Another leading figure on the issue, Sen. \n     John McCain, R-Ariz., has stated outright that he will not \n     vote for a bill to settle the IIM litigation if it does not \n     also settle as many subsidiary trust claims as may be \n     possible. He wants a ``whole'' settlement, in contrast to an \n     IIM-only settlement that would be considered ``partial.'' As \n     a Republican of high stock right now and a probable \n     presidential candidate in 2008, McCain's views will take many \n     lawmakers along with him.\n       So for now, any hope of an IIM-only, ``partial'' settlement \n     is out.\n       So is any hope of the huge settlement described as fair by \n     the IIM plaintiff class. Remember, the litigation itself is \n     only about an accounting. When the frail pages of the lawsuit \n     are found among other fossils many centuries from now, they \n     may show that a court has ``settled'' the mismanaged accounts \n     for a larger sum than the government will agree to, left to \n     its own devices. But the government can litigate for decades \n     yet at a cost still light-years from the settlement figure(s) \n     the plaintiffs have initiated.\n       The starting figure of $176 billion, though never actually \n     sought, was off-putting; $27.5 billion proved another non-\n     starter; $13 billion also struck the administration as \n     unrealistic; $8 billion to $9 billion, considered a \n     reasonable ``rough justice'' number by the SCIA, might have \n     been reachable two years or so ago, but now the \n     administration considers a much lower figure justice enough.\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\n       Nonetheless, according to Interior Secretary Dirk \n     Kempthorne, it is willing to invest ``billions'' in a kind of \n     omnibus bill on trust claims. The key verb is not ``to \n     settle'' or ``to reimburse'' but ``to invest,'' and in the \n     short term there is no getting around it.\n       Indian country should engage with the administration's case \n     settlement concepts, then, and come forward with an improved \n     set of proposals based on them.\n       It's a steep order, but the case settlement concepts do \n     provide some footholds. For starters:\n       The administration foresees ``voluntary and involuntary'' \n     mechanisms for consolidating fractionated lands. Given the \n     history here, the concept of an involuntary taking of land \n     to be consolidated is troublesome, to say the least. But \n     assuming economic use is the goal of consolidation, there \n     is no other way. Land tracts with hundreds of owners \n     cannot be managed for profit, period. Consolidation that \n     requires consent from all owners is impossible for many \n     reasons. Tribes should be able to propose sensible limits \n     on involuntary consolidation mechanisms that don't also \n     torpedo the purposes of consolidation.\n       The administration foresees a ``beneficiary managed trust'' \n     that would grow the trust estate. This was dangerous at the \n     time of the Dawes Severalty Act, a century and some years \n     ago, but nowadays it simply isn't a new concept. In fact, \n     it's a solid, tested concept that can help prosperity along \n     by goading individuals and tribes toward the aggressive \n     management of their own resources. After a 10-year period for \n     technical assistance as financed in the law itself, \n     individuals would manage their own lease property, with \n     payments going direct to individuals instead of being \n     lightened along the way by the government. The original trust \n     funds reform law of 1994 foresaw every bit of that. But the \n     government would still fulfill vital residual roles, \n     maintaining the land as inalienably tribal land, in trust and \n     tax-exempt, as well as probating estates, correcting errors \n     in the accounts, transferring titles and keeping title \n     records. A proposal like this should not be rejected with \n     outrage, but embraced with care. Again, tribes can certainly \n     offer proposals for the longer-term protection of their more \n     vulnerable members.\n       Tribes have especially reviled the idea of limits on \n     federal liability, should IIM beneficiaries choose to manage \n     their own lands. But already, the U.S. Supreme Court has \n     established limits on federal liability in cases where \n     statutory language does not assign liability. Tribes should \n     be willing to propose strictly limited statutory language \n     that assigns certain modified federal liabilities, but \n     without going so far as to convince McCain and company that \n     the settlement is therefore ``partial.''\n       Tribes also seem to despise the idea of an alteration in \n     the trust relationship. But Elouise Cobell, lead plaintiff in \n     the IIM case, suggests the same and then some every time she \n     declares the IIM trust should be taken from Interior and \n     placed in receivership. This could never be done because no \n     bank could responsibly take on the liabilities, but if it \n     were done it would profoundly alter the trust relationship. \n     So let's alter it already, not through receivership but by \n     participating and directing. It really is too important to be \n     left to lawyers and individuals.\n       Finally, tribes have objected to the idea that tribal \n     claims should be included in any settlement that approaches \n     the $8 billion range. But the guessing here is that if tribes \n     genuinely got behind a ``whole'' settlement at some realistic \n     cost, providing their own serious counterproposals with a \n     minimum of posturing, billions more might be found.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11697-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to acknowledge a \nvery important deed this body has accomplished prior to the conclusion \nof the 109th Congress. Despite some incredible obstacles and limited \ntime we have succeeded in protecting real health insurance coverage for \nlow-income, working Americans.\n  The State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, which I am \nproud to have helped establish in 1997, has made a difference in \nexpanding health insurance coverage to low-income children around this \ncountry. In previous years, Congress has stood up for low-income \nchildren and produced the additional funding necessary to keep the \nSCHIP program running. A number of states are again facing urgent \nshortfalls in their SCHIP allotments in fiscal year 2007. I was deeply \ndisappointed when the tax extenders package did not include, as \nexpected, a modest proposal to help those states facing immediate \nshortfalls in their SCHIP budgets.\n  Not so long ago, Rhode Island could proudly claim it had the lowest \nrate of uninsured children in the country. The latest Census Bureau \nreport is now showing a different picture--the number of uninsured \nchildren rose a full percentage point, from 5.8 percent to 6.8 percent \nfrom 2004 to 2005. My state has worked hard over the past decade to \nbuild a children's health insurance program that has become a model for \nthe nation. Yet, Rhode Island is anticipated to be the first of several \nstates in a funding shortfall next year. Specifically, my state is \nfacing a $43 million shortfall and will have only 32 percent of the \nfunding necessary to sustain SCHIP in 2007. These dollars mean the \ndifference between thousands of children, pregnant women, and families \ngetting access to health care or not getting the care they need at all.\n  Included with the reauthorization of the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, is a modest bipartisan proposal to defer the shortfalls \nthat would negatively impact the SCHIP program in my state as well as \nseveral others. This additional time is needed to work on a more \npermanent solution to the chronic shortfalls and other structural \nissues that should be addressed in the context of SCHIP reauthorization \nnext year.\n  I would be remiss if I did not extend my sincere gratitude to the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Harry Reid, and his staff, particularly Kate \nLeone, for their understanding, tenacity, and tireless effort in making \nthis possible. I would also like to thank my colleague from Montana, \nSenate Finance Committee Ranking Member Max Baucus, and his staff for \nall of their hard work in putting together a carefully crafted stopgap \nmeasure, and I look forward to working with him on the equally \nchallenging task of SCHIP reauthorization next year.\n  In the waning hours of the 109th Congress, we have taken a small but \nimportant step to maintain our commitment to America's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11697-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11697-S11698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       END OF THE 109TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the 109th Congress wraps up its \nfinal session, I want to note my disappointment that the current \nleadership decided not to work on all 10 of the appropriations bills \nthat remain undone. Congress is adjourning and walking away with much \nof our work incomplete.\n  It is irresponsible and wrong. We should have stayed and made the \ntough decisions to get the appropriations done. The Federal budget is \ndue October 1. We missed that deadline, as we have often in recent \nyears. The leadership adjourned for the elections, and when we returned \nthe leadership lacked the will and determination to finish the \nappropriations bill. Many individuals Senators, including me, would \nhave stayed and worked hard to get the job done. But we were \noverridden.\n  Failure to enact the appropriations in a timely manner hurts programs \nbecause administrators cannot plan and they cannot hire staff in a \ntimely manner. This can create real problems in our VA hospitals, our \nHead Start agencies and the clinics funded by the Maternal and child \nhealth block grant.\n  This year, instead of doing our work, the congressional leaders are \npunting the tough budget decisions into the next year and the next \nCongress. On February 15, 2007, when the continuing resolution, CR, \nexpires, agencies will have been operating for 4\\1/2\\ months under a CR \nwhich represents more than a third of the fiscal year. This imposes \nburdens and hardships on the people that our agencies of Government \nserve. It is failure of leadership.\n  The Coalition of Human Needs has done some estimates about these cuts \nand their effects since 2002. Their analysis highlights that over time \n72 programs of direct services have been cut when inflation is \nconsidered. Inflation erodes buying power over time, and it makes a \nstark difference in what services needy children and families receive. \nThe coalition reports that 35 programs were cut by 10 percent or more, \nincluding essential programs like family violence, maternal and child \nhealth block grant, and Even Start, the early education component of \nHead Start. Such cuts are harsh and, in my view, shortsighted. \nInvestments in our children's health care and education are \ndownpayments for our future.\n  Housing programs, economic development investments in water and sewer \nprojects, and basic funding for local law enforcement, along with a \nhost of other programs will be put on hold for the next 9 weeks. I wish \nthis were not the case, but sadly it is.\n  My hope for the new Congress and the new leadership is that we will \nget the job done. I am proud to note that the leaders for the 110th \nCongress, which begins on January 4, 2007, have\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\nalready announced their commitment to strike a new tone and to unite \nthe interest of the American people. I will work with our leaders to \nget our work done for the families in West Virginia and across our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11698-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FEDERAL DISASTERS IN OREGON\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I rise on the Senate floor today to lament a state of \nemergency in the rural parts of my State. The emergency we face is \nrelated to natural resources but different from those of drought and \nhurricane that the Senate has discussed and responded to.\n  The disasters in Oregon are not acts of God but of an infinitely more \nfallible entity--the Federal Government. Adverse decisions on forest \nand fisheries management are imperiling entire communities and entire \nways of life.\n  I am not seeking, at this time, to reverse those management \ndecisions. Although they deserve intense scrutiny. What I am seeking is \nthat this Government recognize that its decisions have a cost--one that \nis borne on the backs of those who can least afford It. These people \nand communities need relief as much as those burdened by other \ndisasters not of their creation.\n  Over a decade ago, the Federal Government sought fit to bring tens of \nthousands of loggers and mill workers to their knees by stopping timber \nharvest on Federal lands in Oregon. It did so in the name of the \nspotted owl, a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. I \nshould add that after 15 years of negligible harvest on these lands, \nthe owl is still not recovering and its habitat is being incinerated in \ncatastrophic wildfire.\n  That timber war had more casualties than just jobs in the woods. \nCounty governments receive a share of timber receipts from Federal \nland--25 percent from the Forest Service and 50 percent from the BLM. \nFor generations these funds have offset the inability to tax Federal \nproperty--which makes up the vast majority of most counties in my \nState.\n  When timber harvest evaporated, so did county budgets. In 1999, I \ncame to this floor to describe to my colleagues what was happening in \nrural Oregon. Schools went to 4-day weeks, dropped sports and \nextracurricular activities, and curtailed other programs. Communities \nwere forced to make heart-breaking decisions over whether to cut back \nsocial service programs or school funding--or to sharply reduce \nsheriffs' patrols and close jails or to cut out all extracurricular \nactivities at their schools.\n  Fortunately, Congress created a safety net in the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. This provided \nfunding to counties based on historic rather than current timber \nharvest levels. And not just Oregon counties. In the life of that \nlegislation, California received California received $308 million; \nIdaho, $102 million; and Montana, $63.4 million.\n  That program expired, on our watch, 2 months ago.\n  My colleague from Oregon and I have left no stone unturned to find \nmoney for an extension. Those efforts have been unsuccessful and we \nstand here, with our timber dependent counties, at the mercy of the \nGovernment.\n  Their plight is compounded by a second Federally created disaster in \nOregon's commercial salmon fishing industry, delivering a double blow \nto many of the same counties. Commercial salmon fishing remained this \nseason along more than 400 nautical miles, stretching from Florence, OR \nto Pigeon Point, CA. Estimates put the impact of this closure to Oregon \nand California fishing communities around $60 million. This year marked \nthe first time in history that there was no commercial salmon harvest \nin Curry and Coos counties in Oregon. Curry County also stands to lose \n$6,591,993 or 62.3 percent of its road and general discretionary funds \nwith the failure of Congress to extend the Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunity Self-Determination Act.\n  Mr. President, the clock is winding down on the 109th and soon \nMembers of Congress will leave town to return to their districts or \nStates. We will be leaving without extending this important safety net \nfor our rural counties and without completing action on the annual \nappropriations bills to fund the Government. I can only tell my \ncounties and Oregon's fishermen that the fire will not die on these \nissues, it will only grow more intense when the 110th Congress \nconvenes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11698-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11698-S11700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this past Wednesday, Washington felt a \nlittle like Hollywood. In fact, not many blockbuster movies have gotten \nthe kind of massive press and critical acclaim that we saw yesterday \nfor the release of the Iraq Study Group report. Official Washington \nrushed to embrace the report--understandably, since it reflected the \nsame flawed mindset that led so many here to embrace the war in Iraq 4 \nyears ago. Unfortunately, that same mindset is now what is keeping too \nmany here from fixing an Iraq policy that many now agree is badly \nflawed.\n  The administration still believes that Iraq is the be-all and end-all \nof our national security. So, too, does most of Washington. \nUnfortunately, the Iraq Study Group report does too little to change \nthat flawed mind-set. I respect the serious efforts of the group to \ncorrect the administration's misguided policies, and the report has \nsome valuable ideas. But the very name, the ``Iraq Study Group'' says \nit all. We need recommendations on how to address Iraq, but those \nrecommendations must be guided by our top national security priority--\ndefeating terrorist networks operating in dozens of countries around \nthe world. We can't just look at Iraq in isolation--we need to also be \nlooking at Somalia and Afghanistan and the many other places around the \nworld where we face grave and growing threats.\n  The report doesn't adequately put Iraq in the context of a broader \nnational security strategy. We need an Iraq policy that is guided by \nour top national security priority--defeating the terrorist network \nthat attacked us on 9/11 and its allies. Unless we set a serious \ntimetable for redeploying our troops from Iraq, we will be unable to \neffectively address these global threats. In the end, this report is a \nregrettable example of ``official Washington'' missing the point. The \nreport may have gotten a glowing reception at its DC premiere, but I \ndon't think it will get the same response once it goes on the road. \nMaybe there are still people in Washington who need a study group to \ntell them that the policy in Iraq isn't working, but the American \npeople are way ahead of this report. It has been just over a month \nsince the American people told us clearly what they were thinking about \nIraq. They recognize that we need a timetable to bring the troops out \nof Iraq. They know that a flexible timetable is needed to preserve our \nmilitary readiness, to prevent more unnecessary and tragic American \ncasualties in Iraq and to protect our national security. They are the \nones we should be listening to--not the insiders, politicians and \nthink-tankers who believe they have cornered the market on wisdom.\n  Unfortunately, the focus of this commission, and the amount of \nattention being given to this single report, show just how myopic this \nadministration and Members of Congress are. The long-running debate \nhere in Washington about whether and when to redeploy our troops from \nIraq always centers on the situation on the ground there, and whether a \ndrawdown of troops will make it better or worse. Those are important \nconsiderations. But even more important are the issues that are largely \nignored--the fact that our commitment of troops and resources in Iraq \nis dangerously weakening our national security and the opportunity cost \nof ignoring the growing threats elsewhere in the world.\n  As the administration and Congress mull over the Iraq Study Group's \nrecommendations, it comes as no surprise that the group's work includes \nwhat the New York Times had called a ``classic Washington compromise.'' \nBut we need much more than a compromise to fix our national security \npolicy. We need a dramatic and immediate change of course in Iraq--a \ntimeline to redeploy our troops from Iraq so that we can refocus on the \nterrorist networks that threaten the safety of the American people.\n  The war in Iraq was, and remains, a war of choice. The administration \nhas tried to create a false choice, between staying in Iraq with no end \ndate in sight and ``cutting and running.'' They want us to believe that \nIraq is the central front in the war on terror, just as\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\nthey wanted us to believe their trumped-up reasons for going to war in \nthe first place. They want us to believe that any option besides \nstaying the course is going to be detrimental to our national security. \nThat argument is mistaken.\n  The real choice is this: continuing to devote so much of our \nresources to Iraq, or devoting some of those resources to waging a \nglobal campaign against al-Qaida and its allies. We cannot do both.\n  The administration's choice--to maintain a massive and seemingly \nindefinite U.S. presence in Iraq--is harmful both to our efforts in \nIraq, as well as to our global efforts to defeat the terrorists that \nattacked us on 9/11.\n  Our indefinite presence in Iraq is destabilizing and potentially \ndamaging Iraqi efforts to rebuild their government and their country. \nThat is not the fault of our brave troops--it's the fault of the \npolicymakers here in Washington, who don't recognize that our presence \nis generating instability in Iraq, and that, unless we make it clear \nthat we intend to leave, and to leave soon, our presence is more \nharmful than it is helpful.\n  The Administration's approach in Iraq is a diversion from the global \nfight against terrorism. Iraq isn't, and never was, the central front \nin the war on terrorism. Unfortunately, because of our disproportionate \nfocus on Iraq, we are not using enough of our military and intelligence \ncapabilities for defeating al-Qaida and other terrorist networks around \nthe world. While we have been distracted in Iraq, terrorist networks \nhave developed new capabilities and found new sources of support \nthroughout the world. We have seen terrorist attacks in India, Morocco, \nTurkey, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Spain, Great Britain, and elsewhere.\n  The administration has also failed to adequately address the \nterrorist safe haven that has existed for years in Somalia and the \nrecent instability that has threatened to destabilize the region. And \nresurgent Taliban and al-Qaida forces are contributing to growing \nlevels of instability in Afghanistan.\n  Meanwhile, the U.S. presence in Iraq is being used as a recruiting \ntool for terrorist organizations from around the world. In Indonesia, \nhome to historically moderate Islamic communities, conservative \nreligious groups are becoming increasingly hostile towards the U.S. In \ncountries like Thailand, Nigeria, Mali, the Philippines, and elsewhere, \nmilitant groups are using U.S. policies in Iraq to fuel hatred towards \nthe West.\n\n  This administration's choices have been devastating to our national \nsecurity. Unfortunately, the Iraq Study Group's report doesn't do \nenough to put Iraq into a global context. It doesn't recognize the \nextent to which our disproportionate efforts in Iraq are damaging our \nnational security. And, even where the report suggests the toll that \nIraq is taking on our ability to address global threats, it ends up \nfalling back into the same Iraq-centric mindset that we need to change. \nFor example, the report says that ``the United States should provide \nadditional political, economic, and military support for Afghanistan, \nincluding resources that might become available as combat forces are \nmoved out of Iraq.'' But then it goes on to recommend that ``The most \nhighly qualified U.S. officers and military personnel should be \nassigned to'' teams imbedded in Iraqi battalions and brigades. Those \nare the very people we need in places like Afghanistan and elsewhere we \nface significant threats to our national security. It was the \nadministration's decision to move resources from Afghanistan to Iraq \nthat contributed to the resurgence of the Taliban there--we can't \nafford to perpetuate that mistake.\n  Elsewhere, the report recommends that the DNI and Secretary of \nDefense ``should devote significantly greater analytic resources to the \ntask of understanding the threats and sources of violence in Iraq.'' \nThe problem is that the report doesn't consider the relative importance \nof directing more intelligence resources to understanding Iraq as \nopposed to al-Qaida and its affiliates around the world, Afghanistan, \nSomalia and other critically important regions and concerns. So it came \nup with a recommendation that doesn't serve our overall national \nsecurity interests. Implementing this recommendation at the expense of \nfighting terrorism and dealing with other terrorist safe havens around \nthe world will make us less safe.\n  We need to return to the post-9/11 mindset. In the days after 9/11, \nwe all shared an anger at and a resolve to fight back against those who \nattacked us. This body was united and was supportive of the \nAdministration's decision to attack al-Qaida and the Taliban in \nAfghanistan. No one disputed that decision.\n  That is because our top priority immediately following 9/11 was \ndefeating the terrorists that attacked us. The American people expected \nus to devote most of our national security resources to that effort, \nand rightly so. But unfortunately, 5 years later, our efforts to defeat \nal-Qaida and its supporters have gone badly astray. The administration \ntook its eye off the ball. Instead of focusing on the pursuit of al-\nQaida in Afghanistan, it launched a diversion into Iraq--a country that \nhad no connection to the 9/11 plot or al-Qaida. In fact, the \nPresident's decision to invade Iraq has emboldened the terrorists and \nhas played into their hands, by allowing them to falsely suggest that \nour fight against terrorism is anti-Muslim and anti-Arab, when nothing \ncould be further from the truth.\n  But instead of recognizing that our current policy in Iraq is \ndamaging our national security, the President continues to argue that \nthe best way to fight terrorists is to stay in Iraq. He even quotes \nterrorists to bolster his argument that Iraq is the central front in \nthe war on terror. Just a few months ago, he told the country that \nOsama bin Laden has proclaimed that the ``third world war is raging'' \nin Iraq and that this is ``a war of destiny between infidelity and \nIslam.''\n  Instead of letting the terrorists decide where we will fight them, \nthe President should remember what he said on September 14, just 2 days \nafter 9/11. He said:\n\n       [t]his conflict was begun on the timing and terms of \n     others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of our \n     choosing.\n\n  The President was right when he said that, and he is now wrong to \nsuggest that we must stay in Iraq because that is where the terrorists \nsay they want to fight us. al-Qaida and its allies are operating around \nthe globe. We must engage in a global campaign to defeat them, not \nfocus all of our resources on one country.\n  The way to win a war against global terrorist networks is not to keep \nover 140,000 American troops in Iraq indefinitely. We will weaken, not \nstrengthen, our national security by continuing to pour a \ndisproportionate level of our military and intelligence and fiscal \nresources into Iraq.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has yet to understand that the \nthreats to our country are global, unlike any we have encountered in \nthe past. Our enemy is not a state with clearly defined borders. We \nmust respond instead to a loose network of terrorist organizations that \ndo not function according to a strict hierarchy. Our enemy isn't one \norganization. It is a series of highly mobile, diffuse entities that \noperate largely beyond the reach of our conventional war-fighting \ntechniques. The only way to defeat them is to adapt our strategy and \nour capabilities, and to engage the enemy on our terms and by using our \nadvantages.\n  We have proven that we can't do that with our current approach in \nIraq.\n  By redeploying our troops from Iraq, we can pursue a new national \nsecurity strategy. We can finish the job in Afghanistan with increased \nresources, troops, and equipment. We can develop a new form of \ndiplomacy, scrapping the ``transformational diplomacy'' this \nadministration has used to offend, push away, and ultimately alienate \nso many of our friends and allies, and replacing it with an aggressive, \nmultilateral approach that would leverage the strength of our friends \nto defeat our common enemies.\n  And we can repair and infuse new capabilities and strength into our \narmed forces. By freeing up our Special Forces assets and redeploying \nour military power from Iraq, we will be better positioned to handle \nglobal threats and future contingencies. Our current state of readiness \nis unacceptable and must be repaired. Our National Guard, too, must be \ncapable of responding to natural disasters and future contingencies.\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\n  This new national security strategy will make our country safer. It \nwill enable our government to fully address the wide range of threats \nour country faces. It will free up strategic capacity to deal with \nIran, North Korea, and the Middle East, and to provide real leadership \ninternationally against other enemies that we all face, like poverty, \nHIV/AIDS, and corruption.\n  In sum, it will help return the United States to a place of \npreeminence in the world and will give us the opportunity to address \nthe very real threats we face in the 21st century. While the Iraq Study \nGroup has generated some good ideas and choices, it doesn't put Iraq in \nthe context of a broader national security strategy.\n  We face an unprecedented threat to our national security, and we must \nrespond with much more than a classic Washington compromise. We need to \nrefocus on fighting and defeating the terrorist network that attacked \nthis country on September 11, 2001, and that means realizing that the \nwar in Iraq is not the way to defeat al-Qaida and its global \naffiliates. It never was and it never will be. That global fight can't \nbe won if we let Iraq continue to dominate our security strategy and \ndrain vital security resources for an unlimited amount of time. The \nPresident's Iraq-centric policies are preventing us from effectively \nengaging serious threats around the world. We must change course in \nIraq, and we must change course now.\n  This isn't a choice, it's a necessity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11700-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11700-S11701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAGNUSON-STEVENS FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT REAUTHORIZATION \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize final passage of the \nMagnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization \nAct of 2006 by both the Senate and the House this week, clearing the \nbill for Presidential approval. I am proud to have. developed this bill \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Ted Stevens.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is the \nprimary Federal statute governing how we manage our Nation's fisheries \nand, as such, plays a vital role in our Nation's ability to achieve its \noverarching ocean policy goal. This bill reauthorizes the Magnuson-\nStevens Act from fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2013 and takes \nsteps to improve the act both by making it more effective and \nresponsive to the needs of our fishing communities here at home and by \ntaking important steps toward exporting our successful management \napproaches internationally.\n  After the Senate passed the bill earlier this year, Senator Stevens \nand I worked with the House on a bipartisan basis in order to reach \nconsensus on a final version of the bill. I am pleased that these \ndiscussions have resulted in further improvements and additions to the \nbill that have motivated strong bicameral and bipartisan support for \nthis important piece of conservation legislation.\n  The key to the success of the Magnuson-Stevens Act has always been \nits regional approach to management. Keeping with that regional \napproach, this bill strengthens the accountability of the Regional \nFishery Management Councils by requiring training of new members to \nprepare them to comply with legal, scientific, economic, and conflict \nof interest requirements applicable to the fishery management process.\n  Our bill also aims to improve conservation performance in our \nfisheries by requiring all Councils to establish annual catch limits in \neach federal fishery management plan. The role science plays in this \ndecisionmaking process will be strengthened by this bill as well, since \nrequirements will now be in place for each council to adhere to the \nrecommendations provided by their Science and Statistical Committee, \nSSC, or other peer review process to prevent overfishing and achieve \nrebuilding targets. In recognition of the SSC's increased role, we have \nstrengthened the conflict of interest disclosure requirements to which \neach SSC member must comply.\n  The bill also requires limited access privilege programs, such as \nindividual fishing quota systems, established in the future not only to \ncontribute to a reduction of capacity in overcapitalized fisheries and \nimprove fishermen's safety by ending the race for the fish but also to \nconsider social and economic benefits to coastal communities. Senator \nStevens' and my intent was to sustain thriving fishing communities and \npromote access to the fisheries by residents of our coastal communities \nin order to foster the independent, coastal community-based character \nof our Nation's fisheries. To achieve this aim, the bill sets forth a \nstrong list of standards to ensure that any such program take into \naccount the social and economic implications of the program. In \naddition, it authorizes the creation of voluntary regional fishery \nassociations for the mutual benefit of fishery participants, including \nprovisions to ensure we maintain free and open markets for fishermen to \nsell their catch.\n\n  The bill also requires a periodic review of each program's compliance \nwith the goals of their program. Individual permits will be renewed \nautomatically every 10 years, unless the permit holder fails to meet \nthe requirements specified in the program as meriting modification, \nlimitation, or revocation. The bill also contains grandfathering and \ntransition rules to address the application of these new standards to \nexisting and developing programs. I want to make clear that final \nSenate changes in these provisions were not intended to adversely \naffect or delay ongoing development of a proposal for a rationalization \nprogram for the Pacific trawl groundfish and whiting fisheries by the \nPacific Fisheries Management Council. We intend that this process go \nforward and that adherence to the new standards not delay development \nof the plan called for in the bill.\n  In order to assist fishermen in helping to reduce bycatch and seabird \ninteractions, H.R. 5946 establishes a regionally based Bycatch \nReduction Engineering Program to develop technologies and methods to \nimprove the ability of fishery participants to reduce bycatch and \nassociated mortality, including post-release mortality. The provision \nincludes an outreach mandate to encourage the adoption of new \ntechnologies and also encourages the adoption of bycatch reduction \nincentives in fishery management plans, such as bycatch quotas. \nFinally, it encourages the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration to continue coordinating with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService and other entities to reduce or mitigate seabird interactions \nin fisheries, a process that has had much success in the Western and \nNorth Pacific.\n  This comprehensive package not only addresses conservation and \nmanagement within our Nation's waters but equally as important, \nstrengthens controls on illegal, unreported, and unregulated IUU \nfishing in the high seas. IUU fishing, as well as expanding fleets and \nhigh bycatch levels, are threats to sustainable fisheries worldwide. \nThe bill includes provisions to strengthen the ability of international \nfishery management organizations and the United States to ensure \nappropriate enforcement and compliance with conservation and management \nmeasures in high seas fisheries. The international component of this \nbill ensures other nations provide comparable protections to \npopulations of living marine resources at risk from high seas fishing \nactivities. These provisions help the U.S. fishing industry by both \nsustaining shared resources and leveling the playing field in terms of \nregulation and responsibility.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill includes provisions crucial \nto the long-term sustainability of tuna and other high seas stocks so \nimportant to Hawaii and the Pacific Islands, as well as a program to \nhelp increase marine education and technical skills in the region. \nThese provisions will not only help us work with other countries to \nconserve our shared marine resources but also reduce unfair \nconservation burdens on U.S. high seas fleets. The bill also contains \nlong-awaited legislation to implement the Western and Central Pacific \nFisheries Convention, a critical step in ending overfishing of bigeye \nand other tuna species in the Pacific. I am pleased that \nrepresentatives of both the Western Pacific Council and the Pacific \nCouncil will be commissioners and that the territories will be provided \nrepresentation in this important organization.\n\n  In addition, the bill contains provisions that promote marine \neducation,\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\ntraining, and assistance opportunities for Western Pacific communities \nand underrepresented groups. This training is critically important for \ncommunities that are so dependent upon the health and sustainability of \nour ocean resources.\n  Finally, the bill contains the text of the Tsunami Warning and \nEducation Act, another bill that Senator Stevens and I developed early \nlast year and then negotiated with the House Science Committee. This \nlegislation, so critical to the Pacific region, will go far to \nstrengthen and expand the existing tsunami warning and detection \nsystem, and I am grateful, on behalf of the people of Hawaii, for all \nthe support the bill has gained in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the administration on \nimplementation of the many important provisions of this bill, and I \nthank my friend, Senator Stevens, as well as committee colleagues, \nparticularly Senators Cantwell, Snowe, Boxer, Lott, and Lautenberg, for \nworking so hard toward enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11701-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE LIFE OF GRENVILLE GARSIDE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I have \nhere a resolution signed by all 22 members of the committee.\n  Mr. Garside served as the very first staff director of this committee \nwhen it was first established in 1977 under Senator Henry ``Scoop'' \nJackson of Washington. Gren was well respected on both sides of the \naisle and was renowned for his knowledge of energy and natural \nresources law.\n  The committee enjoyed the able leadership of Mr. Garside in those \nearly years as its jurisdiction and influence began to take shape. Gren \nwas known for his integrity, good judgment, and affable nature.\n  So, it is fitting that we take a moment to honor this man, whose \nprofessional career was so intertwined with this revered institution. \nIt is right that we place this resolution in the Record. We are \ngrateful for his many years of service. Each member of this committee \nexpresses their deepest sympathy to Gren's family and multitude of \nfriends.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          United States Senate\n\n\ncommittee on energy and natural resources honoring the life and service \n                          of grenville garside\n\n       Whereas Grenville Garside was legislative counsel to the \n     late Senator Henry M.

Mr. President, as this session draws to a close, I \nwould be remiss if I did not take a moment, or perhaps more than a \nmoment, to share with my colleagues my deep appreciation to a staffer \nwho has recently left the Senate and Federal service. I speak of Bruce \nArtim.\n  Bruce came to us over a decade ago, first as a legislative fellow, \nthen moving through the ranks of the Senate as a detailee, and finally \nas the top Judiciary Committee staffer.\n  What a long, strange trip it has been.\n  Bruce's work has spanned stem cells to trade treaties to the criminal \ncode. In fact, I can't think of an issue that Bruce has not worked on--\nnuclear waste with the Department of Homeland Security to international \nAIDS with Bono--although it is an open secret Bruce much prefers the \nStones--to juvenile diabetes with Mary Tyler Moore.\n  At times, Bruce has provided legislative drafting services to the \nUtah legislature and medical advice to Members of Congress. He has \nplotted strategy to enact the Child Health Insurance Program, flipped \ncharts at Labor Committee hearings, and written floor statements so \nlong the podium sagged.\n  Bruce is equally competent and equally happy explaining the \ncomplexities of molecular biology or the intricacies of intelligence \nlaw. His range of expertise spans the subchapters of food and drug law \nto the nuances of trade treaties. He is a man who really knows his \nZantac. He works equally well inside the bureaucracy, outside the \nbureaucracy, and around the bureaucracy. He has advised me on the \nesoterics of the totipotent oocyte, the best escape route from the Hart \nin times of emergency, and which dishes were best at the Dirksen \nbuffet. Never was there a better proofreader of international law.\n  I have valued his work, both as a trusted aide in whom I have total \nand absolute confidence, but also as a family member, who has been with \nme through thick and thin.\n  So it is with great sadness that I rise to express my heartfelt \nthanks, appreciation and best wishes to Bruce and his family as he \nretires from 25 years of Federal service and assumes a wonderful \nopportunity in the private sector.\n  Bruce has exemplified the best of Capitol Hill staffers. He is known \nand loved by all--from the cafeteria workers to the chairmen of the \nmajor committees. All recognize what we have come to appreciate about \nBruce--his affable manner, his keen intellect, quick wit, and his \nreadiness to help any and all.\n  Bruce is truly one of a kind. His departure from my office has \ncertainly left a void that will be very difficult to fill.\n  Bruce, his loving wife, Brenda, and his precious 12-year-old son Jon, \nhave been a part of the extended Hatch family for many years. In fact, \nJon has had such a frequent presence in our office that I think we have \neven put him to work more than once.\n  Another frequent guest to our office was Bruce's wonderful mother \nIrma, who turned 80 years old this May. Bruce father's Ed, a World War \nII combat veteran, passed away many years ago and I will always regret \nthat I never had the chance to meet him.\n  I remember so well the time Bruce told me one of the most important \nthings that his father taught him was to always try to make time to \ngive career counseling and opportunities to the talented individuals \nyou meet at work, particularly the young people.\n  I agree with this advice wholeheartedly because as I look at my 30-\nyear career in the Senate, one of the aspects I most cherish is the \nsuccesses that so many of my friends and constituents in Utah and \nformer staffers and other associates have accomplished in part because \nof the help that our office has provided.\n  Bruce is one of the brightest, hardworking, and loyal staffers who \nhave ever served on my staff.\n  And there is one unique and endearing quality about him--he always \nput his family first. His love for his family is inspiring. Even though \nhe worked endless hours for me, he always made it a priority to attend \nhis son's baseball games and swimming meets.\n  After completing his undergraduate education, Bruce started his \ncareer in\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\ngovernment as a member of the Volunteers in Service to America--as a \nVISTA Volunteer. Stationed in Columbus, IN, Bruce helped organize six \nlocal housing authorities and helped train them to operate housing \nrehabilitation and community development programs to benefit low-income \nfamilies.\n  After returning to school and graduating from law school in 1983, \nBruce joined the Office of Management and Budget where he was assigned \nto review the regulatory and legislative programs of the Food and Drug \nAdministration. In 1986, Bruce moved to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services as the executive assistant to the Assistant Secretary \nfor Health, Dr. Robert Windom. In 1989, Bruce became the assistant \ndirector for policy at the National AIDS Program Office of the U.S. \nPublic Health Service.\n  Bruce first joined my office as a legislative fellow assigned to the \nSenate Labor Committee, on which I served as ranking Republican member. \nIt was during this time that Bruce was my lead counsel on the original \nPrescription Drug User Fee legislation, which will again be up for \nreauthorization next year.\n  Between late 1992 and mid-1995, Bruce served as the Assistant \nDirector for Policy at the National Institutes of Health's, NIH, Office \nof Technology Transfer. During that time, he played a key role in \nformulating NIH policy on gene patenting, sponsored research \nagreements, and pricing clauses in Federal Licenses and research \nagreements.\n  When Bruce returned to my staff in 1995 on loan from the NIH, I was \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. I assigned him to a wide range of \nhigh-priority, complex and sometimes contentious issues. For example, \nBruce became an expert in the manner in which the historic 1995 General \nAgreement on Trade and Tariffs--the GATT Treaty--intersected with FDA \nregulatory requirements and U.S. and international intellectual \nproperty laws, including the special rules related to pharmaceutical \npatents.\n  In 1997, my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy and I decided \nto collaborate together on legislation that would increase health \ninsurance coverage to children of low-income families to be financed by \nincreased tobacco taxes. At the beginning of the effort to enact what \nwould become the very popular and very successful CHIP program that \nprovides millions of children with health insurance, there was a \nbipartisan team of six staffers.\n  Representing me were Bruce, my longstanding, loyal, and very talented \naide and current chief of staff, Trish Knight, and Rob Foreman, who \nwent on to run the legislative office of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services during the busy and challenging time period when the \nMedicare Modernization Act and the new prescription drug benefit was \nbeing written and implemented.\n  Senator Kennedy was also represented by a team of energetic experts: \nLauren Ewers, who was a key player in the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act, better known as the HIPAA \nlaw, David Nexon, a leading Congressional staff authority of health \nissues who was the nemesis to many a Republican Member and staffer \nalike on a plethora of issues, and, last, but certainly not least, Nick \nLittlefield, a visionary and inspirational leader and master \nlegislative tactician. It is my firm hope now that Nick and David are \nboth in the private sector that they see the error of Senator Kennedy's \nliberal ways and allow their inner-conservative selves to come out.\n  One of the things that make this institution a great place is the \nability to battle one another politically but to do so always with \nrespect and, as often as possible, with good humor. One thing you can \nsay about Bruce is that he made us laugh, sometimes not even \nintentionally.\n  I will never forget the time when I was testifying before the HELP \nCommittee on the children's health bill. I noticed that Senator \nKennedy's staff had made far better charts than my own crack staff \ncould muster. I ordered Bruce to borrow Senator Kennedy's posters for \nme to use and was prepared to enjoy my friend from Massachusetts' \nsurprise and dismay when he discovered the temporary heist. But the \nsituation got even better when Bruce thoroughly distracted Senator \nKennedy's opening statement by dropping the posters on the floor after \ngetting into a verbal altercation with none other than that great \nshrinking violent of the press corps, Adam Clymer of the New York \nTimes.\n  Apparently, Mr. Clymer was dismayed that the charts were blocking his \nand other reporters' view and demanded that the offending charts be \nmoved. Bruce explained that he was just doing his job. To which Mr. \nClymer responded in his normal diplomatic style: But do you have to be \nso bad at it?\n  Suffice it to say that years later when Vice President Cheney made \nthat now famous comparison between Mr. Clymer and an unflattering part \nof the anatomy, some of us thought back to his discourse with Bruce.\n  Although from time to time Bruce could drive me out of my gourd, it \ndid not stop me from giving him challenging assignments. Once he wrote \na history of how the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act treated exports of \nproducts for me to deliver at a major conference we were to attend in \nSalt Lake. As it was time to depart for the airport, Bruce looked up \nand said, ``But I am only up to 1938!'' But he got it done.\n  In 2003, I promoted Bruce to be my right-hand man by naming him as \nthe Judiciary Committee's chief counsel and staff director, where he \nadvised me and other committee members on matters pertaining to \nexecutive branch and judicial nominations, criminal and civil justice, \ncounterterrorism, immigration, intellectual property, antitrust, and \nconstitutional law. During his tenure as chief counsel, Bruce helped \ndevise and implement a successful strategy that resulted in the passage \nof the Justice for All Act, a key legislative priority for me, Senator \nLeahy, Chairman Sensenbrenner, and Representatives Conyers and William \nDelahunt. This law helps ensure that DNA technology will help bring to \njustice those who have eluded arrest and trial in serious crimes such \nas rape and, just as importantly, helps set free those wrongfully \nconvicted and incarcerated.\n  I feel compelled to add that this success was achieved despite the \nfact that during a particularly sensitive time in the often-contentious \nnegotiations, Bruce did not at first completely comply with my direct \norder to refrain from speaking to anyone from the Department of \nJustice, specifically including a certain sometimes confounding \nofficial we all knew well.\n  I am very proud that, with Bruce's help, during my last 2 years as \nJudiciary Committee Chairman, we were able to work to have the Senate \nconfirm 104 Federal judges.\n  I am also proud that when a few Republican staffers acted \noverzealously and improperly with regard to confidential committee \nmember files concerning judicial nominations, my staff including Bruce, \nReed O'Connor now Senator Cornyn's chief counsel, and Grace Becker--now \na Deputy Assistant Attorney General at DOJ, helped me and the committee \nset the matter back on the right course. Regardless of whether it is \nultimately determined that any laws were or were not violated, in this \ncase the conduct of accessing another's computer files was simply wrong \nand unacceptable. With the advice and counsel of staffers like Bruce \nArtim and Bruce Cohen, Senator Leahy's Democratic Chief Counsel and \nothers, I think the Judiciary Committee faced up to a serious breach of \ncomity and concluded, despite those who might erroneously think that \nanything goes in political combat, anything does not, and should not, \ngo in the Senate, especially not on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I do not shy away from political battles.\n  I do not like to lose political battles.\n  But when I fight a political battle, I fight straight up.\n  Part of what makes our country so great and so strong is that for \nover 200 years we have agreed to disagree agreeably. Bruce understood \nthat fighting fairly and ethically with our adversaries in the Senate \ntoday helps ensure that this body will remain strong and respectful \ntomorrow.\n  In the current 109th Congress, Bruce served as the chief counsel and \nstaff director of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee but still made \ntime to advise me on a wide range of matters, including the \nconfirmations of the Chief Justice of the United States,\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\nJohn Roberts, and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Samuel Alito; \nreauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act; the Bankruptcy Reform bill; and \nthe Class Action Reform legislation.\n  I frequently called upon Bruce to counsel me on difficult matters \ninvolving ethics. In recent years, stem cell research has required a \ncareful study of complex issues relating to ethics, law, science, \neconomics, intellectual property, politics and religion.\n  Bruce Artim accompanied me every step in my journey to understand and \nformulate policy on stem cell research. He worked closely with key \nSenate staffers, such as David Bowen of Senator Kennedy's staff, and \nSudip Parikh of Senator Specter's staff.\n  He helped me and other Senators and House members draft the critical \npieces of legislation that are at the center of national debate.\n  I could list so many laws to which Bruce contributed--the cord blood \nbank law, modifications to FDA export law we enacted not once, but \ntwice, Federal Tort Claims Act coverage for Community Health Center \nworkers, the bioterrorism legislation, and of course, patent law and \nespecially drug patent law.\n  As Bruce leaves, there are many voids we struggle to fill. There is \nso much we will miss about Bruce. He was undoubtedly the most \naccomplished Hill expert on the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nExpiration Act, better known as Waxman-Hatch or Hatch-Waxman.\n  We will miss his pink bicycle down in the Hart garage, the many jokes \nleft on the cutting room floor, and a never-ending supply of neckties \nwhich supplied so many Hill gentlemen in a time of need.\n  I have always appreciated Bruce's wise counsel, his deep commitment \nto the Senate and his ability to make everyone laugh even during \nextremely tense legislative negotiations. He made a tremendous \ncontribution to the Senate, and I know that he will do the same for his \nnew employer, Eli Lilly and Company.\n  Mr. President, Bruce will be missed. He was not only a congressional \nstaffer, he was a true friend. So as the 109th Congress draws to a \nclose, I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing appreciation to \nBruce Artim for his loyalty and his significant contributions he has \nmade to the Senate over his record 11 years; a record Bruce would be \npleased to note now exceeds that of Doug Guerdat.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Bruce's 25 years as a \npublic servant and wishing him all of the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11703-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11703-S11706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2006\n\n Mr. HATCH. I rise today to congratulate my Senate colleagues \non the passage of a tremendously important piece of legislation, the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006, \nH.R. 6344. This act contains numerous provisions whose implementations \nare vital, and would provide specific goals and measurement standards \nto evaluate the effectiveness of our national drug control policy.\n  I want to highlight a specific provision of this bill that, when \nenacted, will benefit thousands of Americans who are struggling with \naddiction to drugs. As our country seeks to develop better treatments \nfor drug abuse, countless Americans continue to fall prey to illicit \ndrugs. As their lives are torn apart by these addictions, many find the \nstrength to call out to doctors for help. Unfortunately, some of these \ncalls for help go unanswered due to limitations placed on physicians \nwith regard to their treatment options.\n  In 2000, I worked with Senators Levin and Biden to pass the Drug \nAddiction and Treatment Act. This groundbreaking legislation allowed \ncertified physicians to prescribe appropriate medication to patients \nsuffering from drug addiction. Under this law, physicians are \nprescribing the drug buprenorphine to patients fighting their addiction \nto heroin and other opiates. The results have been tremendous, and \ncountless lives have been saved by breaking the addiction cycle.\n  However, current law caps the number of patients a qualified \nphysician can treat with this medication at 30. Unfortunately, many \ndoctors are at their cap and are forced to turn patients away due to \nthis artificial limitation.\n  I have spoken with numerous doctors who have relayed amazing stories \nof patients turning their lives around by using this medication and \nparticipating in treatment. These patients have gone on to return to \nthe workforce and continue their lives as productive citizens, free of \nthe scourge of drug abuse.\n  This bipartisan provision included in this bill would expand the \nnumber of patients whom qualified doctors are allowed to treat. Passage \nof this legislation will provide immediate assistance to countless \nAmericans who are fighting for their lives.\n  It is clear this cap needs to be raised. To make an analogy, a doctor \nwould not turn away a broken arm because he or she had already fixed 30 \narms that month! The doctor would not stand for it, and neither would \nsociety. The same should be true for physicians treating drug \naddiction. Given that the destructive effects of drug addiction are so \nmuch greater than a broken arm, we should strive to ensure that the \nhealing hands of doctors are not bound by unintended mandates. Doctors \nshould be allowed and encouraged to help as many as possible, and this \nlegislation allows them to treat many drug addicts that are otherwise \nbeing turned away. This provision will immediately help countless \nAmericans get the treatment they seek and so desperately need.\n  I highlight this provision as a sample of the meaningful substance in \nthis measure, and I applaud the efforts of lawmakers in both Chambers \nof Congress whose tireless efforts produced this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support reauthorization ONDCP and passage \nof the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of \n2006. This bill recognizes and strengthens the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy as the lead agency in the fight against illegal drug \nuse. It also includes important modifications and clarifications that \nwill improve the lives of all Americans by reducing the presence of \ndrugs in our society. I am very pleased that five of my recommendations \nto improve the bill are included in this legislation.\n  I commend Senator Biden, who has long been a leader in the fight \nagainst illegal drugs, and Chairman Specter, the lead sponsor of this \nlegislation. The authorization for ONDCP expired 3 years ago, and it is \nlong passed time for Congress to act. Illegal drug abuse, drug \naddiction, and drug-related violence continue to exact an enormous toll \non our society. Nationwide, drug abuse kills 52,000 Americans each \nyear, and more than 20,000 Americans will die as a direct consequence \nof illegal drug use this year alone. Drug abuse costs our society \nnearly $116 billion annually. It has strained the capacity of our \ncriminal justice system and our medical facilities and brought violence \nand tragedy to families, schools, and communities throughout the \ncountry.\n  This bipartisan legislation will reauthorize ONDCP for 5 years and \nprovide ONDCP with the necessary tools and resources to develop a \nnational drug control policy and coordinate and oversee the \nimplementation of that policy.\n  This legislation includes a number of reforms that provide \nclarification concerning the most significant objectives and duties of \nONDCP. It allows Congress to be vigilant in our oversight by requiring \nthe President to submit to Congress a yearly national drug control \nstrategy, expanding ONDCP's reporting requirements to Congress on \nnumerous areas of ONDCP responsibility; requiring ONDCP to give a full \naccounting of the budget; and requiring ONDCP to develop a new \nperformance measurement system that includes 2-year and 5-year targets \nfor each of the strategy's objectives.\n  In addition, this legislation improves essential information sharing \nby requiring that various Government agencies, including the Attorney \nGeneral, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Departments of \nAgriculture and Defense, submit to ONDCP and Congress reports relating \nto their agencies' drug control efforts.\n  I want to take a moment and address several specific provisions. \nFirst, as a strong supporter of the National Guard, I am pleased that \nthis legislation authorizes $30 million a year for the Chief of the \nNational Guard to establish five National Guard Counterdrug Schools to \ntrain personnel from Federal agencies, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies, community-\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\nbased organizations, and other groups in drug interdiction and demand \nreduction activities.\n  I am pleased that this legislation will require greater diligence on \nmethamphetamine. The bill calls for the creation of a National \nMethamphetamine Information Clearinghouse, an idea which I have long \nsupported, including cosponsoring legislation to set up the \nclearinghouse. This toll-free number and Web-based source of \ninformation will promote sharing of ``best practices'' regarding law \nenforcement, prevention, treatment, environmental, social services, and \nother programs related to combating the scourge of methamphetamine.\n  I am pleased that this legislation embraces a comprehensive policy \nthat reduces the demand, as well as supply, of drugs. It reduces the \ndemand for drugs by ensuring that programs to expand access to drug \ntreatment are adequately supported in the Federal drug control budget \nand by providing greater uniformity and accountability in assessing \nONDCP's effectiveness in drug treatment programs. On the supply side, \nthe bill takes steps to disrupt markets at home and abroad. It requires \nONDCP to develop comprehensive strategies to address the severe threats \nposed by South American heroine and drug smuggling across the southwest \nborder.\n  This legislation also includes a good provision by Senators Levin and \nHatch that amends the Controlled Substances Act to raise the number of \nopioid addicted patients a physician may accept from 30 to 100. In the \nlast 5 years, the number of heroin-related arrests and the number of \npeople seeking treatment for heroin use in Vermont has more than \ndoubled. This provision will expand treatment options for thousands of \npatients who have been denied access to critical addiction treatments \nin Vermont and across the country.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes several of my recommended \nimprovements. I continue to support the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \nCampaign, but I want to make sure that the campaign is run in a way \nthat uses funds efficiently and gets out its antidrug message \neffectively. I therefore recommended inclusion of comprehensive \nstandards for evaluating what type of media campaigns and information \nare effective, as well as a prohibition on the expenditure of antidrug \nmedia campaign funds for political purposes.\n  The campaign will be better for these changes, as well as the \nlegislation's additional step of creating an independent agency to \nconduct annual evaluations of effectiveness. The bill also adopted my \nrecommendation to eliminate two unnecessary provisions which could also \nhinder international diplomacy and drug control efforts.\n  I continue to have concerns about the safety and predictability of \nmycoherbicides against drug crops. While this bill only calls for a \nscientific study on the use of mycoherbicides, I am pleased that the \nbill includes my recommendation to prohibit testing in any foreign \ncountries. I believe this provision will prevent souring diplomatic \nrelations between the United States and countries around the world.\n  I am disappointed that my recommendations to remedy a few weaknesses \nin the bill were not adopted. Among other issues, I am concerned by \nprovisions that prohibit the expenditure of more than 5 percent of the \nFederal funds appropriated for High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \nPrograms for drug prevention programs and that prohibit the use of any \nFederal HIDTA funds to establish new or expand existing drug treatment \nprograms. The State, local, and Federal law enforcement officials in \nthe HIDTA Program should have the discretion to use the programs that \nwork best in their areas.\n  I am also troubled that the Bush administration and the Republican \nCongress have not sufficiently addressed the international drug trade, \nparticularly the rising instability in opium production in Afghanistan. \nThree months ago, the United Nations released a report concluding that \nopium cultivation is surging in the southern region of Afghanistan and \nwarned that the southern region was verging on collapse. Just this past \nweekend, the Washington Post also reported that opium production in \nAfghanistan reached a historic high in 2006, despite ongoing \neradication efforts. These reports are particularly troubling \nconsidering that this administration has increasingly described the \ndrug trade as a problem that rivals the Taliban and threatens to derail \nthe stability and reconstruction of Afghanistan.\n  While I applaud this bill's inclusion of a provision that requires \nthe ONDCP to submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy that addresses \nthe increased threat from Afghan heroin, I fear that this provision may \nnot go far enough. Afghanistan provides more than 90 percent of the \nworld's heroin. Without seeking accountability from the President, the \nState Department, and the Attorney General on the rise of Afghan \nheroin, we cannot sufficiently discharge our duty to address the \ninternational supply of heroin.\n  Nevertheless, I am confident that this legislation will strengthen \nONDCP, its component programs, and our national comprehensive antidrug \neffort. This legislation balances the goals of drug enforcement and \nprevention, while providing Congress with additional oversight tools. I \nsupport its passage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, according to the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, approximately 1 million people in the United States are \naddicted to heroin; more than 3 million individuals over the age of 12 \nhave used heroin at least once; and an estimated 4.7 million people are \ndependent on or abusing other opiate drugs, including prescription \npainkillers according to a 2005 survey of the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration.\n  The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, DATA, which I authored \nalong with Senators Hatch and Biden, makes a dramatic change in the way \nAmerica fights heroin addiction. DATA permits, for the first time, FDA \napproved drug treatment medications to be prescribed and dispensed in \nan office-based setting under strict conditions by specially trained \nphysicians. The medication in question is called buprenorphine--bup. It \nblocks the craving for heroin. This new law essentially brings the \ntreatment of opiate dependence into the mainstream of medicine. It \nallows both primary care and addiction specialists to treat patients \nwho want to get rid of their addiction, but are unable to because of \ndistance or their unwillingness to seek medical treatment at \ncentralized methadone clinics, where their appearance amounts to an \nannouncement of their addiction.\n  This new law has brought tens of thousands of patients into \ntreatment, who would never have sought treatment in methadone programs. \nNow in its fourth year, DATA has proved highly beneficial. The success \nof DATA in extending treatment has resulted in waiting lists for \ntreatment with physicians who have signed up to treat addicts. Those \nphysicians are currently limited to 30 patients.\n  The great success of buprenorphine has been borne out by firsthand \naccounts by physicians and addiction experts from across the country, \nas well as the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Dr. \nNora Volkow and the director of the Center for Substance Abuse \nTreatment, Dr. H. Westley Clark, who participated in an August 3, 2006 \nSenate Symposium on DATA, which I sponsored along with Senator Orrin \nHatch.\n  The legislation before us, S. 2560, which reauthorizes the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, includes an important amendment to DATA \nthat will more than triple the number of patients specially trained \nphysicians may treat in their private offices. The across-the-board 30-\npatient limitation has resulted in denials of treatment and even deaths \nof patients who were not able to enter treatment because a physician \nhad reached the 30-patient limit. For many such persons, their hope of \ntreatment is dashed while they wait on a physician's waiting list.\n  In an effort to remedy this, the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nmodification of DATA in section 1102 of S. 2560 addresses this problem \nby permitting physicians who have been certified to utilize \nbuprenorphine in their office-based practice for at least one year, to \nnotify the HHS Secretary of their intention to begin treating \nadditional patients, in accordance with section 1102.\n  The bill with our amendment raises the number of patients who may be \ntreated by an individual physician from 30 patients to 100 patients. \nThis change--increasing the patient limit\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\nfrom 30 to 100 per physician--is supported by the medical community at \nlarge as well as the addiction speciality associations, including: The \nAmerican Medical Association, the American Osteopathic Association, The \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, The American Psychological \nAssociation, The American Academy of Addiction Medicine, The American \nSociety of Addiction Medicine, The Association of American Medical \nColleges, and several large health providers such as Kaiser Permanente.\n  In addition to establishing a process through which trained \nphysicians can dispense or prescribe buprenorphine, the Drug Addiction \nTreatment Act of 2000 required the Secretary of HHS to evaluate the \nimpact of office-based buprenorphine treatment. In compliance with this \nrequirement, the Secretary directed the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration--SAMHSA--to conduct a survey to \ndetermine (1) the availability of the office-based treatment, (2) the \neffectiveness of the office-based treatment, and (3) the potential \nadverse public health consequences.\n  The preliminary findings of the HHS evaluation were presented and \ndiscussed during the August 3 Senate Symposium which I have previously \nmentioned. The HHS-SAMHSA evaluation showed that buprenorphine \ntreatment is clinically effective and well-accepted by patients; the \nprogram has increased the availability of medication-assisted \ntreatment; adverse effects have been minimal; and that the 30-patient \nlimit established in DATA, as well as cost reimbursement issues \ndecrease potential access to treatment under the program. The \nexperiences articulated by the health care professionals who \nparticipated in the August 3rd Senate Symposium are reflective of the \nfindings of the HHS-SAMHSA evaluation, which were presented by CSAT \nDirector Dr. Westley Clark and that were echoed by NIDA Director Dr. \nNora Volkow, based on her own expertise and observation of \nbuprenorphine office-based treatment.\n  It is tragic if the personal and community benefits of this new anti-\naddiction medication, combined with treatment in the private office of \ncertified physicians are limited because of artificial limits on its \nuse. The legislation before us brings us close to full utilization. I \nam pleased that the Senate has adopted this life-changing, lifesaving \nlegislation as part of the ONDCP reauthorization bill, as well as the \nfree standing bill, S. 4115, which I introduced along with Senators \nHatch, Biden and Collins.\n  In closing, I would like to share with my colleagues in the Senate \nthe names of the distinguished physicians, addiction experts and agency \nofficials who participated in the August 3, 2006, Symposium and Press \nConference Senator Hatch and I hosted on the success of the Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act of 2000, and the subsequent FDA approval of \nbuprenorphine for the treatment of heroin addiction in 2002. Of \nparticular note are Dr. Charles Schuster of Wayne State University, a \npast Director of NIDA who has conducted clinical trials with \nbuprenorphine and who has been a great resource and guide on this issue \nfrom the very beginning and his advice and expertise continues today; \nand Dr. Herbert Kleeber, Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University \nand one of the Nation's foremost experts on drug addiction and \ntreatment, who provided invaluable assistance to me and to Senators \nHatch and Biden in putting together this new system of office-based \ntreatment utilizing buprenorphine. Dr. Nora Volkow's expertise and \ntutoring have led us all to a better understanding of the science of \naddiction. Dr. Volkow is the Director of the National Institute on Drug \nAbuse--NIDA--where buprenorphine was developed under a Cooperative \nResearch and Development Agreement between NIDA and a private \npharmaceutical company; Dr. H. Westley Clark, Director of the Center \nfor Substance Abuse Treatment under the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration. Dr. Clark has contributed great \nunderstanding of buprenorphine's therapeutic effects in the treatment \nof heroin abuse and dependence, and in understanding that drug \naddiction is a public health problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following brief \nremarks of two participants who experienced treatment with \nbuprenorphine, Ms. Tess Walker and Mr. Odis Rivers, and the list of the \nAugust 3, 2006 DATA Symposium and Press Conference participants, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Symposium\n\n         Convened by Senator Orrin Hatch and Senator Carl Levin\n\n\n                               Presenters\n\n       Dr. Nora Volkow--Director, National Institute on Drug \n     Abuse.\n       H.

A while back at Wayne State University we were doing \n     a trial of buprenorphine as a treatment medication for opiate \n     addiction, and Mr. Rivers was one of the volunteer \n     participants in that study.\n       He was successful in terms of stopping using drugs when he \n     was on buprenorphine, and we were able to extend the period \n     of time that he was on buprenorphine, and subsequently taper \n     him off of it, and I'm proud to say that he still comes past \n     my office regularly and he is still totally drug free. And \n     he's going to briefly tell you about his life.\n       Mr. Rivers: Hi, how is everybody? You know, I'm going to \n     get straight to the point. I am proud to be up here to talk \n     about buprenorphine, because it has really made a change in \n     my life. You know, being an addict is a terrible, terrible \n     situation, but being clean from buprenorphine, it just \n     changed my life like night and day. I can get along with \n     people I couldn't get along with before, and it's just a \n     miracle.\n       Like my sister, I had one sister, she's a Sheriff, I have \n     another sister, she's a doctor in California, and due to my \n     addiction, I could hardly get along with either one of them. \n     But since my experience with buprenorphine I get along just \n     fine with both of them, and all of my friends and everything, \n     you know, as a matter of fact, I have a lot of new friends \n     because I've changed so much. I don't take buprenorphine in \n     any kind of way or anything and so life is just wonderful and \n     grand, and I have to give that thanks to the medication \n     buprenorphine. Because it just helped me so tremendously in \n     my life. And so I would like to see everybody that needs an \n     opportunity, get an opportunity to use this medication, \n     because it does work, and I'm a living witness that it does.\n       I'd like to say thank you for listening to me. Thank you \n     very much.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    Ms. Tess Walker, College Student\n\n       My name is Tess Walker and I'm 24 years old, and I'm about \n     to graduate from Berkeley School of Music. I grew up in \n     Cambridge, Massachusetts and went to school there, and was \n     sort of going to school and doing well and had an after-\n     school job and graduated when I was 17, and when I was 18 I \n     started using heroin. And it seems like a very big leap, but \n     at the time, it didn't.\n       I was using heroin for three and a half years, and \n     basically doing nothing but, it was pretty much a day in, day \n     out thing. I was living with my mother. After awhile things \n     were really bad.\n       I was trying to get clean, and going into detoxes, \n     methadone detoxes for five days at a time and coming out and \n     going out and going back in and coming out, and during this \n     period of time, which was probably a\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\n     year and a half, two years into my using, my mother got in \n     touch with a physician named Dr. Daniel Alfred in Boston. He \n     was involved in the research with buprenorphine, and he \n     basically convinced her that she shouldn't throw me out of \n     the house--so thanks, Dr. Alfred--and about a treatment that \n     he was working on, but it wasn't available yet.\n       And I continued sort of on the path that I was on until I \n     had expended methadone detoxes ten times. And I want to focus \n     when I'm talking to you on that, the last experience that I \n     had with methadone detox.\n       I went in and took my first dose, and five days later I \n     took my last dose, and on that day left and I went to New \n     York to my friend's farm, because I knew that it was going to \n     get bad eventually and I was at the end of my rope and I \n     wanted it to end. When I got to New York things got really \n     bad, and I wound up being in a situation where it was like--\n     drugs, death.\n       I think about myself now and who I am now, and thinking \n     about being in a situation in which that's a viable option at \n     all is really scary.\n       I drove back to Boston at probably about 100 miles per hour \n     and got back to the city and got my drugs and went back home \n     and I was just completely at the end of my rope, my mother \n     was probably more at the end of hers, and she called up Dr. \n     Alfred--this was years after all of the process and \n     everything and the methadone and nothing working and trying \n     and trying and trying--and he basically told her that, \n     buprenorphine had been approved, and that I could come in on \n     that Monday.\n       We had so much hope at that point, and we went in and he \n     explained the process to us, and it kind of seemed really \n     unbelievable to me at the time. I went home with \n     buprenorphine and started taking my dose and there was a \n     moment where, I'm sorry, where sitting at my kitchen table in \n     Boston when I felt normal for the first time in three and a \n     half years. And I've been clean for almost three and a half \n     years now, and it changed my life. It was--after going \n     through years of trying and failing and trying and failing, \n     to have something--a drug that did not feel like a drug and \n     make me feel like a human being again, and to have people \n     around you who are treating you that way, was amazing.\n       I went back into college after I was six months clean, I've \n     been on the Dean's List ever since. I'm graduating in the \n     spring, I've been recording music and playing music and all \n     of my family is back in my life and it's an amazing thing. \n     And I've learned a lot standing back here today and I think \n     that it's a massively important thing for buprenorphine to be \n     in any community, especially in communities where you \n     wouldn't expect that this is a huge issue, because it is. And \n     for me to go from a nice high school in Cambridge with \n     amazing love and a huge support system to the places that I \n     went to, I mean, it can happen to anyone. And this is \n     working, it's really working. So I hope that I've given you \n     something to think about and thank you so much for letting me \n     come and speak here. Because this is a really major thing, \n     and I think that everyone needs to be aware that there's an \n     alternative to five days in methadone detox out there, and \n     that it works. Thank you so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11706-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11706-S11721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today unable to find the words \nI need to express just what it has been like to go to work every day \nwith a real, live Greek philosopher.\n  Of course, I mean Paul Sarbanes--who is the longest-serving Senator \nin the history of the State of Maryland; who has been among the wisest \nmembers to sit in this body; who is serving out his last week here with \nus. I have come to the floor today to say goodbye; and as I do, I \nremember one of my favorite Greek stories--which, in a bit of a \nroundabout way, reminds me of Paul.\n  When the Athenians set up the first democracy and declared that every \ncitizen could go and vote in the Assembly, they ran into just one \nproblem--no one wanted to go. It turned out that the Athenians were \nalso the first to discover voter apathy: It turned out that most of the \ncitizens would much rather spend time buying and selling in the \nMarketplace than arguing politics in the Assembly.\n  So the leaders came up with a plan. They hired the two burliest men \nthey could find and gave them a long rope clipped in fresh red paint. \nAnd then the two burly men would stand on opposite sides of the market \nsquare and shout ``Everybody out.'' And after about a minute, they \nwould each grab an end of the rope that was dripping with paint and \nwalk down the square; and anybody who didn't get out of there in time \nhad to go around for the rest of the day with his shirt ruined.\n  I said that story reminds me a bit of Senator Sarbanes. Not because \nhis clothing has been anything but impeccable and stain-free--but \nbecause it points out just how remarkable his 40-year career in public \nlife has been. The truth is that people have been finding ways to avoid \nthe responsibility of governing since governing was invented. So when \nwe have the luck to find a man willing to give not just an afternoon's \nservice to his country, but a whole life--and when he turns out to be a \nman of uncommon intelligence and humility--we know what a treasure we \nhave stumbled on.\n  We can think back to those Athenians dawdling in the marketplace and \nask ourselves: didn't they know? Didn't they know they were in \n``Ancient Greece,'' for crying out loud? Didn't they know they were \nsupposed to be in the cradle of democracy? Didn't they know we'd be \ntalking about them a couple of millennia later on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate?\n  But of course, they had no idea, and we can't blame them--they had \nlives to live. Compared to the getting and spending, the errands and \ntalk that go on in the market square, the work of governing can seem \nlike a book of the driest prose. The print is tiny and the lines are \nclosely spaced.\n  It takes an uncommon mind to appreciate the value, the necessity, of \nwhat's in that book--but Paul Sarbanes has had one all his life. He \nshowed it when he won a Rhodes Scholarship and went on to graduate \nfirst in his class at Oxford. He showed it when he was elected to the \nMaryland House of Delegates back in 1966, and then through 3 terms in \nthe House and 5 in the Senate, through a career one newspaper called \n``electorally invincible.'' And he showed it as one of the most quietly \ninfluential members of this body, a listener in a town full of talkers, \na living example of the maxim, ``It's amazing what you can accomplish \nwhen you don't care who gets the credit.''\n  But I can think of at least one accomplishment for which Senator \nSarbanes's credit is assured. In 2002, when he was chairman of the \nBanking Committee, a series of corporate scandals shocked the stock \nmarket, sapped trust in our economy, and cost shareholders and workers \nbillions of dollars. But Paul confronted the crisis of confidence and \nwrote legislation that helped restore accountability to accounting. \nSarbanes-Oxley was greeted as the most fundamental reform of American \nbusiness since the Great Depression; and I believe it will be Paul's \nlegacy. I was proud to help him; and I will be even prouder to sit in \nhis chairman's seat on the Banking Committee. Paul--your work will be \nmine, I promise.\n  Of course, Senator Sarbanes will be leaving another legacy here in \nWashington--his son John, who was elected to represent his father's old \nHouse district in the 110th Congress. I've never met John Sarbanes, but \nif the son is anything like the father, 2006 will look a lot like 1970: \nWe'll be sable to walk over to the House side and find a bright young \nman of immigrant heritage at the start of his Washington career, \nbrought up in the tradition of service and full of the quiet virtues.\n  I don't think politics has changed so much since 1970 that those \nvirtues aren't still in high demand. And come to think of it, politics \nhasn't changed so much since the days of the rope in the marketplace--\nwith at least one notable exception. We have gotten rid of the rope. In \nour country, no one forces you to care. No one forces you to vote. No \none forces you to serve. If you do those things anyway, it's not a \nmeasure of compulsion, but of conviction. And if, like Paul Sarbanes, \nyou had the talent to make a career for yourself anywhere in the world \nbut chose to spend it here, then we owe you our thanks--for your \ncompany, for your wisdom, for 40 years well spent in the Assembly.\n  Goodbye, Senator Sarbanes,--and my best wishes for you and your wife \nChristine for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my departing colleagues who \nhave, for a time, lent their talents, their convictions, and their hard \nwork to this distinguished body. I may have had my disagreements with \nthem, but the end of a term is a time for seeing colleagues not simply \nas politicians, but as partners who have ``toiled, and wrought, and \nthought with me.'' Each,\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\nin his own way, was distinctive; and each, in his own way, will be \nsorely missed.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  I want to first recognize Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who \nhas been a colleague of mine in this body for 12 years. During that \ntime he rose to No. 3 in the Republican leadership, as chairman of the \nSenate Republican Conference, and made a name for himself as a young \nand energetic conservative.\n  Rick Santorum is the son of an Italian immigrant who earned a law \ndegree and an MBA and won election to the House of Representatives at \nthe tender age of 32. After two terms in the House he won his first \nSenate election in 1994, as well as reelection in 2000. Senator \nSantorum quickly established himself as one of the faces of his party, \na testament to his strong principles and his communications skill.\n  Throughout his legislative career, Senator Santorum has been \nespecially strong on anti-poverty measures. He served as a floor \nmanager for welfare reform in the mid-1990s. In the Senate, he worked \nfor African debt relief and funding for the fight against AIDS, often \ncollaborating closely with his colleagues across the aisle. His efforts \nmoved Bono to declare him ``a defender of the most vulnerable.''\n  I was especially pleased to work with Senator Santorum on the \nCombating Autism Act. When nearly 1 in every 166 children born today \nwill be diagnosed with this developmental disorder by the time they \nreach school age, government action is more necessary than ever. \nSenator Santorum recognized that, and he helped me work for a bill \nthat, in the final version, would authorize $945 million for autism \nresearch, screening, education, and services--double the current level \nof funding. On poverty, AIDS, autism, and many similar issues, Rick \nSantorum has been a dependable ally.\n  Over his 12 years in the Senate, Rick Santorum dedicated himself to a \nphilosophy he described as ``healthy families, freedom of faith, a \nvibrant civil society, a proper understanding of the individual, and a \nfocused government to achieve noble purposes.''\n  Senator Santorum and I may not have always seen eye-to-eye, but no \none ever questioned his commitment to principle. I wish him, his wife \nKaren, and their six children all the best.\n\n\n                              Mike DeWine\n\n  I also want to say farewell to Senator Mike DeWine. Senator DeWine, a \nformer prosecutor, has had a distinguished career in Ohio politics. He \nrepresented his district for four terms in the House of \nRepresentatives, and he served as Ohio's Lieutenant Governor for 4 \nyears, beginning in 1991. Mike DeWine was elected to the Senate as part \nof the famous Republican class of 1994 and served for a total of 12 \nyears. I have had few more valuable partners on the other side of the \naisle.\n  Senator DeWine and I have been strong opponents of underage drinking, \na social malady that, in the last year for which we have data, led \ndirectly to 3,500 deaths, 2 million injuries, and 1,200 babies born \nwith fetal alcohol syndrome, not to mention $53 billion in social \ncosts. The STOP Underage Drinking Act, which I cosponsored with Senator \nDeWine, would fund a comprehensive Federal campaign of research, \nprevention grants, and a media messages aimed to keep children and \nyoung adults alcohol-free. I am proud to stand with Senator DeWine on \nsuch a critically important issue.\n  And I am just as proud to have his support on a whole slew of health \ninitiatives, especially for infants and children. Because States' \nvariable screening standards leave many newborns at risk for treatable \ndisorders, we have worked together to standardize screening across the \nNation so that all newborns have an equal promise of health, no matter \nwhere they are born. Senator DeWine and I have also worked together for \nsafer pediatric medical devices. But above all, Senator DeWine worked \nwith me to secure passage of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. \nThat legislation provides incentives for the drug industry that have \ndramatically increased the number of drugs tested and labeled for \nchildren; as a result, more than a hundred drug labels have been \nchanged to incorporate new pediatric information.\n  It has been a pleasure to serve and work with Senator DeWine. I have \nalways admired his ability to put principle before party, and I am \nthankful for all of his help, and most importantly, for his friendship. \nI wish him and his wife Frances much happiness in the future.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Jim Talent. Senator Talent has \nbeen a lifelong resident of St. Louis; and even when he was attending \nWashington University in his hometown, his outstanding intellect was on \ndisplay as he was named the most outstanding undergraduate in political \nscience. It was a sign of success to come. Jim Talent was elected to \nthe U.S. House in 1992 and served a total of 12 years in Congress, the \nlast 4 representing Missouri in the Senate.\n  I was especially proud to work with Senator Talent on legislation of \nthe utmost moral importance: a bill that would establish new offices at \nthe Department of Justice and FBI to investigate and prosecute Civil \nRights-era murders. This legislation would help ensure that those who \ntook the lives of civil rights workers, and have thus far escaped \njustice, never have another peaceful night of sleep. Senator Talent \nsaid it eloquently: ``We want the murderers and their accomplices who \nare still living to know there's an entire section of the Department of \nJustice that is going after them. We need to unearth the truth and do \njustice because there can not be healing without the truth.''\n  Senator Talent was also known for his work for renewable energy, his \nopposition to predatory lending, and his solid social conservatism. And \nthough we didn't always agree, I am sure everyone who served with him \nhas respected his intellect and his outspokenness. May he and his wife \nBrenda have many more years of happiness.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Next, I would like to send my best wishes to Senator Lincoln Chafee. \nSenator Chafee and I have a fair bit in common: we are both lifelong \nNew Englanders, and we both had Senators for fathers. After completing \nhis undergraduate studies at Brown University, and while many of his \ncolleagues were busy studying law or political science, Lincoln Chafee \nstudied horseshoeing. I imagine he is the only modern Senator to have \nworked as a professional farrier for 7 years. And while Senator Chafee \neventually took up the family business and went into politics, he has \nalways retained the humility and good humor that so often come to those \nwho spend time working with their hands.\n  Senator Chafee was a popular mayor of Warwick, RI, and on the death \nof his father, Senator John Chafee, was appointed to fill out the \nremainder of the term. He was elected in his own right in 2000, and has \nserved a total of 7 years in the upper house, cementing a reputation as \nan independent thinker and one of his State's most popular politicians.\n  I especially enjoyed serving alongside Senator Chafee on the Foreign \nRelations Committee. He was a welcome travel partner. On trips to Latin \nAmerica, it was always reassuring to have a familiar New England accent \nat my side. On a more serious note, I have come to respect Senator \nChafee's courage and principle, especially on the matter of John \nBolton's nomination as United Nations Ambassador. Senator Chafee spoke \nout in favor of competent diplomatic representation at the UN. Because \nof his efforts, we are closer to the day when our representative at the \nworld body will work to win respect from the world, not alienation.\n  On that issue and many others, Senator Chafee was never afraid to put \nhis beliefs ahead of party pressure. He has voted to support stem cell \nresearch and a responsible exit strategy in Iraq; and his strong \nenvironmental record, including opposition to oil drilling in the \nAlaska National Wildlife Reserve, has earned him the endorsement of \nprominent conservationist groups.\n  We will miss his independent mind and his true Yankee spirit. I wish \nall the best to Senator Chafee and his wife, Stephanie.\n\n\n                              Conrad Burns\n\n  I would also like to bid farewell to outgoing Senator Conrad Burns of \nMontana. Conrad Burns is the longest serving Senator in the history of \nhis State, and he has long been known for his plainspoken and blunt \nstyle. Conrad Burns served as a Marine in Japan and Korea, and back \nhome he made a name for himself as a livestock\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\nspecialist, auctioneer, and radio agricultural reporter. He proved \nhimself a canny businessman, as one radio program grew into a network \nof 31 radio stations and six television stations.\n  A passion for local politics led him to win a seat on the Yellowstone \nCounty Commission. When he first ran for the Senate in 1988, Mr. Burns \nwas still a relative political novice; but he was known throughout the \nState of Montana for his successful business ventures, and he won \nelection over an incumbent. Senator Burns was reelected in 1994 and \n2000.\n  Over 18 years in this body, Senator Burns built up a record as an \ninfluential committee member, sitting on Appropriations and chairing a \nSubcommittee on Communications, as well as another on the Interior, \nwith jurisdiction over the entire National Parks Service. Senator Burns \nhas taken pride in securing resources for his State, as well as in \nopening up the promise of advanced telecommunications for all. He \nworked with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon to pass the CAN SPAM Act, which \ncombats unsolicited e-mail. Senator Burns has also worked for Internet \nderegulation and broadband access in rural and areas, earning him \npraise as ``one of the fathers of the modern Internet.'' That is quite \nan achievement for a onetime cattle auctioneer.\n  Now Senator Burns is returning to his home State of Montana, and I \nhope he and his wife Phyllis have many years of happiness there.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Mark Dayton of Minnesota. \nSenator Dayton's talents have long been apparent, whether graduating \ncum laude from Yale University, starting in goal for the college hockey \nteam, or spending time as a teacher on the Lower East Side of New York \nCity. Senator Dayton has long been involved in public service and \nMinnesota politics, serving on Walter Mondale's Senate staff in the \n1970s and working in the 1980s and 1990s for economic development in \nhis home State. Senator Dayton was elected state auditor in 1990, \nserving a 4-year term fighting the misuse and theft of public funds. In \n2000, he once again entered State politics, defeating an incumbent to \nwin a term in the Senate.\n  Mark Dayton took many principled stands during his time in the \nSenate, from his opposition to the Iraq War resolution to his work to \nfully fund special education. Senator Dayton was also known for his \nengagement with the needs of his Minnesota constituents. He won $3 \nmillion for a Minnesota National Guard program to provide soldiers with \npostcombat counseling and support, worked to hire 148 additional patrol \nagents to secure the United States-Canada border, and even donated his \nSenate salary to pay for bus trips to Canada so seniors could buy \ncheaper prescription drugs.\n  Senator Dayton chose to retire after serving out his term, but he \ndeclared that ``everything I've worked for, and everything I believe \nin, depends upon this Senate seat remaining in the Democratic caucus in \n2007.'' Senator Dayton's wish came true when Amy Klobuchar won an \nelection to fill his seat; and I trust she will continue in Mark \nDayton's tradition of capable and hard-working representation for the \npeople of Minnesota. Senator Dayton is returning to private life in his \nhome state, and I wish him all the best.\n\n\n                              George Allen\n\n  Next, I would like to bid farewell to Virginia's George Allen. As we \nall know, Senator Allen is the son of the great football coach, George \nH. Allen. As a boy and young man, Senator Allen lived all over America, \nwherever his father's career took the family. But in the end, Senator \nAllen fell in love with the State of Virginia, especially its wealth of \nhistory. ``I was going to go into a partnership with someone in \nCharlottesville in an old building built in 1814,'' he said, describing \nhis first law practice. ``Mr. Jefferson played the fiddle there, \nallegedly . . . I lived in it while renovating. I started my law \npractice and then bought a log house out in the country, in the woods. \nCharlottesville is where I wanted to take my stand.''\n  In 1982, George Allen won election to the Virginia House of \nDelegates--and Thomas Jefferson's old seat. In 1991, he was elected to \na term in the House of Representatives, and 2 years later, became \nGovernor of Virginia, a post in which he distinguished himself as an \nenergetic executive. As Governor, George Allen fought violent crime, \nreformed his State's welfare system, and signed the standards of \nlearning education reform bill, which helped inspire No Child Left \nBehind. In 2000, he was elected to the Senate, where he served on \ncommittees including Commerce and Foreign Relations.\n  In the Senate, George Allen made a name for himself on technology \nissues, keeping the Internet free of taxation, securing nanotechnology \nfunding, and providing high-tech grants to historically black colleges. \nIt's also been a pleasure to work with Senator Allen for several years \non our own legislation to enhance America's competitiveness in the \nfield of aviation by investing in aeronautics research and a new \ngeneration of aerospace scientists. In addition to his technology \ninterests, Senator Allen was also a strong advocate of balanced \nbudgets.\n  George Allen is leaving the Senate, but we will remember him for his \naffable demeanor and love of history. He was fond of quoting Thomas \nJefferson's 1801 Inaugural Address: ``The sum of good government is a \nwise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one \nanother but otherwise leave them free to regulate their own pursuits of \nindustry.'' George Allen did his best to live and work by those \nprinciples, and as he returns to private life, I wish happiness to him, \nhis wife Anne, and their three children.\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  Last but not least--the departing majority leader, Bill Frist of \nTennessee. His leadership position has only been the cap on a lifetime \nof accomplishment. Bill Frist is a leading transplant surgeon, who has \nperformed more than 150 heart or lung transplants, as well as a highly \nsuccessful medical businessman. The same drive that fueled him in \npolitics, medicine, and business also inspired him to earn his pilot's \nlicense and complete seven marathons. Senator Frist will be remembered \nas a competent majority leader, not to mention as the first medical \ndoctor elected to the Senate since 1928.\n  After pursuing his medical career for nearly two decades, Bill Frist \nestablished himself in Tennessee politics and was elected to the Senate \nin 1994 and was reelected in 2000 with the highest vote total for any \nstatewide election in his State's history. As the Senate's only medical \ndoctor at the time, he attended to the victims of the 1998 Capitol \nshooting, and he also served as a respected spokesman on anthrax and \nbioterrorism following the terrorist attacks of 2001.\n  Besides leading the Senate since 2003, Bill Frist found recognition \nfor his outspoken positions on Medicare reform, judicial nominations, \nand social issues. He also worked to establish a nuanced position on \nstem cell research. Though we didn't always see eye-to-eye, we were \nable to work together on important legislation, including bills on \nobesity prevention and food allergies. And I think I can speak for all \nof my colleagues when I thank him for his hard work in running the \nSenate for the past 3 years--or, as a predecessor put it, ``herding \ncats.''\n  Bill Frist is returning to his philanthropic work and his medical \npractice, where I am sure he will find his success undiminished and his \nskill undulled. I wish him, his wife Karyn, and their three sons many \nhappy years.\n\n\n                      Senators Sarbanes and Dayton\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the great Senator Daniel Webster once \nremarked that the Senate is a place:\n\n       of equals of men of individual honor . . . and personal \n     character.\n\n  He was right, and we can see what he was talking about in the fine \nmen the Senate is losing to retirement at the end of this Congress: \nSenator Frist, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Dayton.\n  On previous occasions, I have talked about how much I appreciated \nserving with Senators Frist and Jeffords. Today, I would like to say a \nfew more words about Senators Sarbanes and Dayton.\n  Paul Sarbanes is a man I have always admired. We share a similar \nbackground.\n  I grew up in a small Nevada town. My parents weren't well connected \nor highly educated. But as we see in my life--and Paul Sarbanes's \nlife--in America your background does not matter.\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\n  Paul is the son of Greek immigrants. His parents didn't have a formal \neducation, but they worked hard. They owned a restaurant--the Mayflower \nGrill on Main Street in Salisbury, MD.\n  Paul worked hard too, and as a result, he has lived the American \ndream. This son of Greek immigrants is the graduate of some of the \nworld's leading educational institutions, and for the last 30 years, he \nhas been a leading voice in the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  Paul received an academic and athletic scholarship to Princeton \nUniversity, from which he graduated in 1954. After graduation from \nPrinceton, he received the Rhodes Scholarship, which sent him to \nOxford, England, until 1957. When Paul came back to the States, he went \nto Harvard to earn his Law Degree.\n  In 1970, Paul won his first Federal election--to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. In 1976, he came to the Senate.\n  During the next 30 years, he made a tremendous mark on our country.\n  Paul Sarbanes has been an excellent Senator, but he has always \nexcelled when the country needed him the most--during times of crisis.\n  During Watergate, he was a leading voice for reform in the House. \nDuring Iran-Contra, he led the fight for the truth in the Senate. And \nmore recently, in the wake of the Enron accounting scandals, he was \nlargely responsible for reforms which restored the people's confidence \nin corporate America.\n  During his 30 years in the Senate, Paul Sarbanes has cast over 11,000 \nvotes. Not all of them were as monumental as his work on Watergate, \nIran-Contra and Enron, but every one of them was cast with the people \nof Maryland, and the people of the United States in mind.\n  Mr. President, Mark Dayton has served in the Senate just one-fifth of \nthe time Paul Sarbanes served here. But he, too, has made his mark. \nHe's been a fine public servant, and an even better friend.\n  Of course, Senator Dayton's service has always been closely \nintertwined with that of our dear departed collegue Paul Wellstone. \nPaul was a legend in our country, but Mark has kept his legacy alive \nthese last 4 years by fighting for the working people of Minnesota.\n  Mark was born in Minnesota in 1947. He graduated from Yale University \nin 1969, where he majored in psychology and played varsity hockey. Mark \nhad many options coming out of college, but he chose to become a \nteacher at a public school on New York City's lower east side.\n  It was an unselfish choice, and it would not be the last time Mark \nchose a path in life that put the public's interest ahead of his own \nself-interest.\n  In 1957, after his years of teaching, Mark came to Washington, where \nhe worked on the staff of then-Senator Walter Mondale. When Mondale was \nselected the running mate of Jimmy Carter in 1976, Mark was there to \nserve.\n  In 1990--following jobs in the Minnesota State government and the \nprivate sector--Mark ran for Minnesota State auditor and won. In 2000, \nhe came to the Senate, where he has served ever since.\n  Mark is known here as a strong advocate for the people of Minnesota. \nHe has used his Senate salary to send busloads of seniors to Canada for \nprescription drugs. He has used his power in the Senate to help low-\nincome constituents get the oil they need to heat their homes. And he \nhas created a ``Healthcare Help Line,'' which is available to \nMinnesotans who have problems with their health insurers.\n  Mr. President, Mark Dayton, like Paul Sarbanes, like Jim Jeffords, \nlike Bill Frist, will be missed.\n  The Senate--and our country--are better off because of their service.\n\n\n                              Mike De Wine\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as this session draws to a close, I \nmust take this opportunity to make a few comments on the outstanding \nrecord left behind by our colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine.\n  I have worked closely with Senator DeWine ever since he came to the \nSenate. I sit with him on three committees: the Select Committee on \nIntelligence; the Judiciary Committee, where he chaired the Antitrust \nSubcommittee; and on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, where he chairs the Retirement Security and Aging \nSubcommittee.\n  I consider Mike to be a Senator's Senator--he is a man who truly \nrepresents his constituents, who studies the issues, works hard, and \ndoes his very, very best to do what is right. His departure from the \nSenate is a great loss to this body and a great loss to Ohio.\n  The DeWine legacy is considerable.\n  One of the major focuses of his work, which I admire greatly, is the \nprotection of children. Senator DeWine has sponsored numerous pieces of \nlegislation aimed at protecting children and enabling prosecution of \nthose who perpetrate acts against children. These include the \nProtecting Children Against Crime Act of 2003, which became law as part \nof the PROTECT Act, the National Child Protection Amendments Act of \n2000, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999, and the \nProtection Against Sexual Predators Act of 1998. It is significant to \nnote that Senator DeWine is a founding member and cochair of the Senate \nCaucus on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children.\n  The Senator's work to protect children extends beyond legal issues. \nHe is the author and true leader in the Senate of legislation to \nprotect children from the horrors of tobacco abuse by giving the Food \nand Drug Administration the authority to regulate it. He has also taken \na leadership role in efforts to stop underage teen drinking by \nsponsoring the Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act. The \nSTOP Act has a good chance of becoming law this year.\n  But the centerpiece of Mike DeWine's prochild agenda is his work to \nincentivize pharmaceutical company testing of drugs used on children. \nMike DeWine showed this whole body the safety risks children face when \nthey take prescription medications never studied in the pediatric \npopulation. I can just hear Mike saying now, ``Children are not little \nadults.'' And he is right.\n  He worked across the aisle and across the Capitol to get the \nPediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 enacted. This was no easy task. \nIt took grit and determination. He fought big PhRMA. He did it for the \nkids. And he won. I am only sorry he will not be here next year as we \nwork to reauthorize it.\n  In his years as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nDeWine emerged as a leader in the area of antitrust law and competition \npolicy. Both as the chairman and the ranking Republican member of the \nAntitrust Subcommittee, Mike has played an invaluable role in each \nsignificant legislative change to the antitrust laws enacted in the \npast decade.\n  In addition to his legislative achievements in antitrust law, Senator \nDeWine has become known for the subcommittee's active oversight of the \nantitrust enforcement activities of the Department of Justice and \nFederal Trade Commission. During the subcommittee's consideration of \nnumerous individual mergers, his thoughtful analysis and evenhanded \napproach earned him considerable respect in the antitrust community as \na tough, but eminently fair, advocate of both consumer interests and \nstrong competition.\n  Earlier this year at the American Antitrust Institute's annual \nconference, where he and Senator Kohl received an achievement award for \ntheir many contributions to antitrust law, Senator DeWine commented \nthat ``[i]t's always difficult to find that fine line between \naggressive, healthy competition and destructive or anticompetitive \nbehavior, but it's our job on the Antitrust Subcommittee to keep \ntrying, and to promote the type of competition that helps everyone.''\n  From my perspective, Senator DeWine not only tried but succeeded \nadmirably in drawing this very difficult line in a careful and \nappropriately balanced way. His expertise, institutional knowledge, and \nthoughtful analysis will be sorely missed.\n  Also of note in discussing Senator DeWine's work on the Judiciary \nCommittee are his anticrime efforts. Mike has been a real leader on \nissues such as the 1998 law, the Crime Identification Technology Act, \nwhich increased funding for State and local law enforcement by $1.25 \nbillion. His work in anticrime\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\ntechnology continued in 2004, when the Senate adopted his amendment to \nthe intelligence reform bill that would upgrade the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's computer networks. That bill was signed into law on \nDecember 17, 2004.\n  Mike has either sponsored or cosponsored a number of bills to help \nlaw enforcement protect Ohio communities, including the local law \nenforcement block grant program, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety \nAct, the Rape Kits and DNA Evidence Backlog Elimination Act of 2003, \nand the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004.\n  Mike DeWine's work to protect Ohioans extended into the compelling \nfield of mental illness treatment as well. In fact, Senator DeWine is \nknown throughout the country for his work related to the treatment of \nmental health in the criminal justice system, including bills such as \nthe Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act and \nAmerica's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project.\n  Another DeWine contribution is the Poison Control Center Enhancement \nand Awareness Act, a significant contribution to public health which \nestablished a national toll-free poison control hotline and provided \nsubstantial assistance to local poison control centers.\n  Finally and more recently, Senator DeWine authored a bill to protect \nchildren's eyes by restricting their access to potentially damaging \ncosmetic contact lenses.\n  Our new leader, Senator McConnell, said this of Senator DeWine, and I \ncould not have said it better:\n\n       I have never observed a more skillful legislator than he \n     during my time in the Senate . . . You know he is a \n     formidable force who, when he has made up his mind about an \n     issue, never lets go. Many bills that have cleared the Senate \n     in the ten years the Senator from Ohio has been here have the \n     fingerprints of Mike DeWine. He is truly an extraordinary \n     legislator.\n\n  I echo those sentiments.\n  Mike DeWine has been an outstanding Member of our body, a good friend \nto me, and a superb representative for his constituents. He and his \nstaff work hard and their work has yielded incredible benefits for the \nAmerican people. It is with great pride that I commend his achievements \nto this body, and I thank Mike for all he has done to make the U.S. \nSenate a more effective and accomplished body. I will miss him, as a \nlegislator, as a colleague, and as a friend.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for the opportunity to take a few \nmoments to recognize the service and devotion to the U.S. Senate by my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island.\n  A true Rhode Islander, Lincoln Chafee was born in Providence, \nattended a Warwick public school, and earned a degree from Brown \nUniversity, where he captained the wrestling team. As an avid horse \nenthusiast, he attended the horseshoeing school at Montana State \nUniversity and worked as a blacksmith at harness racetracks in the \nUnited States and Canada, but only a handful of years slipped by before \nhe returned to his home in Rhode Island.\n  Lincoln then entered politics in 1985 as a delegate to the Rhode \nIsland Constitutional Convention. A year later he was elected to the \nfirst of two successive terms on the Warwick City Council. In November \n1992, Lincoln became the first Republican elected mayor of Warwick in \n32 years--and, with his positive vision, he so won over the hearts and \nminds of voters that he was reelected for another three terms in a \nreliably Democratic city. He held the mayoral post until appointed by \nGovernor Lincoln Almond in November 1999 to fill the unexpired Senate \nterm of his late father, John Chafee. In November 2000, he was \noverwhelmingly elected to the U.S. Senate.\n  As I, Lincoln has a great interest in policy that affects the health \nof our Nation's people, and I am proud to have had the honor of working \nwith him on a number of initiatives that made Americans healthier.\n  I admire Lincoln for taking a stand on stem cell research. He has \nsupported important legislation and joined a bipartisan group of \ncolleagues in calling on President Bush to expand the Federal policy on \nembryonic stem cell research. Senator Chafee and I share similar views \non this issue: he is opposed to any cloning with the intention of \ncreating a human life but strongly supports legislation that would \nallow stem cell researchers to use excess embryos which were created \nfor in vitro fertilization purposes and would otherwise be discarded. I \nrespect and appreciate his courage to stand up for his convictions in \nthe face of such a controversial issue.\n  Lincoln has been a champion for breast cancer research since his \narrival in the Senate in 1999. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof his Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act, which would make \nFederal grants available for the development and operation of eight \nnational centers that would conduct research on how environmental \nfactors may contribute to the causes of breast cancer. In recognition \nof his outstanding leadership in this arena, Lincoln has been honored \nby the National Breast Cancer Coalition and also presented with the \nAvon Foundation Pink Ribbon Crusader Award.\n  Senator Chafee has been a leader in the fight to reauthorize and \nmaintain adequate funding for the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--also called CHIP. I worked very closely with his father to \nwrite that law in 1997. I recognize that Lincoln is also dedicated to \nthe goal of this program, which is to provide health insurance to low-\nincome, uninsured children, and I thank him for his diligent efforts. \nWe have worked tirelessly to ensure that funding continues to make the \nprogram available for these children.\n  Senator Lincoln Chafee is a great man, a loyal Rhode Islander, and a \ngreat American. I thank and commend him for all his selfless work. His \ncontributions have made his State and the whole country significantly \nbetter than before his arrival in Washington. We will all miss his \npresence here in the U.S. Senate, but I doubt we have seen the last of \nLincoln Chafee in the way of public service. I wish him and his family \nhealth, happiness, and the best of luck in all future endeavors.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Rick Santorum, who will soon be ending a \nvery distinguished and impressive career in the U.S. Congress.\n  In my 30 years of service in the U.S. Senate, I have seen a lot of \nSenators come and go. However, it is hard to think of anyone who has \nhad more energy, more enthusiasm, and who, in such a short period of \ntime, has had a greater impact on many important issues affecting our \nfamilies and our society, than has the junior Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  After receiving advanced degrees in business and law, Rick was \nelected to the House of Representatives in 1990 at the age of 32. He \nserved two terms in that body before running for the Senate, he \ndistinguished himself as part of the so-called Gang of 7 that helped \nuncover the House banking scandal and called for reforms of the House.\n  The same year he was first elected to Congress, Rick was married to \nhis wife Karen, and they started their family that now includes six \nchildren. As the father of six myself, I know firsthand the challenges \nand joys that come from having a large family. Rick has done such a \nmarvelous job balancing home life with public life with its demanding \nschedule and its never-ending conflicts.\n  After winning election to the Senate in 1994, Rick Santorum \nimmediately began exerting leadership on issues in several different \nlegislative areas but notably in the areas of health, agriculture, and \nwelfare reform. Upon winning reelection to his second term in the \nSenate, his GOP colleagues validated his natural leadership by choosing \nRick to chair the Senate Republican Conference.\n  Although Senator Santorum is well known for his strong defense of \nmany conservative positions and his articulate voice on many issues \naffecting the sanctity of the family, it would be wrong to characterize \nhim as a strict partisan. I have seen many examples where Rick has \nreached across the aisle to his Democratic colleagues and found common \nground on issues of importance to all Americans.\n  One notable example of this is on an issue that is also very \nimportant to me--promoting charitable initiatives. Several years ago, \nSenator Santorum\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\nteamed up with another of our most distinguished and thoughtful \ncolleagues, Senator Joe Lieberman, to introduce the Charity, Aid, \nRecovery, and Empowerment, CARE, Act. The CARE Act was designed to \naddress many problems faced by the charitable sector of our Nation and \nto help them to better achieve their goals of lifting up the \nimpoverished among us and of helping all of us better assist our fellow \nman in times of need.\n  As an original cosponsor of the CARE Act, I saw up close the tireless \ndedication and unending efforts that Rick Santorum put into promoting \nthis legislation, not just in the Senate but with the White House. \nWhile this very ambitious legislation has not entirely been enacted, \nRick can take a great deal of justifiable pride in the fact that great \nstrides have been made in achieving the goals of the CARE Act. \nMoreover, he can take great satisfaction in knowing that his colleagues \nin the Senate and the House, policymakers in the executive branch, \nthose who serve so diligently in the charitable community, and indeed \nconcerned Americans from all walks of life, are much more aware of the \naccomplishments and the needs of the charitable sector because of the \nefforts of Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. President, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania is going to be \nlong remembered in this body, and he will be sorely missed. He will be \nremembered and missed for his intelligence, his articulate voice, his \ncourage, his energy, and his leadership. I salute Rick as a fine public \nservant as he enters the next stage of his life, and I thank him for \nhis dedication and for his hard work. I am sure I am joined by all of \nour colleagues as we wish Rick and his family the very best in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the accomplishments of \nSenator Jim Talent from the great State of Missouri. I feel privileged \nto have worked with Jim on different pieces of legislation, and I \ngreatly admire his dedication to his constituents and respect his many \naccomplishments during his time in public office.\n  Jim's official, political career started when he was only 28 years \nold, after he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives. He \nwent on to serve for 8 years in that position, and he worked diligently \nto pass meaningful legislation which benefited the people of Missouri.\n  In 1992, Jim was elected to the House of Representatives from \nMissouri's second district. Jim wasted no time in tackling important \nissues and introduced the Real Welfare Reform Act of 1994. Much of the \nideas from this legislation were phased into the Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, which I joined Jim in \nvoting for. This historic piece of bipartisan legislation has had a \nprofound positive impact and dramatically changed the way that this \ncountry helps its neediest citizens. According to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, welfare caseloads in this country have \ndeclined 58 percent since the enactment of this legislation. These \nresults show that, even as a new Senator, Jim had tremendous foresight \nin crafting meaningful ideas which addressed a serious problem in this \ncountry.\n  Jim also served on many important committees during his time in the \nHouse, including the Armed Services Committee, the Small Business \nCommittee, and the Education and Workforce Committee. During his time \non these committees, Jim continued to utilize his tremendous work ethic \nin reviewing and drafting important initiatives which benefited \nAmerican citizens. In addition, Jim worked endlessly as an advocate for \nsmall business, which he recognized as the financial backbone of our \ncountry.\n  In November of 2002, Jim began the next phase of his service after \nbeing elected to serve as Senator for his State of Missouri. Being born \nand raised in Missouri, Jim had a great knowledge base of the State and \nthus the background to recognize important issues which affected his \nconstituents and the State as a whole.\n  I can truthfully say there has been no Senator in the history of this \nbody who has worked harder to represent the history of his State than \nJim Talent.\n  Jim served on four diverse Senate committees: Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry; Energy and Natural Resources; Aging; and the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  During this Congress, Jim and I worked together on the joint \nresolution which proposed an amendment to the Constitution authorizing \nCongress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United \nStates. Jim and I were in complete agreement on this subject, and I \ngreatly respected his steadfast support of this proposed legislation. \nDuring debate of this topic, Jim continually provided insightful \ncommentary that showed his heartfelt support of a very important topic. \nJim summed up his feelings with the following sentiment: ``The flag is \nthe unifying symbol of our Republic. It represents that common history \nand heritage which holds America together notwithstanding religious, \ncultural, or political differences. Physical and public desecration of \nthe flag degrades those values and coarsens America far more than any \nspeech or political dissent possibly could.'' We were both sorry to see \nthe amendment narrowly miss passage, but I will always admire and \nrespect Jim's unwavering support on this important topic.\n  A final item I would like to draw attention to is the Combat Meth Act \nthat Jim drafted along with Senator Feinstein. Recognizing the \ndisastrous effects that have been wrought on American neighborhoods and \nfamilies due to this horrible drug, Senators Talent and Feinstein wrote \nthis new law aimed at making the ingredients used to cook meth less \navailable to law breakers. While we didn't always agree on the approach \nto this effort, we were united in efforts to stop the insidious damage \ninflicted by this drug. I applaud Jim's efforts in drafting an \nincredibly important law that we all hope will have a significant \nimpact on decreasing the amount of toxic meth labs in our communities.\n  As Jim embarks on the next phase of his career, I wish him luck in \nall of his future endeavors. I also want to extend my congratulations \nand appreciation for Jim's legislative achievements during his time in \nCongress. I am confident that his character and attributes will \ncontinue to steer him toward a life of accomplishment and benefit to \nthose around him.\n\n\n                              Jim Jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to extend my best wishes to my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Jim Jeffords.\n  For the last 18 years, I have been privileged to serve with Jim here \nin the United States Senate. When he first came to the Senate in 1989, \nhe was assigned to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. At \nthe time, I was the ranking minority member of that committee and \nworked closely with Jim. In fact, when Jim later became chairman of the \ncommittee, he changed the name to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions, better known today as the Senate HELP Committee. He \ndid that because he felt that the purpose of the committee was to help \npeople. Later, he and I also served together as members of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  Jim has an undergraduate degree from Yale University and graduated \nfrom Harvard University Law School. He served in the United States Navy \nfor 3 years and was in the Reserves until 1990 when he retired as a \ncaptain.\n  He started his career in politics in 1966 when he was elected to the \nVermont State Senate. In 1968, he became the attorney general for the \nState of Vermont. In 1974, he was elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives where he tells a very interesting story about the day \nthat he was sworn in as a Member of the House. As Jim tells it, 1974 \nwas not a good year to be a Republican candidate--for those who do not \nremember, it was the year that President Richard Nixon resigned due to \nthe Watergate scandal. The 1974 freshman class had 92 new Members of \nwhich only 17 were Republicans--two of them were our Senate colleagues, \nChuck Grassley and Jim Jeffords. At the time, Chuck was on crutches and \nJim was in a neck brace. As the two walked down the aisle, Jim heard \none of the Democrat Members say, ``There are two we almost got.'' Well, \nall I can say is, thank goodness the Democrats didn't get Chuck and \nJim. The two of them have been an integral part of both the House and \nthe Senate.\n  Senator Jeffords has always been known for his self deprecating sense \nof humor. I will never forget his story\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\nabout being interviewed by a reporter with Congresswoman Millicent \nFenwick, who, as many know, was a very elegant woman from New Jersey, \non their first impressions of what it was like to live in Washington. \nCongresswoman Fenwick talked about her lovely view of the city from \nacross the river. When asked what it was like for him to be in \nWashington, Jim replied that he lived in a Winnebago in the parking lot \nof a Holiday Inn and he had a view of the hotel dumpster. Quite \nhonestly, Jim is probably one of the most humble and down to earth \npeople I have met in the Senate.\n  Jim is someone who fought hard for increased education funding, \nespecially for special needs children. He is also very passionate about \nenvironmental issues. But in my opinion, one of Jim's most significant \nachievements was the difference he made on health care issues. Jim was \ncommitted to providing a prescription drug benefit to Medicare \nbeneficiaries and was actively involved in writing the Tripartisan \nMedicare prescription drug bill which was considered on the floor of \nthe Senate in 2002. Jim, Chuck Grassley, former Senator John Breaux, \nSenator Olympia Snowe, and I all got together and wrote a bill that \nprovided a drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. It was the \nfoundation of the Medicare prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D, \nwhich was included in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Jim \nprovided valuable input and did his best to look out for what was in \nthe best interest of senior citizens and the disabled. So far, 38 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the Medicare Part D \nProgram.\n  Before I close, I want to share an insightful story about Jim that is \nindicative of the way he has led his life. When Jim interviewed Paul \nHarrington to be the HELP Committee's Health Policy director, it was at \nhis home in Shrewsbury, VT. Shrewsbury is a very rural town in a very \nrural State and that is best typified by the Brown Covered Bridge. Jim \nconducted the job interview in his garage where he had a large pile of \nbent nails on his work bench. While he discussed the possibility of \nPaul joining his staff, they each began straightening out the used \nnails. At the end of the conversation they had created quite a large \npile of nails that were useful again. Paul shared this experience with \nmany of his friends and colleagues when he left the Senate because he \nfelt that the circumstances of the job interview were indicative of \nJim's philosophy and his approach to problem solving. I couldn't agree \nmore. There's a practical side to Jim's nature that seeks to adapt old \nsolutions to solving new problems. Using the analogy of the nails, Jim \nhas always been able to take up used ideas from the past and put them \nto good use in new circumstances by reshaping them to fit the new needs \nof today.\n  I want everyone to know that I consider Jim to be one of my dear \nfriends in the Senate, and while I was disappointed when he decided to \nbecome an Independent, I respected his decision. And so did former \nSenate majority leader Bob Dole, who is a close friend of Jim's. In \nfact, on the first year anniversary of Jim's big decision, Bob sent Jim \na pineapple upside down cake. He told Jim that he looked all over for a \ncake to send him and came to the conclusion that a pineapple upside \ndown cake described Jim the best. While that may be true, let me say \nthat Jim is a man who has the best of intentions and always does what \nhe believes is in the best interest of his constituents.\n  While serving in the Senate, Jim has always been an independent force \nand that is one of the main reasons that I respect him so much. Policy \nalways came before politics, something very rare in Washington these \ndays. He has a great love for the institution. He is passionate about \nissues he cares about and it showed when he offered an amendment in \ncommittee or spoke on the Senate floor.\n  Jim has dedicated his life to public service and the great people of \nVermont are very fortunate to have had him representing them in both \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate. He is a great legislator \nand he will be missed by all of us. I wish Jim Jeffords all the best in \nthe years ahead.\n\n\n                              Conrad Burns\n\n  Mr. President, I want to pay special tribute to my good friend and \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Conrad Burns, known by his staff, \nMontanans, and myself as just Conrad. It is hard for me to imagine a \nmore down-to-earth Member of Congress than Conrad. His straight-\nshooting analysis of the issues and his humorous outlook on life made \nlife around the Senate more enjoyable.\n  Utahns in particular owe a debt of gratitude to Senator Burns. As \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and \nRelated Agencies, Senator Burns worked with our delegation to meet many \nof Utah's needs.\n  First and foremost, he oversaw a dramatic increase in funding for the \nPayments-in-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILT) Program, which provides funding for \nschools, roads, and public safety services in rural communities in Utah \nwhere the tax base is limited due to the predominance of tax-exempt \nFederal land.\n  Chairman Burns also helped me to pass legislation which expedites \nresearch and development projects on Bureau of Land Management, BLM, \nland. Senator Burns also helped provide funding for Sandy City, UT, to \nupgrade its drinking and storm water infrastructure. With this funding, \nSandy City will now be able to prevent flooding which has threatened \nthe homes of many citizens in the past.\n  Over the years, Conrad has been extremely helpful to many Utah \ncommunities. He helped provide funding to protect the Range Creek/\nRainbow Glass Ranch for conservation purposes, to improve drinking \nwater for the citizens of Centerfield, Mayfield, Park City, and Eagle \nMountain, UT, to provide for the Sand Hollow Recreation Area, and to \nincrease the reach of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail.\n  Conrad has also helped Utah and our country continue down the path of \nenergy independence and accelerate Utah oil and gas production by \nhelping to fund the Utah Oil and Gas Leasing Internet Pilot Program.\n  Allow me to share just one example of how Senator Conrad Burns is, \nand always will be, a man of the people. The highway system around the \nWashington, DC area provides for express lanes for vehicles carrying \npassengers. A regular feature of the Washington commute is lines of \npassengers hoping to be picked up by drivers who are driving their way. \nMuch of the population of the high occupancy vehicle express lanes is \nmade up of single drivers who have picked up these passengers, thus \nallowing them to use the express lands. For years, my friend Senator \nBurns would pick up these riders in his less than glamorous van. They \nwould have great conversations together along the way, and in most \ncases, the passengers would not have the slightest idea that they had \nbeen picked up and were now chatting with a U.S. Senator. And knowing \nthe junior senator from Montana, I am sure that's just the way he \nwanted it.\n  Senator Conrad Burns has been a great friend to the people of Utah \nand a great friend to me. I will miss his presence here in the Senate, \nand I wish him the greatest of success in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                              George Allen\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Senate career of my \ndistinguished colleague from the State of Virginia, the Honorable \nGeorge Allen. The contributions he has made to Congress and this \ncountry are significant, and we owe him a debt of gratitude for all \nthat he has given.\n  George has spent most of his career in public service. A few years \nafter earning his law degree, he served as a delegate in the Virginia \nAssembly before becoming a Congressman in 1991. He made a successful \nrun for Governor of Virginia and presided over 4 years of strong \neconomic growth and steady job creation. In 2001, he joined the U.S. \nSenate, and I have been honored to call him my colleague for the past 6 \nyears.\n  George has been a tireless advocate for a smaller, more efficient \nGovernment throughout his career. He helped lead the way to enactment \nof the President's tax cut package in 2001 and 2003 and has been an \narticulate defender of the progrowth tax policies that we have pursued \nover the past 6 years, including the reduction in capital gains and \ndividend taxes, the repeal of the death tax, and the reduction in the \ntax burden of our Nation's small businesses, where so many of our jobs \nare created. These were lessons he learned well from his days as a \nGovernor.\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\n  He has done more than just pay lip-service to the importance of \nkeeping taxes low: He has fought the good fight as well. He introduced \nand worked hard to ensure the passage of the Internet Tax \nNondiscrimination Act, legislation that prohibited taxes on Internet \naccess or taxation from multiple jurisdictions on goods bought over the \nInternet.\n  Over the last few years, George has achieved an almost legendary \nstatus with the technology community in this country. In 2001, George \nwas appointed to serve as chairman of the Senate High Tech Task Force \nwhere he advocated for policies to make America a leader in innovation \nfrom nanotechnology to broadband to the education of future engineers \nand scientists. So much of the technology agenda being advanced in this \ncountry today spawned from the efforts of George as the High Tech Task \nForce chairman. If you were to meet with the top executives of any \ntechnology company with a significant presence in the United States, \nthey would tell you what a wonderful advocate George Allen has been for \ntheir company and their industry. I have heard it time and again from \nhundreds of executives.\n  George also has served our party well. His success as head of the \nNational Republican Senatorial Committee during the 2004 election cycle \nis a result of the Senator's bedrock faith in his beliefs and his \nability to articulate that which he holds true.\n  So many times, politicians come to Washington with strongly held \nconvictions and a desire to do good and instead take the more expedient \npath to reelection and power. When it comes to George Allen's career, \nno one can say he ever abandoned his belief in the virtues of a small \ngovernment and lower taxes. These are the very beliefs I hold true as \nwell, and I was glad to have him on my side.\n  At its heart, politics is a battle over ideas. Our distinguished \nSenator from Virginia earned the respect of us all for the pitched \nbattles he fought to advance the cause of freedom and economic growth \nfor the United States and the world.\n  Personally, I have admired George Allen for a long time. In my \nopinion, his demeanor, his knowledge, and his drive are all exemplary \nand worthy of emulation. Every interaction I have had with George over \nthe years has done nothing but bolster my original opinion of him. He \nreminds me more of Ronald Reagan than any national politician I have \nmet. That is a high compliment for a great statesman. I would like to \ntake this time to thank my friend, George Allen, and to wish him, \nSusan, and the rest of the Allen family the very best as he leaves this \ngreat institution to take on new challenges.\n\n\n                              Mark Dayton\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as Senator Mark Dayton prepares to leave \nthis body, I would like to share with my colleagues a few thoughts \nabout his service. In September, I had the pleasure of speaking on \nSenator Dayton's behalf at a dinner paying tribute to the retiring \nSenators, and I ask that my remarks from that event be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n       On the night six years ago when Minnesota voters chose him \n     as their 33rd Senator, Mark Dayton told the cheering crowd: \n     ``No matter what your political party or personal philosophy, \n     no matter who you voted for today or even whether you voted \n     at all, I'll work for you. When, next January, I become \n     Senator Dayton, please--call me Mark. Because I'm your public \n     servant. I'll work for you.''\n       For the past six years, Mark has kept that pledge, because \n     those words were not the rhetoric of a campaign; they were a \n     reflection of Mark's deeply-held beliefs. Mark Dayton treats \n     everyone--from the wealthiest to the least fortunate--with \n     the same sense of fairness and compassion, and he carries \n     himself with a humility to which we can all aspire. Mark's \n     lack of guile has characterized his service here, where \n     political calculating is an accepted reality.\n       When Mark came to the Senate, he brought with him a broad \n     range of experience. In the private sector he had worked as a \n     public school teacher in a challenging New York City school; \n     as a counselor to runaway youth; as a chief financial officer \n     for a non-profit group; and as head of an investment group. \n     In public life, he had served as a Senate aide to Walter \n     Mondale; as head of Minnesota's Department of Energy and \n     Economic Development; and as State Auditor, among many other \n     capacities.\n       That path of service to Minnesota led to his own election \n     to the Senate. Mark and I serve together on both the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on \n     Investigations. As the ranking member on both committees, I \n     have witnessed in Mark a Senator who is passionately \n     dedicated to public service. Mark reads the long reports, he \n     attends the dry meetings, he masters the difficult material, \n     and he asks the tough questions with a disarming directness \n     and quizzical curiosity.\n       ``On the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Mark has \n     been a strong voice in our hearings examining abusive tax \n     shelters and offshore tax havens. Mark has been a leader on \n     prescription drug issues, and he even donates his Senate \n     salary to help seniors buy prescription drugs they could not \n     otherwise afford. And Mark has been a great battler on issues \n     common to our two states, including fighting on behalf of our \n     steel and mining industries and to strengthen our Northern \n     Border.\n       As part of our work on the Armed Services Committee, Mark \n     traveled with Chairman Warner and me and six other Senators \n     to Iraq, where we saw firsthand Mark's deep dedication to the \n     men and women of our Armed Forces. After allegations surfaced \n     that our troops in Iraq had been given contaminated water by \n     a contractor, it was Mark's insistence that led to an ongoing \n     investigation into the contractor's actions. And Mark has \n     been a true champion for our National Guard and Reserve \n     forces, working forcefully to ease their difficult transition \n     back to civilian life when their tours of duty finally end.\n       As Mark writes the next chapter in his own life, he can \n     return home to the people of his beloved Minnesota knowing \n     that he has served them honorably and well. Some of them will \n     probably insist on calling him ``Senator.'' But, for most, \n     this idealist with a good heart never stopped simply being \n     ``Mark.''\n\n  We shall miss Mark Dayton and wish him well as he leaves us.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Mr. President, as this session of Congress comes to a close, I want \nto take a moment to pay tribute to my friend Lincoln Chafee.\n  Following in the footsteps of his late father, John, Senator Chafee \nhas been a voice of moderation and civility in the Senate. In a time of \nincreasing partisanship, Senator Chafee has been a bridge between the \nparties and to an earlier era of a less divisive politics. He votes his \nconviction and his conscience, not just a party line.\n  Senator Chafee's legacy will be defined by his leadership on \nenvironmental protection and fiscal responsibility. On both, he has had \na forward-looking approach, grounded in common sense, for which our \ngrandchildren will be grateful.\n  Senator Chafee has been a true champion for conservation, fighting \nfor clean air, clean water, and a healthier environment. He has been \nwilling to stand up to the administration when he believes it is wrong, \nincluding opposing the administration's Energy bill, its weak \nregulations on mercury, and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. For the past several years, Senator Chafee has led an effort \nwith Senator Jeffords and me to fully fund the EPA Brownfields program, \nwhich would accelerate the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield \nsites, protecting human health, and creating jobs. Senator Chafee is a \nmember of the Senate's Smart Growth Task Force, which promotes growth \nand development that protects the environment and preserves critical \nhabitats.\n  Lincoln Chafee has also been a strong voice for fiscal discipline. He \nhas repeatedly opposed reckless tax cuts and supported pay-as-you-go \nbudget rules to bring the budget back into balance. The bipartisan \nConcord Coalition has twice recognized him for his fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Lincoln Chafee has also been an important voice on foreign affairs. \nHe took a courageous stand in 2002 as the lone Republican to vote \nagainst the Iraq war authorization, and he has served well as the \nchairman of the Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs Subcommittee of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I want to close by noting that Lincoln Chafee remains widely \nrespected and admired in Rhode Island, as well as among his colleagues \non both sides of the aisle in the Senate. His father would have been \nvery proud of how well Lincoln Chafee has served the people of Rhode \nIsland.\n  I thank him for his service to our country and wish him and his wife \nStephanie all the best.\n\n\n                              Jim Jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, when this session of Congress comes to an end, Senator \nJim\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nJeffords will leave the Senate. He has been a thoughtful and \nindependent voice here, and he will be greatly missed.\n  Senator Jeffords has been a true champion for the environment. He was \ninstrumental in passing the 1990 Clean Air Act, and he chaired the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee from 2001 to 2002. He has fought \nfor policies that encourage renewable energy use and that reduce \nemissions of carbon and other pollutants.\n  Senator Jeffords is a strong believer in promoting economic \ndevelopment that also protects the environment and preserves the \nlandscape. In the 1960s, when he served as a State senator and then \nattorney general of Vermont, Jim worked on the most comprehensive \nState-level growth management policy in the United States. Jim \ncontinued these efforts as a U.S. Senator, and I joined with Jim in \n1999 to form the Senate's Smart Growth Task Force, a bipartisan, \nmultiregional caucus.\n  With Jim's leadership, the task force's membership grew to more than \n20 Senators who shared the goal of determining how the Federal \nGovernment can help States and localities address their own growth \nmanagement issues. Out of this task force, a series of bipartisan \nlegislative initiatives have emerged, including legislation to promote \nbrownfields development, support urban and town centers, provide \ntransportation funding and access, and conserve open space and historic \nstructures.\n  Senator Jeffords has also been a strong leader on education, job \ntraining, and disability legislation and served as chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee from 1997 to June \n2001. He has a particular passion for improving education for students \nwith special needs and coauthored the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. Jim Jeffords is also a strong advocate for fairness and \nhas sponsored legislation to end discrimination based on sexual \norientation and to strengthen penalties for hate crimes.\n  Senator Jeffords became a household name and earned a spot in Senate \nhistory in 2001 when he left the Republican Party, creating a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate. That action stunned Washington. But \nfor those of us who have been fortunate to know him over the years, we \nwere not at all surprised that Jim Jeffords had followed his conscience \nand his deep commitment to the interests of the people of Vermont and \ndid what he believed to be right.\n  I want to wish Jim and his wife Elizabeth well as they enter a new \nphase in their lives.\n\n\n                              Mike De Wine\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to our colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine. Senator DeWine \nis a truly decent, thoughtful individual with a deep concern for \nchildren and a refreshing willingness to reach across the aisle. He has \nbeen a solid partner on several of the issues common to our two States \nand the region.\n  In particular, it has been a pleasure to work with Senator DeWine on \nissues affecting the Great Lakes, which are critical for our States' \neconomies and for our environment. Since 1999, he and I have served as \ncochairs of the Great Lakes Task Force and have shared a commitment to \nprotecting and restoring these national treasures. We have fought to \nprotect the lakes from invasive species, to improve water quality, to \ncreate a long-term restoration plan, and to expand public access to the \nlakes.\n  Senator DeWine's service here has also been characterized by his \ncommitment to children and children's health, and he has been willing \nto work in a bipartisan way to make progress. He has worked with \nSenators Dodd and Jack Reed to prevent teen suicides and with Senator \nClinton to ensure that drugs given to children are safe for them. He \nhas sponsored a bill with Senator Kennedy to allow the Food and Drug \nAdministration to regulate tobacco. As the chair of the District of \nColumbia Appropriations Subcommittee, he has also worked to reform the \nchild welfare system in DC.\n  In addition to his bipartisan approach, Senator DeWine has also shown \na willingness to take politically difficult positions when he believes \nthey are the right thing to do. Last year, for example, he joined a \nbipartisan group of 14 senators who worked to forge a compromise on \njudicial nominations and to save the Senate from the so-called nuclear \noption. That step helped to diffuse a tense situation and to protect \nthe Senate as an institution.\n  I have great respect for Mike DeWine's integrity, his commitment to \nhis State, and his willingness to seek progress over partisanship. I \nwish him and his wife Fran well in their future endeavors.\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today, I rise to acknowledge and honor \nthe good work and service of my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Bill \nFrist. As a Senator for the past dozen years, and majority leader for \nthe past four, Senator Frist has been a leader of strong resolve on \nbehalf of his home State and our entire Nation. His work in the U.S. \nSenate will be remembered for a long time to come, and I personally owe \nSenator Frist a debt of gratitude.\n  He has been an advocate of the offshore drilling agreement that would \nbenefit not only the people of my home State of Florida, but millions \nof Americans living in the gulf coast region--this plan would reduce \nAmerica's reliance on foreign sources of energy and is vital to our \nfuture. I applaud Senator Frist for recognizing and acting so \ndecisively on this important issue.\n  Senator Frist has also been a dedicated leader on immigration reform \nand I thank him for taking on this divisive, yet necessary issue with \nsuch a keen understanding of what our Nation needs. I also know how \npassionate Senator Frist is about national security and defense. We \nwere able to travel to and around Iraq together, and while there, we \nhad the opportunity to personally thank some of our troops for their \ncourage and incredible sacrifice. I was appreciative to have that \nexperience with someone who certainly knows the meaning of service.\n  On a personal note, Senator Frist made sure that I would be able to \npay my respects to Pope John Paul II--and I cannot say enough about how \nmuch that has meant to me and to my family. Thank you for that and for \nyour relentless leadership. Thank you for your time and for your \ncounsel. Thank you for your friendship.\n  Senator Frist is a fine senator and a true gentleman. We will miss \nhim a great deal here Washington. Yet, all of us know how well he will \ndo as he returns to his long and distinguished career in medicine. The \npeople of Tennessee are fortunate to have back their revered Dr. Frist. \nI wish my best to Senator Frist and his family always.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  Mr. President, today, I commend Senator Rick Santorum for his \ndedication to public service and accomplishments as a legislator. Above \nall, I admire the Senator's commitment to the people of his home State, \nPennsylvania, and to his family. Throughout his 12-year tenure in the \nU.S. Senate, he relentlessly fought to pass legislation benefiting the \nwelfare of, not only his constituents, but Americans everywhere. In \naddition, Senator Santorum has been a great advocate in the effort to \nfind a cure for the Global HIV/AIDS pandemic and a strong supporter of \nthe war on terror. He has represented the American people well.\n  As a colleague, I would also like to thank Senator Santorum for his \nstrong leadership as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. \nDuring his time in Washington, Rick has always maintained the \nimportance of family, a value that I admire and share. He has also \nprovided valuable guidance to me in the past and will be missed. I wish \nmy colleague from Pennsylvania, his wife, and children all the best in \nthe future. Thank you for your service.\n\n\n                              George Allen\n\n  Mr. President, today, I recognize the service of Senator George \nAllen. The citizens of Commonwealth of Virginia and the American people \nare losing a great patriot in the U.S. Senate. Senator Allen will be \nleaving the Senate after 6 years of service to his home State \nconstituents and to this country.\n  He has been an important member of the Republican Party and the \nSenate, always striving to better America's defense and homeland \nsecurity. He has worked to ensure good-paying jobs for\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\nthe people of Virginia, and to guarantee that every person in Virginia \nreceives a quality education. It is disappointing that a strong leader \nlike Senator Allen is leaving the Senate; he will be missed. Senator \nAllen was one of the people who helped convince me to run for the \nUnited States Senate, and without his support and his guidance, I might \nnot be here today.\n  I wish my colleague from Virginia and his family all the best, and \nthank them for the service that they have given to our country. Thank \nyou, Senator Allen.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, when I look back on the years I was \nfortunate enough to have served in the Senate with Rick Santorum, I \nthink I will most remember him for his strong and passionate belief in \nthe principles he fought for on the floor, the unwavering support he \nalways gave his friends, and the powerful way he expressed himself on \nthe issues that came before the Senate.\n  Whenever there was a problem ahead, it was always good to know Rick \nwas in your corner. In fact, Rick was one of my first supporters when I \nwas running for the U.S. Senate. Everyone who runs for the Senate for \nthe first time has a great need for funds. I was no exception. Rick \ngave me a check that I later noticed was not signed. I needed the help \nand I would gladly have walked halfway across the District of Columbia \nto get his signature to make the document official, but when he learned \nthat I needed his endorsement on the check he had so generously helped \nme obtain, he dropped everything he was doing and came to where I was \nto sign the check for me.\n  In the years since my election, Rick has shown time and time again \nthat he is a thoughtful, genuine person on whom I could rely. He has a \ngreat mind for politics and his heart is with the people of \nPennsylvania whom he has represented so well. I have often relied on \nhim for the way he would quietly offer me his good advice, support me \nwhen we took up issues that were big concerns of the people of my \nState, mentor me on how to get things done around here, advise me on \nprocedure, and help me to advance the causes that were common to the \npeople of our States. The people of his home State could not have had a \nmore active and effective advocate through the years, and he will be \nvery hard to replace.\n  As any observer would note, Rick's career has been nothing short of \namazing. At every step in his political life, critics would tell him \nhis vision was an impossible dream. In response, Rick would take his \ncase to the people, and time after time he would prove the naysayers \nwrong. That is because Rick knew the value of hard work and he also \nknew the first law of politics--it is not where you start, it is where \nyou finish--and Rick made a habit of finishing first.\n  When Rick ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, he \nknew it was going to be a rough campaign because he was battling a \nseven-term incumbent who had a lot more money than he did. So, Rick \nknocked on 25,000 doors and put together a grassroots effort that \nincluded people from many different backgrounds who wanted to work with \nRick on a wide range of issues. In the end, when the election was over \nand the votes were counted, Rick had won. It was clearly Rick's \npersonal touch and his enthusiasm for the job that had been strong \nenough to overcome every obstacle--even a shortage of financial \nresources.\n\n  It wasn't long after that Rick was elected to the Senate after \nanother difficult campaign battle. Again, the critics said it couldn't \nbe done. Once again, Rick showed them he could do it.\n  As soon as he arrived in the Senate, he continued to fight for the \nprinciples he believed in, regardless of what others predicted the \noutcome would be. He fought for the tough causes without regard for the \noutcome because he couldn't be silent when the rights of the unborn \nwere denied or a cherished principle was at stake. It was a commitment \nborne of his deep and abiding faith. In fact, I can't think of anyone \nwho is a stronger man of faith than Rick is. His faith is a great part \nof who he is, and it forms the basis of his character.\n  I heard a story about the last campaign about Rick and a trip he and \nhis wife were making so Rick could appear on ``Meet the Press.'' It was \nnear the end of what had been a long and difficult campaign and anyone \nelse would have been exhausted. Not Rick. He was fighting for a cause \nthat he believed in, and he was, once again, full of that remarkable \nenergy he called upon for all of his political campaigns.\n  As they headed down the road toward Washington, Rick and his wife \ntalked about how hard the campaign was and how it had affected them and \ntheir family. As they thought about the battle that was still before \nthem, they began to talk about Rick's opponent and the toll the battle \nwas undoubtedly taking on him and his family as well. Without \nhesitation, as they drove to Washington for the televised debate, they \ntook the time to pray for his opponent and his family in the hope that \nGod would bless them and give them all the strength they would need to \ncomplete the campaign. Then they would leave the matter to the voters \nto decide. That is how strong a part of his life Rick's faith is.\n  In the years to come, I think Rick will often come to mind, standing \nwith us on the Senate floor, taking on a cause that has driven him to \nact. Rick is known as a scrapper, but he is much more than that. He is \na warrior, the kind you want on your side when the going gets tough. He \nis also a brilliant tactician, and if there is anyone who can develop \nand implement a winning strategy on the floor or in the field, that \nindividual is Rick Santorum.\n  Rick has been a winner over the years because he knows the value of a \nmessage--and how to effectively advocate and present it. He is a great \npersuader as well, and he has been a valuable part of many efforts to \npass legislation. He is someone who likes to get things done, and that \nability has been recognized here in Washington and back home in \nPennsylvania by members of both parties. When it comes to a difficult \nbill, Rick has the conviction, courage, and persistence to work through \nour difficult process and get the job done. His defense of life on the \nfloor has made a difference and it will continue to do so.\n\n  Rick knows that one person doing the right thing is a majority. He \nknows that has cost him in the past, but he will be the first to say \nthat it has been worth it, and people will see that in the long run it \nis all about standing up for what you believe.\n  I have always believed that life is a great adventure and God has \nplaced us where he needs us, when he needs us to be there. I know that \nGod has special plans for Rick. We haven't heard the last from him. \nThere is another battle, a greater cause for which he is needed, and I \nam looking forward to seeing where God will see fit to place him in the \nmonths to come.\n  Rick Santorum has been a great friend during the time I have had a \nchance to come to know him. His expression of his faith and all he has \nshared with us at our Prayer Breakfasts will stay with me because they \nwere a powerful and memorable affirmation of his belief in God. I hope \nhe continues to weigh in on the issues that come before the Senate. We \ncan always benefit from the views and advice of someone who says what \nhe means and means what he says.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  Mr. President, soon the last remaining items of business on the \nlegislative calendar for the current session of Congress will be \ncompleted and the current session will be brought to a close. When it \ndoes, several of our colleagues will be returning home and ending their \nservice in the Senate. We will miss them, and we will especially miss \nthe good ideas and creative energy they brought to their duties in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Jim Talent is one of those individuals we will miss because of his \ncan-do spirit and his determination to make a difference. He cares a \ngreat deal about our country, and he came to the Congress determined to \nmake this a better place for us all to live--especially our children \nand our children's children. That is why he has always been so focused \non the future of our Nation and the need to solve the problems that \nface us before they overwhelm us.\n  I first met Jim when he was the chairman of the House of \nRepresentatives Small Business Committee. Coming from a small business \nbackground myself, I was determined to do everything I could to \neliminate the redtape that too often serves to discourage instead of \nencourage the growth of our\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nsmall businesses throughout the country.\n  At the time, Jim was working on a number of issues in his committee \nthat I was working on with the Workplace Safety and Training \nSubcommittee of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \nTogether we began to focus on some OSHA issues and other matters \naffecting the workplace that needed our attention. We came up with a \nplan to work them incrementally, and by taking them up piece by piece, \nbit by bit, we were able to get some things done that might have \notherwise been put off for another day. Over a couple of years, we were \nable to pass into law some of the first changes in the history of OSHA. \nEach step was a small victory for the workers of America. Taken \ntogether, the results gave us both hope that we would collaborate on \nbigger and bigger things in the future.\n  Back then, Jim had a decision to make. He was very popular back home \nand he probably could have stayed in the House for quite a long time, \nbut he decided he wanted to run for statewide office. That call \neventually led him to run for the Senate. It was a difficult battle, \nbut Jim emerged with a wellearned victory.\n  I was delighted by his decision to run for the Senate and even more \nenthused by his victory. It proved what I had always thought about Jim, \nthat he is a hard worker and he is always there to fight for what he \nbelieves in.\n  During his service in the Senate, Jim has been a champion for the \npeople of his State and an expert on health plans for small businesses. \nWhen he was in the House he had served on the conference committee for \nthe Patients Bill of Rights. He got the health plan legislation we \nwanted in the report, but the report, was never voted on. Now that he \nwas in the Senate, he was working on a number of issues but none as \nhard or as focused as he was on passing the small business health plan \ninto law that he had helped shape and draft.\n  In the end, we were able to get 56 votes in the Senate for our plan, \nbut it takes 60 to force a matter to a vote. That meant we were just \nfour votes short of the total we needed to pass this legislation and \naddress the issue of health care for small businesses and people all \nacross the country.\n  I know we will miss Jim's participation when we take up this issue \nnext year, but I expect he will find a way to keep our feet to the fire \nand remind us that the people of this Nation are expecting us to get \nsomething done to help address their health care needs. I look forward \nto hearing from him with his suggestions and thoughtful comments about \nthe bill that emerges from committee next year--how to improve it and, \nmore importantly, how to pass it.\n  In the years to come, I know I will miss Jim and his creative ideas \nand enthusiasm for getting things done. Jim's greatest asset has always \nbeen his ability to listen to all sides of an argument and create ways \naround the obstacles that were preventing us from taking action. He is \na leader, an innovator, and most of all, a friend to all who have come \nto know him.\n  Thanks, Jim, for your dedication, your persistence, your courage, and \nthe many capabilities you brought to your work on the Senate. You will \nbe missed around here. Good luck in whatever you choose to do in the \ndays to come. You will always have our support and our appreciation for \nyour determination to make this country's health care system work as it \nshould.\n\n\n                              Mike De Wine\n\n  As each congressional session draws to a close, we work as hard as we \ncan to try to tie up all the loose ends and finish as much of the \npending legislation as we possibly can. As we do, we also take a moment \nto say goodbye to some of our colleagues who won't be with us during \nthe next Congress to share with us their insights, wisdom and \ncreativity.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions, I know I will miss Mike DeWine when the committee meets \nto begin its schedule of activities next year. Mike has always been a \nparticularly hard-working member of the committee and I know my \ncolleagues on the committee and I will miss his perspective and his \ntireless commitment and his dedication to the issues affecting children \nand families.\n  Working with Mike has been a pleasure. We have a great deal in \ncommon--beginning with our mutual enjoyment of the old-fashioned ice \ncream social back home. It is a tradition for both of our families and \nour political lives because it is a great way to get everyone together \nto talk about current events while enjoying everyone's favorite \ndessert.\n  No one ever said that politics was an easy career to follow and, true \nto form, Mike has had a number of hurdles placed before him that took \nsome doing for him to overcome.\n  He began his career of public service as a county prosecutor. He took \na tough stand against crime and people noticed. Then, he was elected to \nthe Ohio Senate. That led to a run for a seat in the Congress. He faced \na tough primary fight, but wound up at the top of a field of six \ncandidates. Then, when the general election was held, he was elected to \nserve the people of his district in the House of Representatives.\n  In the years to follow, Mike had some more tough battles. He didn't \nalways win, but he never quit. That spirit of dedication and commitment \nof his helped him to win a seat in the Senate, representing the people \nof Ohio he had been fighting for over the years. His election gave Mike \na new forum from which to promote his principles, and he soon proved \nhimself to be a champion for children and family values. As bill after \nbill came to the Senate floor for our consideration, Mike always gave \nit a close look to see if there was something that needed to be added \nto increase the protections available to our Nation's children.\n  Mike understands full well that our children are our most important \nresource. If we don't help our Nation's families do a good job of \nraising their children, nothing else we do, no matter how well we do \nit, will matter much in the long run.\n  Some people might be surprised to learn how well Mike has used his \ntime to work with members on both sides of the aisle. To Mike, it was \njust common sense. You never know how long you will be a member of the \nSenate, he would say, so it makes sense to use your time wisely.\n  As the chairman of the Senate HELP Committee I can attest to the fact \nthat he has used his time wisely. He has been a great addition to the \ncommittee because he is an expert on children's issues and issues \naffecting older Americans. I have watched him carefully work on a \nnumber of bills dealing with a wide variety of topics. He always comes \nto our meetings, well prepared, fully focused, and committed to making \na difference for the people of Ohio and the rest of the Nation.\n  Mike is very much a people person, and he and his wife Fran have made \nregular trips to Haiti to work with the poorest of the poor. I have \noften heard it said that God must love the poor because he made so many \nof them. Fortunately, God also made people like Mike DeWine to plead \ntheir case for them in Washington and work with them around the world \nin an effort to make their lives better.\n  The ice cream social I mentioned earlier has become an annual \ntradition and Fran and the friends she recruits are now famous for \ntheir hospitality as they put on what must be the world's biggest pie \nand ice cream social.\n  That is just part of the full schedule Mike and his family maintain \nevery year here, in Ohio and around the world taking on the causes he \nand Fran hold dear. If you want to know what kind of a year Mike has \nhad, take a look at his Christmas card. If you do, you will see an \namazing collage of pictures of his family and all that has taken place \nin their lives over the past 12 months. It serves to emphasize his \ngreat belief in the importance of family and family activities. It is a \nvalue Diana and I and so many of our colleagues share.\n  In the years to come, whenever I think of Mike DeWine, I know I will \nthink of those Christmas cards, which I hope to be still receiving, and \nof the smiles and happiness reflected on each face in the pictures on \nthat card. They tell me that Mike and Fran DeWine have learned one of \nlife's most important lessons. Fame and fortune are all too often \nfleeting and evasive things in life. In the end, and every day, the \nmost important part of our lives has to do with the strength of our \nfaith, the bonds that tie our families together,\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\nand the friendships we develop along the way that help us to fully \nappreciate and enjoy all that life has to offer.\n  Mike DeWine is truly blessed to have a family which has shown \nthemselves to be role models on all three of those special values. I \nknow I will miss him, but, I also know I won't forget him and Fran.\n\n\n                              Conrad Burns\n\n  Mr. President, the 109th Congress will soon be drawing to a close. As \nit does, we will be casting our final votes on the issues we will take \nup this year, and saying goodbye to several of our colleagues who will \nnot be with us for the start of the 110th session of Congress. I know I \nwill miss them all for the creativity, imagination and firm resolve \nthey have brought to the consideration of the issues we have worked so \nhard to address for the past 2 years.\n  One of our colleagues I know I will miss in particular is Conrad \nBurns. Throughout my service in the Senate he has been a remarkable \nfriend, and the kind of person you would want on your side if a battle \non the Senate floor was about to take place. For 18 years he has been a \nremarkable Senator and a strong and effective representative of the \npeople of Montana. It just won't be the same around here without him.\n  Conrad Burns is a true westerner--through and through--and very proud \nof his western roots. He has always been strongly committed and \nabsolutely loyal to the United States and to his home State of Montana. \nHe showed his commitment to each at an early age. First, his love of \nhis country showed itself when he decided to leave home and join the \nMarines. Then, when his tour of service was completed, he returned to \nMontana and began a career that was going so well his employer wanted \nto transfer him to another State where he thought Conrad would be more \neffective. That is when Conrad's love for his home State of Montana \nshowed itself and he quit a promising career rather than leave the \nState he loved so well.\n  Instead, Conrad set up the Northern Ag Network, which grew from 4 \nradio stations to 29 radio stations and 6 television stations. Then, as \nthings were going so well with that project, he began looking for a new \nchallenge. He found it when he ran for Yellowstone County commissioner \nand won. It was the start of a great political career for him and the \nmore the people of Montana got to know Conrad Burns, the more they \nliked him.\n  Conrad then decided to run for the Senate and ever since he came to \nWashington, Conrad has compiled quite a remarkable record of service. \nHe has made great decisions for our country as he has watched out for \nthe best interests of the people of Montana. He has made a difference \non the local, State and national level. Here in Washington, he has \nchampioned some amazing projects and issues and there is a lot of \nlegislation that bears his mark for his having worked on it or \nsupported it through the years.\n\n  As we have watched Conrad roll up his sleeves and get to work on any \nof a number of issues, he has always impressed us with his \nunderstanding of complex issues and their short-term and long-term \nimplications for our society such as the Internet and the development \nof modern technologies. In fact, I don't think anyone knows more about \nbroadband and communication issues than he does. He is probably the \ngreatest expert in the Senate on those matters and I know I will \ncontinue to seek his advice and counsel about them when these or \nrelated issues come to the floor in the months to come.\n  That is an impressive start, but it is not all you will find when you \nexamine Conrad's record of service. Conrad has also been a hero to \nsmall businesses across the country. He understands their importance \nand he is fully aware that our Nation's small businesses are the \nbackbone of every State's economy and our national economy as well.\n  People around the country have come to know Conrad as he exercised \nhis strong and effective leadership on the Appropriations Committee. He \nwas always very careful with the people's money to ensure it was \neffectively spent.\n  For my part, I will always remember Conrad as one of my greatest \nmentors in the Senate. Thanks to him, I learned a great deal about the \nhearings process and how it works. I learned the importance of putting \na hearing together that would generate good ideas to solve difficult \nproblems. That enabled us to address the concerns of the ranchers of \nWyoming, Montana and the West and take a closer look at the destruction \ncaused by the fires in our States. As we examined those issues during \nour hearings in Montana, I got a chance to see how he handled the gavel \nand exercised his leadership as chairman. That experience helped me to \nplan and hold my own hearings and ensure a maximum amount of \nparticipation and discussion.\n  Conrad has also been a good friend over the years we have served \ntogether in the Senate. We have fished and golfed together. We have \nworked together on issues of concern to Wyoming, Montana and the West \nand we have voted together. We have gone to quite a few sporting events \ntogether usually to watch the Wyoming and Montana teams play each \nother. I seem to recall that Wyoming usually got the better of those \nencounters. I think Conrad may recall those games differently, but I am \npretty sure the Wyoming teams always finished ahead of the others.\n  Our families have enjoyed each other as well. Our wives are best \nfriends in the western sense--not the Washington, DC sense. Our kids \ngrew up together and they have remained close--even through those times \nwhen they were miles apart.\n  Most important to me, Conrad has been my friend through thick and \nthin--the good and bad--the wins and losses--and the highs and lows of \npolitical life. Time changes so many things in our lives, but one thing \nit never changes is a friendship. Thankfully, those only grow deeper \nand stronger with time.\n  As we say goodbye to Conrad Burns, I know I will still be seeing him, \nhearing from him and spending time with him now and again. Change is \ntemporary, friendships are permanent, and I know my family and I are \nlooking forward to continuing to share our lives with Conrad and his \nfamily. We can't ever let change ``change'' that.\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Senator Bill Frist, \nwhose sense of public service harkens back to ancient Athens when every \ncitizen, in order to be called an Athenian, served in a public capacity \nfor the good of the state. And it is more than fitting that this \nSenator, this son of Tennessee, comes from the only place in the United \nStates with a full-scale replica of the Parthenon, for Bill First--like \nthe Athenians of old--sees himself first as a citizen above all else.\n  Senator Bill Frist and I arrived in the U.S. Senate in the same class \nin 1994. And only 9 years later, he was chosen Senate majority leader--\na rapid ascent by anyone's count. In the time that Senator Frist has \nserved his country in the position of leader, he has worked ceaselessly \nto translate ideals and principles into tangible improvements in the \ndaily lives of the American people. For me, it has been a tremendous \nprivilege over the years to work closely with him on many issues and \nserve with him on the Senate Budget Committee and the Senate Committees \non Commerce, Small Business, and Finance.\n  Senator Frist's allegiance to serving others has been nothing short \nof exemplary. He went into medicine because he cared about people. His \nprofound dedication to public service--to the American people and the \npeople of Tennessee--grew out of an earlier devotion to thousands of \nmen and women whose dilemmas and struggles Dr. Frist came to understand \nfirsthand. No wonder he takes such great pride in being known as a \n``citizen legislator''--and with good reason.\n  As he prepares to leave this Chamber, we recall that when the leader \nspoke about America's uninsured or the rising cost of health care or \nabout the dangers posed to our communities by the threat of \nbioterrorism, his insights are rooted, not in theory, but in years of \nup-close and personal contact with the people who sent him to \nWashington in the first place. We also remember that Senator Frist was \nthe first practicing physician to occupy a U.S. Senate seat since \n1928--in fact the sign on his office door didn't say ``majority \nleader''--it fittingly read, ``Dr. Bill Frist, M.D.''\n  He has held his oath of office with distinction, just as he has kept \nto the\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\n2000-year-old Hippocratic precept ``to do no harm,'' and in fact, he \nhas gone well beyond that tenet, as he has done and will continue to do \na world of good. We will miss his perspective and leadership and wish \nhim and Karyn all the best as they pursue this next phase of their life \nand service together.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my great friend, \nSenator Lincoln Chafee, a public servant who exemplifies the idea that \nsuperior governance depends on people of good will working for the \ncommon good--together. He epitomizes the New England pragmatism in \ngovernment that sees not weakness but strength in reaching across the \naisle to build consensus and make the system work for those it was \nformed to serve.\n  When I consider Senator Chafee's tenure, I cannot help but think how \nhe has so successfully forged his own pathway and legacy of exceptional \nservice in the U.S. Senate, while honoring the formidable contributions \nof his extraordinary father, John Chafee. Senator Chafee has brought \nlevelheaded leadership on myriad issues critical to our progress as a \npeople, always with vigilant and careful attention to his beloved Ocean \nState of Rhode Island.\n  He has been a stalwart colleague and friend in our mutual cause to \nrevitalize and advance the political center, in our concerted effort to \nanswer the challenges facing our Nation by producing not rancor but \nresults, not acrimony but accord. His loss not only diminishes the \nSenate but is also a loss for the country because we need more voices \nseeking to craft compromise and consensus to forge solutions, not \nfewer.\n  Linc Chafee was not only a political neighbor of mine in the center \nof the political spectrum--where most Americans consider themselves--\nbut he has been a next-door neighbor in my hallway in the Russell \nSenate Building, a corridor also appropriately occupied by my good \nfriend Senator Mike DeWine, who also epitomized the finest ideals of \npublic service. So I will profoundly miss seeing them not only in the \nSenate but also simply walking down the hall outside my office. They \nwere a constant reminder of what is best and most noble about public \noffice.\n  Linc and I worked hand-in-glove on issues of fiscal restraint and \naccountability by calling for and advocating the implementation of the \npay-as-you-go approach to the Federal budget. And I believe it is \ninstructive that he is rightly considered a champion of the \nenvironment, even as he championed economic growth. But that is Linc--\nfor him, issues that may seem mutually exclusive to those with \nintractable dogmas could coexist naturally in his vision of a world not \nso easily or appropriately cast in hews of black and white. Indeed, \nSenator Chafee's fight to strengthen air and water quality standards \ncontinues to resonate, a battle he has waged with innovation and \nresolve by combining business development with environmental advocacy.\n  Unflagging in his dedication to the precepts of personal \nresponsibility and freedom, fiscal accountability, and serving the \npublic interest, Lincoln Chafee has, with honor and distinction, \nbrought intelligence, vigor, and courage to the U.S. Senate from \ndebates about foreign policy and homeland security to marshaling health \ncare efforts to confront breast cancer and long-term care.\n  Whether serving as captain of his university wrestling team, working \nas a blacksmith at harness race tracks, or serving the highest ideals \nof public service, Lincoln Chafee has demonstrated an independence, \nresiliency, and strength of purpose that has made him a credit to this \ninstitution and an example for his country.\n  I wish Senator Chafee, his wife Stephanie, and their children all the \nbest for the future.\n\n\n                              Jim Jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my enormous gratitude and deep \nappreciation for my good friend and colleague, Senator Jim Jeffords. \nPresident John Adams, who served as the first President of this body, \nonce exclaimed. ``If we do not lay out ourselves in the service of \nmankind whom should we serve?'' The answer given through the years by \nSenator Jim Jeffords has been one marked by the eloquence of his \nactions.\n  True Yankee independence and integrity are two of the hallmarks \ndistinguishing Senator Jim Jeffords. Our legislative service together \ndates back to the 97th Congress and our participation together on the \nhouse Aging Committee, ironically at much younger ages than we are \ntoday. We have also served together on the Senate Finance Committee. \nAnd I will forever fondly remember the monthly moderates lunches we \nattended together, just as I will cherish the lunch we shared in the \nfinal days of his distinguished tenure in the Senate.\n  Indeed, so many achievements distinguish this public servant and \nusher him into a prestigious pantheon of officeholders, whose common \ndenominator is uncommon commitment to addressing tough issues that \ntruly affect the daily life of the people whom they represent.\n  Educated at Yale University and Harvard Law School, this son of a \nformer chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court could have pursued \nany number of pathways in his life, but it testifies to his strength of \ncharacter and abundance of integrity that he chose to use his depth of \nlearning, prodigious skill, and expertise on behalf of others with the \ngoal of service--a journey that began with his active duty in the U.S. \nNavy in 1956 and that continued throughout his 32 years in the \nCongress. From his days in the U.S. House in the mid-1970s--where he \nalso served with my husband Jock McKernan--to the present, Senator \nJeffords made a priority to champion education and the environment and \nby doing so became one of the best advocates these issues have ever \nhad.\n  In 1975, Senator Jeffords, as the ranking member on the subcommittee \non select education, coauthored what would later be known as the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, which has provided equal \naccess to education for millions of students with disabilities. Since \nits enactment, Senator Jeffords has continued to fight for full Federal \nfunding for the law. He has fought to reduce industrial pollution and \nacid rain, and as a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee he ensured the passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act. More \nrecently, Senator Jeffords has introduced legislation that would clean \nup polluting powerplants and create incentives for investments in \nclean, renewable power.\n  In 2001, during the tax-cut debate, as we were working to ensure a \nfair but a fiscally-responsible compromise, Senator Jeffords and I \ncombined to advocate for significant relief for the working poor. In \n2003, during intense negotiations, we joined forces to ensure \nprescription drug benefits for Medicare. And I could not have been more \npleased to work with him in authoring the so-called Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision to the historic Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. I couldn't be \nmore proud that our arguments were not only persuasive in the Senate \nbut ultimately before the U.S. Supreme Court after more than 3 hours of \noral arguments, as the act--including our provision--was upheld.\n  In the true spirit of statecraft, Jim Jeffords has ennobled not only \nthe art of public affairs but the public affairs component of art. \nThen-Congressman Jeffords cofounded the Congressional Arts Caucus and \nhas consistently fought for financial support of the National Endowment \nfor the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the \nInstitute for Museum and Library Services. Like my State's own Margaret \nChase Smith, Senator Jeffords has been a public servant of deep and \nabiding conscience, buttressed by a profound courage and unwavering \nlove for his State and his country. I wish him all the best.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Senator Jim Talent, my \ncolleague and friend whose capacity for being a catalyst on issues that \nhe holds dear is truly remarkable--and will be missed in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  In his first term in the U.S. Senate from Missouri, otherwise known \nas the Show-Me State, Senator Jim Talent has shown--not just me--but \nhis colleagues and his constituents that he is a person who cares about \nhealth care, small business, economic growth, and defense. Whether \nduring his 8 years in the U.S. House or his 4 years in the U.S. Senate, \nJim Talent has demonstrated the fortitude and will necessary to meet \nchallenging issues with national implications.\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\n  In the U.S. House, as a freshman congressman, he introduced the Real \nWelfare Reform Act of 1994, which became the basis for landmark, \nbipartisan welfare reform legislation. Never one to turn from a \nchallenge, then-Congressman Talent also managed to get association \nhealth plans legislation passed out of the U.S. House, not once but \ntwice. And he built on that success by working on that same issue in \nthe U.S. Senate--indeed, Senator Talent was an essential proponent of \nthis important effort to allow small businesses to pool their resources \nto lower skyrocketing health insurance costs.\n  I saw firsthand how the same indefatigable energy that was indicative \nof his commitment in the House was very much on display in the Senate \nas he worked tirelessly with our leadership, Labor Secretary Chao, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, and so many others on this \ncritical issue. As we go forward to identify a path forward on this \nvital matter, Senator Talent's acumen and will to move this issue will \nbe missed in our chamber.\n  I wish Jim Talent and his entire family all the best for what I am \ncertain will be a successful next chapter in his life.\n\n\n                    FAREWELL TO SENATOR MIKE DE WINE\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude to Senator Mike \nDeWine, whose desire to do good has remained his abiding purpose and \nlifelong contribution to the people of Ohio, the U.S. Senate, and his \ncountry. The moniker of ``bodyguard of the poor''--which he has been \ndubbed by many in his State--speaks volumes about Senator DeWine's \ntireless dedication to enriching and helping others and about his \nearnest efforts to defend the defenseless and protect those in need.\n  With a career in public service spanning more than 30 years, Senator \nMike DeWine has more than earned his reputation as hard-working, \nhonest, compassionate, and results-oriented. I first got to know Mike \nwhen he entered the House of Representatives the same year as my \nhusband Jock. I am proud to say we served together in both the U.S. \nHouse and Senate. In the 99th and 101st Congresses, we both served on \nthe House Committee on Foreign Affairs. And in the U.S. Senate, we were \ncolleagues on the Select Committee on Intelligence, where issues of \nnational security and safety have been more paramount then ever. \nAmerica is most fortunate to have had his thoughtful, considered \napproach on that committee and on so many other issues. Jock and I have \ntreasured our longstanding friendship with Mike and Fran DeWine, and we \nhave enormous respect for Mike's passion and depth of commitment.\n  Indeed, he is a serious and deliberative legislative craftsman who \nsought to effectively represent his State and reach across the aisle in \nthe true spirit of the institution. At no point in time was this more \nevident than during last year's debate over judicial nominations when \nMike--a dedicated member of the Senate Judiciary Committee--joined with \nme and a dozen of our colleagues to form the Gang of 14. His courage \nand leadership helped broker a compromise that preserved the principles \nand traditions of this great institution. His loss diminishes the \nSenate at a time when we need more like Mike DeWine--leaders committed \nto solutions over sound-bites. I will deeply miss seeing Mike in the \nSenate--for he was always a reminder of the finest ideals of public \nservice.\n  Indeed, Mike DeWine has represented well the principles and pride of \nAmerica's heartland. As the son of parents who ran a small agricultural \nbusiness, he learned the value of diligence and perseverance working in \nthe fields and in the mill.\n  He has exemplified that unwavering commitment throughout his career \nin public service, whether as a prosecutor, U.S. Representative, \nGovernor, or U.S. Senator and whether advocating for children, \npromoting humanitarian relief, aiding law enforcement, protecting our \nnatural resources, spurring job growth, increasing national security \nthrough intelligence improvements, or working to secure balanced \nbudgets. And he has led many of these efforts through his active and \nthorough committee work on Appropriations, Judiciary--Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions--and Intelligence.\n  Above all else, I believe Mike DeWine's essential sense of humanity, \nand the personal compass that guided him in all he did in the Senate, \nwas exemplified by his final minutes on the Senate floor--which he \ndevoted to speaking of the soldiers of Ohio who had fallen in service \nto our Nation in Iraq. That Senator DeWine sought assurance he would \nhave this opportunity to honor the troops before the end of the session \nis a testament to the compassionate heart of an exceptional man.\n  For all of his dedicated service to the people of Ohio and to this \ncountry, undoubtedly, Mike DeWine's most cherished achievement is his \nmarriage of 39 years to his wife Fran, their eight children, and nine \ngrandchildren. I wish them--and Mike DeWine--all the best.\n\n\n                             RICK SANTORUM\n\n  Mr. President, today I honor a principled legislator, a passionate \nadvocate, and stalwart son of Pennsylvania, Senator Rick Santorum, \nwhose vitality as a leader in both the House and Senate was exceeded \nonly by his exceptional dedication and extraordinary civic \ncontribution.\n  During his 16 years in both the House and the Senate, Rick Santorum \nmarshaled his experience and skills in business and law to answer \neffectively and historically a clarion call to public service. And the \nbedrock hallmarks that have been the constant catalysts driving him are \nhis remarkable passion and enormous resolve.\n  In the Senate, an institution known rightfully and constitutionally \nfor deliberation, Rick's energy has been refreshing and welcomed. \nWhether on the Senate Armed Services or Finance Committees on which we \nboth served, Senator Santorum invariably infused policy debates with a \nfresh, informed, and vibrant voice on a range of critical issues, \nincluding national security, health care, economic development, and \ncombating AIDS. Indeed, Rick has been passionate in aggressively \nfighting the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS--a scourge that brings tragedy \nto millions of men, women, and children across the globe. Throughout \nhis tenure in the Senate, Rick worked without regard to political \nideology or philosophy on this matter that truly rises above \npartisanship because he recognizes that compassion and humanism are \nideals too large and important to be constrained by political labels.\n  Finally, I well recall our legislative service together in the House \nwhere Rick was a vital champion for change and an indispensable force \nbehind an agenda for reform. He unquestionably engendered a \ntransformative sensibility that helped catapult Republicans into the \nmajority.\n  Senator Santorum has dedicated his life to service to others, and I \nhave no doubt that he will continue to do so in the future. \nCharacterizing those achievements is his steadfast integrity and \nallegiance to deeply held beliefs. But for all of his accomplishments \nand the titles that accompany them, those that bring him the greatest \nsatisfaction, that he treasures above all, are that of husband and \nfather. Rick Santorum has served his country and the people of \nPennsylvania well, and I wish him, his wife Karen, and their children \nall the best.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the \nRepublican Members of the Senate who will not be returning in the 110th \nCongress. Senators George Allen; Conrad Burns; Lincoln Chafee; Mike \nDeWine; Dr. Bill Frist; Rick Santorum; and Jim Talent have served their \nconstituents with honor and distinction during their tenure here in the \nU.S. Senate. All care very deeply for this great Nation and I hope they \nwill have continued success in their future endeavors.\n  Senator Conrad Burns and I have had a great working and personal \nrelationship over the last 8 years. He and his wife Phyllis have become \ndear friends of my wife Mary and me. I have enjoyed our time spent \ntogether both personally and professionally. Conrad and I watched a \nbaseball game with our grandsons a couple of years ago in Montana. \nConrad and Phyllis also joined Mary and me at the Kentucky Derby. I \nwish Conrad and his family all the best as they start a new chapter in \ntheir lives.\n  Senator Rick Santorum is a principled conservative who is not shy to \ntell you where he stands. He has served the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania tirelessly for the last 16 years. Rick has always been \nhonest and upfront, and\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\nhis passion will be missed. Rick and his wife Karen have six wonderful \nchildren who all should be proud of how their dad represented \nPennsylvania in the U.S. Congress.\n  Majority leader Bill Frist has run the Senate through difficult and \ntrying times and he has done it well. Senator Mike DeWine, my neighbor \nto the north, has represented the Buckeye State with great distinction \nand has committed over 30 years of his life to public service. Senator \nGeorge Allen represented the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. \nSenate for 6 years, and he worked closely with me to make America safer \nby helping usher through important legislation to arm cargo pilots. \nSenator Jim Talent has had a great career in Congress and wrote the \nblueprint to the welfare reform bill of 1996. And Senator Lincoln \nChafee has continued the proud legacy set forth by his father and my \nfriend, Senator John Chafee.\n  Mr. President, I would like to again commend all of our departing \nRepublican Senators. I am proud of what they accomplished here in the \nU.S. Senate. They will all be missed, and I wish all of them the very \nbest.\n\n\n                              GEORGE ALLEN\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, Senator Allen has spent many years \nworking for Virginia.\n  He came to the Senate in 2000 after a strong record of \naccomplishments as his State's Governor.\n  As Virginia's Senator, he has worked diligently to protect our \nfreedoms, preserve conservative values, and help America remain the \nland of opportunity.\n  He was a strong supporter of the tax reforms of 2001 and 2003 that \nhave resulted in the economic upswing our economy is currently \nenjoying.\n  His work on the Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act has helped keep \naccess to the Internet tax free.\n  He also worked to increase military benefits, including legislation \nto increase the death benefits for families of fallen troops from \n$12,000 to $100,000.\n  I have also worked with Senator Allen on the PACE Act. Senator Allen \nunderstands that we must provide our children with the education \nnecessary for the jobs of tomorrow. His work with the National \nNanotechnology Initiative will also help our country compete globally \nas other countries continue to emerge. Senator Allen understands that \nAmerica must remain home to the best and brightest.\n  I will miss working with him in this Chamber, and I will miss his \nfriendship and support on the issues that matter most to America.\n\n\n                               JIM TALENT\n\n  Mr. President, Jim Talent has a long and honorable history of service \nto the people of Missouri.\n  In the House of Representatives, he introduced the bill that laid the \nfoundation for historic welfare reforms.\n  In 1997, he became the youngest chairman in the House when he was \nnamed Chairman of the House Small Business Committee. Under his \nleadership, the committee passed many crucial reforms for small \nbusiness owners, including tax relief and health insurance provisions.\n  When Jim joined the Senate in 2000, he continued serving his State \nwhile emerging as a powerful force for the good of his State and the \nNation.\n  His work on the Energy Committee has shown great foresight and has \ngalvanized our fight for energy independence.\n  I am proud to have served with Jim these past 6 years.\n  I expect great things from his continued efforts on behalf of the \nMidwest.\n\n\n                              MARK DAYTON\n\n  Mr. President, I wish Senator Dayton well as he departs from the \nSenate.\n  During his 6 years serving the citizens of Minnesota as their \nSenator, I got to know Senator Dayton by working together with him on \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration. I have seen first hand \nSenator Dayton's tireless efforts to protect the interests of his \nState.\n  During his political career, Senator Dayton has held many leadership \nroles for Minnesota, including commissioner of the Minnesota Department \nof Energy and Economic Development, State auditor, and, most recently, \nU.S. Senator.\n  As the eldest of 4 children, he grew up knowing what it meant to set \na good example. I have no doubt that Senator Dayton will continue to \nserve as a shining example for his two sons.\n  I know that Senator Dayton's love for public service--and for \nMinnesota--will remain strong in the future, and I wish him well.\n\n\n                              MIKE DeWINE\n\n  Mr. President, Mike DeWine has spent more than three decades in \nservice to his State and the Nation.\n  Senator DeWine has maintained a reputation of integrity throughout \nhis service as a State senator, Lieutenant Governor, four-term \nCongressman, and U.S. Senator. He has built a record of service on \nmaking our Nation and the world a better place for future generations.\n  A father of eight and grandfather of nine, Senator DeWine is a \ndevoted family man.\n  He is a champion of children's causes, always focusing on protecting \ntheir welfare and safety.\n  Senator DeWine has often reached across party lines to vote with his \nheart for issues in which he believes.\n  His hard work and devotion will be missed by the people of Ohio, whom \nI know are grateful for his years of service.\n\n\n                             LINCOLN CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. President, it is no coincidence that Senator Lincoln Chafee's \nhome State has an 11-foot-tall statue called the Independent Man \nstanding atop the State House in Providence, RI. In fact, Senator \nChafee has referred to this statue as his inspiration, as it represents \nRhode Island's founding principles of political and religious freedom.\n  Senator Chafee has done an admirable job following in the footsteps \nof his father, Senator John Chafee.\n  During his time in the Senate, Senator Chafee has been committed to \nenvironmental issues as a champion for improved air and water quality.\n  Senator Chafee has remained steadfast in his beliefs and a powerful \nvoice for Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             RICK SANTORUM\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Rick Santorum has a distinguished career \nserving the people of Pennsylvania.\n  Everyone knows he is a hard worker who is defined by his \ndetermination, commitment to a core set of values, and unyielding \noptimism.\n  His strong leadership in the Senate led Senator Santorum to be \nelected chairman of the Senate Republican Conference in 2001.\n  I have had the opportunity to work on a number of projects with \nSenator Santorum as the vice chairman of the Senate Republican \nConference. He joined with me in supporting and organizing numerous \nleadership summits, which gave us opportunities to reach new \nconstituencies. These summits have been outstanding, and their success \nwas due in large part to our cooperation and Senator Santorum's \nleadership.\n  Throughout his tenure in the Senate, he has committed himself to \nhelping American families.\n  He believes profoundly in the dignity of all human life and has \nconsistently fought for measures that protect the most vulnerable among \nus. He has supported initiatives to strengthen and protect Social \nSecurity, provide access to affordable health care, and stop the HIV/\nAIDS epidemic.\n  Senator Santorum's passion and commitment to his work is an admirable \nquality that will be missed. It has been an honor to serve with him in \nthe Senate.\n\n\n                              JIM JEFFORDS\n\n  Mr. President, today we say goodbye to Senator Jim Jeffords after 18 \nyears in the Senate, serving the State of Vermont.\n  Throughout his years in the Senate, Senator Jeffords has remained \nsteadfast in his convictions and beliefs.\n  As a proud citizen of the State of Vermont, Senator Jeffords has made \nenormous efforts to ensure the interests of his State were represented \nin the U.S. Congress.\n  This is the legacy Senator Jeffords has earned.\n  As a staunch proponent of environmental issues, Senator Jeffords rose \nto leadership as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nin 2001, and he currently serves as the committee's ranking member.\n  Senator Jeffords leaves the Senate with my respect.\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\n                              CONRAD BURNS\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Conrad Burns has had a long and distinguished \ncareer in the Senate as Montana's longest serving Republican Senator.\n  Since 1988, Senator Burns has represented his constituents with honor \nin the Senate. He has made sure that Montana's unique, rural economy is \nsustained through his support of balanced trade, high-tech investments, \nand small business.\n  Since serving as chairman of the Communications Subcommittee in 1997, \nhe has continually fought for the rollout of broadband in rural areas \nand pushed for new Internet and mobile phone technologies to help \nMontanans participate in our global economy.\n  Senator Burns' love for the outdoors has made him a steward of our \ncountry's natural resources. As chairman of the Senate's Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have watched him work tirelessly to \nprotect and provide for our National parks and forests. Our natural \nresources are being protected thanks to the work of Senator Burns. I \nknow he is looking forward to returning to Montana and the great \noutdoors.\n  He has been an ardent supporter of making Government more fiscally \nresponsible and lowering our taxes, and he was often an ally on issues.\n  His leadership and strong conviction to do what is right will be \nsorely missed.\n\n\n                             PAUL SARBANES\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes, the son of Greek immigrants, \nembodies the very heart of the American dream.\n  Senator Sarbanes' parents, who never received a college education, \ninstilled in him the belief that no matter where you go and what you \nsee, you should always stand by your principles and never forget your \nroots.\n  He became a Rhodes Scholar.\n  Senator Sarbanes served the people of Baltimore with distinction and \nhonor in the Maryland Legislature before coming to Washington to \nrepresent them on a national level.\n  After a period of service in the House of Representatives, he was \nelected to the Senate in 1976. Since then, he has held numerous \npositions within the Senate.\n  Most recently, he served as the ranking member of the Senate Banking, \nHousing and Urban Affairs Committee and as a senior member of the \nForeign Relations, Budget, and Joint Economic Committees.\n  Today we bid him farewell after five terms in the U.S. Senate, which \nmakes him the longest tenured Senator in Maryland's storied history.\n  Paul is a good friend, and I will miss him.\n\n\n                               BILL FRIST\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude with Dr. Bill Frist, who has \ndedicated his life to helping people.\n  Though many of us have come to know Dr. Frist best in his current \nrole as our leader, his contributions to America exceed elected office.\n  Dr. Frist first came to Washington in 1972 as an intern for Tennessee \nCongressman Joe Evins. Congressman Evins told the young intern that \nshould he ever want to serve in Congress, he should first excel in a \nprofession other than politics and then bring that experience back to \nWashington.\n  Dr. Frist did just that.\n  During a stellar 20-year career in medicine, Dr. Frist performed over \n150 heart and lung transplant procedures, including the first lung \ntransplant and the first pediatric heart transplant in Tennessee and \nthe first successful combined heart-lung transplant in the Southeast.\n  He always hoped to one day serve America at a broad policy level, \nwhere he could advance medicine and improve the quality of life of the \nNation.\n  Dr. Frist returned to Washington in 1994, becoming the first \npracticing physician elected to the Senate since 1928. As a U.S. \nSenator, Bill Frist has been one of the leading voices on health issues \nin America today.\n  He moved quickly up the leadership ranks, becoming deputy whip in \n1999, chairman of the NRSC in 2000, and finally majority leader in \n2002.\n  In the Senate, Dr. Frist has worked tirelessly to strengthen \nMedicare, provide seniors with better access to prescription drugs, \nreduce health care disparities among races, and make health care more \naffordable and accessible.\n  He has also been one of America's strongest advocates for increasing \nfunding for global HIV/AIDS. He sponsored landmark legislation to \nprovide $15 billion to combat global HIV/AIDS in African and Caribbean \nnations hardest hit by the disease. This law will literally save \nmillions of lives and stands as one of the greatest public health \naccomplishments in modern history.\n  Many of us also remember Dr. Frist utilizing his medical skills in \n1998, when a gunman shot and killed two U.S. Capitol Police officers in \nthe capitol. The gunman was also shot and seriously wounded during the \nincident. Dr. Frist came to the aid of Officer Jacob Chestnut, who \nlater died of his wounds, as well as the gunman, who survived because \nof Dr. Frist's actions.\n  After the event, Dr. Frist told Capitol reporters:\n  At the time, I did not know he was the alleged gunman, and in truth, \nas a physician, you try to focus on resuscitation.\n  People have said ``If you knew that, would things have changed?'' And \nthe answer is, ``No.''\n  ``As a physician, you're trained to focus, and that's what you do \nyear after year. You're not a judge; you're not a jury. You're a \nphysician.''\n  Dr. Frist never stopped being a physician. Throughout his 12 years in \nthe Senate, he always had the Nation's health in mind. He was always a \nchampion of medicine, and his class and integrity is unquestioned.\n  The Senate will truly miss his leadership, and we will miss all of \nour departing friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11721-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11721-S11722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            APPAREL IMPORTS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the assurances \nmy friend and colleague from Oregon and I have received from U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, USTR, Susan Schwab and Assistant Secretary of Commerce \nDavid Spooner about the import monitoring program on Vietnamese \ntextiles and apparel. In response to concerns raised by Senator Dole \nand Senator Graham about the impact of Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations, PNTR, for Vietnam, Ambassador Schwab and Secretary of \nCommerce Carlos Gutierrez wrote a letter stating their intention to \nmonitor U.S. textile and apparel imports from Vietnam and self-initiate \nantidumping investigations if the normal elements of an antidumping \ncase can be demonstrated. The Commerce Department will conduct a review \nevery 6 months, and the program will last until the end of this \nadministration. I ask the Senator from Oregon if he is aware of the \nconcerns that have been raised about this program.\n  Mr. SMITH. I am aware of the concerns, and I want to thank the senior \nSenator from California for her leadership on this issue. The apparel \nindustry is a very important segment of Oregon's economy, and my \nconstituents back home are watching this issue very closely. There is a \ngreat deal at stake here for Oregon companies such as Nike, Inc., and \nColumbia Sportswear that source apparel from Vietnam. These companies \nprovide thousands of well-paying jobs to workers in my State and infuse \nbillions of dollars into Oregon's economy. I have heard from them and \nother U.S. retailers about the impact the proposed monitoring program \nwill have on their businesses as unilateral actions such as this can \nhave a significant chilling effect on companies' sourcing strategies.\n  Unfortunately, the administration did not give the apparel and retail \nindustry due consideration in its decision to monitor textile and \napparel products from Vietnam. I am disappointed that the \nadministration chose to use our trade remedy laws as a tool in the \nlegislative process and not consult with other Members of Congress or \nthe retail industry before agreeing to create a new monitoring process. \nI share the concerns of my constituents that this program will burden \nand discriminate against trade in textiles and apparel from Vietnam.\n  I was pleased that the senior Senator from California agreed to send \na letter with me to USTR and Commerce asking for assurances that the \nprogram would be implemented in a manner fully consistent with U.S. law \nand our obligations in the World Trade Organization, WTO, and that no \nnew precedent would be set; the program would not establish any \nadditional burdens for importers and exporters of Vietnamese textiles \nand apparel; and U.S. textile and apparel importers and retailers will \nhave the opportunity to review and comment on how the program is \ndeveloped.\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree with the Senator from Oregon's description of \nour concerns and the assurances we are seeking from the administration. \nThis matter was first brought to my attention by key retail \nconstituents in my State including companies like Gap, Inc., Liz \nClaiborne, and Limited Brands. Retailers have expressed their concern \nthat the import monitoring program would create too much \nunpredictability and force companies to modify their sourcing \nstrategies and accept the risk of and potential additional cost of \nantidumping investigations and antidumping duties. They share the \nconcern expressed by the Senator from Oregon that the retail industry \nwas not consulted before the administration committed to setting up the \nprogram. I was happy to join the Senator from Oregon on the letter to \nUSTR and Commerce, and I had hoped that we would receive a response \nbefore a vote on PNTR on the Senate floor. Is it the Senator's \nunderstanding that we will not receive a response to our concerns \nbefore the vote?\n  Mr. SMITH. It is my understanding that lawyers from USTR and Commerce \nhave advised Ambassador Schwab and Secretary Gutierrez that because a \nnotice has been placed in the Federal Register announcing the creation \nof the import monitoring program and soliciting public comment, they \ncannot provide a substantive written response to our letter. \nNevertheless, Ambassador Schwab and Assistant Secretary of Commerce \nSpooner graciously agreed to meet with the Senator from California and \nme to provide us with more information about the import monitoring \nprogram and how it will be implemented.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator from Oregon is correct. We had a robust \nand substantive discussion. Ambassador Schwab and Assistant Secretary \nSpooner assured us that the import monitoring process will be fully \nconsistent with U.S. law and applicable WTO rules. No new precedent \nwould be set. In addition, they also agreed that the import monitoring \nprocess should not harm U.S.-Vietnam textile and apparel trade, and \nthey assured us that no additional reporting requirements or other \nburdens would be placed on importers of textiles and apparel from \nVietnam. This means that it is their intention that monitoring will be \nbased upon information already collected in the normal customs entry \nprocess or otherwise available to the Government. Finally, they assured \nus that the views of our constituents and all Members of Congress would \nbe taken into account as the process is developed. Is that the \nSenator's understanding?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, the Senator from California is correct. \nSpecifically, USTR and Commerce told us that it is their intention that \nany investigation would only cover those textile and apparel products \nimported from Vietnam which are like or identical to a product also \nproduced in the United States. This also means that, consistent with \nU.S. law, the domestic producer will have to request monitoring and \nsupply information about their employment levels and production. This \nmakes sense to me because why would the U.S. Government monitor a \nproduct from Vietnam that is not produced in the United States or that \nthe U.S. domestic industry is not interested in being monitored in the \nfirst place? It is also my understanding that according to U.S. law, \nany finding of critical circumstance, which would trigger preliminary \nantidumping duties, would only be made during the course of an \ninvestigation and not in advance of an investigation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's commitment \nand hard work on this issue. With the assurances from Ambassador Schwab \nand Assistant Secretary Spooner, I will support legislation granting \npermanent normal trade relations status to Vietnam. Would the Senator \nfrom Oregon agree that we will continue to follow this process closely \nto ensure that USTR and Commerce live up to their commitments and \nimplement this program in a manner that is fully consistent with U.S. \nlaw and our WTO obligations?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I agree with the senior Senator from \nCalifornia, and I would like to thank her for standing with me on this \nimportant matter. I too will support PNTR for Vietnam. Both of us are \ncommitted to a strong and mutually beneficial United States-Vietnam \ntrade relationship. Both of us understand how important the vibrant and \ngrowing Vietnam market is to our constituents. I look forward to \nworking with the senior Senator from California to provide effective \noversight of the monitoring program and ensure that the voice of \nretailers across the country are heard in the discussion of U.S. trade \npolicy. I trust Ambassador Schwab when she told us that she intends to \nhave this monitoring process work in the way we discussed in our \nmeeting. As the senior Senator from California knows, we have many \ndifficult trade initiatives that we will consider next year. I, for \none, will measure my willingness to work with the administration on \nthese upcoming initiatives, in part, based on the good faith of the \nadministration in implementing this monitoring process in a fair and \nnormal way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11722-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11722-S11723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE DIETARY SUPPLEMENT AND NONPRESCRIPTION DRUG CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today Congress acted in the interest of the \npublic health by passing the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription \nDrug Consumer Protection Act. I am extremely pleased that the House has \nnow passed this bill and sent it to the White House for the President's \nsignature. This legislation would require manufacturers of dietary \nsupplements and all manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs to report \nserious adverse events to FDA.\n  The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, DSHEA \nensures that a broad array of dietary supplements are available to \nAmerican consumers. DSHEA protects consumer choice and access to \ndietary supplements that are safe and properly labeled.\n  This bill will preserve the safety and availability of dietary \nsupplements that benefit so many Americans. Although many dietary \nsupplement manufacturers already give FDA reports they may receive \nregarding adverse events associated with their products, they are not \nrequired to do so. This legislation would add that requirement, while \nkeeping safe supplements available to consumers.\n  This proposal adds a new reporting requirement for dietary \nsupplements and all manufacturers of over-the-counter, OTC, drugs to \nreport serious adverse events to FDA. This is an entirely new \nrequirement for supplements. Some OTC drug manufacturers are already \nrequired to report serious adverse events.\n  The reporting would be limited to serious adverse events. We are \ntalking about the kind of information FDA really needs--reports of \ndeath, a life-threatening experience, hospitalization, a persistent or \nsignificant disability or incapacity, or a congenital anomaly or birth \ndefect.\n  To ensure that unscrupulous competitors cannot damage legitimate \nbusinesses, the bill makes it a prohibited act to make a deliberately \nfalse adverse event report to a manufacturer or to the FDA.\n  The bill also sets a 15-day time limit for manufacturers to turn over \nreports of serious adverse events they receive. They must keep the \nreports for 6 years, and FDA is allowed to inspect the manufacturer's \nrecords of adverse event reports.\n  This new Federal requirement would replace any potential state \nrequirements. However, States would still work with FDA on safety \nissues.\n  And safety is what this bill is all about. You need good data to make \ngood decisions. Most dietary supplements are safe and should be \navailable to consumers. But just in case one isn't, FDA needs to have \naccurate, current information to decide when to act and what to do. \nThis bill will help the agency get that information.\n  This bill is the result of a tremendous amount of work across party \nlines. I want to thank my colleagues Senators Hatch and Harkin here on \nthe committee, and Senator Durbin, for getting this bill started. I \nwould also like to express my deep appreciation and thanks to the \nranking member, Senator Kennedy, for his hard work during this process. \nWe have produced a fair bill, and I am so pleased my colleagues on both \nsides of the Capitol have lent it their support.\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11722-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11722-S11723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE DIETARY SUPPLEMENT AND NONPRESCRIPTION DRUG CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nSenate's unanimous passage of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment \nModernization Act earlier this week. It has been 25 years since the \nfirst AIDS diagnosis in the United States. At present, approximately \n40,000 Americans are newly infected with this disease each year, and \nmore than half of those diagnoses are in people under age 25. This is a \ndisease that has taken its toll on millions of individuals and \nfamilies, but as a result of combined Federal, State and local efforts \nto support individuals living with this disease as well as advances in \ntreatment options, many Americans living with HIV/AIDS continue to have \nthriving, productive lives.\n  Since 1990, when the Ryan White CARE Act was first authorized, we \nhave made incredible strides in treating and caring for individuals in \nthe United States affected by HIV/AIDS. The number of new infections \neach year has dropped from more than 100,000 in 1990 to approximately \n40,000 today. Mother-to-child transmission has dropped from 2,000 to \nfewer than 200 cases annually. Life expectancy for those with the \ndisease has increased by almost 20 years. In fact, more people are now \nliving with AIDS in the United States than at any other time in the \nepidemic.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act is at least partially responsible for these \nsuccesses. But there is much more work to be done. It is estimated that \nmore than a quarter of those infected with HIV do not know it, and many \nwho do know it still do not have access to needed care and services. \nAnd HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects the poor and minorities. \nAfrican Americans account for up to 54 percent of new HIV infections \nand Latinos account for 19 percent of new infections, though they \naccount for only approximately 12 percent and 13 percent of the U.S. \npopulation, respectively. Hispanic and African-American women account \nfor 82 percent of new infections among females in the United States.\n  For many years I have been particularly concerned about the impact \nthis disease has on children and families. Last year, Senator Bond and \nI introduced legislation to reauthorize and strengthen title IV of the \nRyan White CARE Act. For those who are unfamiliar with title IV, it \nprovides grants for coordinated care, services, and research for women, \ninfants, children, and youth. The programs and services funded by title \nIV have kept families alive and together. For example, title IV \nprojects have led the way toward reducing mother-to-child transmission \nfrom more than 2,000 babies born HIV-positive each year to fewer than \n200. In my home State of Connecticut, a total of 213 babies have been \nborn to HIV-positive mothers since 2002. Of that total, only one baby \nhas been confirmed as HIV-positive.\n  The bill passed earlier this week by the Senate contains many \nsignificant improvements to title IV that were part of the legislation \nSenator Bond and I introduced. I believe those changes will improve the \ntreatment and services for women, families, and youth provided under \nthe Ryan White CARE Act. However, I am deeply disappointed in the \nauthorization level for title IV contained in the bill. All other \ntitles of this bill authorize increases in funding except title IV, \nwhich is flat funded. I pushed hard to secure a comparable increase for \ntitle IV, and although I am disappointed with the final outcome, I \nrealize this is an authorization bill, not an appropriations bill, and \nI will work to secure increased funding for this critical title.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the 109th Congress will come to a \nclose without the House and Senate having passed a Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2007. It is a failure on the part \nof the leaders in the House and Senate that we did not debate this bill \nand have an opportunity to increase funding for the Ryan White CARE \nAct. As we look to the next Congress, I urge my colleagues and the \nwhole advocacy community to join me in fighting for providing adequate \nfunding for this program.\n  I believe that the bill passed unanimously in the Senate is a fair \ncompromise which stabilizes funding for cities and States and urban and \nrural areas for the next 3 years. Without this legislation, 17 States--\nincluding Connecticut--and the District of Columbia stand to lose \nmillions of dollars next year. This legislation is now before the House \nof Representatives. It is my hope that the house will act quickly to \npass this legislation so that these States and the District do not \nexperience a disruption in critical care and treatment services for \npeople living with HIV/AIDS.\n  In closing, I want to commend the hard work of the members and their \nstaff in both Chambers who developed this bipartisan, bicameral \ncompromise bill over the past 2 years. In particular, I would like to \nrecognize Connie Garner with Senator Kennedy and Shana Christrup with \nSenator Enzi who worked tirelessly to incorporate the priorities of \nmany offices. I would also like to thank the many public health \nadvocacy organizations who contributed to the development of this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11723-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE RELATIONS TO VIETNAM\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, in relation to the extension of \npermanent trade relations to Vietnam that the Senate is in the process \nof considering this evening, there is a finding in the bill that I want \nto call to the Senate's attention. The finding notes that, ``Vietnam \nhas taken cooperative steps with the United States under the United \nStates Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, formerly the Joint Task Force-\nFull Accounting, established in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush to \nprovide the fullest possible accounting of MIA and POW cases.''\n  I serve as the cochairman of the U.S./Russia Joint Commission on POW/\nMIAs, and also have several close friends who have family members who \nare POW/MIAs and continue to search for their family members and for \ninformation that will bring them closure regarding their fate.\n  I think we can all agree that Vietnam has in fact taken cooperative \nsteps along the lines of POW/MIA accounting with the United States. \nHowever, I think we can also all agree that Vietnam needs to take \nadditional steps in this area. Specifically, I believe there are \nadditional steps that Vietnam can take in providing the United States \naccess to archives regarding POW/MIA cases in Laos and Cambodia. Cases \nof US service members lost in Laos and Cambodia are particularly \ndifficult to resolve due to the difficulty of access to both archival \ninformation and the actual locations where service members are \npresumably missing.

I am \nextremely pleased that the Senate passed this bill and sent it to the \nWhite House for the President's signature.\n  This anticipated law has a long history. Senators Santorum and Dodd \nworked diligently with me, Senator Kennedy, and our staffs for the past \n2 years to develop this crucial piece of legislation to assist \nindividuals living with autism and other developmental disabilities and \ntheir families. This legislation focuses on expanding autism research \nand coordination of that research at the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, and increasing awareness of autism and its manifestation through \nthe Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, CDC. In addition, the \nbill integrates the country's various\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\nhealth, education, and disability programs serving children and \nfamilies affected by autism. Finally, the bill provides a greater voice \nto the community of people affected by this disorder.\n  No one knows the cause of autism or exactly how many children are \naffected by autism and autism spectrum disorders; however, some studies \nsuggest the numbers could be as high as 1 out of every 166 American \nchildren. But there are many things we do know about autism.\n  We know that early intervention is critical to helping children with \nautism reach their full potential. The earlier the intervention, the \ngreater the chance a child has to grow and learn how to live with the \ndisorder. Given the importance of early intervention, this bill will \nexpand the necessary research to study the possible causes of autism \nespecially at the critical early childhood development stages.\n  Also, we need greater understanding about the various forms of autism \nso that we can improve our ability to provide the right kinds of \nintervention and support. Finally, we need to provide better \nintegration of the health, education, and disability programs already \navailable to meet the anticipated and increasing demand for these \ninterventions, supports, and services in the future.\n  The Combating Autism Act is an important step to address these needs \nand to find solutions that will improve the lives of children and \nfamilies whose daily lives have been disrupted by autism.\n  I would like to close by adding my congratulations to the people who \nhave had a key role in drafting and passing this key piece of health \ncare legislation. First, I would like to thank my colleagues and their \nstaff both in the Senate and in the House for their hard work in \npassing this critical legislation. I want to thank all the members of \nthe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nespecially my friend and ranking member, Senator Kennedy, for his hard \nwork and determination to seeing this bill become law. In addition, I \nwould like thank and our colleagues in the House, Chairman Barton and \nRepresentatives Bono and DeGette.\n  This bill is the result of a tremendous amount of work across party \nlines. I want to thank the original bill cosponsors, Senators Santorum \nand Dodd, for introducing this legislation and for working with me to \nfine-tune it. They are to be commended for taking the lead on this \nissue and for the tremendous effort they put into making sure that some \nday we have a solution to autism.\n  Of course, in providing thanks to the Members, I would be remiss if I \ndid not mention the staff. I would like to specifically acknowledge \nRandy Pate and Ryan Long, with Chairman Barton's office; Caya Lewis \nwith Senator Kennedy's office; Jen Vesey with Senator Santorum; Jim \nFenton, Ben Berwick, Tamar Magarik, and Elizabeth Hoffman with Senator \nDodd; and Elizabeth Hall with Majority Leader Frist.\n  Finally, I would like to give thanks to my staff, both past and \npresent--Shana Christrup, Steve Northrup, Aaron Bishop, Brittany Moore, \nTec Chapman, and Martina Bebin, all on my health and disability \noutreach teams, for their diligence and determination as we worked \ntogether to craft this important and essential bill. I also would like \nto thank Katherine McGuire, who as my staff director has provided the \nleadership and guidance to ensure that this bill made it into law.\n  This process involved many dedicated staffers and many late nights. \nStaff were crucial in helping us reach the final compromise.\n  I also want to thank the various groups and individuals who work on \nbehalf of children and families affected by autism and other \ndevelopmental disabilities. There are so many people, primarily parents \nof children who have autism or an autism spectrum disorder, who have \nworked for years to see this day come to fruition that I cannot thank \neach one of them individually, but they should know that I greatly \nappreciate their tireless efforts, determination, unlimited patience, \nand commitment to seeing this bill was passed on behalf of their \nchildren and all people living with autism, autism spectrum disorder, \nor other developmental disabilities.\n  This is a comprehensive piece of legislation that will take the next \nsteps toward providing greater research so that we can provide children \nwith autism early intervention to enable them to grow and reach their \nfull potential. I am proud that we are taking this step to pass the \nCombating Autism Act.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am extremely grateful that my \nSenate colleagues considered and passed the Combating Autism Act \nyesterday, following the House's passage yesterday afternoon. The \nCombating Autism Act promotes early detection, early evidence-based \ninterventions, research, and services for individuals with autism. It \nalso reauthorizes the epidemiologic surveillance programs at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. This legislation is \nabsolutely vital for the hundreds of thousands of families across \nAmerica who struggle each and every day with autism, and I commend my \nSenate colleagues for passing it today so that the President can sign \nit into law before the end of the year.\n  Autism has a profound effect on children and their families. It \naffects a child's ability to communicate and to form relationships with \nothers. Some children with autism are relatively high functioning, \nwhile others suffer from serious language delays, motor problems, and \nrigid behaviors. Because autism is a spectrum disorder, symptoms range \nfrom mild to extremely severe. Many children with autism will require \nlifelong care.\n  Mr. President, health care for individuals with autism over their \nlifetimes costs approximately $35 billion per year. By 2015, the annual \ncost of care could reach an estimated $300 billion, but this figure can \nbe cut in half with early diagnosis, services, and intervention. I \nbelieve strongly that to reduce the economic burden for individuals \nwith autism and to ensure that children have a chance to achieve their \nhighest potential and live productive and independent lives as adults, \nwe must support aggressive efforts to understand what causes autism and \nto improve early screening, diagnosis, and services for individuals and \ntheir families who live with autism every day.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, the prevalence of autism in the \nUnited States is 10 times greater now than a decade ago. It is \nestimated that about 1 in 166 children born today will be diagnosed \nwith autism by the time they reach school age, up from one in 10,000 in \n1987. In my own State of Connecticut, autism diagnoses have increased \neleven-fold since 1993. We simply must provide answers to all those \naffected by this devastating condition, and the Combating Autism Act is \na critical first step.\n  There are many theories as to why autism diagnoses have increased. \nSome have suggested that it is simply a reflection of better diagnostic \ntools and measures. Other theories focus on genetic or environmental \nfactors. But the fact is that when it comes to autism, we do not know \nwhat causes it, we do not know exactly how to diagnose it, and we still \ndo not know how best to intervene.\n  What we do know is that growing numbers of children and their \nfamilies suffer from and cope with this disorder, and we simply must do \nmore to bring hope to all who are in its grip. This is why the \nCombating Autism Act is so important. By expanding the Federal response \nto autism and other developmental disabilities through the Combating \nAutism Act, we will see improved research on autism, including its \ncauses, and families across America will get the services they so \nurgently need.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleagues in the Senate and the House \nfor acting on this important legislation. Although the Combating Autism \nAct has undergone some modification since the Senate first passed it in \nAugust of this year, and it is by no means a perfect bill, it provides \nan essential starting point in what I hope will be an ongoing \nlegislative effort to provide hope and answers to the families across \nAmerica who live and cope with autism every day. I am hopeful that the \nPresident will sign it into law before the end of the year. In my view, \nwe must not lose the momentum that has brought us here today. Those \nchildren and their\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\nfamilies living with autism deserve our support now, and they deserve \nanswers.\n  I'd like to conclude by thanking my colleagues, Senator Santorum, \nChairman Enzi, ranking member Senator Kennedy, and their staffs, as \nwell as Chairman Barton and ranking member Representative Dingell and \ntheir staffs, for their extraordinary hard work on this bill. I also \nwish to offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to all of the \nindividuals who are personally affected by autism and the many advocacy \ngroups who represent them for their continued dedication and passionate \ncommitment to this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11725-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                 CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about two \nissues that are of great importance to Vermonters--sustainable \nagriculture and environmental protections. Over the years, I have \nfought for education dollars when it seemed none were available. I have \nfought to protect the environment when its champions were few. But my \ngreatest priority has been to find ways to ensure that Vermont \nagriculture, the lifeblood of our economy and our culture, remains \nsustainable and competitive into the future.\n  I have worked successfully in both the House and the Senate to help \nassure dairy farmers of a fair and stable price for their milk, through \nthe dairy compact and MILC Program. I have worked hard to provide \nstrong Federal support for conservation programs, helping farmers to be \ngood stewards of the land, while never comprising my commitment to \nenvironmental protection. I have supported the cider and cheese \nindustries in the face of increasing Federal regulation and have \npromoted tax policy that allows for the intergenerational transfer of \nfarms.\n  Today, I stand before you somewhat perplexed. For several months now, \ntwo of the issues where I have dedicated the majority of my time in \npublic service--the environment and agriculture--have been seemingly at \nodds with one another.\n  In some States, lawsuits have been brought against large agricultural \noperations under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation \nand Liability Act, CERCLA. I have been contacted by a number of Vermont \nfarmers very concerned about whether CERCLA applies to them and about \nwhat it would mean to be sued under this law.\n  In response to this concern, proposals have been made that would \nunnecessarily adopt expansive exemptions from the Superfund statute for \nmajor pollution streams stemming from very large agricultural \noperations. I cannot support these proposals that would eliminate one \nof the tools of last resort for communities with waters contaminated by \nlarge-scale animal feeding operations.\n\n  I have watched with regret as the face of American agriculture in \nsome regions has changed from one of the individual family, working \nhard to extract their living from their land, to one of the corporate \nexecutive, leading massive agribusiness operations. With this type of \nconsolidation, we have lost in many places, though not in Vermont, the \nreality of the hard-working family farming using sustainable practices. \nIn many parts of the Nation, we see massive animal feeding operations, \noften controlled by corporate interests located outside the State, \ncontributing significantly to local water quality problems. Allowing \nthese large operations to simply walk away from the damage that they \ncan cause to our local communities allows them to cut costs, tipping \nthe economic scales in their favor when compared with smaller farms \nthat have less environmental impacts. I wish to do everything in my \npower to ensure that this scenario never becomes the norm in Vermont.\n  Vermonters have a long tradition of strong feelings about water \nquality. In 1972, when the Clean Water Act was adopted by Congress, our \nNation was faced with a water pollution crisis. Toxic materials were \nroutinely dumped into pristine water bodies by industrial polluters. It \nwas standard practice in municipalities to have underground pipes \ndeliver raw sewage from homes directly into rivers and streams without \nany intervening treatment. Citizens demanded action to solve our \nenvironmental problems. In 1970, I was the state attorney general of \nVermont. My office worked to create Vermont Act 252, which enacted the \ntoughest water pollution laws in the country at the time. I had the \nhonor of testifying before this Committee during Senator Muskie's \nchairmanship during the first phases of the debate on the 1972 Clean \nWater Act. Some of the concepts in Act 252 are today part of Federal \nwater pollution laws. One of my fondest memories from this period is of \nthe slogan, ``Jeffords Won't Let Them Do it in the Lake,'' which came \nabout as we successfully fought off efforts by International Paper to \ndump untreated waste into Lake Champlain.\n  Despite progress on wastewater treatment and point sources of \npollution like International Paper, by the mid-1980s, it was clear that \nwithout action on other water quality issues such as toxics like \nmercury and nonpoint source pollution from urban and agricultural \nsources, we would not be able to meet our clean water goals. In 1987, \nour own Senator Stafford of Vermont worked with champions like Senator \nJohn Chafee, Senator Mitchell, and Senator Bentsen to write the 1987 \nClean Water Act amendments, overcoming the third Presidential veto in \nthe act's history. Many of the key pieces of the 1987 amendments, in \nparticular, nonpoint source pollution, continue to resonate in our \nclean water debate today.\n  Despite our progress on these issues, there is much to be done. \nAccording to the EPA, the overwhelming majority of the population of \nthe United States--218 million people--live within 10 miles of a \npolluted river, lake or coastal water. Almost 40 percent of these \nwaters are not safe for fishing, swimming, boating, drinking water or \nother needs. The EPA estimates that nonpoint sources of pollution are \nresponsible for 50 percent of our water quality problems.\n  I discuss this history because it is relevant. I understand the \nimpacts of nonpoint sources of pollution on water quality. I also \nunderstand the importance of small-sca1e farming to my home State of \nVermont, and I do not believe that CERCLA is well suited, or was ever \nintended, to apply to the normal operations on Vermont-scale farms.\n  I am here today with my colleague from California, Senator Barbara \nBoxer, who will be taking over the helm of the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. I know that the committee will be in good \nhands.\n  I have written to Senator Boxer and asked her to consider an \nalternative approach that I have put together on this issue of animal \nmanure and CERCLA during the Committee's deliberations on this issue in \nthe 110th Congress. This proposal takes steps to equalize the playing \nfield between\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\nsmaller, Vermont-scale farms and large-scale agriculture. It would \nclarify that the normal application of fertilizer as described in the \nCERCLA statute includes the use of animal manure as fertilizer. I wrote \nto the EPA earlier this year asking them to take regulatory action for \nthat purpose and they refused.\n\n  The proposal does not change the existing provision in CERCLA, which \nprovides that Federal permitholders, when they are in compliance with \ntheir permit, are not subject to CERCLA litigation. Existing law \nensures that larger animal feeding operations that will be required to \nhold Clean Water Act permits and are more likely to have significant \nwaste streams should be protected from CERCLA litigation as long as \nthey are in compliance with the terms of their permit. My legislation \ntakes steps to provide similar assurances to smaller, Vermont-scale \nfarms that are generally not required to hold Clean Water Act permits. \nIt provides that an independent, third-party certification that a farm \nhas applied fertilizer to land in a manner that is in compliance with \nits nutrient management plan would serve as evidence for an affirmative \ndefense in the unlikely event that a CERCLA lawsuit would be filed \nagainst a small, Vermont-scale farm. I offer this extra assurance, even \nthough there is no record of farms of this scale having been sued under \nCERCLA, and even though such a lawsuit is an unlikely event given the \namount of material being handled at these small facilities and the \nstructure of CERCLA, which is designed to address major waste streams. \nFederal Officials and Environmental advocates understand, I think, that \nresorting to a Superfund lawsuit to gain compliance from a small farm \nwould be like using a sledge hammer to open a walnut.\n  Some have asked me: What does that actually get you? The independent \nthird-party certification offered as evidence during the course of any \ncivil or administrative proceeding would support the fact that the \nfacility properly used or applied animal manure to land in compliance \nwith its nutrient management plan. This presumption of fact could only \nbe overcome by contradictory evidence. I believe that the establishment \nof this affirmative defense will protect Vermont small-scale farmers \nfrom CERCLA litigation.\n  Mr. President, I will not be here in the next Congress to help my \ncolleagues find a way forward on this issue. I offer this idea as a \nstarting point in the debate after much discussion with Vermonters, \nfarmers, environmentalists, and legal and policy experts. We are all \nseeking the silver bullet that will help to maintain the American \ntradition of the small, family farm and allow us to make forward \nprogress on the persistent problem of nonpoint source pollution. This \nidea is my vision of how we can overcome this latest hurdle in our \nefforts to effectively deal with nonpoint source pollution and \nhopefully bridge the gap between two of my passions--sustainable, \nVermont-scale agriculture, and environmental progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11726-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                       IRAN CONFERENCE RESOLUTION\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, next week the Iranian \nGovernment and its President, Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad, will convene a 2-day \nconference in Tehran on the Holocaust.\n  The Iranians say their conference will bring together the vast array \nof ``opinions'' on the Holocaust. Allegedly more than 60 so-called \nscholars from 30 countries will participate.\n  I can only imagine the hatred that will be on display.\n  It is no secret that President Ahmadi-Nejad has a long history of \ndistortion of the truth and hatred for the Jewish people. It is also \nshocking that he has called for the destruction of the sovereign, \ndemocratic State of Israel.\n  But what is so revolting is how casually he tries to alter history \nand the memory of those who perished at the hands of the Nazis.\n  To make matters worse, Iran is holding this conference on \nInternational Human Rights Day\n  Last year at an Islamic conference in Saudi Arabia, the Iranian \nPresident told reporters that the Holocaust had been used as a tool of \npropaganda, stating that the scale of the Holocaust had been \nexaggerated. He also sent a 3,000-word letter to German Chancellor, \nAngela Merkel, outlining his arguments.\n  Now, the Iranians are trying to assure the world that this conference \nwill be free of anti-Semitism and that it will explore views of ``both \nsides.'' Both sides? It is clear that denial is one of the sides.\n  The Holocaust is an undeniable fact of history, and the upcoming \nconference will serve only to perpetuate intolerance. Eleven million \npeople in total, including six million Jews, were viciously murdered in \nNazi death camps. No one living in the rational world denies this fact.\n  The Iranian President has a clear track record of poisonous hatred. \nHe has stated that ``Israel must be wiped off the map.'' He also said \n``Anybody who recognizes Israel will burn in the fire of the Islamic \nnations' fury.''\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is poised to take up and \nadopt a resolution that I have drafted--along with Senators Biden and \nClinton--that condemns the Iranians and this sham conference.

SEQUEIRA\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to share my serious concern about \nthe implementation of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act, EEOICPA. Because of the gravity of my \nconcerns, I have placed a hold on a nomination currently pending before \nthis body--the nomination of Leon R. Sequeira to be Assistant Secretary \nfor Policy at the Department of Labor.\n  I harbor no ill will toward Mr. Sequeira. But I am furious with the \nfoot-dragging, the obstruction, and the neglect that have characterized \nthe administration's approach toward American citizens who took real \nrisks for our country during the cold war, who are suffering now, and \nwho need and deserve help.\n  It is my understanding that Mr. Sequeira's role will be to advise the \nDepartment of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao on policy development and \nprogram implementation. It is my hope that I can work through my \nnumerous concerns with the Department of Labor and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  The EEOICPA Program is supposed to compensate the thousands of cold \nwar veterans who worked for our country's nuclear weapons programs. \nTogether, these Federal agencies are responsible for administering the \nEEOICPA Program. Both agencies also play significant roles in the \nspecial exposure cohort SEC petition process.\n  As Congressman John Hostettler pointed out earlier this week, the SEC \npetition process was designed to provide a mechanism for workers to be \ngiven relief from government that ``frequently misled them about the \nhazards they were facing and failed to properly monitor their \nexposure.'' Among the workers who face just such a situation were the \nAmericans who worked at Rocky Flats in my State of Colorado.\n  Many of these individuals, who knowingly risked their own safety to \nprotect our democracy, have suffered from painful and debilitating \ndiseases, including cancer, and many have died as a result of their \nbrave service. Like Department of Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, I would \nhope that their Government could provide some measure of justice to \nthese patriots. She has stated that, ``My concern is that we take care \nof men and women who were harmed as a result of loyal service to their \ncountry. It is my hope that this program will repay them in some small \nway for all they've lost.''\n  Unfortunately, this program is repaying them with bureaucratic delays \nand a deck stacked against them. I believe our Government is failing to \nfulfill the promise and intent of the EEOICPA Program.\n  In Colorado, many people who worked at Rocky Flats were exposed to \nberyllium, radiation, and other hazards that have led to cancer and \ndeath. They filed a special exposure cohort petition over 17 months ago \nto receive compensation. Their petition has been delayed and obstructed \nat various levels and by several agencies. We have\n\n[[Page S11727]]\n\nbeen waiting for the administration to take action to ensure that the \ncomposition of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health is \nadjusted so that it will more fairly examine workers' claims, but the \nadministration has failed to act. Sadly, I fear that, to a great \nextent, these actions are the result of conscious decisions by certain \nagency officials.\n  Since the Department of Labor's mission is to foster and promote the \nwelfare of American workers, I hoped to work with the Department to \nensure that the quiet heroes of the Rocky Flats petition were \ncompensated. However, I have struggled to find common ground, and for \nsome of these workers, time is running out. Moreover, hearings held by \nthe House Judiciary Committee have left me with serious questions \nregarding their efforts to undermine the Rocky Flats and other SEC \npetitions in the name of cost containment and other shameful actions.\n  I hope to discuss these questions with Mr. Sequeira and other \nadministration officials and to get some firm commitments about \ncleaning up this process, moving forward fairly, and getting the Rocky \nFlats petition approved. Until then, I cannot in good faith allow this \nnomination to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11727-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2006\n\n  Mr. DORGAN, Mr. President, earlier today I spoke on the Senate floor \nabout the need to pass the Indian Health Care Improvement \nReauthorization bill. My colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Enzi, \nhave worked long and hard over the past several weeks to address the \nmany objections that have been raised by the Department of Justice and \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Those negotiations have brought clarity to the positions of the \nadministration and have helped to define how legislation can best \naddress the health crisis in Indian country. In an effort to \nmemorialize those discussions, I am joining Senators McCain and Enzi in \ncosponsoring the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2006. \nThe bill being introduced tonight reflects, to a significant extent, \nthe bill that the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs approved in \nOctober 2005. It also reflects the many hours of negotiations and \nmeetings with the administration, the Indian Affairs Committee, the \nFinance Committee, and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. In spite of the dedication of all those involved, however, \nthe bill reflects progress but not perfection.\n  I have talked to the tribal leaders who are advocates for Indian \nhealth care improvements about this bill. They, too, are pleased that \nwe have made some progress. But they, too, feel there have been too \nmany compromises and we must begin with a fresh view of how to improve \nthe health care of American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  When the 110th Congress convenes in January, I intend to work with \nIndian Country and my colleagues in the Senate and in the House to \nproduce a bill that will put solutions for Indian people front and \ncenter. We have spent far too much time these past 8 years focusing on \nlegalistic issues rather than on human needs. I thank Senator McCain \nand Senator Enzi for their leadership in bringing us to this important \njuncture and I look forward to working with them over the next 2 years \nto reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11727-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE PRIVATE DEBT COLLECTION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 authorized the IRS \nto hire private debt collection agencies to collect delinquent taxes. \nAn IRS pilot program was initiated this year, and the IRS expects to \nexpand the program in early 2007.\n  It is important that the program be administered by the IRS in a fair \nand responsible manner. Senator Nelson has proposed legislation, \nalready unanimously passed by the Senate, which would ensure 10 percent \nof the employees assigned to the IRS contract by the private agencies \nare persons with disabilities. This will not affect the ability of the \nprivate contractors to collect delinquent taxes, but it will greatly \naffect the ability of persons with disabilities to find gainful \nemployment that will promote their independence and well-being.\n  I commend Senator Nelson for his commitment to improve the quality of \nlife for persons with disabilities. I pledge to work with both of my \ngood friends, Senator Nelson and Senator Grassley, in the next session \nof Congress to support his efforts.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my good friend, Senator Baucus.\n  As my colleague knows, this legislation passed the Senate unanimously \nin November 2005 but unfortunately failed to be included in a \nconference report. It will create meaningful employment for persons \nwith disabilities and disabled veterans in the field of third-party \ndebt collection.\n  Especially with the large numbers of returning disabled veterans, \nemployment opportunities are urgently needed. Generally, the employment \nopportunities for persons with disabilities are not great--1 in 10 \nAmericans has a disability and the rate of unemployment is 70 to 80 \npercent. These private debt collection jobs are essentially highly paid \ncall center jobs with annual incomes averaging $40,000 and often come \nwith good health benefits and 401(k) plans.\n  This legislation is necessary since in letters and conversations with \nthe Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service they have \nstated that under existing GSA rules, they cannot set a specific number \nof awards aside for contractors employing significant numbers of \npersons with disabilities. My understanding is the GSA currently allows \na preference for a business that is owned by a disabled veteran, but it \ndoes not also allow a preference for a business that employs several \npersons with disabilities. This is an oversight which needs to be \ncorrected.\n  This legislation is supported by the Disabled American Veterans, the \nAmerican Legion, the American Legion Auxiliary, the American \nAssociation of People With Disabilities, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nand the Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I support Senator Nelson's efforts to create \nopportunities that will employ persons with disabilities and am hopeful \nthat these efforts can be in place before the IRS issues the next \nRequest for Quotes in March 2007. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and with the relevant agencies on this important matter.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my colleague and good friend from \nMontana for his commitment to such an important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11727-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11727-S11732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

This project, Mr. Majority leader, is \nthe only project in the entire WRDA bill--in the entire bill that I am \naware of--that was authorized in the last WRDA bill, but because of a \ntechnical error, it was left out. It was authorized, not in this WRDA \nbill--well it is, but in two, the last and this one.

But \nthis project has been signed off by Chairman Inhofe, by Senator Bond, \nand Senator Boxer because they recognize it is unique among projects.\n  I now understand it is being held up.

Mr. President, I am honored to speak to you today \nabout a school in my home State of Montana--the Winnett School. The \nDepartment of Education recently selected the Winnett School as 1 of \nonly 200 schools across the country to receive a Blue Ribbon. Winnett \nSchool, with just 95 students, is a wonderful example of how dedication \nand effort can lead to success in education.\n  To the students, teachers, parents, and administrators at Winnett, I \ncongratulate you on receiving this award. Being named a Blue Ribbon \nSchool is one of the highest recognitions in our country. With 120,000 \nschools nationwide, less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all the schools \nare honored. Your school is a model of success.\n  America today faces a world more intensely competitive than ever in \nour history. The coming decades will be a race for economic leadership. \nIf we are to succeed in a global economy, we must make education our \nfocus. Nothing is more important than providing every Montanan with a \nsolid education and the tools needed to succeed in life.\n  Winnett School should be an example to schools all over the country \nof what we can do if we make a real commitment to education. The \nstudents at Winnett have set the standard for excellence that we must \nencourage and expect at all schools.\n  I have always said that our Montana schools are the best in the \ncountry. And this week, the Department of Education has formally \nrecognized you as such.\n  Winnett School has succeeded because of the investment that teachers, \nstudents, parents and administrators make in the importance of a high-\nquality education. I applaud the teachers for their dedication to \nmaking sure that every student can succeed. Your energy is impressive \nand should be an example of what we can do with the support and \ncommitment from the entire community.\n  Your teachers go above and beyond their curriculum requirements. Each \nMonday the teachers meet at 8 a.m. to talk about whether any student in \nthe whole school is at risk of falling behind. If a student is \nstruggling, the staff together prepares a plan for the student and \nenlists the parents' help and cooperation. This dedication to the \nentire student community is evident in your students' commitment to \neducation and achievement in school. The school dropout rate is zero \nand has been for some time. The last student who dropped out of school \nwas over 10 years ago. That is way below the national dropout rate.\n  Not only do Winnett School students stay in school, but they excel in \na rigorous curriculum. All students take 4 years of math, science, \nEnglish, history, and government. Their test scores demonstrate a \ncommitment to achievement--92 percent of sophomores scored advanced or \nproficient in reading and 90 percent rated advanced or proficient in \nmath.\n  Students at Winnett School--you deserve this award. With your \nexcellent education, you have no boundaries to what you can accomplish. \nYou are the leaders of tomorrow.\n  Once again, congratulations on your Blue Ribbon Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11733-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING MR. BRANDON WEBB\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Mr. Brandon \nWebb of Ashland, KY. Mr. Webb was recently awarded the 2006 National \nLeague Cy Young Award.\n  Mr. Webb graduated from Paul G. Blazer High School in Ashland, KY, \nand went on to play baseball for the University of Kentucky. He began \nhis Major League career with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2003 and has \nsince become known for his devastating sinker. This season, Mr. Webb \nwent 16-8 with a 3.10 ERA and pitched in the 2006 Major League All-Star \nGame.\n  Introduced in 1956 to honor the late Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, \nthe Cy Young Award honors annually the best pitcher in each league in \nMajor League Baseball. The prestigious award is voted on by members of \nthe Baseball Writers Association of America.\n  As a former Major League pitcher, I understand the strength and \ncommitment it takes to reach such a high level of accomplishment. To be \nsingled out among so many great pitchers is truly an honor.\n  I congratulate Mr. Webb on this achievement. He is an inspiration to \nthe citizens of Kentucky and to aspiring athletes everywhere. I look \nforward to seeing all that he will accomplish in the future. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11733-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF MANDAN, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that celebrated its 125th anniversary earlier \nthis year. On February 25, 2006, the residents of Mandan kicked off a \nyearlong celebration of their community's history and founding.\n  Mandan is a vibrant community in west-central North Dakota, located \nalong the bank of the great Missouri River in Morton County. With \nhistoric roots dating back to 1100 A.D., when the first Native American \nsettlers arrived, Mandan is rich with history. The city of Mandan was \nincorporated on February 25, 1881, and named for the Mantani Indians, \nor ``people of the bank.'' With the development of the railroads and \nthe close proximity to the Missouri river, Mandan flourished and became \nknown as ``Where the West begins.''\n  Today, with a population of more than 16,000, Mandan remains tied to \nthe railroad, housing a major rail equipment maintenance facility.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that celebrated its 125th anniversary. On \nJuly 7-9, the residents of Thompson gathered to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Thompson is a growing community in eastern North Dakota, just 10 \nmiles south of Grand Forks. Settlers came to the area as early as 1874. \nWith the arrival of the railroad 5 years later, more pioneers came to \nsettle in the region. Founded in 1881 with the establishment of a post \noffice, the community name was changed from Norton to Thompson by \nresidents to avoid potential confusion with Norton, MN.\n  Thompson attracts people who like small town living but hold jobs in \nthe nearby city. Thompson residents also celebrate the values they \ninstill upon their children, because those are the same values taught \nto them years ago. The people of Thompson have worked for a sense of \ncommunity and, in doing so, have established ``Thompson Days,''\n\n[[Page S11734]]\n\na time to meet neighbors and celebrate the heritage of an entire area. \nThompson Days features a parade, garden tour, dances, craft shows, \nclassic car show, horseshoe tournament, and lots of other activities.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nThompson, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well through the next century. By honoring Thompson and all the \nother historic small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great \npioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places \nsuch as Thompson that have helped to shape this country into what it is \ntoday, which is why this fine community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Thompson has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11734-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE HAWTHORNE MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, Idahoans have a strong reputation \nfor being staunchly patriotic and supporting our military men and \nwomen. I am proud to say that this patriotism has its roots even in our \nchildren, as evidenced by the recent penny drive held at Hawthorne \nMiddle School in Pocatello, ID.\n  More than 500 seventh and eighth graders, with the help of teachers \nand administrators, raised $1,000 over the course of 3 weeks to \npurchase special gifts for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. That \n$1,000, mostly in change, required daily counting by the students and, \nfrom what I understand, taking it to the bank required multiple bags \nand boxes! In fact, 100,000 pennies weigh close to 700 lbs, so I am \ncertain that it was a heavy deposit despite the fact that it wasn't all \ncollected in pennies. This remarkable achievement and dedication to \nsupporting our military overseas deserves recognition and \ncongratulations. Hawthorne Middle school's success reflects a sense of \ncivic duty and national pride, refreshing in middle school students in \ntoday's world. This is indicative of the influence of strong families \nand strong educators at this Idaho school. I commend them on their \ngenerosity and commitment to our troops, and present Hawthorne Middle \nSchool students, parents, and teachers as models of patriotism, civic \nduty, and selfless giving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11734-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JEFF SINCLAIR\n\n Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Jeff \nSinclair, an outstanding Scoutmaster in the State of Wisconsin who \npassed away October 25, 2006, after a brave battle with cancer.\n  Jeff's involvement with the Boy Scouts began in 1998, when he became \na leader of St. Dominic's Cub Scout Pack 119. Beginning in 2001, he \nserved as Scoutmaster for St. John Vianney's Boy Scout Troop 71, and \ndespite his illness, he continued leading the group until his death.\n  During his tenure as Scoutmaster, Jeff mentored over 14 percent of \nhis Scouts--including both of his sons--to receive the Eagle Award, the \nhighest rank attainable within the Boy Scouts. This is a stark contrast \nto the national average of 4 percent of Scouts who receive the award. \nJeff's remarkable dedication and leadership to the group has earned him \nnumerous awards and commendations, and I believe he deserves our \nrecognition as well.\n  Jeff was also accepted as a member of the Boy Scout prestigious Order \nof the Arrow Honor Society, and his sons followed in his footsteps to \nattain the distinction. Clearly, not only did Jeff commit himself to \nserving others, but he inspired those around him to do the same.\n  Born on March 9, 1960, in Milwaukee to Dr. Eugene and Jean Sinclair, \nJeff was an accomplished individual who dedicated himself to helping \nothers. In 1983 he earned a business degree from Marquette University, \nand for the next several years, he used his skills and expertise to \nserve the State of Wisconsin through the Department of Revenue.\n  While Jeff was successful and well regarded in his career and \nthroughout Boy Scouts, his greatest priorities were his family and his \nfaith. A loving husband to wife Kathy and a dedicated father to four \nchildren--Matt, Andy, Maggie and Emma--Jeff found great joy in \nencouraging and supporting their endeavors. In addition to his devoted \ninvolvement with his sons' Boy Scout troop, Jeff often assisted with \nhis daughters' soccer teams. He was also very active in his home \nparish, St. Dominic's.\n  On behalf of my colleagues and myself, I want to remember Jeff \nSinclair for his dedication to his family, church, and community. \nUndoubtedly, he was a great friend, mentor, and source of joy to \ncountless individuals throughout the years, and he will be missed.\n  Mr. President, please join me in offering deepest sympathy to his \nwife, children, and parents. May they find peace and comfort knowing \nthat Jeff's legacy of serving, teaching, and empowering others will \nlast far into the future that this world is a better place because of \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11734-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JOHN R. GANTZ\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I recognize Dr. John R. Gantz for \nhis 43 years of distinguished service to the United States of America. \nDr. Gantz has provided faithful service to his Nation as a soldier, \neducator and as chief of the Troops to Teachers Program. A native of \nPennsylvania, Dr. Gantz earned a Bachelor of Science degree from East \nStroudsberg University, a Master's Degree in Adult Education from \nGeorge Washington University, and a Doctor of Education degree from the \nUniversity of Southern California.\n  After serving in the infantry with the U.S. Army at Fort Dix, he \ntaught mathematics and science for the Job Corps in New Jersey. He then \nbegan his civil service career as an education adviser in Virginia, \nfollowed by two similar assignments in Korea. During this time, he has \nserved as an education specialist, Headquarters Department of the Army; \nDirector of Education, U.S. Army Southern European Task Force, Vicenza, \nItaly; Deputy Director of Education, U.S. Army Forces Command, Atlanta \nGeorgia; and Deputy Director of the Defense Activity for Non-\nTraditional Education Support, DANTES.\n  In 1984, Dr. Gantz was selected as the DANTES European adviser. In \nthis position, he provided guidance and training to education \nprofessionals supporting military personnel throughout the United \nStates-European military commands. He has served on numerous advisory \nboards and been selected to participate in many national conferences as \nan expert in education programming. This year he was inducted into the \nInternational Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame in Dallas, \nTX.\n  Since 1994, Dr. Gantz has been the first and only chief of the \nfederally authorized Troops to Teachers Program. Under his dynamic and \ninnovative leadership, over 9,000 servicemembers from the Army, Air \nForce, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy have made the transition from \nmilitary careers to become K-12 public education classroom teachers and \nschool administrators. His superb dedication to develop a unique \nprogram that recruits special education, mathematics and science \nteachers for high-needs, low-income schools has provided countless \nstudents the benefit of learning with ``real world'' mentors and role \nmodels. His dedication to academic excellence, complete selflessness \nand visionary professionalism has brought great credit not only upon \nhimself, but also upon the Troops to Teachers Program and public \neducation everywhere.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in congratulating Dr. \nGantz for his dedicated service to our country. He has made a \nsignificant difference in both the U.S. Army and as chief of the Troops \nto Teachers Program. Once again, I thank Dr. Gantz for his many years \nof devoted service. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11734-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11734-S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EBENEZER AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate an \noutstanding and historic church from my home State of Michigan. This \nyear, Ebenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church of Detroit, \ncelebrates 135 years of service, learning and faith. This milestone \nprovides the perfect opportunity to reflect on the rich history of this \ninstitution and to remember the many individuals who played an integral \npart in its success.\n  The name ``Ebenezer'' means ``stone of help,'' and for 135 years, \nEbenezer African Methodist Episcopal Church has truly exemplified this \nmeaning. Ebenezer was established by a small\n\n[[Page S11735]]\n\ncongregation from Detroit's Colored Society under the leadership of \nRev. Gee C. Booth on November 2, 1871, to serve as a safe harbor for \nnewly freed slaves in Detroit. Rev C.H. Ward served as the first pastor \nfor 25 years. Three pastors from Ebenezer were elected to the office of \nBishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church--Bishop George W. \nBaber served as pastor from 1933 until he was elected in 1944; Bishop \nHubert Robison served as pastor from 1955 until he was elected in 1964; \nand Bishop Robert Thomas, Jr. served as pastor from 1972 until 1988. \nMore recently, Rev. Robert L. Phillips, who served as pastor from 1991 \nuntil 1997, became presiding elder of the north district of the \nMichigan Annual Conference in 1997.\n  Throughout its history, Ebenezer served as an institution fully \nengaged in the fight for civil and human rights. Ebenezer has also \nworked with the community to make Detroit a better city through \noutreach ministries, community involvement and financial investments. \nIn 1901, the church provided financial assistance to Henry Ford when he \napproached Ebenezer for support of endeavors to develop his automobile \ncompany. During the Depression, the church established an employment \nbureau and relief agency for families in need, and during WWII the \ncongregation housed soldiers in the dorms of the former church \nbuilding. Because of this rich history, in 2003, Ebenezer African \nMethodist Episcopal Church was designated a historical site by the \nDetroit Historical Commission.\n  Today, Ebenezer strives to continue this rich history through a \nvariety of ministries, including programs for young adults and the \nhomeless, as well as substance abuse and prison ministries. Ebenezer \nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church continues to stand as a ``stone of \nhelp'' under the leadership of Rev. Dr. H. Michael Lemmons. As the \nsixth oldest Black congregation in Detroit with members from four or \nmore generations, Ebenezer is full of memories of great historical \nmoments and faith that there are many more to come.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Ebenezer \nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church and wish its members, volunteers and \nministerial staff continued success as they celebrate their 135th \nanniversary. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11735-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE THUNDERCHICKENS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nThunderChickens on winning the 2006 FIRST Robotics Competition. This is \na tremendous accomplishment, and I am delighted to recognize the \nimpressive result of their hard work, dedication, and commitment.\n  The For Inspiration and Recognition in Science and Technology, FIRST, \nprogram provides aspiring engineers with an opportunity to develop and \nshowcase their talents by designing and implementing original robotic \ndesigns. Teams work together to build individual robots and compete \nagainst high school participants across the country.

Mr. President, today, I honor an important \nFloridian and a proud American. Virginia Scott Thomas was a loving wife \nand mother, a passionate volunteer, and a trailblazer for women in \nRepublican politics--I am very thankful that she was a constituent of \nmine. Sadly, she died this past month--but her legacy of hard work and \ndedication to good lives on.\n  Virginia Thomas should be commended for the work she put into \ncreating the Bay County Republican Women's Club. As part of her \nvolunteer work for the Republican Party, Virginia Thomas opened her \nhome to numerous GOP candidates--many of them to kick off their \ncampaigns. Her energy and hospitality were well known, and Republicans \nfrom Ronald Reagan to Charlie Crist had the pleasure of being welcomed \ninto her home. Candidates always spoke about their ideas and vision in \nfront of her now-famous raised fireplace hearth and her warm \nhospitality made her many friends.\n  Before calling Florida home, Virginia Thomas, a Birmingham, AL, \nnative, made history in her State. In 1943, she joined and became part \nof the first group of women Marines in the State of Alabama. She \ncompleted basic training in both South Carolina and Georgia and was \nthen sent to the U.S. Marine Corps base in El Centro, CA, to serve as a \nsupply officer. There in California, she met her future husband, Marine \nL.E. ``Tommy'' Thomas, and after the war ended, they headed for \nBirmingham. Eventually, she and her family moved to Florida, where \nVirginia Thomas became very active in their community.\n  Virginia Thomas will not be forgotten by the generations of \nFloridians that came to know her and her lively spirit. And because of \nher volunteerism and good work throughout more than 40 years in the Bay \nCounty area, she will be remembered long into the future. We will miss \nthis good Floridian. Yet we know that her legacy will be carried on by \nher family and friends. The good works of Virginia Scott Thomas will \nlive on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11735-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11735-S11736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING LINKS, INC.\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I recognize the North \nJersey Chapter of the Links, Inc.'s Linkages to Life Program, and honor \nthe program participants for their hard work and dedication to raising \nawareness about the importance of blood, tissue, marrow, and organ \ndonation among minority communities.\n  Each year, for the past 5 years, Links, Inc., in collaboration with \nRoche Pharmaceutical Company, conducted the Linkages to Life Program to \nhelp save lives by educating individuals of African descent about \nblood, tissue, marrow, and organ donation. With the help of a \npublication called Can We Talk? they were able to reach a large number \nof individuals, and educate them about how they can help save lives by \nbeing a volunteer donor. More specifically, the North Jersey Chapter \nprovided important education services to individuals and families in \nEssex, Hudson, Bergen, and Passaic Counties.\n  Today, approximately 93,000 people are awaiting transplant surgery, \nand 25 percent of the people awaiting transplants are of African \ndescent. In New Jersey, there are close to 3,000 individuals awaiting \nan organ transplant. Since organs are matched by a number of factors, \nincluding blood and tissue\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\ntyping, which can vary by race, patients are more likely to find \nmatches among donors of their same race or ethnicity. Given the large \nnumber of individuals of African descent awaiting transplants, it is \ncritical to increase the knowledge about donating blood, tissue, \nmarrow, and organs among all races and ethnicities.\n  Since 1996, our country reserves the second weekend in November to \nemphasize the need for life-saving and life-altering blood, organ, \nmarrow, and tissue donation in houses of worship throughout the United \nStates. This program is known as the National Organ Donor Sabbath, and \nNovember 10-12, 2006, marked the 10th anniversary celebration.\n  Links, Inc., is built on a foundation of friendship and service. \nToday, it contains a network or more than 10,000 African-American \nwomen. This year the motto for Links, Inc., is ``Seizing the \nOpportunity to Provide World Class Leadership, Friendship and \nService.'' The members of the North Jersey Chapter of Links, Inc., \nexemplify that motto.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the dedication and \ncommitment of the North Jersey Chapter of Link's, Inc., members to help \nothers. I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking these individuals \nfor helping fellow New Jerseyans live longer and healthier \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11736-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOYCE WOODBURN\n\n Mr. ROBERTS.

During her career, she has \nworked for 7 Presidents, 13 Directors of Central Intelligence, 2 \nDirectors of the CIA, and the first Director of National Intelligence.\n  Joyce's excellent work and professionalism is well known to us on the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence, and she has been a linchpin in \ncoordinating and supporting the CIA's relations with Congress over the \nlast 27 years. Her calm and friendly diplomacy has certainly smoothed \nover many a bump in the CIA's relations with Congress.\n  She has represented the CIA in Congress through some historic crises, \nincluding the ordeal of the American hostages in Iran, the Soviet \noccupation of Afghanistan, the bombings of the Embassy and Marine \ncompounds in Beirut, the Iran-Contra scandal, the fall of the Soviet \nUnion, Operation Desert Storm, Somalia, the bombings of our embassies \nin Africa, 9/11 and the hunt for Osama bin Laden, the invasions of \nAfghanistan and Iraq, as well as the current tensions with Iran and \nNorth Korea.

A bill to establish the Northern Appalachian Economic \nDevelopment Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Northern \nAppalachian Economic Development Commission Act of 2006 with Senator \nCollins because the people of the Northern Forest region have not \nshared in the economic prosperity of many parts of the rest of the \nUnited States. The bill establishes a Federal-State partnership \ncommission for the purpose of promoting economic development in the \ncommunities in the northern forest area of Maine, New Hampshire, New \nYork and Vermont through the development of public policy tools and \ngrants designed to build local capacity.\n  The legislation calls for a collaborative regional effort to achieve \nreal progress to enhance not only the forest products industry to \npreserve the traditional industries of the region, but to catalyze new \nrural economic and small development and job growth, and slow out-\nmigration.\n  Today, small businesses are fueling the economic growth of the \nNation, producing over 50 percent of the gross domestic product and \ncreating three-fourths of all new jobs. Entrepreneurship is a critical \nelement in the establishment of self-sustaining communities that create \njobs and contribute broadly to economic and community development. The \nbill authorizes appropriations of $40 million for economic development \ngrants for fiscal years 2008-2012 that will support existing \nentrepreneur and small business development programs and projects and \nsupport projects for small business innovation research. Funding will \nalso assist the region in obtaining job training, employment-related \neducation and business development and assist in community development. \nAssistance will be provided to severely distressed and underdeveloped \nwhile maintaining the integrity of the region's resources.\n  Many residents of the Northeast region live below the poverty level, \nin areas of significantly higher than average unemployment rates, with \nlimited access to capital, and with low per capita personal income. \nMaine's economy has long been based on the bounty of its natural \nresources--fishing, farming, forestry, and tourism. The very nature of \nthese industries has meant that a significant portion of employment \nopportunities are seasonal and overall earnings lag behind national \naverages. Currently, Maine leads the country with the fastest growing \npoverty rate, tied with Arkansas and Mississippi. As a matter of fact, \nin 2005, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Maine was the \nonly State other than Louisiana that experienced a decline in economic \nactivity. The entire northern forest region shares many of these common \nchallenges, and as a result, local and State economic development \nleaders have been receptive to considering other means to create jobs.\n  Currently, there are several independent entities focused on regional \neconomic development, such as the Appalachian Regional Commission, the \nDenali Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, and the Northern Great \nPlains Regional Authority. However, there is currently no single \nregional economic development entity focused on the needs of the far \nNortheast region. Our Northern Appalachian Economic Development \nCommission is expected to complement existing efforts, and I plan to \npursue these efforts in the 2007 Farm bill.\n  The Appalachian Regional Commission--ARC--developed in 1965 has \nproven to be a success and has help transform a region once solely \ndependent on mining, agriculture and heavy industry to one more reliant \non the service and retail industries. Since its creation, the ARC has \nreduced the number of distressed counties from 219 to 100. It has cut \nthe poverty rate from 31 percent to 15 percent and has helped 1,400 \nbusinesses create 26,000 new jobs since 1977. This is the type of \nassistance that could also be very effective in Northern Appalachian \narea.\n  I look forward to fostering the rich potential of the northern forest \nStates of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York, with its \nabundance of natural resources and entrepreneurship, and hard working \npeople through the Northern Appalachian Economic Development Commission \nto obtain vigorous self-sustaining growth throughout the region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN:\n  S. 28.

A bill to treat payments by charitable organizations with \nrespect to certain firefighters as exempt payments; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will give tangible relief to the families of the five federal \nfirefighters killed in the devastating Esperanza fire in southern \nCalifornia this October.\n  The Esperanza fire tragically claimed lives, homes and other \nbuildings, while burning more than 40,000 acres. No one has felt the \npain of this heartbreaking disaster more than the families of Mark \n``Lotzie'' Loutzenhiser, Jess McLean, Jason McKay, Daniel Hoover-\nNajera, and Pablo Cerda.\n  These five men served honorably while exhibiting the utmost bravery \nin the name of helping others. They gave the ultimate sacrifice, and so \nhave their families, who must now go on without a father or a son, a \nbrother or a husband.\n  Now, in an outpouring of generosity and compassion, a United Way \nchapter in Riverside County, together with the surrounding community \nhas raised more than $1 million to help the families of our fallen \nheroes as they move forward from this tragedy.\n  This serves as a testament to what these men meant to the community, \nthe State of California and the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, in what seems to be a cruel twist, IRS rules do not \nallow this generosity to be passed on to the families of these brave \nfirefighters.\n  Tax-exempt charitable organizations are prohibited from raising money \nfor small, targeted, groups, such as the families of the fallen \nfirefighters. In fact, if this memorial fund is passed on to the \nfamilies, it could endanger the tax-exempt status of the Central County \nUnited Way and other charitable organizations trying to help these \nfamilies in their hour of need.\n  In the wake of this disaster, our Government should be providing \nassistance to these families, not increasing their burden.\n  This much-needed legislation provides exemptions to allow this moving \ngesture to be realized. The United Way will preserve their tax exempt \nstatus, those who made these donations will receive the tax deductions \nthey expected, and most importantly the families of the five fallen \nfirefighters can receive individual donations, penalty free.\n  This legislation encourages the kind of generosity and kindness that \nwe should all commend, not discourage.\n  We came together to pass similar legislation in the wake of the 9/11 \ntragedy and we should do so again today.\n  While this simple measure only makes a minor tax code clarification, \nthe impact of this legislation will be profound for the families of \nthese fallen heroes.\n  Let us not forget the heroism of these men and the sacrifice of their \nfamilies.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of\n\n[[Page S11743]]\n\n1968 to clarify that territories and Indian tribes are eligible to \nreceive grants for confronting the use of methamphetamine; considered \nand passed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Bingaman, \nGrassley, Smith, Baucus, Feingold, Johnson, Salazar, Wyden, Boxer, \nReid, Feinstein, and Cantwell in introducing and passing a bill to \namend the Omnibus Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to clarify that \nIndian tribes and U.S. territories are eligible to receive grants for \nconfronting the use of methamphetamine.\n  The amendments that this bill makes to section 2996(a) of the Omnibus \nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 would make U.S. territories \nand Indian tribes eligible to receive grants from the Department of \nJustice to address the scourge of methamphetamine use, sale, and \nmanufacture. The terrible business of methamphetamine use, \ndistribution, and manufacture has impacted communities all over the \ncountry, in urban and nonurban areas alike, and our territories and \nIndian reservations have not been spared. This bill will make much \nneeded resources available to territorial and tribal governments to \nhelp bring the methamphetamine epidemic under control. However, I \nunderstand there are some questions about the intent of this bill in \nrespect to a provision in this bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of engaging \nSenator McCain in a colloquy over a certain provision, to be sure that \nits purpose is clear. In section 1(a)( 4) of the bill, there is a \nprovision which states, ``Nothing in this subsection, or in the award \nor denial of any grant pursuant to this subsection--(A) allows grants \nauthorized under paragraph 3(A) to be made to, or used by, an entity \nfor law enforcement activities that the entity lacks jurisdiction to \nperform; or (B) has any effect other than to authorize, award, or deny \na grant of funds to a state, territory, or Indian tribe for the \npurposes described in this subsection.''\n  It is my understanding that the intent behind the amendment made by \nsection 1(a)(4) of the bill is simply to make it clear that by \nauthorizing the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to \naward grant funds to a State, territory, or Indian tribe to \n``investigate, arrest and prosecute individuals'' involved in illegal \nmethamphetamine activities, section 2996(a) does not somehow authorize \na State, territory, or Indian tribe to pursue law enforcement \nactivities that it otherwise has no jurisdiction to pursue. And \nsimilarly, this provision also clarifies that an award or denial of a \ngrant by the Bureau of Justice Assistance does not somehow allow a \nState, territory, or Indian tribe to pursue law enforcement activities \nthat it otherwise lacks jurisdiction to pursue. For example, a law \nenforcement agency in one State, territory, or Indian reservation is \nnot somehow enabled by this section, or by an award made pursuant to \nthis section, to prosecute a methamphetamine crime arising in some \nother jurisdiction unless that agency already has the jurisdiction to \ndo that.\n  I would like to ask Senator McCain if my understanding of this \nprovision is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from New Mexico is correct in his \nunderstanding of this provision.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It is also my understanding that the language, \n``Nothing in this subsection, or in the award or denial of any grant \npursuant to this subsection. . . (B) has any effect other than to \nauthorize, award, or deny a grant of funds to a state, territory, or \nIndian tribe for the purposes described in this subsection'' is \nintended to make it clear that the provisions of section 2996(a) and \ngrant awards or denials pursuant to section 2996(a) have no effect \nbeyond simply authorizing, awarding, or denying a grant of funds to a \nState, territory, or Indian tribe for the purposes described in section \n2996(a). So, for example, if a State, territory, or Indian tribe is \nawarded or denied a grant of funds under this section, that award or \ndenial has no relevance to or effect on the eligibility of the State, \nterritory, or Indian tribe to participate in any other program or \nactivity unrelated to the award or denial of grants under section \n2996(a). The award or denial of a grant under this subsection, in other \nwords, is relevant only to the award or denial of the grant under this \nsubsection and nothing else.\n  I would like to ask Senator McCain whether my understanding of this \nprovision of the bill is correct in this particular regard as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from New Mexico is correct in his \nunderstanding of this provision as well.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this critically needed \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Bingaman, \nGrassley, Smith, Baucus, Feingold, Johnson, Salazar, Wyden, Boxer, \nReid, Feinstein, and Cantwell in introducing this bill to amend the \nOmnibus Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to clarify that Indian \ntribes and U.S. territories are eligible to receive grants for \nconfronting the use of methamphetamine.\n  The amendments that this bill makes to section 2996(a) of the Omnibus \nCrime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 would make U.S. territories \nand Indian tribes eligible to receive grants from the Department of \nJustice to address the scourge of methamphetamine use, sale, and \nmanufacture. The terrible business of methamphetamine use, \ndistribution, and manufacture has impacted communities all over the \ncountry, in urban and nonurban areas alike, and our territories and \nIndian reservations have not been spared. This bill will make much-\nneeded resources available to territorial and tribal governments to \nhelp bring the methamphetamine epidemic under control.\n  Mr. President, the impacts of methamphetamine use on communities \nacross the Nation are well known and cannot be underestimated. We have \nworked hard with Senator Bingaman and his staff to craft legislation \nthat makes these critical resources for fighting methamphetamine use, \ndistribution, and manufacture available to sectors on which this drug \nis having a devastating impact. I would also like to thank Senator \nSessions for the long hours he and his staff have devoted to working \nwith my staff and other offices interested in this bill to make this a \ngood bill that this body can and should support.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this critically needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Levin, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Biden):\n  S. 4115. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to increase \nthe effectiveness of physician assistance for drug treatment; \nconsidered and passed.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, among the most consequential tasks Congress \nwill undertake in the coming months is a potentially epoch-defining \nreview of U.S. trade policy occasioned by the looming expiry of \nnumerous trade preference programs, ``fast-track'' Trade Promotion \nAuthority and the Doha Round of World Trade Organization negotiations. \nThe fate of recent trade legislation, mirroring growing acrimony in the \npublic debate over trade policy, portends that Congress will not simply \nbe considering whether to reauthorize certain programs and processes \naffecting international trade--it will be setting forth a doctrine \ndeclaring America's position and powers in an irreversibly \ninterdependent global economy.\n  The complexity of the market forces that can bring both hope and \nhardship under the modern trade regime mean that few other issues cut \nacross traditionally drawn party, geographic and ideological lines so \ndramatically. Where the usual political dichotomies don't apply, new \nones have been framed to polarize the issue: free-trade versus fair-\ntrade, globalization versus protectionism, growth versus \nsustainability.\n  Yet above this fray of competing economic theories and realities, a \nsolid consensus has grown around the principle that whatever our trade \nlaws may be, they should be consistently and vigorously enforced.\n  The distressing reality is that U.S. industry and labor groups are \noften rebuffed in attempts to petition the United States Trade \nRepresentative to initiate a formal investigation or bring a dispute \nresolution action under the relevant multilateral or bilateral trade \nagreement, as there is considerable institutional momentum among senior \nofficials at USTR and elsewhere in the administration against bringing \nformal enforcement action against certain trade partners, and China in \nparticular.\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\n  USTR's handling of the trade effects of China's currency manipulation \npractices is representative of the problem. In September 2004, a U.S. \nindustry coalition filed a petition under section 301 of the Trade Act \nof 1974--the statute setting forth general procedures for the \nenforcement of U.S. trade rights--alleging that Chinese currency \nmanipulation practices constituted a violation of China's obligations \nto the United States under World Trade Organization rules, and calling \nfor USTR to conduct an investigation of such practices. USTR rejected \nthe petition on the day it was filed, contending that ``an \ninvestigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, \nand practices covered in the petition. The administration is currently \ninvolved in efforts to address with the Government of China the \ncurrency valuation issues raised in the petition. The USTR believes \nthat initiation of an investigation under--the section 301 process--\nwould hamper, rather than advance, administration efforts to address \nChinese currency valuation policies.'' Shortly thereafter, in November \nof 2004, a congressional coalition of 12 Senators and 23 \nRepresentatives filed a similar section 301 petition, which was \nrejected by USTR on the same grounds.\n  As noted in USTR's rejection of these petitions, current law allows \nthe Executive to decline to initiate an industry-requested \ninvestigation where it determines that action under section 301 would \nbe ineffective in addressing the offending act, policy or practice. The \nmerits of USTR's determination are unreviewable under current law. USTR \nused this loophole to avoid having to even investigate industry's \nclaim, let alone take formal action against China. And as we now know, \nthe administration's ``soft'' approach to Chinese currency manipulation \nhas itself proven ineffective in addressing the problem in the 2 years \nsince these filings.\n  It is to prevent further disregard for U.S. businesses and workers \nseeking a fair and consequential hearing of their concerns with foreign \ntrade practices that I today introduce the Trade Complaint and \nLitigation Accountability Improvement Measures Act, or the ``Trade \nCLAIM Act''.\n  The Trade CLAIM Act would amend the section 301 process to require \nthe U.S. Trade Representative to act upon an interested party's \npetition to take formal action in cases where a U.S. trade right has \nbeen violated, except in instances where: the matter has already been \naddressed by the relevant trade dispute settlement body; the foreign \ncountry is taking imminent steps to end to ameliorate the effects of \nthe practice; taking action would do more harm than good to the U.S. \neconomy; or taking action would cause serious harm to the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  The bill would also grant the Court of International Trade \njurisdiction to review de novo USTR's denials of section 301 industry \npetitions to investigate and take enforcement action against unfair \nforeign trade laws or practices. Such jurisdiction would include the \nability to review USTR determinations that U.S. trade rights have not \nbeen violated as alleged in industry petitions, and the sufficiency of \nformal actions taken by USTR in response to foreign trade laws or \npractices determined to violate U.S. trade rights.\n  The Trade CLAIM Act would give U.S. businesses and workers a greater \nsay in whether, when and how U.S. trade rights should be enforced. The \nbill would be particularly beneficial to small businesses, which--like \nother petitioners in section 301 cases--currently have no avenue to \nformally challenge the merits of USTR's decisions, and are often \ndrowned out by large business interests in industry-wide section 301 \nactions initiated by USTR.\n  By providing for judicial review of USTR decisions not to enforce \nU.S. trade rights, the bill provides for impartial third party \noversight by a specialty court not subject to political and diplomatic \npressures. In delinking discreet trade disputes from the mercurial \nmachinations of international relations, this act would end the \nsacrifice of individual industries on the negotiating table, and leave \nit to the free market--uniformly operating under the trade rules to \nwhich our trading partners have already agreed--to decide their fate.\n  America's prosperity is due in no small part to its excellence in \nassuring the rule of law. It is fundamental to the success of worthy \nenterprises in a functioning market that the government--rather than \nchoosing winners and losers--consistently and dispassionately enforce \nthe rules that bind all actors. It is the extension of this \nfoundational principle of the American economic tradition to the \ninternational trade regime that the Trade CLAIM Act seeks to \naccomplish--and which America's businesses and workers have long been \npromised.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Sununu):\n  S. 4117. A bill to repeal title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005, to \nreinstitute the section 7212 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, which provides States additional regulatory \nflexibility and funding authorization to more rapidly produce tamper- \nand counterfeit-resistant driver's licenses and to protect privacy and \ncivil liberties by providing interested stakeholders on a negotiated \nrulemaking with guidance to achieve improved 21st century licenses to \nimprove national security; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the REAL ID Act of \n2005.\n  The REAL ID Act became law over a year and a half ago, but opposition \nremains strong and vocal. I hold in my hand a list of hundreds of \norganizations--ranging from the National Governor's Association--NGA--\nto the American Civil Liberties Union--ACLU--to the National Rifle \nAssociation--that believe the REAL ID Act was a grave mistake. None of \nthese groups were heard by Congress before the bill was passed in May \n2005. There were no hearings to understand the repercussions of such \nsweeping legislation; and no debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Rather, the REAL ID Act was attached to a must-pass piece of \nlegislation, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, \nthe Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief Act--Public Law 109-13, in \nconference and therefore received virtually no scrutiny before passage. \nEvery Member of Congress who supported providing much needed funding to \nour troops and relief to the Indonesia tsunami victims was forced to \nvote in favor of the REAL ID Act, an unrelated bill.\n  That is why I come to the floor today to spark a real debate on REAL \nID. I say to my colleagues there are serious problems with REAL ID and \nit's time Congress took a closer look.\n  My two primary concerns with REAL ID are that the law: places an \nunrealistic and unfunded burden on state governments; and erodes \nAmericans' civil liberties and privacy rights.\n  There is nothing realistic about REAL ID. This law mandates that \nState-issued IDs, such as driver's licenses, comply with certain \nsecurity standards and procedures, as determined by the Department of \nHomeland Security--DHS--in order to be accepted by the Federal \nGovernment for such purposes as boarding an airplane or entering a \nFederal building. These procedures include electronically verifying the \nauthenticity of each identifying document, such as birth certificates, \npassports, and social security cards, presented to a local Department \nof Motor Vehicles--DMV--office. Such a requirement likely will involve \ndeveloping an extremely costly and complex set of electronic systems \nthat connect the thousands of DMVs to one another and to a host of \nFederal agencies. This would cost $1.42 billion according to a \nSeptember 2006 report issued by the NGA, the National Conference of \nState Legislatures--NCSL--and the American Association of Motor Vehicle \nAdministrators--AAMVA.\n  In addition, every current driver's license holder must be reenrolled \nunder the new screening process which will more than double the \nworkload at local DMVs across the country and far exceed their current \ncapacity. REAL ID will put an end, at least temporarily, to online and \nmail license renewals and will cause huge lines and back-up at the DMV. \nAlthough security should never be sacrificed for convenience, it is \nimportant that states have the time and flexibility to implement the \nadditional security standards in an effective manner. Moreover, \nreenrollment\n\n[[Page S11745]]\n\nwill be the mostly costly piece of REAL ID, estimated at approximately \n$8 billion over 5 years by NGA, NCSL, and AAMVA.\n  There are a number of other requirements imposed on states by REAL \nID, such as new design requirements for the ID cards and on-site \nsecurity. In total, REAL ID will cost over $11 billion according to the \nNGA study. Congress has appropriated only $40 million for REAL ID \nimplementation to date, and no funds were included for fiscal year \n2007. That leaves a hefty pricetag for the States, especially for \nlegislation that was passed with no review.\n  In addition to the cost imposed on States, REAL ID imposes an \nunrealistic timeframe. Under the law, states must have REAL ID \ncompliant systems in place by May 2008. Yet implementing regulations \nhave not been issued. DHS is expected to issue the regulations early \nnext year. However, as of today, the Office of Management and Budget, \nOMB, has not received the draft regulations, and OMB is allowed 90 days \nby Executive order for review of all proposed regulations. That would \ngive states a little over a year to develop electronic verification \nsystems, redesign driver's license cards, establish protocols on how to \nhandle and secure personal information, increase DMV personnel, and \nfind a way to fund it all. It has taken DHS over a year and a half just \nto issue the regulations. Expecting the States to execute the new \nsystem in even less time is unrealistic.\n  In addition to the unrealistic burden REAL ID places on States, REAL \nID is a serious threat to our privacy rights and civil liberties.\n  The REAL ID Act will require each State's driver's licensing agency \nto collect and store substantial numbers of records containing \nlicensees' most sensitive personally identifiable information, \nincluding one's social security number, proof of residence, and \nbiometric identifiers such as a digital photograph and signature. If \nthe new State databases are compromised, they will provide one-stop \naccess to virtually all information necessary to commit identity theft. \nMoreover, the sharing of the aggregated personally identifiable \ninformation of licensees between and amongst various government \nagencies and employees at the Federal, State, and local level, as \ncontemplated by the REAL ID Act, potentially allows millions of \nindividuals access to that information without protections or \nsafeguards. The potential for the private sector to scan and share the \ninformation contained on a REAL ID compliant license exponentially \nincreases the risk of identity theft as well. Despite these obvious \nthreats to Americans' privacy, the REAL ID Act fails to mandate privacy \nprotections for individuals' information nor does it provide States \nwith the means to implement data security and antihacking protections \nthat will be required to safeguard the new databases mandated by the \nact.\n  REAL ID exacerbates the threat of identity theft which threatens our \nsecurity. As the Honolulu Star Bulletin noted in a October 1, 2006, \neditorial, the REAL ID Act gives us ``a false sense of security.''\n  I come to the floor today to inject some reality into REAL ID. \nUnfunded mandates, privacy, and security are real problems that deserve \nreal consideration and real solutions. It is my hope that when DHS \nissues the REAL ID regulations, the following issues are addressed: (1) \nlimiting access to the REAL ID networks; (2) securing data that is \nelectronically stored on driver's licenses and ID cards; (3) allowing \nflexibility in the technological solutions employed by the States; (4) \ndefining the role Federal agencies will play in developing and \nconnecting with the electronic verification systems; (5) ensuring that \nindividuals' privacy rights provided by the Federal Government and \nState governments are protected; (6) providing a means to correct \ninaccurate information held in the REAL ID networks; and (7) ensuring \nthat the information contained in the license cannot be scanned or \nshared by private entities.\n  I hope that the regulations will be well thought out and reflect the \nstakeholder input provided to DHS over the past year and a half which \nincluded the issues I just raised.\n  However, given what I have heard from participants about the rule-\nmaking process thus far, I am concerned that the regulations are being \ndeveloped by too few people without enough stakeholder engagement.\n  When DHS began this process, the State Working Group was developed to \ngather input from stakeholders. However, the engagement process was not \nas robust as it could have been. Participants in the working group \nnever received feedback from DHS on their proposals and DHS never \nreconvened the group to evaluate a draft of the regulations.\n  I also am concerned that given the shortsightedness of the law DHS \nwas given by Congress, it may be the case that a complete replacement \nof the REAL ID Act is necessary. I am looking to DHS to issue workable \nregulations. However, if our personal privacy is not protected and the \nburden placed on states is too great, a legislative change to REAL ID \nmay prove necessary.\n  Congress established a negotiated rulemaking process to improve the \nsecurity of drivers licenses and ID cards in the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. According to participants, that \nprocess was making headway when the REAL ID Act passed repealing the \nnegotiated rulemaking language and imposing much stricter guidelines.\n  Today Senator Sununu and I introduce the Identification Security \nEnhancement Act, which will repeal the REAL ID Act and reinstitute the \nshared rulemaking and more reasonable guidelines established in the \nIntelligence Reform Act. It is my intention to review the forthcoming \nDHS regulations before pursuing any action on our bill. I am hopeful \nthat new legislation will not be necessary, and I look forward to \nworking with DHS to produce workable guidelines. However, I believe \nthat introducing the Identification Security Enhancement Act now is \nimportant because it will send a message that the intent of the \nentirety of Congress is not reflected in the REAL ID Act.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that driver's licenses and ID \ncards issued in the United States are secure--both from would-be \nterrorists and identity thieves--affordable, and practical. I ask my \ncolleagues to join us in injecting reality into the REAL ID Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security $300,000,000 for each of the fiscal years \n     2007 through 2013 to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 4118. A bill to amend the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\nto-Know Act of 1986 to strike a provision relating to modifications in \nreporting frequency; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would preserve the public's right to know exactly what types and \namounts of chemicals are being stored and released into their \nneighborhoods and communities.\n  The legislation would stop the Environmental Protection Agency's \ndangerous attempts to undermine the Toxic Release Inventory--TRI--\nprogram--which I authored in 1986--by allowing facilities that release \nup to 5,000 pounds of a toxic chemical to simply provide notice of a \nchemical's presence at the facility, rather than disclose the actual \namounts released to the land, air, and water. The 5,000 pounds standard \nrepresents a ten-fold increase of the current reporting threshold; this \nchange would eliminate detailed reporting for thousands of facilities \nin communities around the country, including 92 facilities in New \nJersey, and could eliminate entirely the disclosure of the releases of \nmore than a dozen potentially dangerous chemicals. The EPA also has \nproposed to require reports on chemical emissions only every other \nyear, instead of the current annual requirement. Under this wildly \nirresponsible proposed rule change, corporations would only be required \nto disclose their chemical emissions every other year. This means that \ncommunities would have no knowledge of what chemicals have been \nreleased in the 50 percent of years where emissions are not disclosed; \nadditionally, companies would have a perverse incentive to\n\n[[Page S11747]]\n\nconcentrate their most egregious releases of toxic chemicals into the \nenvironment in years which are not reported. Furthermore, the EPA has \npublished a proposal to reduce the information available to the public \nregarding the management of some of the most toxic chemicals that \naccumulate in the environment, including lead and mercury. Needless to \nsay, I strongly oppose all three of these rule changes; the legislation \nI am introducing will stop them from taking place.\n  I firmly believe that it is simply unacceptable for the EPA to reduce \nthe amount of information available to the public about chemicals--\nincluding mercury, lead and other carcinogens--stored nearby or \nreleased into their community. When Congress passed the original \nEmergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act in 1986, as a \nresponse to the 1984 Union Carbide chemical disaster in Bhopal, India, \nsome accountability was finally established in the chemical industry. \nAnd now, the EPA is attempting to weaken these rules and reduce the \namount of information available to the public on these critical issues. \nFor instance, in my home State of New Jersey, a chemical facility that \nreleased 2,000 pounds of arsenic via air emissions in 2003 would no \nlonger be required to disclose this pollution to the general public. \nFourteen facilities that released a combined 8,600 pounds of \ncarcinogenic styrene would no longer have to report these emissions in \ndetail. I find these proposals absolutely outrageous. It truly begs the \nquestion: who is the EPA really ``protecting''? The general public and \nthe environment, or corporate interests that pollute our communities?\n  While the EPA touts the benefits of its proposal as ``burden \nreduction'' for industry, I strongly believe that the benefit of \nannual, detailed reporting vastly outweighs the marginal reduction in \nburden that will be provided to industry. In fact, according to the \nEPA's own estimates, the average cost saved for facilities no longer \nrequired to report the release of toxic chemicals in amounts less than \n5,000 pounds would be approximately $2.32 per day. It is simply \nstunning that the EPA is willing to jeopardize public health and safety \nfor a daily cost savings roughly equivalent to a couple cups of coffee.\n  There are constructive ways to improve the TRI program, and lessen \nthe burdens on industry, without reducing the amount of information \navailable to the public. These include improving the system for \nelectronic reporting, and offering technical assistance to help \nbusinesses comply with the requirements.\n  The bill I am introducing is simple. First, it would codify the \nrequirement that companies which release emissions of more than 500 \npounds of any standard TRI chemical must disclose the details of their \nreleases. Releases in amounts less than 500 pounds would continue to be \nallowed to use the less detailed reporting form. Second, it would \ncodify the current prohibition on using the less detailed form for the \nmost persistent chemicals, including lead, mercury, and dioxin. \nFinally, it would prevent EPA from making the frequency of reporting \nless than every year.\n  I would be remiss not to thank my congressional colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Hilda Solis \nof California, with whom I have been pleased to work on this issue. \nRepresentatives Pallone and Solis have introduced the companion of this \nbill in the House; I now look forward to continuing to work with them \nto ensure its passage. I would also like to thank my colleagues Senator \nMenendez and Senator Boxer, for being original cosponsors of this \nimportant legislation.\n  As a result of the EPA's dereliction of its duty to protect the \npublic and the environment, Congress must act to do so. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues to do just that by enacting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Toxic Right-to-Know \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Reg. 57822), to revise requirements under the Toxics \n     Release Inventory Program described in subsection (a)(1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 4119. A bill to clarify the tax treatment of certain payments made \nto homeowners by the Louisiana Recovery Authority and the Mississippi \nDevelopment Authority; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service had another \nbig surprise for citizens in my State of Louisiana and in Mississippi \nwho are trying to rebuild after Katrina: a tax surprise.\n  The problem is simple. Louisiana and Mississippi have both \nestablished programs to help families rebuild their homes and their \nlives after Katrina and Rita. Congress appropriated the money for these \ninitiatives--more than $10 billion in all and we are very grateful for \nthe assistance. The Louisiana program, which we call the Road Home, is \nadministered by the Louisiana Recovery Authority, LRA. The program is \nnow starting to get going. Under the Road Home, up to $150,000 in \ngrants are available to people to rebuild or repair their homes. There \nis also funding available for rental properties. Grants can also be \nused to buy out homes. The Louisianians who were displaced by the \nstorms want to go home and the Road Home program will get them there.\n  But the IRS is putting a pothole in the middle of the Road Home by \nmaking some of these payments taxable. The way this tax surprise works \nis by requiring that any hurricane victim who claimed a casualty loss \ndeduction for damage to their home on their tax return for 2005 will \nhave to reduce that loss by the amount of any payment from the LRA. So \nif they had their taxes reduced in one year and received a Road Home \ngrant the next year, they have to essentially eliminate any benefit of \nthe earlier casualty loss deduction. Their taxes will go up.\n  Now I realize that under normal circumstances, when a person's home \nbums down, the roof caves in, or they are a victim of theft, they can \ntake a casualty loss deduction, provided it meets certain requirements. \nThe loss must exceed ten percent of the taxpayers adjusted gross \nincome, and a per loss floor of $100. In some circumstances, taxpayers \nare permitted to include a current-year casualty loss on an amended \nprior year return.\n  Immediately after Katrina, we enacted the Katrina Emergency Tax \nRelief Act, KETRA, that suspended the ten percent floor for casualty \nlosses incurred in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area, including those \nclaimed on amended returns. The purpose of the change in KETRA was \nsimple: we wanted to put money in the hands of Katrina victims as \nquickly as possible. We essentially encouraged taxpayers to\n\n[[Page S11748]]\n\ntake this loss, even by amending a past return. The IRS would then \nprovide them with a refund.\n  Hurricane victims needed that money. They had to find a place to \nlive, often at higher rents. Many of them had lost their jobs and \nneeded this money to see them through until they started working again. \nThey used the money to begin the rebuilding of their lives. These \npeople didn't take this money and invest it in the stock market or put \nit in a trust fund somewhere. They spent it because they had to. \nCongress encouraged people to take the deduction by changing the law. \nNow the IRS wants to take it back.\n  I fully understand the policy behind all of this. Casualty loss \ndeductions are reduced by the amount of any insurance or other recovery \nthey make on the loss. In fact, at the time the taxpayer makes the \ndeduction he or she is supposed to reduce the amount of the loss by any \ninsurance recovery they reasonably expect to receive. If you receive a \nlarger payment than you expected at a future time, you must claim it on \nyour income tax return when you receive it.\n  The problem is that this policy will seriously hamper our recovery by \ndiscouraging people from staying in Louisiana. If you took a casualty \nloss and you receive a $150,000 Road Home payment to rebuild your \nhouse, you will have a tax consequence. But if you took the casualty \nloss and sold your house to the LRA for the $150,000 payment, it is \ntreated like a home sale and there is no tax. This policy creates a \ndisincentive to recovery. This tax policy will encourage people to take \nthe road out of town and not to return to the gulf coast. On top of \nthis, if a person did not claim the casualty loss, but receives a \ngrant, the grant is tax free.\n  Mr. President, Congress has done a tremendous job passing legislation \nto encourage investment and the rebuilding of the gulf coast. We should \nnot put road blocks in the way of the Road Home. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation to eliminate this road block to our recovery. I \nrealize that we are at the end of the session and that there will not \nbe enough time to pass this legislation before we adjourn. I will \npursue this in the next Congress when we return in January. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 4122. A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nrevise and extend that Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act Amendments of 2006. I am proud to be joined in \nintroducing this bill by Senators Enzi and Murkowski. This bill \nreflects the work of three committees of jurisdiction and countless \nmeetings with the administration over the past four Congresses. \nNevertheless, I must express my profound disappointment in seeing yet \nanother Congress go by without passage of this critical \nreauthorization.\n  Thirty years ago, Congress first enacted the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act to meet the moral commitment and trust obligation of \nthe United States to provide comprehensive health care to Indian \npeople. The act was last reauthorized in 1992, and efforts on the \nlatest reauthorization have been ongoing since the 106th Congress. Over \nthe course of nearly 7 years and four Congresses, the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, along with the Committees on Finance and Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions and the Indian tribes, has labored to \nreauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. I have been \nencouraged by the recent discussions with the administration on the \nreauthorization, however, we were simply left without sufficient time \nto achieve final passage.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is the fundamental statutory \nframework for the Indian health care system and governs nearly every \naspect of Indian health care. The Vice-Chairman of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, Senator Dorgan, and I introduced the predecessor bill, \nS.1057, over 1 year ago to build upon that framework by updating the \ndelivery of health services to be consistent with currently accepted \nhealth policy and practices everywhere in our great nation except \nIndian Country. This new iteration of the reauthorization of the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act contained critically needed improvements \nincluding increased access to care, alternative financing for health \ncare facilities and services, integrated programs for behavioral \nhealth, and progressive recruitment and retention programs for health \nprofessionals serving Indian communities.\n  Extensive work went into crafting these bills. Six years ago, a \nsteering committee of Indian tribal leaders, after extensive \nconsultation with the Indian Health Service, developed a broad \nconsensus about the needed improvements to the Indian health care \nsystem. Bills based on this steering committee's recommendations have \nbeen introduced in the Senate since the 106th Congress, but none have \nbeen enacted.\n  In October, 2005, the Committee on Indian Affairs favorably reported \nout S. 1057. As with many bills, aspects of S. 1057 fell under the \njurisdiction of other committees, and in years past, this appears to \nhave complicated and delayed consideration. However, in the 109th \nCongress S.1057 was reviewed and debated by the Senate Committees on \nIndian Affairs, Finance and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. We \nworked closely with those committees to advance and improve upon the \nreauthorization legislation.\n  In July, 2005, the HELP Committee reached out to us and we held a \njoint hearing on S.1057. The HELP Committee worked diligently with us \nto improve upon and advance that bill. In addition, despite last minute \ndelays by the Department of Health and Human Services, on June 8, 2006, \nthe Finance Committee unanimously reported the amendments to the Social \nSecurity Act that were needed to effectively implement S. 1057.\n  However, when we sought consideration of the bill on the floor, \nadditional concerns were raised about the bill, even after it had been \nconsidered by the committees of jurisdiction and after years of \ndiscussion with the administration. These concerns prevented the Senate \nfrom considering S.1057 prior to its recess on September 29, 2006.\n  I have not been averse to a constructive dialogue aimed at improving \nthe measure introduced, but I am deeply concerned about the repeated \ndelays in passing this legislation and the seemingly unending series of \nobstacles thrown in the way of getting this business done. The \ncommittee has held at least nine hearings on the reauthorization since \nthe 106th Congress, conducted extensive negotiations with the \nadministration, and provided ample opportunity to engage in \nconstructive dialogue from all interested parties. We have demonstrated \nour willingness to accommodate any reasonable concerns, even when \nraised belatedly as they so often have been, without compromising \ncongressional oversight, and the quality, accessibility and flexibility \nfor the Indian health programs deserved by Indian people. Nevertheless, \nwe could not reach a final resolution to some provisions which would in \nour view have regressed from current law and good health policy.\n  Therefore, Senator Enzi and I decided to introduce this bill, which \nreflects the reasonable compromises we have agreed to with the \nadministration. Specifically, to address concerns raised by the \nDepartment of Justice, this bill protects the United States from \nunnecessary lawsuits, while at the same time insuring that Indian \npatients receiving health care in IHS or tribal facilities, or in home- \nor community-based settings, will have the quality of care they \ndeserve.\n  I believe that it is extremely important to remember, when looking at \nthis bill, that improving, rather than regressing from, current law and \npolicy is particularly important in light of studies which drive home \nthe desperate need for improving the Indian health care system. For \nexample, a Government Accountability Office report issued in August, \n2005 documented the lower life expectancies and substantially higher \ndisease rates among Indians, and found that health care services were \nnot always available for Indian people. The GAO further reported that \nthe treatment delays or service gaps could exacerbate the severity of \nIndian patients' conditions and create a need for more intensive \ntreatment.\n  These findings should concern Congress. We retain the ultimate \nauthority\n\n[[Page S11749]]\n\nand responsibility to deal with Indian tribes and provide oversight of \nthe Federal agencies which discharge the responsibilities outlined in \nour laws. It is Congress's responsibility to ensure that the Indian \nhealth care system is updated to accommodate practices that have become \na part of the mainstream health care industry.\n  This concern and commitment was evident in the work of many Members \nof the Senate. We are very pleased that Senator Murkowski has joined us \nin the introduction of this bill. I want to thank Senators Enzi, \nGrassley, Baucus, and Kennedy, for their efforts and that of their \nstaff on this legislation. I was proud to advance a bill which \nreflected the bipartisan work of the multiple committees of \njurisdiction. During this Congress, we were joined in pushing toward \npassage by other Senators and I want to thank, in particular, Senators \nBurns, Crapo, Bingaman, and Senator Domenici, who has long supported \nIndian health and has been instrumental in advancing the bill. Finally, \nI express special thanks to Senator Dorgan and his staff for their \nunwavering support and unstinted efforts on the reauthorization of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  At the end of this Congress I relinquish the chair of the committee \nknowing that there is much work to do for Indian health. However, I am \nconfident that Senator Dorgan will continue these efforts, and I look \nforward to working with him on these and other Indian issues. I ask \nconsent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today my good colleague Senator McCain and I \nare reintroducing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of \n2006. This legislation is a reflection of our dedication to the health \ncare of American Indians and Alaskan Natives. It also is a reflection \nof the work that has been done by Members and the many stakeholders to \nmove this legislation forward.\n  I want to thank Chairman McCain and his staff, as well as Senator \nDorgan and the rest of the members on the Indian Affairs Committee and \ntheir staff for their effort and commitment to the health care and well \nbeing of every American Indian and Alaskan Native. Their hard work has \nnot gone unnoticed.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is the fundamental statutory \nframework for the delivery of health care services to American Indians \nand Alaskan Natives. Since 1992, this law has been expired. This means \nthat for the past 14 years there has been no comprehensive change to \nthe Federal Government's approach to delivering health care to \napproximately 1.8 million American Indians and Alaskan Natives.\n  This troubles me. When I talk to members of the Northern Arapaho \ntribe and Eastern Shoshone tribe from my home State of Wyoming, they \ntell me that quality health care is a top priority for them. For me, as \nchairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, I \nbelieve that our health care systems should grow as science and \ntechnologies grow and that our Federal Government programs also should \nbe kept current in line with today's health care quality standards in \nthe private sector.\n  Last spring, Chairman McCain and I held a joint hearing about this \nlegislation, at which time Mr. Richard Brannan, the chairman of the \nNorthern Arapaho Business Council of Fort Washakie testified about the \nproblems those living on reservations face. He spoke about how they \nrely on these health care services. He also discussed the progress that \nhas been made in reducing health disparities experienced by American \nIndians, and how this legislation can support such progress.\n  Since 1992, there have been many advances made in health care, \nespecially in mental health. In the past 14 years we have come to \nbetter understand how to prevent, diagnose, and treat individuals with \na behavioral health problem. We have learned that individuals have the \nbest chance of recovery when a comprehensive, integrated approach is \ntaken. This legislation authorizes programs to provide such services. \nThis is especially important as we better understand the \ninterconnectedness of alcohol, substance abuse, child welfare and \nsuicide prevention.\n  This legislation also recognizes the alarming suicide rates among \nIndian youth. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, American Indian and Alaskan Native suicide rates in some \nareas are five to seven times higher than the overall United States \nrates. This is not acceptable. This legislation aims to change that by \nencouraging more Indian people to enter into the psychology profession. \nThrough such provisions youth have access to culturally competent \nprofessionals in a familiar environment.\n  Recruiting and retaining qualified health professionals--Indian \nhealth professionals, in particular--to work in Indian communities is \ndifficult. Secretary Michael Leavitt of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services recognizes this challenge. Thanks to his efforts, this \nbill ensures that tribes can better rely on the services of health care \nprofessionals. Currently, a health care professional who receives a \nscholarship through the Indian Health Service may provide their \nservices equal to the number of terms they received a scholarship. Thus \nsome health care professionals are only required to work in a service \narea for one term. Most people understand it usually takes an \nindividual anywhere from 3 months to one year to become accustomed to a \njob. Thus, it is not fair to those tribal communities to have a health \ncare professional leave as soon as they become acclimated. This \nlegislation would ensure that individuals serve a length of time that \nwill allow their services to be depended on. Health care professionals \nwill be more reliably available in areas where such professionals are \nscarce.\n  There are many other recommendations that the Department of Health \nand Human Services has made that I think will strengthen this \nlegislation and improve the quality of care provided through the Indian \nHealth Service. I look forward to working with Secretary Leavitt next \nCongress.\n  I believe that by the working together along with other members of \nthe HELP Committee, the Indian Affairs Committee, the tribal community\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\nand any others interested in this legislation, we can maximize the \nfunds available to the Indian Health Service and coordinate resources \nat the local and State level to provide tribes the tools they need to \nbe self sufficient.\n  I would also like to thank the Department of Justice for their \ntireless work on this bill. This is truly a reflection of their \ncommitment to ensuring every Native American and Alaskan Native who is \nan employee of the Indian Health Service is held to a high standard, \nand thus every individual who receives services through this program \nreceives quality care.\n  I hope that this legislation can be a starting point next Congress. I \nalso strongly encourage my colleagues to continue to work to get this \ninvaluable piece of legislation signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11790-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 630--ALLOWING THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY TO \n       REASSIGN THE HENRY CLAY DESK WHEN SERVING AS PARTY LEADER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Bunning) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

\n     human cost is beyond calculation'';\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2006, President Bush stated, ``We will \n     call genocide by its rightful name, and we will stand up for \n     the innocent until the peace of Darfur is secured.'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of people have died and over \n     2,500,000 have been displaced in Darfur since 2003;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has failed in its \n     responsibility to protect the many peoples of Darfur;\n       Whereas the international community has failed to hold \n     persons responsible for crimes against humanity in Darfur \n     accountable;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2006, the Government of Sudan and the \n     largest rebel faction in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation \n     Movement, led by Minni Minnawi, signed the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement (DPA);\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has not disarmed and \n     demobilized the Janjaweed despite repeated pledges to do so, \n     including in the DPA;\n       Whereas violence in Darfur escalated in the months \n     following the signing of the DPA, with increased attacks \n     against civilians and humanitarian workers;\n       Whereas violence has spread to the neighboring states of \n     Chad and the Central African Republic, threatening regional \n     peace and security;\n       Whereas, in July 2006, more humanitarian aid workers were \n     killed than in the previous 3 years combined;\n       Whereas increased violence has forced some humanitarian \n     organizations to suspend operations, leaving 40 percent of \n     the population of Darfur inaccessible to aid workers;\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), \n     asserting that the existing United Nations Mission in Sudan \n     (UNMIS) ``shall take over from [African Mission in Sudan] \n     AMIS responsibility for supporting the implementation of the \n     Darfur Peace Agreement upon the expiration of AMIS' mandate \n     but in any event no later than 31 December 2006'', and that \n     UNMIS ``shall be strengthened by up to 17,300

      Whereas, on September 19, 2006, President Bush announced \n     the appointment of Andrew Natsios as Presidential Special \n     Envoy to Sudan to lead United States efforts to bring peace \n     to the Darfur region in Sudan;\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2006, high-level consultations led \n     by Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, and \n     Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the African Union \n     Commission, and including representatives of the Arab League, \n     the European Union, the Government of Sudan, and other \n     national governments, produced the ``Addis Ababa Agreement'';\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the Darfur conflict could \n     be resolved only through an all-inclusive political process;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the DPA must be made more \n     inclusive, and ``called upon all parties--Government and DPA \n     non-signatories--to immediately commit to a cessation of \n     hostilities in Darfur in order to give [the peace process] \n     the best chances for success'';\n       Whereas the Agreement included a plan to establish a United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping operation;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the peacekeeping \n     operation would consist of 17,000 military troops and 3,000 \n     police, and would have a primarily African character;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the peacekeeping \n     operation must be logistically and financially sustainable, \n     with support coming from the United Nations;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that command and control \n     structures for the United Nations-African Union force would \n     be provided by the United Nations;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan's Foreign Minister agreed \n     to the conclusions of the High Level Consultation on the \n     Situation in Darfur, though the Foreign Minister indicated \n     that he would need to consult with his government on the size \n     of the peacekeeping mission;\n       Whereas, at an international press conference on November \n     27, 2006, Sudanese President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir rejected \n     the Addis Ababa Agreement and reiterated his objections to \n     any substantive United Nations involvement in Darfur, saying, \n     ``Troops in Darfur should be part of the [African Union] AU \n     and under command of the AU'';\n       Whereas it is imperative that a peacekeeping force in \n     Darfur have the sufficient strength and mandate to provide \n     adequate security to the people of Darfur; and\n       Whereas Presidential Special Envoy Andrew Natsios set \n     December 31, 2006 as the deadline for the Government of Sudan \n     to comply with the demands of the international community or \n     face serious consequences: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports, given the rapidly deteriorating situation on \n     the ground in Darfur, the principles of the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement in order to increase security and stability for the \n     people of Darfur;\n       (2) declares that the deployment of a United Nations-\n     African Union peacekeeping force under the command and \n     control of the United Nations, as laid out in the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement, is the minimum acceptable effort on the part of \n     the international community to protect the people of Darfur;\n       (3) further supports the strengthening of the African Union \n     peacekeeping mission in Sudan so that it may improve its \n     performance with regards to civilian protection as the \n     African Union peacekeeping mission begins to transfer \n     responsibility for protecting the people of Darfur to the \n     United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force under the \n     command and control of the United Nations, as laid out in the \n     Addis Ababa Agreement;\n       (4) calls upon the Government of Sudan to immediately--\n       (A) allow the implementation of the United Nations light \n     and heavy support packages as provided for in the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement; and\n       (B) work with the United Nations and the international \n     community to deploy United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur in \n     keeping with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 \n     (2006);\n       (5) calls upon all parties to the conflict to immediately--\n       (A) adhere to the 2004 N'Djamena ceasefire; and\n       (B) respect the impartiality and neutrality of humanitarian \n     agencies so that relief workers can have unfettered access to \n     their beneficiary populations and deliver desperately needed \n     assistance;\n       (6) urges the President to--\n       (A) continue to work with other members of the \n     international community, including the permanent members of \n     the United Nations Security Council, the African Union, the \n     European Union, the Arab League, Sudan's trading partners, \n     and the Government of Sudan to facilitate the urgently needed \n     deployment of the peacekeeping force called for by United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1706;\n       (B) ensure the ability of any peacekeeping force deployed \n     to Darfur to carry out its mandate by providing adequate \n     funding and working with our international partners to \n     provide technical assistance, logistical support, \n     intelligence gathering capabilities, and military assets;\n       (D) work with members of the United Nations Security \n     Council and the international community to develop and impose \n     a set of meaningful economic and diplomatic sanctions against \n     the Government of Sudan should the Government of Sudan \n     continue to\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\n     refuse to cooperate with the implementation of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1706 and the principles contained \n     in the Addis Ababa

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Remediation \n     Research Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) methamphetamine use and production is growing rapidly \n     throughout the United States;\n       (2) some materials and chemical residues remaining from the \n     production of methamphetamine pose novel environmental \n     problems in locations in which methamphetamine laboratories \n     have been closed;\n       (3) there has been little standardization of measures for \n     determining when the site of a former methamphetamine \n     laboratory has been successfully remediated;\n       (4)(A) initial cleanup actions are generally limited to \n     removal of hazardous substances and contaminated materials \n     that pose an immediate threat to public health or the \n     environment; and\n       (B) it is not uncommon for significant levels of \n     contamination to be found throughout residential structures \n     in which methamphetamine has been manufactured, partially \n     because of a lack of knowledge of how to achieve an effective \n     cleanup;\n       (5)(A) data on methamphetamine laboratory-related \n     contaminants of concern are very limited;\n       (B) uniform cleanup standards do not exist; and\n       (C) procedures for sampling and analysis of contaminants \n     need to be researched and developed; and\n       (6) many States are struggling with establishing assessment \n     and remediation guidelines and programs to address the \n     rapidly expanding number of methamphetamine laboratories \n     being closed each year.\n\n     SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Voluntary Guidelines.--Not later than \n     1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Administrator''), in \n     consultation with the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology, shall establish voluntary guidelines, based on \n     the best available scientific knowledge, for the remediation \n     of former methamphetamine laboratories, including guidelines \n     regarding preliminary site assessment and the remediation of \n     residual contaminants.\n       (b) Considerations.--In developing the voluntary guidelines \n     under subsection (a), the Administrator shall consider, at a \n     minimum--\n       (1) relevant standards, guidelines, and requirements found \n     in Federal, State, and local laws (including regulations);\n       (2) the varying types and locations of former \n     methamphetamine laboratories; and\n       (3) the expected cost of carrying out any proposed \n     guidelines.\n       (c) States.--\n       (1) In general.--The voluntary guidelines should be \n     designed to assist State and local governments in the \n     development and the implementation of legislation and other \n     policies to apply state-of-the-art knowledge and research \n     results to the remediation of former methamphetamine \n     laboratories.\n       (2) Adoption.--The Administrator shall work with State and \n     local governments and other relevant non-Federal agencies and \n     organizations, including through the conference described in \n     section 5, to promote and encourage the appropriate adoption \n     of the voluntary guidelines.\n       (d) Updating the Guidelines.--The Administrator shall \n     periodically update the voluntary guidelines as the \n     Administrator, in consultation with States and other \n     interested parties, determines to be appropriate to \n     incorporate research findings and other new knowledge.\n\n     SEC. 4. RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall establish a \n     program of research to support the development and revision \n     of the voluntary guidelines described in section 3.\n       (b) Research.--The research shall--\n       (1) identify methamphetamine laboratory-related chemicals \n     of concern;\n       (2) assess the types and levels of exposure to chemicals of \n     concern identified under paragraph (1), including routine and \n     accidental exposures, that may present a significant risk of \n     adverse biological effects;\n       (3) identify the research efforts necessary to better \n     address biological effects and to minimize adverse human \n     exposures;\n       (4) evaluate the performance of various methamphetamine \n     laboratory cleanup and remediation techniques; and\n       (5) support other research priorities identified by the \n     Administrator, in consultation with States and other \n     interested parties.\n\n     SEC. 5.

RESIDUAL EFFECTS STUDY.\n\n       (a) Study.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall offer to enter \n     into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences \n     under which the National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a \n     study of the status and quality of research on the residual \n     effects of methamphetamine laboratories.\n       (b) Content.--The study shall identify research gaps and \n     recommend an agenda for the research program described in \n     section 4, with particular attention to the need for research \n     on the impacts of methamphetamine laboratories on--\n       (1) the residents of buildings in which such laboratories \n     are, or were, located, with particular emphasis given to \n     biological impacts on children; and\n       (2) first responders.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     completion of the study, the Administrator shall submit to \n     Congress a report describing the manner in which the \n     Administrator will use the results of the study to carry out \n     the activities described in sections 3 and 4.\n\n     SEC. 7. METHAMPHETAMINE DETECTION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       The Director of National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology, in consultation with the Administrator, shall \n     support a research program to develop--\n       (1) new methamphetamine detection technologies, with \n     emphasis on field test kits and site detection; and\n       (2) appropriate standard reference materials and validation \n     procedures for methamphetamine detection testing.\n\n     SEC. 8. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act modifies or otherwise affects the \n     regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n     SEC. 9.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about \nthe pending passage of the Native American Methamphetamine Enforcement \nand Treatment Act of 2006. Section 2 of the act authorizes Indian \ntribes to receive grants under section 2996(a) of the Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act in order to address the scourge of \nmethamphetamine. I strongly support aiding Indian tribes in their \nefforts to combat the methamphetamine epidemic in Indian country.\n  Members of the steering committee, which I chair, expressed concern \nabout one part of the original bill--a concern that I am pleased to \nannounce will be addressed by the substitute amendment.\n  Part of the bill authorizes tribes to receive grants, under 42 U.S.C. \n3793cc(a)(3)(A), to ``investigate, arrest and prosecute individuals \nviolating laws related to the use, manufacture, or sale of \nmethamphetamine.'' The problem was that the bill originally appeared to \nauthorize any tribe, without limitation, to receive these grants--\ngrants that can only be used for law enforcement activities. Permitting \nthese grants to all tribes would not have been appropriate, since many \ntribes--indeed, perhaps a majority of the officially recognized tribes \nin this country--do not have any criminal jurisdiction. Many officially \nrecognized tribes, for example, were only recognized long after their \nStates were admitted to the Union or only received land from the \nFederal government long after that land had become part of a State and \nState jurisdiction had attached to it. Although these tribes may \nreceive Federal services, their recognition or receipt of land did not \ndivest the State of its jurisdiction or bring into being a new \ngovernment within the State. Nearly half of the recognized tribes in \nthe United States, for example, are in the State of Alaska, and were \nfirst recognized in the early 1990s. Obviously, the Federal Government \ndid not create over 200 new governments in Alaska by this action. \nTribes such as these do not exercise any governmental powers and, \nconsequently, do not have the authority to arrest, prosecute, or punish \nindividuals. In several other States, although tribes were preserved as \nseparate jurisdictions when their surrounding States entered the Union, \nand they enjoyed criminal law enforcement powers for many years \nthereafter, those tribes were later divested of criminal jurisdiction \nby Public Law 280. That law transferred criminal jurisdiction from \ntribes to State and local governments in the several States identified \nin that law or that later opted into its provisions. Again, because \ntribes in Public Law 280 States no longer have criminal jurisdiction, \nthey cannot arrest, prosecute, or punish individuals for crimes.\n  Arguably, the Justice Department would have been aware of these \nissues and would have only awarded grants to tribes that exercise \ncriminal jurisdiction. These issues, however, are more in the expertise \nof the Department of the Interior than the Justice Department, and \nthere have been reports that some law enforcement grants were \ninappropriately awarded to nongovernmental tribes in the 1990s. The \nlanguage added by new paragraph 2(a)(4) of the act serves as a reminder \nto the Justice Department to first verify that a tribe exercises law \nenforcement powers before awarding a grant to the tribe under paragraph \n3793cc(3)(A). When a tribe applies for such a grant, the Department \nmust first determine whether the tribe exercise law enforcement powers. \nIt must ask, was the tribe preserved as a separate jurisdiction when \nits surrounding State was admitted to the Union, and is the tribe \nsubject to Public Law 280? Only if the answer to the first question is \nyes and the second is no is the tribe eligible to receive grants under \nparagraph 3793cc(3)(A).\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today the Senate is acting on \nH.R. 798 Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act, with an amendment \ndeveloped by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith. This legislation is \ndesigned to assist communities perform preliminary site assessments and \nremediate former methamphetamine, or meth, labs.\n  The bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to \ndevelop voluntary guidelines for communities engaged in meth \nremediation activities. The guidelines would help communities identify \ncontaminants from meth labs and establish appropriate cleanup levels. \nIn implementing this legislation, it is my hope that the EPA should \nalso issue companion regulations that would assist communities in \nimplementing these voluntary guidelines. These regulations should \nidentify contaminants from meth labs, establish appropriate cleanup \nlevels, address sampling activities in the residences, training and \ncertification for response workers, and use of personal protective \nequipment.\n  There is a need for regulations and a Federal cleanup standard, in \naddition to voluntary guidelines, because of the nature and abundance \nof waste produced from meth labs. Many of the chemicals and wastes \noften associated with meth production are considered hazardous wastes \nunder the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA. Some of \nthese wastes are classified under RCRA as ``characteristic'' waste, \nmeaning that they are ignitable. Other wastes produced by the \nmanufacture of meth are regulated in other sections of law, such as the \nsolvents and other chemicals used in the purification process.\n  The reason companion regulation is needed is meth's toxicity. One \npound of manufactured meth produces 5 pounds of waste. Chemicals used \nin meth production cause breathing problems, skin irritation, \nheadaches, damage to the central nervous system, and, in some cases, \ndeath. Meth waste is typically dumped on the ground or down drains, \nwhich contaminates drain fields, soils and surface waters. Cleanup \nusually involves the removal and disposal of wastes and the ventilation \nand plumbing systems.\n  Several States have already developed standards and regulations for \ncleanup and for determining if a meth-contaminated property is \n``clean.'' Oregon's level is 0.5 micrograms per square foot. And the \nState of Tennessee has set a level that is 0.1 microgram per hundred \nsquare centimeters. EPA should follow suit.\n  Ten years ago, EPA developed extensive regulations for the \nremediation of lead based paint waste. Waste from meth labs appears to \npresent a more immediate public safety concern. EPA should develop the \nsame type of comprehensive regulations to address sampling and worker \nprotection, and should do all it can to assist our communities in these \nefforts.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5239) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Remediation \n     Research Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

These centers have had long \n     waiting lists, with as many as 1,500 blind veterans waiting \n     for openings in 2004.\n       (4) Specialists provide--\n       (A) critically needed services to veterans who are unable \n     to attend residential centers or are waiting to enter a \n     residential center program;\n       (B) a range of services for blind veterans, including \n     training with living skills, mobility, and adaptation of \n     manual skills; and\n       (C) pre-admission screening and follow-up care for blind \n     rehabilitation centers.\n       (5) There are not enough Specialist positions to meet the \n     increased numbers and needs of blind veterans.\n       (b) Establishment of Additional Specialist Positions.--Not \n     later than 30 months after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall establish an \n     additional Specialist position at not fewer than 35 \n     additional facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (c) Selection of Facilities.--In identifying the most \n     appropriate facilities to receive a Specialist position under \n     this section, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) give priority to facilities with large numbers of \n     enrolled legally blind veterans;\n       (2) ensure that each facility does not have such a \n     position; and\n       (3) ensure that each facility is in need of the services of \n     a Specialist.\n       (d) Coordination.--The Secretary shall coordinate the \n     provision of blind rehabilitation services for veterans with \n     services for the care of the visually impaired offered by \n     State and local agencies, especially to the extent to which \n     such State and local agencies can provide necessary services \n     to blind veterans in settings located closer to the \n     residences of such veterans at similar quality and cost to \n     the veteran.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated for the Department of Veterans Affairs to \n     carry out this section $3,500,000 for each of fiscal years \n     2007 through 2012.\n\n     SEC. 208.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 6407 which was received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6407) to reform the postal laws of the United \n     States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                     discretionary budget transfer\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise, first and foremost, to \ncongratulate Chairman Collins and Senator Carper for getting their \npostal reform bill to the finish line. This bill has been a gargantuan \ntask for both Senators. It has been a long time coming. Some have \nobserved that it has taken over 30 years for the Congress to pass \nlegislation that fundamentally reforms the Postal Service. This bill is \ncritically important to the long-term fiscal health of our Postal \nService. It is equally important to the well-being of all our postal \nworkers as well as the needs of all citizens and businesses, large and \nsmall, which use our Postal Service.\n  As both of the managers are aware, there was an important issue that \nthreatened to derail this legislation at the last minute. Specifically, \nthere is a provision in this final bill that has been interpreted as \nhaving the effect of transferring some $200 million in annual costs \nfrom the Postal Service to the discretionary budget. More specifically, \nthose costs that previously were covered through mandatory spending \nwould have to be covered within the tight discretionary budget ceiling \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the \nJudiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies.\n  I currently serve as the ranking member of that subcommittee, and I \nexpect to serve as its chairman when the 110th Congress convenes. Over \nthe course of the 109th Congress, I have spent a great deal of time \nworking with Chairman Kit Bond to put together an appropriations bill \nthat meets all of the disparate needs addressed in our bill. I can tell \nmy colleagues, we do not have an extra $200 million available within \nour allocation to cover the costs of the Postal Service. When the 110th \nCongress convenes, we are likely to have to mark up an appropriations \nbill for the current fiscal year that will be even tighter than the \nbill our committee reported back in July. As such, I can assure my \ncolleagues that we will not be in a position to take on these costs \nthis year, next year, or in any other year.\n  It is important to point out that these costs that are proposed to be \ntransferred to the Committee on Appropriations are not new costs to the \nPostal Service. We are accustomed to the practice of authorizing \ncommittees enacting authorizations for new or expanded activities in \nthe hope that the Appropriations Committee will be in a position to \nfund them. But this situation is something very different. Under the \nprovisions originally included in this bill, the burden of financing \nthe ongoing costs of the Postal Rate Commission, renamed the Postal \nRegulatory Commission, and the USPS inspector general would have \nsuddenly been shifted to the Appropriations Committee.\n  My understanding is that the original intent of this provision was to \nprovide both the Commission and the IG's office with an added degree of \nbudget autonomy and independence. However, the original provision had a \nmuch more dramatic effect. I make no apology for insisting on changes \nto this bill to keep it from happening.\n  I am pleased to say that, through a series of discussions today with \nmy good friend and colleagues, Senators Collins and Carper, we have \nbeen able to negotiate some important changes to the original bill. \nSpecifically, the provision that seeks to transfer the funding burden \nof these activities to the Appropriations Committee will now be delayed \nuntil fiscal year 2009. Given the shortness of time and the critical \nneed to pass this important legislation today, before this Congress\n\n[[Page S11822]]\n\nadjourns, I agreed to this change rather than insisting that the entire \nfunding transfer be stricken. I wish to make clear that my position on \nthis bill tonight should not be viewed as signaling any intent on my \npart to fund these activities in 2009 and beyond. To the contrary, I do \nnot anticipate that the Appropriations Committee will be in a position \nto fund these activities in 2009, 2010, or in any other year. I agreed \nto this date change to give the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs a full 22 months--almost 2 years--to revisit this \nlegislation and bring the costs of these activities back into the \nmandatory budget. If not, these activities will go unfunded. And it \nwill not be the fault of the Appropriations Committee if they do go \nunfunded. My colleagues on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee are on notice and the Postmaster General is on \nnotice. The funding transfer included in this bill for 2009 and beyond \nwill need to be fixed. My subcommittee has no intention of absorbing \nthese costs. It will be the responsibility of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to bring them back within the revenues \navailable to the Postal Service.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my friend for her statement and for her help in \nmoving this critical bill through the Senate tonight. I agree with her \nthat the Appropriations Committee should not bear the burden of funding \nthe Postal Regulatory Commission and the USPS inspector general. While \nit is important that the Commission and the inspector general enjoy the \nnew independence from postal management that we seek to extend them in \nthis bill, it is unfair to do so by taking scarce resources away from \nthe critical programs overseen by the Appropriations subcommittee \nSenator Murray will soon lead. Our imprecision in drafting the section \nof our bill that Senator Murray refers to should not make her already \ndifficult job even harder.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I pledge to work closely with Senator \nMurray, her colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, and my \ncolleagues on the Homeland Security Committee in seeking a permanent \nsolution to the problematic language that Senator Murray has brought to \nour attention.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6407) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11822-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11822-S11825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHENRY J.

Hyde \nUnited States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006.\n  The conferees on this legislation believe that one of the most \nimportant aspects of renewed nuclear cooperation with India will be the \nnew safeguards agreement it enters into with the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, IAEA, that would apply to its expanded list of declared \ncivilian nuclear sites, facilities, and locations.\n  The administration's original legislation concerning India, which I \nintroduced as S. 2429 on March 16, 2006, stated with regard to this \nmatter that the President had to determine that ``an agreement has \nentered into force between India and the IAEA requiring the application \nof safeguards in accordance with IAEA practices to India's civil \nnuclear facilities.''\n  As a part of the committee's consideration of the administration's \nproposal, I asked a number of questions for the record regarding this \nnew safeguards agreement. Secretary Rice stated in response to a \nquestion asked in April of this year regarding India's new safeguards \nagreement that:\n\n       This Initiative will only allow for nuclear cooperation to \n     proceed with civil facilities and programs that are \n     safeguarded by the IAEA. The Government of India has agreed \n     that these safeguards will be in place in perpetuity. Under \n     the Initiative, India has committed to place all its current \n     and future civil nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards, \n     including monitoring and inspections. These procedures are \n     designed to detect--and thereby prevent--the diversion to \n     military use of any nuclear materials, technologies, or \n     equipment provided to India's civil nuclear facilities. India \n     has also committed to sign and adhere to an Additional \n     Protocol, which provides for even broader IAEA access to \n     facilities and information regarding nuclear related \n     activities.\n\n  In March of this year, Senator Biden asked Under Secretaries Robert \nJoseph and Nicholas Burns how they interpreted certain Indian \nstatements regarding their new safeguards agreement, specifically \nIndia's contention that it will be ``India-specific.'' They stated:\n\n       ``It will be incumbent on India to clarify what it means by \n     `India-specific' safeguards in the context of its \n     negotiations with the IAEA. In our view, the safeguards \n     agreement for India will be unique to India because India \n     presents a unique set of circumstances. India has agreed to \n     place all its civil nuclear facilities under safeguards in a \n     phased manner, along with future civil facilities, but India \n     is not an NPT party and will have non-civil facilities and \n     material outside of safeguards. However, there is an accepted \n     IAEA framework for safeguards (INFCIRC/66) that pre-dates the \n     NPT and is suited to safeguarding material in a non-NPT party \n     without full-scope safeguards. In its separation plan, India \n     has committed to safeguards in perpetuity.''\n\n  In November 2005, I asked Under Secretary Joseph what kinds of \nsafeguards will be applied to India's declared civil sites, facilities, \nand locations. He responded that:\n\n       ``Safeguards agreements are modeled after INFCIRC/153 (the \n     NPT safeguards agreement) or INFCIRC/66 (the Agency's \n     safeguards system predating the NPT). India will not likely \n     sign a safeguards agreement based strictly on INFCIRC/153, as \n     this would require safeguards on India's nuclear weapons \n     program. NPT-acknowledged nuclear weapon states have so-\n     called `voluntary' safeguards agreements that draw on \n     INFCIRC/153 language, but do not obligate the IAEA to \n     actually apply safeguards and do allow for the removal of \n     facilities or material from safeguards. We heard from other \n     states at the recent NSG meeting that they would not support \n     a ``voluntary offer'' arrangement as, in their view, it would \n     be tantamount to granting de facto nuclear weapon state \n     status to India. We have similarly indicated to India that we \n     would not view such an arrangement as defensible from a \n     nonproliferation standpoint. We therefore believe that the \n     logical approach to formulating a safeguards agreement for \n     India is to use INFCIRC/66, which is currently used at \n     India's four safeguarded reactors. For the most part, \n     INFCIRC/66 and INFCIRC/153 agreements result in very similar \n     technical measures actually applied at nuclear facilities.''\n  In view of these responses, and since S. 2429 contained similar \nlanguage, the Senate's India bill, S. 3709, specified with regard to \nIndia's safeguards agreement, and the determination the President had \nto make regarding it, that ``an agreement between India and the IAEA \nrequiring the application of safeguards in perpetuity in accordance \nwith IAEA standards, principles, and practices to civil nuclear \nfacilities, programs, and materials . . . has entered into force and \nthe text of such agreement has been made available to the appropriate \ncongressional committees.''\n  The conference agreement before us today does not include the \nlanguage from the S. 3709 regarding this element of the Presidential \ndetermination required to use the waiver authority we grant. Rather, \nthe conference agreement provides in section 104(b)(2) that ``India and \nthe IAEA have concluded all legal steps required prior to signature by \nthe parties of an agreement requiring the application of IAEA \nsafeguards in perpetuity in accordance with IAEA standards, principles, \nand practices, (including IAEA Board of Governors Document GOV/1621 \n(1973)) to India's civil nuclear facilities, materials, and programs . \n. . including materials used in or produced through the use of India's \ncivil nuclear facilities.''\n\n[[Page S11823]]\n\n  The conferees were assured by administration officials that the \nlanguage referring to ``all legal steps'' includes approval by the IAEA \nBoard of Governors. The conferees understand that safeguards agreements \nare signed after Board of Governors' approval, but that entry into \nforce can take additional time. Since Board of Governors' approval \nwould mean that the text of the safeguards agreement would be final, \nand it is unlikely that either the IAEA or India would sign an \nagreement that is not final, conferees agreed to this language. The \nconferees' intent was to secure as final a text as possible for \ncongressional review since the text of the new Indian safeguards \nagreement would be submitted to Congress as a part of the Presidential \ndetermination and waiver authority contained in section 104 of this \nconference agreement. It is the view of the conferees that this \nlanguage means that Congress will receive the final text of such an \nagreement as a part of the President's determination.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BIDEN. The Senate will shortly take a momentous step in \nU.S.-India relations by passing the conference report on H.R. 5682, the \nHenry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation \nAct of 2006. Enactment of this legislation brings us much closer to the \nday when India will resume peaceful nuclear commerce, despite its \nstatus as a state that has nuclear weapons and has never been a state \nparty to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It will help bring India \ninto the global nuclear nonproliferation system. It also helps to \nremove a major irritant in the relations between our two countries.\n  This bill is a tremendous victory for U.S.-India relations. And it \nincreases the prospect for stability and progress in South Asia and the \nrest of the world.\n  It has become cliche to speak of the U.S.-India relationship as a \nbond between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest \ndemocracy--but this cliche is also a fact. Shared political values are \nthe foundation for our relationship, a firm belief in the dignity of \nman and the consent of the governed.\n  Senator Lugar and I yield to no one in our commitment to nuclear \nnonproliferation. We have taken great care, in this legislation, to \nprotect the role of Congress and of the international institutions that \nenforce nuclear nonproliferation.\n  This legislation was the result of hard compromises--compromises \nbetween our two countries and between Congress and the executive \nbranch. The end result, however, was overwhelming bipartisan support, \nin both the House and the Senate. That level of broad, solid, \nbipartisan buy-in was absolutely essential when crafting legislation \nwith such long-term impact on vital American interests.\n  I want to pay special tribute tonight to the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar of Indiana, for his \ntremendous contribution to securing that broad, bipartisan consensus. \nThe administration originally proposed legislation that would have \neffectively taken away the power of Congress to review an agreement for \nnuclear cooperation with India, and Senator Lugar was under great \npressure to accept that proposal. He did not do that. Instead, he held \nfour hearings--three open and one closed--that allowed all sides to \nexpress their views and that enabled Senators from both parties to \nraise their concerns with the approval procedure that the \nadministration had proposed. Then he and I worked to craft a Senate \nbill that passed by a vote of 16-2 in committee and 85-12 on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Senator Lugar performed a signal service to our country when he added \ntitle II to this legislation, the implementing legislation for the U.S. \nAdditional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is \nfitting that this legislation has been combined with the India nuclear \nbill, since part of the nuclear deal is for India to negotiate its own \nAdditional Protocol with the IAEA. It will also be a notable benefit to \nU.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy when the United States finally \nratifies its Additional Protocol, giving our country greater \ncredibility as it presses other countries to allow the IAEA to increase \nits inspections of their nuclear programs. Ratification of the U.S.-\nIAEA Additional Protocol was long delayed, and Senator Lugar's \nleadership on this issue was absolutely vital to this final, successful \nconclusion.\n  In conference with the House of Representatives, Senator Lugar and I \nonce again worked for a measure that could gain broad support from the \nSenate. We worked with the House conferees to craft a bill that \nembodied the best ideas from each house of Congress. At the same time, \nwe worked with the Administration to reach agreement on a wide range of \nissues, without sacrificing the principles that each house had written \ninto its legislation. We and the other conferees chose substance over \nrhetoric. The result is a conference report that will command the same \nbroad, bipartisan support today that was demonstrated in the Senate 3 \nweeks ago.\n  I would like also to acknowledge the staff members who have \ncontributed to the success of this legislation. On the Senate side, the \nForeign Relations Committee was most ably served by Ken Myers III, \nThomas Moore, Edward Levine and Brian McKeon. Mr. Stephen Rademaker of \nthe majority leader's staff was also an important contributor to our \nefforts. On the House side, the conferees were most ably served by \nDouglas Seay, David Fite and David Abramowitz, among others.\n  The U.S.-India agreement is much more than just a nuclear deal. I \nbelieve historians will see this as part of a dramatic and positive \ndeparture in the U.S.-India relationship that was begun by President \nClinton and continued by President Bush.\n  In a time when relationships between states are critically important \nin shaping the world in which we live, no relationship is more \nimportant than the one we're building with India. There is still much \nto be done in India, as a stable and secure India is very much in \nAmerica's national interest. We should work to help India increase its \nenergy production, combat terrorism, and guard against epidemics of \ninfectious diseases. We should help both India and Pakistan to ease \ntensions between their countries and, someday, to walk back from the \nnuclear precipice. And India should continue its progress toward the \nfront rank of world leaders, and especially of leaders in combating the \nproliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Enactment of \nthis bill today helps both countries to keep moving on the path of \ncooperation for a better world.\n  In conclusion, I would like to turn to an issue raised recently by \nsome experts, whether the legislation before us, by citing a particular \nIAEA document, might undermine the principle of perpetuity of \nsafeguards in India. My view is that the IAEA document makes a real \ncontribution to our understanding of safeguards perpetuity.\n  The document cited by this legislation appears in section 104(b)(2), \nthe second determination that the President will have to make when \nsubmitting a U.S.-India agreement for nuclear cooperation to the \nCongress. It is an IAEA Board of Governors memo cited as GOV/1621 of 20 \nAugust 1973. We have been given permission to publish this document, so \nI will ask that it be printed in the Record at the end of these \nremarks.\n  The Board of Governors memo makes clear that safeguards on nuclear \nmaterial will extend until that material no longer has any possible \nnuclear weapons use, or until it is exchanged with an equal amount of \npreviously unsafeguarded material, or until it leaves the country--in \nwhich case safeguards may continue elsewhere. In other words, if you \nmove some imported fuel or equipment to a new location, that location \nbecomes subject to safeguards.\n  The memo also makes clear that safeguards on ``nuclear material, \nequipment, facilities or non-nuclear material'' supplied to a nuclear \nfacility will apply as well to fissile material ``produced, processed \nor used in or in connection with'' a safeguarded facility. In other \nwords, any fissile material produced by a safeguarded facility becomes \nsubject to safeguards even after it leaves that facility. Until that \noutput no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use, safeguards \nfollow it; that is a real example of perpetuity of sanctions.\n  At the same time, perpetuity does not mean that a facility will be \nsubject\n\n[[Page S11824]]\n\nto safeguards until the end of time. A facility can be decommissioned \nso that it, too, no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use. Or, if \nthe only reason for safeguards is that the facility has imported \nequipment or material, removal of all such equipment or material from \nthe facility could render it eligible for removal from safeguards. \nThus, India's reprocessing plant is safeguarded when it handles spent \nfuel from imported uranium, but not when India is using it to reprocess \nspent fuel made from domestic uranium. That is the way safeguards have \nworked for years in India.\n  The Government of India has announced that eight more of its existing \npower reactors will be declared as civil and opened to IAEA inspection. \nIndia would gain great credibility if it were to let those reactors be \ninspected even if they use domestic nuclear fuel. Indian officials have \nsuggested, however, that they may insist upon the right to remove those \nreactors from safeguards if foreign fuel supplies are cut off, and the \nsafeguards agreement that India negotiates with the IAEA may allow for \nthat. There is precedent for such an arrangement, in states that do not \nhave full-scope safeguards, and it would be up to the IAEA Board of \nGovernors, of which the United States is a member, to decide whether \nthat arrangement was permissible in this case. It would be up to \nCongress and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of course, to consider \nwhether that sort of safeguards arrangement was sufficient to warrant \nauthorizing peaceful nuclear commerce with India. And it would be up to \nthe executive branch to determine whether to authorize a particular \nexport to India, in light of the safeguards that would govern the \nfacility for which the export was requested.\n  India has also said that many new power reactors will be put under \nIAEA safeguards. If those reactors are foreign-built, like the Tarapur \nreactor, there will be no way that they can be withdrawn from \nsafeguards unless they are decommissioned. If they are domestic designs \nbut use some foreign equipment, there will be no way to withdraw them \nfrom safeguards without first removing the foreign equipment. And if \nforeign equipment should be used in one of the eight domestically built \nreactors that are put under safeguards, then that equipment, too, would \nhave to be removed before that reactor could be removed from \nsafeguards.\n  As a matter of principle, then, perpetuity in safeguards applies more \nto material and equipment than it does to a whole facility, unless that \nfacility is foreign-built. In practice, however, the only reactors that \nIndia might pull out of its safeguards regime would be the eight newly-\nsafeguarded ones, and I believe that the only time that this might \noccur would be if India were to come under sanctions because of \nimproper nuclear activities or weapons proliferation. In such a case, \nthe regime for nuclear cooperation with India would likely be \ncollapsing anyway.\n  The material follows.\n\n                               SAFEGUARDS\n\n   (b) The Formulation of Certain Provisions in Agreements Under the \nAgency's Safeguards System (1965, as Provisionally extended in 1966 and \n                                 1968)\n\n                   Memorandum by the Director General\n\n       (1) A substantial number of Governors have urged that there \n     should be a greater degree of standardization than in the \n     past with respect to the duration and termination of such \n     agreements as may henceforth be concluded under the Agency's \n     Safeguards System (1965, as Provisionally Extended in 1966 \n     and 1968) for the application of safeguards in connection \n     with nuclear material, equipment, facilities or non-nuclear \n     material supplied to States by third parties. To achieve \n     this, it is recommended that the following two concepts \n     should be reflected in these agreements:\n       (a) That the duration of the agreement should be related to \n     the period of actual use of the items in the recipient State; \n     and\n       (b) That the provisions for terminating the agreement \n     should be formulated in such a way that the rights and \n     obligations of the parties continue to apply in connection \n     with supplied nuclear material and with special fissionable \n     material produced, processed or used in or in connection with \n     supplied nuclear material, equipment, facilities or non-\n     nuclear material, until such time as the Agency has \n     terminated the application of safeguards thereto, in \n     accordance with the provisions of paragraph 26 or 27 of the \n     Agency's Safeguards System.\n       A short exposition with respect to the application of these \n     concepts is annexed hereto.\n       (2) The proposed standardization would appear likely to \n     facilitate the uniform application of safeguards measures. It \n     is furthermore to be noted that the combined operation of the \n     two concepts would be consistent with the application of the \n     general principle embodied in paragraph 16 of the Agency's \n     Safeguards System.\n\n\n                     REQUESTED ACTION BY THE BOARD\n\n       (3) In bringing this matter to the Board's attention, the \n     Director General seeks the views of the Board as to whether \n     it concurs with the two concepts set out in paragraph 1 \n     above.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 ANNEX\n\n       (1) In the case of receipt by a State of source or special \n     fissionable material, equipment, facilities or non-nuclear \n     material from a supplier outside that State, the duration of \n     the relevant agreement under the Agency's Safeguards System \n     would be related to the actual use in the recipient State of \n     the material or items supplied. This may be accomplished by \n     requiring, in accordance with present practice, that the \n     material or items supplied be listed in the inventory called \n     for by the agreement.\n       (2) The primary effect of termination of the agreement, \n     either by act of the parties or effluxion of time, would be \n     that no further supplied nuclear material, equipment, \n     facilities or non-nuclear material could be added to the \n     inventory. On the other hand, the rights and obligations of \n     the parties, as provided for in the agreement, would continue \n     to apply in connection with any supplied material or items \n     and with any special fissionable material produced, processed \n     or used in or in connection with any supplied material or \n     items which had been included in the inventory, until such \n     material or items had been removed from the inventory.\n       (3) With respect to nuclear material, conditions for \n     removal are those set out in paragraph 26 or 27 of the \n     Agency's Safeguards System; with respect to equipment, \n     facilities and non-nuclear material, conditions for removal \n     could be based on paragraph 26. A number of agreements \n     already concluded have prescribed such conditions in part, by \n     providing for deletion from the inventory of nuclear \n     material, equipment and facilities which are returned to the \n     supplying State or transferred (under safeguards) to a third \n     State. The additional provisions contemplated would stipulate \n     that items or non-nuclear material could be removed from the \n     purview of the agreement if they had been consumed, were no \n     longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the \n     point of view of safeguards or had become practicably \n     irrecoverable.\n       (4) The effect of reflecting the two concepts in agreements \n     would be that special fissionable material which had been \n     produced, processed or used in or in connection with supplied \n     material or items before they were removed from the scope of \n     the agreement, would remain or be listed in the inventory, \n     and such special fissionable material, together with any \n     supplied nuclear material remaining in the inventory, would \n     be subject to safeguards until the Agency had terminated \n     safeguards on that special fissionable and nuclear material \n     in accordance with the provisions of the Agency's Safeguards \n     System. Thus, the actual termination of the operation of the \n     provisions of the agreement would take place only when \n     everything had been removed from the inventory.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today the Senate passes H.R. 5682, the \nHenry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation \nAct.\n  This agreement is the most important strategic diplomatic initiative \nundertaken by President Bush. By concluding this pact and the far-\nreaching set of cooperative agreements that accompany it, the President \nhas embraced a long-term outlook that seeks to enhance the core \nstrength of our foreign policy in a way that will give us new \ndiplomatic options and improve global stability.\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations undertook an extensive review of \nthis agreement. We held 4 public hearings with testimony from 17 \nwitnesses, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. We received a \nclassified briefing from Under Secretaries of State Nick Burns and Bob \nJoseph. Numerous briefings were held for staff with experts from the \nCongressional Research Service, the State Department, and the National \nSecurity Council. I submitted more than 170 written questions for the \nrecord to the Department of State on details of the agreement and \nposted the answers on my web site.\n  The agreement allows India to receive nuclear fuel, technology, and \nreactors from the United States--benefits that were previously denied \nto India because of its status outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, (NPT). This pact can be a lasting incentive for India to \nabstain from further nuclear weapons tests and to cooperate closely \nwith the United States in stopping proliferation, and our legislation \nfurther strengthens this situation.\n\n[[Page S11825]]\n\n  The conference agreement before us is an important step toward \nimplementing the nuclear agreement with India, but we should understand \nthat it is not the final step. This legislation sets the rules for \nsubsequent Congressional consideration of a so-called 123 agreement \nbetween the United States and India. A 123 agreement is the term for an \nagreement for civil nuclear cooperation arranged pursuant to the \nconditions outlined in section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.\n  I am pleased to note that the conference agreement does not restrict \nnor does it predetermine congressional action on the forthcoming 123 \nagreement. Unlike the administration's original legislative proposal, \nthis bill preserves congressional prerogatives with regard to \nconsideration of a future 123 agreement. Under the administration's \noriginal proposal, the 123 agreement would have entered into force 90 \ndays after submission unless both Houses of Congress voted against it \nand with majorities that could overcome a likely Presidential veto. I \nam pleased the administration changed course on this matter and agreed \nto submit the 123 agreement with India to Congress under existing \nprocedures in the Atomic Energy Act. This means that both the House and \nthe Senate must cast a positive vote of support before the 123 \nagreement can enter into force. In my view, this better protects \nCongress's role in the process and ensures congressional views will be \ntaken into consideration. In addition, it does not limit our actions to \na single ``no'' vote, which could have severe consequences for United \nStates-India relations. It would be particularly risky if that were the \nonly course available to Congress, no matter what its concerns may be.\n  Title II of this conference agreement contains legislation on the \nU.S. Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency AEA. President Bush called on the \nSenate to ratify this important agreement on February 11, 2004, and the \nSenate did so on March 31, 2004. This conference agreement contains \nimportant implementing provisions for our Additional Protocol that the \nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations has been working on for more than \n2 years. This legislative measure is critical because our Additional \nProtocol is not a self-executing agreement, and passage of implementing \nlegislation completes Congressional action and permits the agreement to \ncome into force. Our action today will allow the President to complete \nU.S. ratification and make this Nation a party to this important IAEA \nsafeguards measure. U.S. ratification and implementation of the \nAdditional Protocol will give Secretary Rice and our representative to \nthe IAEA in Vienna, Austria, an important diplomatic tool in the battle \nagainst proliferation as we maintain our longstanding leadership and \nsupport for the IAEA safeguards system. Our Additional Protocol is one \npart of that support, just like our annual voluntary contributions to \nthe IAEA, and they involve significant congressional oversight and \ninvolvement. Approval of this legislation today is good news because it \nshows that Congress supports the critical nonproliferation work of the \nIAEA.\n  I thank Senator Biden for his close cooperation on developing this \nconference agreement. I thank our House colleagues, Chairman Hyde and \nRanking Member Lantos, for their close cooperation and hard work. \nTogether, we have constructed a law that allows the United States to \nseize an important strategic opportunity while ensuring a strong \ncongressional oversight role, reinforcing U.S. nonproliferation efforts \nand maintaining our responsibilities under the NPT. I also want to \nthank all members of the Foreign Relations Committee for their support.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is set to give rubberstamp \napproval to legislation that would waive the most important parts of \nour nuclear nonproliferation laws, but only with respect to India. This \nso-called U.S.-India nuclear cooperation agreement is a mistake, and \nour Nation's efforts to draw a line in the sand against further \nproliferation of nuclear materials and technology may suffer as a \nresult.\n  This agreement signals the willingness of the United States to look \nthe other way when it comes to compliance with the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty. At a time when nuclear weapons programs in North \nKorea and Iran are front-page news, the United States should not be \ngiving its blessing to any nuclear weapons program that is not in one \nhundred percent compliance with all nonproliferation treaties. It is \nespecially galling that the only thing the United States appears to be \ngetting from this agreement is a vague assurance of improved relations. \nThat just does not sounds like a good deal to me.\n  India is a strategically important country, and the influence of the \nworld's most populous democracy is expected to increase in the coming \nyears. Closer relations between the United States and India is a worthy \ngoal. However, the nuclear cooperation agreement before the Senate is a \nbad deal for the United States, and I will not support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11825-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR THE SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE ONE \n                         HUNDRED NINTH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 631, submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 631) urging the Government of Sudan \n     and the international community to implement the agreement \n     for a peacekeeping force under the command and control of the \n     United Nations in Darfur.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, along with Senator Brownback, Senator \nKennedy, and others, I rise today in support of a bipartisan resolution \non the crisis in Darfur, Sudan, and the urgent need to get a robust \npeacekeeping force on the ground there as soon as possible.\n  This Congress will adjourn in the next several hours or several days, \nbut\n\n[[Page S11826]]\n\nthe crisis in Darfur continues. As it continues, many innocent people \nwill lose their lives in what our administration and most of the world \nhas characterized as genocide.\n  On Wednesday of this week, in a meeting with the United States \nSpecial Envoy to the Sudan, Andrew Natsios, we asked him: What can \nCongress do at this point in time to help? Along with some technical \nchanges in law that we will certainly consider, Mr. Natsios asked that \nwe pass this resolution. Again, I think his hope is we will bring this \nmatter to the attention of the American people and express to the world \ncommunity our continuing alarm over this crisis in Darfur.\n  The President approved Mr. Natsios to his position in September. For \nmonths before that, many of us here in the Senate had urged the \nPresident to name a special envoy. We believed that violence and \nsuffering in Darfur demanded a single individual in a leadership \nposition who could devote all his time and energy to working to resolve \nthis terrible crisis. That places a special obligation on us to listen \nwhen Mr. Natsios asks for help.\n  The resolution before us spells out the terrible facts of the \ngenocide in Darfur and outlines two significant responses by the \ninternational community. The first was the passage by the United \nNations Security Council of Resolution 1706, which authorized a 23,000-\nperson peacekeeping force to Darfur, which was to be deployed no later \nthan October 1 of this year. It is now well into December, and not a \nsingle U.N. peacekeeper has been deployed to Darfur, for the simple \nreason the Sudanese Government has continued to refuse to give consent \nto this United Nations mission to be sent expressly to protect innocent \npeople in Darfur.\n  It looked for a moment last month as if Secretary General Kofi Annan \nhad managed to break through this impasse.\n  On November 16, Secretary General Annan, along with the African \nUnion, met in Ethiopia and helped broker the Addis Ababa agreement with \nthe Sudanese Foreign Minister. This agreement laid out a roadmap for a \njoint or hybrid peacekeeping mission combining United Nations and \nAfrican Union personnel under U.N. command and control. The Sudanese \nagreed to this in principle, although they did not agree on the spot to \nthe numbers spelled out in the agreement; namely, 10,000 additional \nmilitary peacekeepers and 3,000 police officers. These troops could \njoin the 7,000 African Union monitors already in Darfur.\n  The resolution we have introduced on a bipartisan basis expresses the \nsupport of the United States Senate for this agreement, as well as U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 1706. It also declares that numbers and \nstandards laid out in the Addis Ababa agreement represent the minimum \nacceptable. Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Darfur over \nthe last 3 years; 2\\1/2\\ million have been driven from their homes. In \nrecent months, violence has escalated.\n  You and I and our colleagues in the Senate are thinking now about \nholiday gifts, Christmas gifts. We are thinking about being with our \nfamilies and sharing a peaceful moment in our homes with our friends \nand with those we love at this time of year. As we consider the safety \nand security of our lives in the United States as we approach this \nholiday season, we cannot forget those who are suffering and dying \naround the world and in this spot on Earth known as Darfur. You cannot \npick up a newspaper in America this week without seeing full-page ads \nurging the United States to take action, urging Congress to take \naction. This resolution we pass may not save a single life, but it may \nstart a call to arms across this country and around the world that we \nwill not tolerate a genocide.\n  Over 10 years ago there was a genocide in Rwanda. Sadly, we never \naccepted the reality of what faced us. Sadly, we never responded. There \nwere a few stalwart, courageous voices in the Senate. My predecessor \nSenator Paul Simon, and the retiring Senator from Vermont, Jim \nJeffords, spoke out. If they had been listened to, hundreds of \nthousands of lives could have been spared in the Rwandan genocide. Now \nthis is our time.\n  I commend President Bush and his administration for acknowledging \nthat, indeed, we face a genocide. But having made that admission, it \ncalls on every civilized country on earth and every civilized person on \nEarth to do something, not just to acknowledge this terrible human \ntragedy but to do something.\n  In our meeting this week, special envoy Natsios described one murder \namong many. He told us of a woman in a refugee camp whose 1-year-old \nbaby was shot and killed by a jingaweit militia man while she held the \nbaby in her arms. The world cannot allow this to happen. Today we \nexpress our strongest support for a real peacekeeping force for Darfur \nmade up of African Union and U.N. personnel to save the next child in a \nmother's arms.\n  I urge the Senate to pass this resolution. I say with real regret \nthat it is certainly the least we can do today. I certainly wish we \ncould do more.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 631) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 631\n\n       Whereas Congress declared on July 22, 2004 that the \n     atrocities in Darfur were genocide;\n       Whereas, on September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell testified that ``genocide has been committed in \n     Darfur'';\n       Whereas, on June 30, 2005, President Bush confirmed that \n     ``the violence in Darfur region is clearly genocide [and t]he \n     human cost is beyond calculation'';\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2006, President Bush stated, ``We will \n     call genocide by its rightful name, and we will stand up for \n     the innocent until the peace of Darfur is secured.'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of people have died and over \n     2,500,000 have been displaced in Darfur since 2003;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has failed in its \n     responsibility to protect the many peoples of Darfur;\n       Whereas the international community has failed to hold \n     persons responsible for crimes against humanity in Darfur \n     accountable;\n       Whereas, on May 5, 2006, the Government of Sudan and the \n     largest rebel faction in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation \n     Movement, led by Minni Minnawi, signed the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement (DPA);\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan has not disarmed and \n     demobilized the Janjaweed despite repeated pledges to do so, \n     including in the DPA;\n       Whereas violence in Darfur escalated in the months \n     following the signing of the DPA, with increased attacks \n     against civilians and humanitarian workers;\n       Whereas violence has spread to the neighboring states of \n     Chad and the Central African Republic, threatening regional \n     peace and security;\n       Whereas, in July 2006, more humanitarian aid workers were \n     killed than in the previous 3 years combined;\n       Whereas increased violence has forced some humanitarian \n     organizations to suspend operations, leaving 40 percent of \n     the population of Darfur inaccessible to aid workers;\n       Whereas, on August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), \n     asserting that the existing United Nations Mission in Sudan \n     (UNMIS) ``shall take over from [African Mission in Sudan] \n     AMIS responsibility for supporting the implementation of the \n     Darfur Peace Agreement upon the expiration of AMIS' mandate \n     but in any event no later than 31 December 2006'', and that \n     UNMIS ``shall be strengthened by up to 17,300 military \n     personnel . . . up to 3,300 civilian police personnel and up \n     to 16 Formed Police Units'', which ``shall begin to be \n     deployed [to Darfur] no later than 1 October 2006'';\n       Whereas, on September 19, 2006, President Bush announced \n     the appointment of Andrew Natsios as Presidential Special \n     Envoy to Sudan to lead United States efforts to bring peace \n     to the Darfur region in Sudan;\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2006, high-level consultations led \n     by Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, and \n     Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the African Union \n     Commission, and including representatives of the Arab League, \n     the European Union, the Government of Sudan, and other \n     national governments, produced the ``Addis Ababa Agreement'';\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the Darfur conflict could \n     be resolved only through an all-inclusive political process;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the DPA must be made more \n     inclusive, and ``called upon all parties--Government and DPA \n     non-signatories--to immediately commit to a cessation of \n     hostilities in Darfur in order to give [the peace process] \n     the best chances for success'';\n       Whereas the Agreement included a plan to establish a United \n     Nations-African Union peacekeeping operation;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the peacekeeping \n     operation would consist of\n\n[[Page S11827]]\n\n     17,000 military troops and 3,000 police, and would have a \n     primarily African character;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that the peacekeeping \n     operation must be logistically and financially sustainable, \n     with support coming from the United Nations;\n       Whereas the Agreement stated that command and control \n     structures for the United Nations-African Union force would \n     be provided by the United Nations;\n       Whereas the Government of Sudan's Foreign Minister agreed \n     to the conclusions of the High Level Consultation on the \n     Situation in Darfur, though the Foreign Minister indicated \n     that he would need to consult with his government on the size \n     of the peacekeeping mission;\n       Whereas, at an international press conference on November \n     27, 2006, Sudanese President Omar Hassan Al-Bashir rejected \n     the Addis Ababa Agreement and reiterated his objections to \n     any substantive United Nations involvement in Darfur, saying, \n     ``Troops in Darfur should be part of the [African Union] AU \n     and under command of the AU'';\n       Whereas it is imperative that a peacekeeping force in \n     Darfur have the sufficient strength and mandate to provide \n     adequate security to the people of Darfur; and\n       Whereas Presidential Special Envoy Andrew Natsios set \n     December 31, 2006 as the deadline for the Government of Sudan \n     to comply with the demands of the international community or \n     face serious consequences: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports, given the rapidly deteriorating situation on \n     the ground in Darfur, the principles of the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement in order to increase security and stability for the \n     people of Darfur;\n       (2) declares that the deployment of a United Nations-\n     African Union peacekeeping force under the command and \n     control of the United Nations, as laid out in the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement, is the minimum acceptable effort on the part of \n     the international community to protect the people of Darfur;\n       (3) further supports the strengthening of the African Union \n     peacekeeping mission in Sudan so that it may improve its \n     performance with regards to civilian protection as the \n     African Union peacekeeping mission begins to transfer \n     responsibility for protecting the people of Darfur to the \n     United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force under the \n     command and control of the United Nations, as laid out in the \n     Addis Ababa Agreement;\n       (4) calls upon the Government of Sudan to immediately--\n       (A) allow the implementation of the United Nations light \n     and heavy support packages as provided for in the Addis Ababa \n     Agreement; and\n       (B) work with the United Nations and the international \n     community to deploy United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur in \n     keeping with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 \n     (2006);\n       (5) calls upon all parties to the conflict to immediately--\n       (A) adhere to the 2004 N'Djamena ceasefire; and\n       (B) respect the impartiality and neutrality of humanitarian \n     agencies so that relief workers can have unfettered access to \n     their beneficiary populations and deliver desperately needed \n     assistance;\n       (6) urges the President to--\n       (A) continue to work with other members of the \n     international community, including the permanent members of \n     the United Nations Security Council, the African Union, the \n     European Union, the Arab League, Sudan's trading partners, \n     and the Government of Sudan to facilitate the urgently needed \n     deployment of the peacekeeping force called for by United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1706;\n       (B) ensure the ability of any peacekeeping force deployed \n     to Darfur to carry out its mandate by providing adequate \n     funding and working with our international partners to \n     provide technical assistance, logistical support, \n     intelligence gathering capabilities, and military assets;\n       (C) work with members of the United Nations Security \n     Council and the international community to develop and impose \n     a set of meaningful economic and diplomatic sanctions against \n     the Government of Sudan should the Government of Sudan \n     continue to refuse to cooperate with the implementation of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706 and the \n     principles contained in the Addis Ababa Agreement; and\n       (D) work with members of the United Nations Security \n     Council and the international community to address escalating \n     insecurity in Chad and the Central African Republic; and\n       (7) strongly supports United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1706 and the principles embedded therein.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe passage of the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for \nMothers who deliver Infants Early Act, the PREEMIE Act. This \nlegislation which I introduced with Senator Lamar Alexander passed \nunanimously in the Senate last August and I am pleased to inform my \ncolleagues that after working with the House on some modifications to \nthe bill, it has now passed in both Chambers.\n  The PREEMIE Act takes a big step toward understanding the causes of \npremature birth and how to prevent it. Specifically, the bill \nauthorizes approximately $65 million over 5 years to expand and \nintensify activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nwith respect to preterm births and infant mortality, to study the \nrelationship between prematurity and birth defects, to carry out a \npublic and health care provider education and supportive services \neffort, to authorize an Interagency Coordinating Council on Prematurity \nand Low Birthweight, and to convene a Surgeon General's Conference on \nPreterm Birth which will make recommendations to the public and private \nsectors on ways to better identify and treat the causes of and risk \nfactors for preterm labor and delivery.\n  This is not the same bill the Senate passed unanimously. To begin \nwith, this bill authorizes $26 million less than the bill the Senate \npassed last August. This is due in large part to the removal of \nauthorizations for multidisciplinary research underway at the National \nInstitutes of Health. It is my hope that despite these changes, the NIH \nwill continue this vital research in order to better understand the \nrole DNA plays in prematurity and to improve maternal and fetal health \noutcomes.\n  Nearly 1 out of every 8 babies in the U.S. is born prematurely--that \nis more than 1,300 babies each day and more than 500,000 each year. \nAccording to recent data, in 2002 the infant mortality rate actually \nincreased for the first time since 1958. Much of this increase is \nattributable to infant death in the first month of life, of which \nprematurity is the leading cause.\n  Although we know some risk factors associated with prematurity such \nas advanced age of the mother, smoking, and certain chronic diseases, \nthe cause of nearly 50 percent of all premature births is still \nunknown. Prematurity has been linked to such long-term health problems \nas cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, and vision and hearing loss.\n  According to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine, medical \ncare costs due to prematurity and low birth weight were $16.9 billion \nin 2005, $33,200 per preterm infant. The March of Dimes estimates that \nabout half of preterm birth medical care costs were paid for by \nMedicaid. For employers, health care costs for a premature baby during \nthe first year of life average $41,610 compared to $2,830 for a full-\nterm baby. However, none of these numbers can quantify the emotional \ntoll a premature birth takes on a family.\n  That is why the PREEMIE bill is so essential. This legislation will \ngo a long way toward helping families during what can be the most \ndifficult moments of their baby's life and will help us better \nunderstand and prevent premature births in the future.\n  I conclude by thanking Senator Alexander for his leadership on this \nlegislation. He has been a terrific partner in this effort and I look \nforward to working with him in the 110th Congress. I also thank \nChairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy and their staffs for making \nthe passage of the PREEMIE Act a priority this Congress. Lastly, I \nwould to recognize Page Kranbuhl of Senator Alexander's staff for her \nwork on this legislation as well as Emil Wigode, Carolyn Doyle and Jo \nMerrill of the March of Dimes who have stood with us every step of the \nway.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate concur in the \nHouse amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11830]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Security Strategy of the United States, \n     dated September 17, 2002, concludes that ``[i]n Africa, \n     promise and opportunity sit side-by-side with disease, war, \n     and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of \n     the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic \n     priority combating global terror. American interests and \n     American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: \n     we will work with others for an African continent that lives \n     in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.''.\n       (2) On February 16, 2005, the Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency testified, ``In Africa, chronic \n     instability will continue to hamper counterterrorism efforts \n     and pose heavy humanitarian and peacekeeping burdens.''.\n       (3) According to the United States Agency for International \n     Development, ``Given its size, population, and resources, the \n     Congo is an important player in Africa and of long-term \n     interest to the United States.''.\n       (4) The Democratic Republic of the Congo is 2,345,410 \n     square miles (approximately \\1/4\\ the size of the United \n     States), lies at the heart of Africa, and touches every major \n     region of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, a secure, peaceful, \n     and prosperous Democratic Republic of the Congo would have a \n     profound impact on progress throughout Africa.\n       (5) The most recent war in the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo, which erupted in 1998, spawned some of the world's \n     worst human rights atrocities and drew in six neighboring \n     countries.\n       (6) Despite the conclusion of a peace agreement and \n     subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, both the \n     real and perceived presence of armed groups hostile to the \n     Governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi continue to serve \n     as a major source of regional instability and an apparent \n     pretext for continued interference in the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo by its neighbors.\n       (7) A mortality study completed in December 2004 by the \n     International Rescue Committee found that 31,000 people were \n     dying monthly and 3,800,000 people had died in the previous \n     six years because of the conflict in the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo and resulting disintegration of the social \n     service infrastructure, making this one of the deadliest \n     conflicts since World War II.\n       (8) In 2004, Amnesty International estimated that at least \n     40,000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured \n     in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1998, and \n     nearly two-thirds of ongoing abuses against women and girls \n     are perpetrated by members of the security forces, \n     particularly the Forces Armes de la Republique Democratique \n     du Congo (FARDC) and the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC).\n       (9) According to the Department of State, ``returning one \n     of Africa's largest countries [the Democratic Republic of the \n     Congo] to full peace and stability will require significant \n     United States investments in support of national elections, \n     the reintegration of former combatants, the return and \n     reintegration of refugees and [internally displaced persons], \n     establishment of central government control over vast \n     territories, and promotion of national reconciliation and \n     good governance''.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Mr. President, today we were able to finish up our work in \na very successful way before we leave for the year. We passed a \ncontinuing funding resolution, the critical tax extenders package, and \na number of important legislative items, as well as a list of executive \nnominations. We have had a long week--a productive week--and I do want \nto thank all my colleagues for their patience and their dedicated \nefforts.\n  As we close, I also want to thank all of the staff at the desk and \nthose in the offices above this Chamber and below this Chamber who will \nbe here long after we adjourn, preparing and finalizing all of the \nbusiness we have just completed.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize the pages who are with us \ntonight, and those who are not with us tonight, but those who have all \nleft their home States to come to Washington for the semester to work \nin this Chamber.\n  We thank each and every one of you for your tremendous, tremendous \nwork. It is 4:34 a.m. now, and we have finished a long day, and people \nalways laugh when I say being Senate majority leader is like doing \nheart transplants. But times like this make it all very clear that they \nare very similar because at about 4:34 a.m. in the morning, we would be \nputting those last few stitches in the transplanted heart. And as you \ndo that, you begin to feel that anticipation of that heart, all of a \nsudden starting to beat again and coming alive, which gives new life \nand rebirth to an individual who would otherwise die.\n  I say that because that is what I would be doing if I were not here, \nand I was doing 12, 13 years ago. I may well be doing it next year. But \nthat sort of change is good. And change can be, as I said yesterday, \nconstructive. It can be rebirth. And it can give real hope.\n  I gave my formal remarks on leaving the Senate yesterday, but the \nwords I speak over the next 2 minutes are the very last I will ever \ngive in this Chamber. In 2 minutes, maybe less, that door closes, and \nthe chapter ends.\n  After I gave my farewell address yesterday, I had dinner last night \nwith Karyn and with my three boys, Jonathan, Bryan, and Harrison, who \nhad all come back to hear my farewell address yesterday. They had to \nfly in from New York, take a train from New Jersey, and come up from \nTennessee. And because we are empty nesters, they are all out of the \nhouse now. It is getting increasingly rare that we are all together.\n  But one of the things we did last night is we sat around a table--it \nhappened to be at a restaurant--and thought a little bit about past \nexperiences. And you can imagine how their lives have changed over 12 \nyears. We knew this night would come, this final minute or so would \ncome, for a long time. I have known for 12 years, and that is the \nnormal life cycle that one can expect if you are a citizen legislator, \nwhich I have said again and again that is what I tried to be in self-\nlimiting my period here in the Senate.\n  But over that period, we have seen these three young boys--all very \nyoung--grow into three robust young men. I have seen a wife grow more \nbeautiful by the day. I have seen a relationship of family, and a \nrelationship between a husband and a wife, grow stronger over these 12 \nyears through this opportunity the people of Tennessee have given me \nand Karyn and my three boys to serve them.\n  I have seen faith strengthened and challenged by the responsibility \nthe people of Tennessee give us as elected officials when they select \nus to represent their hopes and their dreams.\n  I have also seen in this body, in watching my colleagues and being \nwith my colleagues, a group of men and a group of women who are very \ngood people, with good intentions, who are unselfish, who are people of \nfaith, people of vision, people with real dreams, not perfect, as we \nall know--and we all have our foibles, and we all have our weaknesses--\nbut people who are good.\n  My dad always used to say: ``Good people beget good people.'' ``Good \npeople beget good people.'' And I think that as we go through periods \nof change here, we can have that tradition of good people in this body \nbegetting good people to continue.\n  I will close, again quoting from Dad's letter I mentioned yesterday \nthat he wrote to future generations prior to his death.\n  I mentioned yesterday that that is a great thing for all of us to do \nlater in life. What advice would you give people you will never see a \ngeneration or two generations later? I will close with his words from \nthat same letter. This was after a list of things he wrote, giving his \ncounsel and advice--very simple things, by the way, commonsense things. \nHe said:\n\n       Finally, I believe it is so terribly important in life to \n     stay humble. Use your talents wisely and use other people's \n     talents to help other people.\n\n  ``Help other people.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/08/senate-section/article/S11845-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
