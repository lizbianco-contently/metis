Mr. President, the confirmation over judicial filibusters \nis, I believe, the greatest single constitutional issue to confront the \nSenate in our lifetime. That is because this issue involves the very \nspecial and unique relationship between the Senate and the Presidency \nand the special relationship between the Senate and the courts. It \ninvolves all three branches of government. In addition, it involves the \ninteraction between the minority and majority parties within the \nSenate.\n  The Senate confronts so many significant issues every month, every \nyear, but none of them touches the grand institutions of American \ndemocracy the way this one does. The President has the constitutional \nobligation to appoint judges, and the Senate has the constitutional \nresponsibility to offer its advice and consent.\n  For 214 years, the Senate gave every nominee brought to the floor a \nfair up-or-down vote. Most we accepted; some we rejected. But all of \nthose nominees got a vote.\n  In the last Congress, however, the minority leadership embarked on a \nnew and dangerous course. They routinely filibustered 10 of President \nBush's appellate court nominees and threatened filibusters on 6 more. \nOrganized and fueled by the minority leadership, these filibusters \ncould not be broken. By filibuster, the minority denied the nominees a \nconfirmation vote and barred the full Senate from exercising its \nobligation to advise and consent.\n  The purpose of those filibusters was clear. It was not only to keep \nthe President's nominees off the bench; it was to wrest control of the \nappointments process from the President. Anyone who did not pass the \nminority leadership's ideological litmus test would be filibustered. \nThat meant a minority would dictate whom the President should appoint, \nif he expected that nominee to get a confirmation vote in this body. \nThat was a power grab of unprecedented proportions.\n  With more filibusters threatened for this Congress, the power grab \nwould become even bolder. It would become even more entrenched. \nFundamental\n\n[[Page S5860]]\n\nconstitutional principles were called into question. They included the \nseparation of powers, checks and balances, the independence of the \njudiciary, and the negation of the Senate's right to advise and \nconsent. The minority claimed the right to impose a 60-vote threshold \nbefore a nominee could pass muster, for that is the number needed to \ninvoke cloture and to break a filibuster. The Constitution doesn't say \nthat. It only requires a majority to confirm. But for a minority \nspinning novel constitutional theories, the real Constitution took a \nback seat.\n  The Republican majority tried first to invoke cloture on each of the \njudicial nominees, but driven by the minority leadership, the \nfilibusters proved resilient to cloture. Then we introduced a \nfilibuster reform proposal and, with regular order, took it through the \nRules Committee, but it died without action because it was sure to be \nfilibustered as well.\n  So then we turned to the voters in November. The election \nstrengthened our majority. But the minority ignored the election and \neven dug their heels in further. Faced with the certainty that the \nminority would expand its filibusters, we faced a critical choice: \neither accept the filibuster power grab as the new standard for the \nSenate or restore the tradition of fair up-or-down votes on nominees.\n  We, as Republican leadership, decided to stand for a principle. That \nprinciple is simple and clear. It is clear without equivocation, \nwithout trimming. Every judicial nominee brought to the floor shall get \na fair up-or-down vote--a simple principle.\n  The Constitution specifically gives the Senate the power to govern \nitself. We were fully committed to use that power to establish a \nprocess by which a confirmation vote would occur after reasonable \ndebate. This approach has a lot of precedent. We were prepared to use \nthis approach. The minority attempted to demean it by calling it the \nnuclear option, surrounding it with threats of closure of government \nand stopping this body from working. But realistically, the nuclear \noption is what they did. It is what they did when they detonated this \nfilibuster power grab in the last Congress.\n  The proper term for our response is the ``constitutional option'' \nbecause we would rely on the Constitution's power of self-governance to \nrestore Senate traditions barring judicial filibusters. Against their \nunprecedented power grab by filibuster--that is what I would call the \nnuclear option--there is only one antidote that is certain, that would \nabsolutely be effective, and that is the constitutional option.\n  The moment of truth was to have come yesterday on May 24, but, as we \nall know, that action was preempted by an agreement among seven \nDemocrats and seven Republicans to forestall use of the constitutional \noption in exchange for confirmation votes on just three nominees and a \npromise that filibusters would occur only under what are called in \nthe agreement ``extraordinary circumstances.'' I was not a party to \nthat agreement, nor was our Republican leadership. It stops far short \nof guaranteeing up-or-down votes on all nominees. It stops far short of \nthe principle on which this leadership stands. It leaves open the \nquestion of whether someone such as Miguel Estrada, who came to this \ncountry as a 17-year-old immigrant from Honduras, worked his way to the \ntop of college and law school, and tried 15 cases at the Supreme Court, \nwho was filibustered again and again and again, filibustered 7 times, \nwould be an extraordinary circumstance.\n\n  Now we move on to a new and an uncertain phase. Today, the Senate \nwill happily confirm Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Some of the other nominees will follow her. Priscilla Owen is \na gentlewoman, an accomplished lawyer, and a brilliant Texas jurist. \nShe was unconscionably denied an up-or-down vote for not just a few \nmonths or a year or 2 years but for 4 years. It was over 4 years ago \nthat she was nominated to this position. The minority has distorted her \nrecord. They have cast aspersions on her abilities. They have rendered \nher almost unrecognizable. She had the fortitude to see the process \nthrough. Very late, too late, but finally, she will receive an up-or-\ndown vote and will be confirmed.\n  Without the constitutional option, Priscilla Owen would have never \ncome to a vote today. Neither would any of the other nominees. The \nother side made it clear that they would filibuster. Without the \nconstitutional option, judicial filibusters would have become a \nstandard instrument of minority party policy.\n  The agreement among those 14 is based on trust, a trust that casual \nuse of judicial filibusters is over. Without the constitutional option, \nthe minority would have adhered to the path it was on, and deal brokers \nwould have had no deal to broker.\n  I am very hopeful now and optimistic, but I am curious what \n``extraordinary circumstances'' will mean.\n  I am wary, but as Ronald Reagan was fond to say, ``Trust but \nverify.'' If nominees receive up or down votes and the sword of the \nfilibuster is sheathed, then the Republican leadership can be proud \nthat its focused direction on the constitutional option arrested a \ndangerous and destructive trend.\n  If filibusters erupt under circumstances other than extraordinary, we \nwill put the constitutional option back on the table and will implement \nit. Abraham Lincoln once said that when it is not possible to do the \nbest, it is best to do what is possible. Standing firm for the \nprinciple of fair up-or-down votes, we have made real progress. That is \nsomething I think we can all celebrate with the up-or-down vote \nPriscilla Owen receives today. That principle will be our guidepost as \nthe rest of this great constitutional drama unfolds.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5860-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am sorry I was unable to be on the floor \nfor the entire statement of the Republican leader. I think we should \njust move on. Filibusters are only under extraordinary circumstances. \nThat is when you filibuster. I have been involved in two filibusters \nduring my career of almost 19 years in the Senate. That is two more \nthan most people have been involved in. Filibusters don't happen very \noften. I think we should move beyond this and get the business of the \ncountry done. Let's not talk about the nuclear option any more. Let the \nSenate work its will. Let's get over this. I have said it is good that \nit is over with, done.\n  I wish the distinguished majority leader and I could have worked \nsomething out on our own. We didn't. It was done by 14 people, 7 \nDemocrats and 7 Republicans. We have important things to do. There is \nno question that these five people--actually that is what it boiled \ndown to--are important, but keep in mind they all had jobs. They were \nall working. It is not as if they were in a bread line someplace. It is \nunfortunate that during the last 12 years there have been problems with \nthese judges, and I would say problems we never had before.\n  During the Clinton years, we had more than 60 nominees that never \neven got a hearing. We talked yesterday about what happened in the Bush \nyears. Let's put that behind us and move on. Let's forget about it and \nhave the Senate work its will. If a problem comes up with a judge, \nthere will be discussions between the Senator from Tennessee and me. If \nit is necessary, there will be extended debate, and we will talk about \nit. That is not going to happen very often. We know that. So let's just \ngo about our business. I had a wonderful conversation with the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States yesterday. He acknowledged, let's move on. \nI said, fine, let's move on. Let's just move on and not talk about this \nany more.\n  I have had extended conversations with the distinguished Republican \nleader, and the next matter that the Senate is going to be involved in \nis the Bolton nomination. We are clear on the Democratic side to move \nforward. I think it would be in the best interest of everybody if we \nget this agreement made as quickly as possible and we can move forward. \nThat is why I hope my friend from Montana--if somebody comes to the \nfloor and we can clear this in the next little bit, that should be \ndone. I don't want us being blamed\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\nfor not being able to go forward with the Bolton nomination.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comment of the Democratic \nleader. We have agreed on the schedule for the week, and it is really \nto get to the Bolton nomination as soon as we possibly can. He is \ntalking to Senators on his side, and I have to talk to some on our \nside. We are both eager to get on to the nomination, which we plan to \ndo today.\n  I appreciate the Democratic leader coming to encourage us along. We \nwill work things out here shortly on the plans to proceed to the Bolton \nnomination after the Owen nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5861-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, now that we have established the ``new'' \nguidelines--which have always been there--confirming or rejecting the \nappointment of judges to the Federal appellate courts, I have come to \nthe floor today to speak in support of William Myers, who is the \nPresident's nominee to the Ninth Judicial Circuit. He, as nominees \nOwen, Brown, and Pryor, deserves a straight up-or-down vote on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I got a call last night from a constituent in Montana who didn't \nunderstand what an up-or-down vote was on the floor of the Senate. So I \nexplained to her that it is a ``yea'' or a ``nay,'' and whoever gathers \nthe most votes wins. That is as simple as I could put it. Of course, \nshe understood.\n  Bill Myers is a native of Idaho and is a highly respected attorney \nwho is nationally recognized for his work. He is an expert in the area \nof natural resources, public lands, water and water law and, most \nimportantly, environmental law.\n  Mr. Myers has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwhich covers my State, along with Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, \nNevada, Oregon and also Guam and the Northern Marianas--by far, the \nlargest of all of the appellate district courts. It is huge. The \ncaseload is huge. And always the caseload has burdened them to where we \ndon't get a verdict very quickly in the Ninth. Most of us subscribe to \nthe view that justice delayed is justice denied.\n  From July 2001 to October 2003, Mr. Myers served as Solicitor of the \nInterior, the chief legal officer and third ranking official in the \nDepartment of the Interior. He was confirmed by the Senate to serve as \nSolicitor of the Interior by unanimous consent.\n  Before coming to the Department, Mr. Myers practiced at one of the \nmost respected law firms in the Rocky Mountain region, where he \nparticipated in an extensive array of Federal litigation involving \npublic lands and natural resource issues.\n  From 1992 to 1993, he served in the Department of Energy as Deputy \nGeneral Counsel for Programs, where he was the Department's principal \nlegal adviser on matters pertaining to international energy, Government \ncontracting, civilian nuclear programs, power marketing, and \nintervention in State regulatory proceedings. He really earned his \nstripes there.\n  Prior to that, he was assistant to the Attorney General of the United \nStates from 1989 to 1992. In this capacity, he prepared the Attorney \nGeneral for his responsibilities as chairman of the President's \nDomestic Policy Council.\n  Before entering the Justice Department, Mr. Myers served 4 years on \nthe staff of the Honorable Alan Simpson of Wyoming, where he was a \nprincipal adviser to the Senator on public land issues. Everyone, in my \nmemory, remembers with great fondness Senator Simpson of Wyoming.\n  Mr. Myers is an avid outdoorsman. He is a person who is totally \ncommitted to conservation, having served over 15 years of voluntary \nservice to the National Park Service, where he did all the menial \njobs--trail work, campsites, and visitor areas, understanding our Park \nService and its role in American life.\n  He has also received widespread support from across the ideological \npolitical spectrum. For example, former Democratic Governor of Idaho, \nand good friend, Governor Cecil Andrus, stated that Myers possesses \n``the necessary personal integrity, judicial temperament, and legal \nexperience,'' as well as ``the ability to act fairly on matters of law \nthat will come before him on the court.''\n\n  Former Democratic Wyoming Governor Mike Sullivan endorsed Mr. Myers \nsaying that he ``would provide serious, responsible, and intellectual \nconsideration to each matter before him as an appellate judge and would \nnot be prone to the extreme or ideological positions unattached to \nlegal precedents or the merits of a given matter.''\n  That is a pretty high recommendation by two outstanding Governors. By \nthe way, they are Democrats and are good friends of mine.\n  In addition, in 2004, Mr. Myers was endorsed by 15 State attorneys \ngeneral, including the current Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado, as well \nas the Democratic attorneys general of Oklahoma and Wyoming. These \nchief law enforcement officers stated that Mr. Myers ``would bring to \nthe Ninth Circuit strong intellectual skills, combined with a strong \nsense of civility, decency, and respect for all.''\n  Finally, in 2004, the Governors of Montana, Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, \nand Nevada--five States in the Ninth Circuit--strongly backed Mr. \nMyers, writing that he had the ``temperament and the judicial instincts \nto serve on the Ninth Circuit.''\n  The Ninth Circuit needs more judges just to get their work done, to \nclear out the backlog. They can use some good old rural common sense on \nthat bench as well. He brings that kind of common sense, that kind of \nbalance, those values that are dear to the West.\n  Out of the Ninth Circuit, we have seen many rulings that have been \nvery troubling to most Americans and some really radical rulings. They \nare the court that ruled the words ``under God'' in the Pledge of \nAllegiance were unconstitutional. Now, to a lot of us, that doesn't \nmake a lot of sense. But I will tell you, it was evidenced by the \ncontinual overturning of many of the Ninth Circuit rulings. That court \nhas been overturned more than any court in the land.\n  Bill Myers is a man of strong character, who would reestablish \nbalance in the Ninth Circuit by accurately reflecting those commonsense \nvalues--in other words, that old country lawyer that came to town who \nunderstands people. He will reflect the population from those States, \nsuch as my State of Montana, which make up the Ninth Circuit.\n  I am committed to making sure he gets the vote he deserves on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 16 minutes 23 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have taken one step forward in the last few days on \nour advise and consent responsibility in the Senate. I am here today to \nsay we are doing the right thing by one nominee, and that is to have a \nfair up-or-down vote on Judge Priscilla Owen to be a justice on the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals after 4 years of waiting for this day.\n  During this entire process, she has continued to serve on the Texas \nSupreme Court, demonstrating judicial temperament beyond anything I \nhave ever seen. She has waited patiently, showing courage, \ndetermination, and a quiet spirit, the likes of which I have never seen \nbefore.\n  This is a person who would have been confirmed by the Senate four \ntimes, though she has never been able to take\n\n[[Page S5862]]\n\nher rightful place on the bench. On May 1, 2003, she received 52 votes \nin a cloture motion; on May 8, 2003, 52 votes; on July 29, 2003, 53 \nvotes; and on November 14, 2003, 53 votes.\n  She has waited, and she is going to be rewarded. She will get over 50 \nvotes, and she will take her place on the bench. Justice Owen ought to \nreceive 100 votes. Anyone who has looked at her record and who has seen \nher experience knows she is a judge who does not believe in making law \nfrom the bench. She believes in interpreting law, trying to determine \nwhat the Supreme Court has said on this subject, trying to determine \nwhat the legislature intended, as it is her responsibility to do. To \ndepict Justice Owen as a judicial activist is absolutely wrong. \nPresident Bush is trying to put jurists on the bench who have a strict \nconstructionist view of the Constitution, who interpret as opposed to \nmaking laws from the bench.\n  Justice Owen, as has been said so many times, has bipartisan support \nin Texas. Fifteen State bar presidents--Republicans and Democrats--have \ncome out in her favor. The American Bar Association gave her a \nunanimous well-qualified rating, the highest they give. She was \nreelected to the Texas Supreme Court with 84 percent of the vote. \nPriscilla Owen has had distortions of her record. She has had \ninnuendoes about what she believes, no one speaking from knowledge, and \nyet she has never lashed out, she has never shown anger or bitterness, \nalways a judicial demeanor, always respect for the Senators as they \nwere questioning her.\n  I believe it is an important time in the Senate that we are now \nvoting on someone who has been held up for four years, and I hope this \nis a time that is never repeated in Senate history. I hope we will go \nforward with all of the judges who should have the respect given to \npeople willing to serve, people who have taken an appointment with the \nhonest view that they can do a good job for our country and, in many \ncases, taking pay cuts to do so. I hope they will be treated by the \nSenate in the future with respect. I hope we can debate their records \naccording to the different views. But in the end, I hope they will get \nan up-or-down vote, not only for these nominees, but out of respect for \nthe President of the United States. Our President, George W. Bush, has \nhad fewer circuit court of appeals nominees confirmed by the Senate \nthan any President in the history of our country--69 percent. Every \nother President of our country has had confirmation rates in the \nseventies, eighties, and even Jimmy Carter in the nineties, and yet our \nPresident has not had his right under the Constitution for appointment \nof judges who would get an up-or-down vote by the Senate.\n  I hope that period in the history of the Senate is at an end today. I \nhope this is the first day of going back to the traditions of over 200 \nyears, except for that brief 2-year period in the last session of \nCongress. I think the people of our country also agree this period \nshould end. They agreed by the votes they cast for Senators who are \ncommitted to up-or-down votes. There were Democrats who ran on that \nplatform and won, and there were Republicans who ran on that platform \nand won.\n  I hope very much that today we will end a dark period in the Senate \nand return to the traditions of the past 200 years and not only confirm \nPriscilla Owen, as we are going to do today, but start the process of \ngiving up-or-down votes to the other nominees who have come out of \ncommittee after thorough vetting and after debate of any length of time \nthat is reasonably necessary to bring everything to the table and to \nthe attention of the American people. In the end, every one of these \npeople has reputations and experience and they deserve the respect of \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Priscilla Owen, I have to say, is the perfect person to be first in \nline to break a bad period in the history of the Senate because she is \na person of impeccable credentials. She is a person with a great record \nof experience, showing what a smart, honorable judge can be. She is a \nperson who graduated at the top of her class at Baylor Law School. She \nis a person who received the highest score on the State bar exam. She \nis a person who practiced law for over 15 years and was so well \nregarded that she was asked to run for the Texas Supreme Court, and she \ndid so. She is a person who was reelected with 84 percent of the vote \nand endorsed by every major newspaper in Texas. No one ever said \nanything bad about Priscilla Owen as a person. Her record has been \ndistorted, but she is a person of impeccable credentials.\n  I was able to talk with Priscilla in the last few days. She is so \nhappy that she is going to finally have this opportunity because she \ncertainly has withstood so much. This is going to be a bright day in \nher life. And Priscilla Owen deserves a bright day.\n  I said in one of my earlier speeches that the classmates of her \nfather at Texas A, the class of 1953, have a reunion every year. They \nrealized at their reunion 2 years ago that one of their classmates who \ndied very early had a legacy. The class newsletter came out saying, \nwith a headline: ``Pat Richman's Legacy,'' and it told the story of \nPriscilla Owen. It related back to her dad in the class of 1953 at \nTexas A when it was an all-male school, and almost every member of \nthe Corps of Cadets went into the service after graduation, as did Pat \nRichman.\n  Pat Richman served in Korea. He left his sweetheart, whom he had just \nmarried, pregnant, as he took off for Korea. Priscilla was born while \nhe was gone. He came back to see her for the first time when she was 7 \nmonths old. Pat Richman died of polio 3 months later. His daughter, of \ncourse, never remembered anything about him, but he was a star in the \nclass of 1953.\n  When the newsletter came out, they decided to invite Priscilla Owen \nto their last reunion this spring, and she went. She told me she \nlearned things about her dad she had never heard before because, of \ncourse, it was from the perspective of his college classmates.\n  I ended that speech by saying I hope Priscilla Owen will be able to \ngo to this year's reunion of the class of 1953 and that she would be \nable to go as a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judge.\n  In about 2 hours, this Senate is going to finally do the right thing \nfor this woman of courage, conviction, and quiet respect for the rule \nof law and for our President, quiet respect for the Senate that I do \nnot think has merited that respect in her individual case, although I \nlove this institution. But she does respect the institution, the \nprocess, and most especially the judiciary of our country. Priscilla \nOwen is finally going to be treated fairly by the Senate. I know the \nclass of 1953 is going to invite her back, and I know she will attend \nas a judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to once again hear \nstories about her dad, Pat Richman, a man she never met but who is so \nrespected by those classmates because he was one of the class stars.\n  It is time that Priscilla Owen has that opportunity. I am pleased the \nSenate is finally going to give her what is rightfully due and long \noverdue, and that is an up-or-down vote, where I am confident she will \nbe confirmed. She will make America proud because she will undoubtedly \nbecome one of the best judges on the Federal bench in the United States \nof America.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been spending a considerable amount \nof time in this body debating the so-called nuclear option. Today I \nwant to spend a little bit of time talking about an issue that poses a \nmore significant threat to our Republic.\n  Throughout the last half of the 20th century, one nation more than \nany other on the face of the Earth, defined and shaped the threats \nposed to the United States. This nation, of course, was the Soviet \nUnion and its successor state, Russia.\n  While many have turned their attention to China or other parts of the \nworld, I believe the most important threat to the security of the \nUnited States continues to lie within the borders of the former Soviet \nUnion in the form of stockpiles of nuclear, biological, and chemical \nweapons and materials.\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\n  We are in a race against time to prevent these weapons from getting \nin the hands of international terrorist organizations or rogue states. \nThe path to this potential disaster is easier than anyone could \nimagine. There are a number of potential sources of fissile material in \nthe former Soviet Union in sites that are poorly secured. The material \nis compact, easy to hide, and hard to track. Weapons designs can be \neasily found on the Internet.\n  Today, some weapons experts believe that terrorist organizations will \nhave enough fissile material to build a nuclear bomb in the next 10 \nyears--that is right, 10 years.\n  I rise today to instill a sense of urgency in the Senate. I rise \ntoday to ask how are we going to deal with this threat tomorrow, a year \nfrom now, a decade from now?\n  The President has just completed an international trip that included \na visit to Russia. I commend him for taking this trip and making our \nrelationship with Russia a priority.\n  During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union produced \nnearly 2,000 tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for use in \nweapons that could destroy the world several times over. To give an \nidea of just how much this is, it takes only 5 to 10 kilograms of \nplutonium to build a nuclear weapon that could kill the entire \npopulation of St. Louis. For decades, strategic deterrence, our \nalliances, and the balance of power with the Soviet Union ensured the \nrelative safety of these weapons and materials.\n  With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nall this has changed. Key institutions within the Soviet national \nsecurity apparatus have crumbled, exposing dangerous gaps in the \nsecurity of nuclear weapons, delivery systems, and fissile material.\n  Regional powers felt fewer constraints to develop nuclear weapons. \nRogue states accelerated weapons programs.\n  And while this was happening, international terrorist organizations \nwho are aggressively seeking nuclear weapons gained strength and \nmomentum.\n  Now, thanks to the leadership of former Senator Nunn and Senator \nLugar in creating the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at the \nDepartment of Defense, there is no question that we have made some \ngreat progress in securing these weapons.\n  These same two leaders continue to work tirelessly on this issue to \nthis day--Senator Nunn, through the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and \nSenator Lugar, through his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  The situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union is \ndrastically different than it was in 1991 or even 1996 or 2001. But, \nthe threat is still extremely dangerous and extremely real.\n  In March of this year, a senior Russian commander concluded that 39 \nof 46 key Russian weapons facilities had serious security shortcomings. \nMany Russian nuclear research sites frequently have doors propped open, \nsecurity sensors turned off, and guards patrolling without ammunition \nin their weapons.\n  Meanwhile, the security situation outside of Russia continues to be \nof grave concern. Fanatical terrorist organizations who want these \nweapons continue to search every corner of the Earth resorting to \nvirtually any means necessary. The nuclear programs of nations such as \nIran and North Korea threaten to destabilize key regions of the world. \nWe are still learning about the tremendous damage caused by A.Q. Khan, \nthe rogue Pakistani weapons scientist.\n\n  Looking back over the past decade and a half, it is clear that we \ncould and should have done more.\n  So as the President returns from his trip to Russia, we should be \nthinking--on a bipartisan basis--about the critical issues that can \nguide us in the future to ensure that there are no more missed \nopportunities.\n  The first question we should be thinking about is what is the future \nof the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program? What is our plan? I \nbelieve the administration must spend more time working with Congress \nto chart out a roadmap and a strategic vision of the program.\n  There are two things the President can do to move on this issue. \nFirst, in the National Security Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass \nDestruction of 2002, the administration said the National Security \nCouncil would prepare a 5-year governmentwide strategy by March of \n2003. To my knowledge, this has not been completed. In addition, \nCongress required the administration to submit an interagency \ncoordination plan on how to more effectively deal with nonproliferation \nissues. This plan is due at the end of this month.\n  Completing these plans will help the United States better address \ncritical day-to-day issues such as liability, resource allocation, and \ntimetables. Having a better strategic vision will also help us work \nmore efficiently and effectively with other international donors who \nhave become increasingly involved and are making significant \ncontributions to these efforts. This is very important, as the \ncontribution of other donors can help us make up valuable lost time.\n  Mr. President, my second question concerns the U.S.-Russian \nrelationship. Where is this relationship heading? Will Russia be an \nadversary, a partner, or something in between?\n  We do not ask these questions simply because we are interested in \nbeing nice and want only to get along with the Russians. We have to ask \nthese questions because they directly impact our progress towards \nsecuring and destroying stockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials.\n  In the last few years, we have seen some disturbing trends in Russia: \nthe rapid deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, bizarre and \ntroubling statements from President Putin about the fall of the Soviet \nUnion, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, and Russian \nmeddling in the former Soviet Union--from the Baltics to the Ukraine to \nGeorgia.\n  The Russians must understand that their actions on some of these \nissues are entirely unacceptable.\n  At the same time, I believe we have to do a better job of working \nwith the Russians to make sure they are moving in the right direction. \nThis starts by being thoughtful and consistent about what we say and \nwhat we do. Tone matters.\n  Some of the statements by our own officials have been confusing, \ncontradictory, and problematic. At times I have been left scratching my \nhead about what exactly our policy is and how administration statements \nsquare with this policy.\n  Another issue is the level of sustained engagement with Russia. I am \nglad the President and Secretary of State have made several trips to \nRussia, but as these trips are only a few days every year or so this is \nonly one aspect of the relationship.\n  An additional component, which has suffered in recent years, is our \nforeign assistance programs to Russia and the rest of the former Soviet \nUnion. These programs are absolutely essential in maintaining our \nengagement with Russia. These programs are not giveaways. They are \nprograms that advance U.S. interests by strengthening Russian democracy \nand civil society, enhancing economic development and dealing with \ninternational health issues--in addition to curbing the \nnonproliferation threat.\n  At a time when these programs are desperately needed, their budgets \nhave been cut dramatically. At a time when we should be doing more to \nengage and shape the future of Russia, we seem to be doing the exact \nopposite.\n  The nonproliferation threat does not exist in a vacuum. The issue I \njust mentioned, along with other important issues such as our own \nstrategic nuclear arsenal, must be considered as we move forward.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to consider how \nour relationship with Russia, and our efforts to secure and destroy \nweapons and materials inside the former Soviet Union, fits in with our \nbroader nonproliferation goals.\n  Russia is a major player in the two biggest proliferation challenges \nwe currently face--Iran and North Korea. Russia's dangerous involvement \nwith Iran's nuclear program has been well documented, and there is no \nquestion their actions will be pivotal if the President is to \nsuccessfully resolve this deteriorating situation.\n  The Russians are also an important voice in trying to make progress \non the deteriorating situation in North Korea. The Russian city of \nVladivostok is\n\n[[Page S5864]]\n\nhome to 590,000 people and is very close to the North Korean border, \nputting the Russians smack in the middle of the crisis that we need to \nresolve.\n  In addition to all this, Russia holds a seat on the Security Council \nof the United Nations, which could consider Iranian and North Korean \nissues in the very near future.\n  Developing bilateral and multilateral strategies that deal with \nRussia's role in these growing crises will be extremely important, both \nin terms of resolving these crises, advancing our non-proliferation \ngoals within the former Soviet Union, and our long-term relationship \nwith Russia.\n  I realize that, at this time, none of us have all the answers to \nthese extraordinarily difficult questions. But if we hope to \nsuccessfully fight terror and avoid disaster before it arrives at our \nshores, we have to start finding these answers. We have a lot of work \nto do.\n  I believe it is worth putting in place a process, one that involves \nsenior administration officials, a bipartisan group of Members of \nCongress, as well as retired senior military officers and diplomats, in \nan effort to dramatically improve progress on these issues.\n  I am interested in hearing from the President about his trip. I am \nalso interested in hearing if he believes that an idea similar to the \none I put forward is worth considering.\n  Delay is not an option. We need to start making more progress on this \nissue today. I urge my colleagues to act.\n  Despite all the distractions we have had with the so-called nuclear \noption and judicial nominations, this is literally a matter of life and \ndeath. I hope we start paying more attention to it in this Senate \nChamber and in the debates that are going to be coming in the coming \nmonths.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5864-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5864-S5865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague and friend from \nIllinois for his incisive comments on a very important topic.\n  I am here to discuss the vote we will take at noon on the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen to the U.S. court of appeals. We all know a lot has \nchanged in the last 48 hours. The Senate has stepped back from the \nprecipice of a constitutional crisis. Our robust system of checks and \nbalances has been saved from an unprecedented attack. Fourteen \nmoderates came together and said we are not going to tolerate a nuclear \noption and that we are asking the President to come and talk to us \nbefore he makes a nomination.\n  While the compromise reached by 14 Senators has dramatically changed \nthe outlook for the Senate, one thing has not changed, the record of \nJustice Priscilla Owen. I want to spend some time talking about that \nrecord, though it speaks for itself.\n  There is no question that Justice Owen attended fine schools and \nclearly is a very bright woman. But there is also no question that she \nis immoderate, she is a judicial activist, and she puts her own views \nahead of the law's views. In case after case, Justice Owen comes to \nconclusions that are simply not justified by the facts or by the law. \nThese decisions consistently come down against consumers, against \nworkers, against women seeking to exercise their constitutional rights.\n  In choosing judges, in voting for judges, I have one standard and one \nstandard alone. It is not a litmus test on any one issue. It is simply \nthis: Will judges interpret law or not? Will judges do what the \nFounding Fathers said they should do--because, after all, they are not \nelected--and interpret what the legislature and the President have \nwanted and the Constitution requires, not put their own views above the \npeople's views?\n\n  If there was ever a judge who would substitute her own views for the \nlaw, it is Justice Owen. Her record is a paper trail of case after case \nwhere she knows better than 100 years of legal tradition. It does not \nmatter how brilliant a nominee is, or what a great education or career \nshe has had; if she puts her own views above the law's views, she does \nnot belong on the bench. It is as simple as that. In case after case, \nthat is just what Justice Owen has done.\n  She thinks she knows better than the 100 years of established law \ntradition. She thinks she knows better than what the people have \nwanted, as enunciated by their legislators. Her own views take \nprecedence over all other views. That is why she does not belong on the \nbench.\n  Let me go over a few cases, a few of many, where she has done this. \nIn one case, In re Jane Doe, Judge Owen's dissent came under fire from \nher colleagues of the Texas supreme court. They referred to her legal \napproach as an effort to ``usurp legislative function.''\n  Even more troubling, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who sat on \nthe same court as Judge Owen at the time, wrote a separate opinion. He \nwent out of his way to write a separate opinion to chastise the \ndissenting judges, including Justice Owen, for attempting to make law, \nnot interpret law from the bench.\n  Here is what Judge Gonzales said. He said that to construe the law as \nthe dissent--that is what Priscilla Owen did--would be ``an \nunconscionable act of judicial activism.'' How ironic. The very same \nconservatives who rail against judicial activism are putting at the top \nof their pantheon a judge who, by Alberto Gonzales's own testimony, is \nan activist, somebody who thinks, ``I know better.''\n  Activism does not mean left or right. Activism means putting your own \nviews above the law. That is not what the Founding Fathers wanted.\n  Let's look not at my words but at those of Judge Gonzales. They are \nwords of a man who served for 4 years as President Bush's White House \ncounsel. He is now the Attorney General. He is a distinguished \nconservative. Some of my colleagues have tried to suggest that Mr. \nGonzales was not referring to Justice Owen by his caustic comment. Who \nare we kidding? It was brought up at her hearing originally. He didn't \nsay a peep. Only now that she is controversial, people said: Well, \nexplain yourself. I am sure he was pressured.\n  I direct my colleagues to a New York Times article by Neil Lewis last \nweek which reported that Attorney General Gonzales specifically \nadmitted he was referring to Justice Owen's dissent, among others, in \nhis written opinion.\n  Let's take another case, Montgomery Independent School District v. \nDavis. There the majority, also including Judge Gonzales, ruled in \nfavor of a teacher who had wrongly been dismissed by her employer. \nJustice Owen dissented, deciding against the employee. That is what she \ntypically does.\n  The majority, which included Judge Gonzales, ruled in favor of a \nteacher who had been wrongly dismissed by her employer. Justice Owen \ndissented, siding against the employee. The majority, including Judge \nGonzales once again, wrote that:\n\n       Nothing in the statute requires what the dissenters claim.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       The dissenting opinion's misconception stems from its \n     disregard of the rules that the legislature established. . . \n     .\n\n  And that:\n\n       The dissenting opinion not only disregards procedural \n     limitations in the statute but takes a position even more \n     extreme than argued by the employer.\n\n  There is Justice Owen. She looks very nice. But here is another case \nwhere she not only put her own view on the table, but she went further \neven than the defendant employer did. That is why she does not belong \non the bench. She always does that, time and time again.\n  A third case, Texas Department of Transportation v. Able, again \nJustice Gonzales took Owen to task for her activism.\n  I am not going to get into all these cases but they are clear. \nJustice Owen, yes, she has a good education; yes, she has had a \ndistinguished, long career; and, yes, she just does not belong on the \nbench because she thinks her views are better, more important, and \nsuperseding the views of the law, the views of the legislature, the \nviews of the people.\n  I want to speak for the few more minutes I have left about the \nagreement and where we go from there. It is one thing to put on the \nbench mainstream conservatives, who do not adhere to an extreme agenda. \nI have voted for many, many of the judges we have confirmed so far. \nMany of them have views on choice or other things quite different from \nmy own. Where we have a duty is to stand up and oppose\n\n[[Page S5865]]\n\nnominees who are outside the mainstream. We have a duty to the \nConstitution and a duty to the American people not simply to \nrubberstamp the President's picks. Mark my words, we are going to \nfulfill those duties as long as we have to. That is our constitutional \nobligation.\n  But there is not a single Senator on our side of the aisle who wants \nthese fights. There is not a single Senator on our side of the aisle \nwho wants to oppose even one of the President's nominees. We would be a \nlot happier if we could all come together. We have done that on the \ndistrict courts in New York. They are all filled. I consulted with the \nWhite House, with the Governor, and we came to agreements. We can do \nit. If the White House and I can come to an agreement, so can the \nSenate and the White House on who should be judges.\n  But there is an important point here. How did we solve the problems \nin New York? The President and the White House consulted with the \nSenators and with the Senate. As the compromise of 2005 sets out, \nPresident Bush must consult with the Senate in advance of nominating \nappellate judges to the bench. ``Advise and consent.'' To get the \nconsent, you need the ``advise.''\n  So I again call on the President, once and for all, to tell him we \ncan solve this problem by coming together, by him consulting. I really \nbelieve we can solve this problem. But we are not going to find common \nground when we keep seeking nominees who will be activists on the \nFederal bench. We are not going to solve this problem if the President \nstands like Zeus on Mt. Olympus and hurtles judicial thunderbolts down \nto the Senate. He has to consult. He has to ask us, as President \nClinton did.\n  Why did President Clinton's Supreme Court nominees have no trouble in \nthe Senate? I would argue because the President proposed a number of \nnames to Orrin Hatch, hardly his ideological soulmate, and Orrin Hatch \nsaid this one won't work and that one won't work, but this one will and \nthis one will. President Clinton heeded Senator Hatch's advice. As a \nresult, Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg didn't have much of a \nfight. Some people may have voted against them, but it didn't get to \nthe temperature that importuned my colleagues to filibuster--which they \ndid on some other judges, although unsuccessfully: Judge Paez, Judge \nBerson, et cetera.\n  Mr. President, this is a plea to you. Let us take an example from the \ngroup of 14. Please, consult with us. You don't have to do what we say, \nbut at least seek our judgment. If we say this judge would be \nacceptable and that judge will not--take our views into consideration. \nWhat will happen is it will decrease the temperature on an awfully hot \nissue. But second, and more importantly, it will bring us together so \nwe can choose someone if the Supreme Court should have a vacancy, and \nwe can continue to choose people when the courts of appeal have \nvacancies, without a real fight.\n  It can work. It has worked in New York between this White House and \nthis Senator. It has worked at the national level, at the Supreme Court \nlevel, when President Clinton consulted with Republicans in the Senate, \nwho were in the majority. It can work now. The ball is in President \nBush's court. If he continues to choose to make these judgments \ncompletely on his own, if he continues to stand like Zeus on Mt. \nOlympus and just throw thunderbolts at the Senate, we will not have the \ncomity for which the 14 asked.\n\n  A very important part of their agreement was for the President to \nstart paying attention to the advise, in the ``advise and consent.''\n  Again, the ball is in his court. If the President starts doing that, \nI am confident this rancor on judges will decline, the public will see \nus doing the people's business, and the generally low view that the \npublic has had of this body because of the partisan rancor will be \ngreatly ameliorated.\n  Mr. President, again, you can change the way we have done these \nthings, but only you can. Please, consult the Senate. Bring down hot \ntemperatures that now exist.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session to consider the following nomination, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Priscilla Richman Owen, of \nTexas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to move forward with a vote on \nPriscilla Owen. It is well that the Senate is moving. There are other \njudges who are waiting and have waited a long time. We have three \njudges from Michigan. There is no reason we can't move those four very \nquickly. They were held up as a result of an intractable procedural \nmatter. That is no longer. We can do those judges in a very short \ntimeframe.\n  We also have a person Senator Hatch has been wanting to have for some \ntime now, way into last year, a man by the name of Griffith. We are \nwilling to move him. There were some problems. Some Senators will vote \nagainst him. There is no question about that. Senator Leahy, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has made a number of \nnegative speeches about Griffith. We will agree to a very short \ntimeframe on his nomination and move it on. That would be four \nappellate court judges very quickly. I hope we can do it in the \nimmediate future. We could clear four judges today or tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally against both Senators Specter and Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak briefly \nabout the compromise agreement reached on judicial nominees and about \nthe pending circuit court nominees.\n  Let me begin by saying that I am pleased that, through the agreement \nreached this week, we were able to protect the rights of the minority \nin this body to have our voices heard. That is consistent with the best \ntraditions of the Senate. I certainly believe it is consistent with the \nconstitutional principle that gave each State two Senators, regardless \nof their number of citizens. So, for example, California has 36 million \npeople and Wyoming has a little more than 500,000 citizens. But our \nforefathers saw to it, in an effort to protect the rights of the \nminority, that each State would have two Senators to represent their \ninterests.\n  I also believe that the agreement, at least at this time and place, \npreserves our constitutional system of checks and balances. So I \ncompliment my 14 colleagues who reached this agreement and, in so \ndoing, protected two of the most essential principles of American \ngovernment--the rights of the minority and our system of checks and \nbalances.\n  Let me also say that I am particularly proud of Senator Reid's \nleadership in pushing towards this compromise.\n  That said, my enthusiasm for this compromise is tempered by the \nreality that I see before us. For while I am cautiously optimistic \nabout the immediate outcome, I am aware that, like in so many things, \nthe devil is in the details. Time will test the meaning of the term, \n``extraordinary circumstances'',\n\n[[Page S5866]]\n\nthat was included in the compromise agreement but has not been \nexplicitly defined. And as we all know, compromises come with many \nchallenges and I am certain that this compromise will be tested through \nthe course of time.\n  Indeed, I have been deeply troubled by what has been said by some of \nmy colleagues on the Senate floor, including comments made by the \nmajority leader, that the so-called nuclear option is still on the \ntable. I was also distressed by the suggestion made by some of my \ncolleagues that judicial nominees in the future may only be blocked if \nthey have personal or ethical problems. I look at the agreement and \ncome to a very different conclusion about what the term ``extraordinary \ncircumstances'' means. So I am deeply troubled when I hear that the \nnuclear option is still on the table, except under circumstances where \nthe nominee has personal or ethical issues. I believe that \ninterpretation is inconsistent with the spirit and intent of this \ndelicate compromise. And, I note that the agreement specifically--and \nclearly--states that it is up to each individual Senator--using his or \nher own discretion--to decide when a filibuster is appropriate and what \nconstitutes extraordinary circumstances. So I believe it requires a lot \nof vigilance and attention as we go forward with judicial nominations \nfor appellate and Supreme Court vacancies, jobs that come with lifetime \nappointments. We must ensure that our courts retain the independence \nthat has been, and should continue to be, the hallmark of our \njudiciary. The stakes could not be any higher.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn specifically to the nominees who are \nbefore the Senate. I believe many of these individuals are outside the \nmainstream of legal thought. That is why I have opposed them, and that \nis why I supported the filibuster. I believe these individuals--and I \nrecognize that they may be very good individuals on a personal level--\nhave demonstrated, through their judicial records and their public \ncommunications, that they are outside of the mainstream and that they \nhave taken positions that may be fairly labeled, in my view, as \nextremist.\n  Likewise, these judicial nominees have shown a willingness to put \ntheir own political views before the rule of law as set forth in \nestablished precedent. We need judges who are fair and impartial and \nare absolutely committed to maintaining the credibility and \nindependence of our judicial branch. What we do not need are judges who \nsubstitute their own political views for fact, law, and precedent. That \nwould undermine the federal courts and remove the impartiality, \nindependence, and fairness that American citizens have come to expect \nin our democracy.\n  It is essential that we look for these very qualities--impartiality, \nindependence, and fairness--in our judges. We have not seen that, \nunfortunately, in many of the nominees currently before the Senate. I \nbelieve strongly that we need to oppose these nominations because of \nthat--not because of their personal character--but because, in my view, \nthey have operated outside of the mainstream and endeavored, through \njudicial activism, to inappropriately alter the law.\n  As to Priscilla Owen, I intend to vote against her because of her \nactivist judicial opinions. She has consistently voted to throw out \njury verdicts favoring consumers against corporate interests and she \nhas also dismissed suits brought by workers for job-related injuries, \ndiscrimination, and unfair employment practices. Her record \ndemonstrates that Judge Owen operates outside of the mainstream. She is \noutside of the mainstream, both in Texas and in the United States as a \nwhole. I note that some of her colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court \nhave taken issue with her attempts to disregard generally accepted \nlegal precedents and to interfere with the authority of the state \nlegislature.\n  In addition, I intend to vote against Janice Rogers Brown, William \nPryor, and William Myers. I intend to vote against them not because of \ntheir character or their ability to think through problems but because \nof what I believe is their espousal of a legal theory that is far \noutside the mainstream--called the Constitution in Exile theory. This \ntheory has been very eloquently argued by a number of jurists but, in \nmy belief, falls far outside of the mainstream of legal thought in this \ncountry. Basically, it is an intent to roll back many of the socially \nprogressive actions flowing out of the New Deal and to rescind \nGovernment protections that have been well established under the law.\n  And it is important, in my view, that we consider an individual's \nlegal philosophy when we talk about extraordinary circumstances, and \nparticularly when we are debating the nomination of someone who intends \nto use that philosophy as a vehicle to change the law. That is judicial \nactivism and I believe that it is inappropriate. I also believe that \nthis level of judicial activism in a nominee justifies the use of the \nfilibuster as we go forward. Not everyone will agree, but I think it is \nabsolutely essential that we take this into consideration as we debate \nthese nominees.\n\n  I hope we can all move forward within the framework of the \ncompromise, which I am very pleased we were able to reach. The \ncompromise agreement encourages increased consultation between the \nWhite House and Republicans and Democrats in the Senate with regard to \njudges. I sincerely hope this will come about. In New Jersey, we have \nbeen fortunate to have had a good dialogue with the White House on \njudges and have been able to reach a consensus on both district and \ncircuit court judges. We currently have additional vacancies--four on \nthe district court and one on the circuit court--and I hope we will be \nable to have the same kind of dialogue so that we may reach a consensus \non these nominees. I am hopeful that we can agree upon judges of whom \nwe can all be proud. That is what advise and consent is all about.\n  If we follow that spirit, the compromise stands a much better chance \nof working. Again, we need to make sure--and I certainly will be making \nthe case--that legal philosophy is taken into consideration when we \ndiscuss extraordinary circumstances in the future and that we are not \nlimited to using the filibuster only when a nominees has personal or \nethical problems.\n  Finally, I am pleased that my colleagues worked so hard--and I again \ncompliment all 14 Senators who were a part of that process--to make \ncertain that we can get back to working on the issues that the folks I \nknow in New Jersey care about. They are getting a little hot under the \ncollar about gas prices. They are very concerned as we see the number \nof men and women who have come home either injured or who have \nsacrificed their lives for our country.\n  We are about to go into Memorial Day to say thank you to all those \nwho throughout the years have protected our country. We have hundreds \nof thousands of individuals now on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwho are protecting us. People want us to be focused on what we are \ndoing regarding national security, homeland security, making sure we \nare doing everything we can to keep those troops safe, and trying to \nensure affordable health care. So I am pleased that we may now open up \nthe floor for debate on those issues.\n  For a lot of reasons, I am very grateful about this compromise, but I \ndo hope that, as we go forward, there is a true commitment to allowing \nfor real debate on the meaning of extraordinary circumstances.\n  I appreciate very much the opportunity to speak on this and look \nforward to our continuing debates in the days and weeks ahead.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday I voted to invoke cloture on the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit. Today I shall vote to confirm her nomination by an \nup-or-down vote.\n  I voted to invoke cloture on this nominee and have committed to do so \non a number of other pending nominees to preserve the right of extended \ndebate in the Senate. For 200 years, Senators have enjoyed the right to \nspeak at length on matters dear to them. This essential right has been \nrightfully employed for generations to protect minority rights--both in \nthe Senate and nationwide.\n  It would have been a travesty to have permitted this cherished right \nof extended debate to be extinguished simply as the result of a \npolitical squabble\n\n[[Page S5867]]\n\nover a handful of judges. While passions over these seven judges have \nrun high, it is necessary for the Senate to look at the bigger picture \nand stop this partisan bickering over these few judges. Now is the time \nfor logic and reason. Now is the time for cooler heads to prevail to \naddress the truly weighty matters that confront our nation--matters \nlike the need of every American to obtain necessary health care, \nsufficient pension benefits, and affordable energy.\n  I voted four times previously not to invoke cloture on Priscilla Owen \nbecause I respected the right of the Senate to hear further debate \nconcerning her qualifications, her philosophy, her temperament, and \nexactly what she would be like if she were confirmed to fill this \nlifetime position on the Federal bench. Having examined these aspects, \nas well as her prior record as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, I \nshall vote in support of her nomination.\n  I know that some critics assail Justice Owen's belief that, in \ncertain circumstances, minors should be required to notify their \nparents prior to obtaining an abortion. However, I cannot help but \nbelieve that in many, but perhaps not all, cases, young women would do \nwell to seek guidance from their parents or legal guardians, who would \nhave their best interests at heart when these young women are \nconfronted with making such a difficult decision--a life-altering \ndecision that carries with it extraordinary consequences. I have a long \nhistory of support for parental notification in these kinds of \ndifficult circumstances. For example, in 1991, I supported legislation \nthat would have required entities receiving grants under title X of the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide parental notification in the case \nof minor patients who seek an abortion. Based on my examination of the \ntotality of circumstances that surround this nomination, I have decided \nto support the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, while I commend my Senate colleagues for \ntheir success at averting an unnecessary showdown over the so-called \nnuclear option, the fact remains that Justice Priscilla Owen is still \nill suited to serve a lifetime appointment on the Fifth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. While I voted to invoke cloture on her nomination, this was \ndone in the spirit of compromise and comity. I remain steadfastly \nopposed to her appointment and note that nothing that has transpired in \nthe last 24 hours has changed her record of judicial activism or \nextremism, nor has it changed the fact that she consistently and \nconveniently ignores justice and the rule of law in order to promote a \nconservative political agenda. For these stated reasons, I cannot vote \nin favor of her confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The American people deserve judges--be they conservative or liberal--\nwho are dedicated to an evenhanded application of our laws, free of \npolitical constraints and considerations. Justice Owen's record is \nlittered with examples that demonstrate a lack of respect for these \nvalues. In case after case, Justice Owen shows her willingness to make \nlaw from the bench rather than follow the language and intent of the \nlegislature.\n  Justice Owen consistently votes to throw out jury verdicts favoring \nworkers and consumers against corporate interests and dismisses suits \nbrought by workers for job-related injuries, discrimination and unfair \nemployment practices.\n  For example, in Fitzgerald v. Advanced Spine Fixation Sys., the Texas \nSupreme Court responded to a certified question from the federal Fifth \nCircuit. Then Texas Supreme Court Justice and current Attorney General \nAlberto Gonzales wrote the majority decision holding that a Texas law \nrequired manufacturers of harmful products to indemnify sellers who \ndefend themselves from litigation related to their sales of these and \nsimilar products. A dissent authored by Justice Owen would have \neffectively rewritten Texas law to preclude such third-party relief in \nsome cases. Gonzales wrote that adopting the manufacturer's position, \nas Owen argued, would require the court to improperly ``judicially \namend the statute.''\n  Justice Owen has also authored many opinions that severely restrict \nor even eliminate the rights of workers. For example, in Montgomery \nIndependent School District v. Davis, the 6-3 majority affirmed the \nfinding of the lower courts that the school district had to reinstate a \nteacher after finding there was insufficient basis not to renew the \nteacher's contract.\n  As she often does, Justice Owen dissented from the majority--a \nmajority which included Gonzales and two other Bush nominees. Owen's \ndissent sets forth an interpretation of the statute that was contrary \nto the plain language of the law. The majority rightly points out that \nOwen's dissent, ``not only disregards the procedural limitations in the \nstatute but takes a position even more extreme than that argued for by \nthe board . .  .''\n  In another case, Austin v. Healthtrust Inc., Justice Owen held that \nemployees in Texas could be fired for whistle blowing or refusing to \nact illegally. She held that whistle blowers--heroes, as Time Magazine \nentitled them in the wake of the Enron debacle--have no protection in \nher courtroom.\n  In a time such as this, we rely on our nation's workers to report \nacts of illegality and provide much needed oversight of corporations. \nOur courts and judges should acknowledge the important role that these \npeople play. But, again, Justice Owen does not believe that these brave \nwomen and men should have access to the courts or a remedy in the law.\n  I could go on and on. These cases make clear that Justice Owen is \nready and willing to take extreme positions that run contrary to the \nfacts and the law in order to favor businesses and government.\n  Apart from all of the above questionable opinions favoring business, \nJustice Owen has also expressed a particular hostility to women's \nconstitutionally protected right to reproductive choice.\n  In Texas, there is a law that is constitutional under Supreme Court \nprecedent. This law mandates that a minor woman who seeks an abortion \nmust notify her parents. The law provides for three exceptions that \nallow a court to offer what's called a ``judicial bypass.'' The law is \nvery clear about these three circumstances, yet Justice Owen routinely \nadvocates adding additional obstacles to the process and making it much \nharder for a young pregnant woman to exercise her constitutionally \nprotected freedom of choice.\n  In re Jane Doe I, Justice Owen advocated requiring a minor to show an \nawareness of the ``philosophic, moral, social and religious arguments \nthat can be brought to bear'' before obtaining judicial approval for an \nabortion without parental consent, ignoring the explicit requirements \nof the statute.\n  This and other opinions prompted Justice Gonzales to criticize Owen \nfor attempting to rewrite Texas' parental notification statute, calling \nher opinions In re Jane Doe ``an unconscionable act of judicial \nactivism.''\n  As her record unequivocally demonstrates, Justice Owen lacks the \nimpartiality and dedication to the rule of law to separate her \nconservative political agenda from her judicial opinions. Time after \ntime, when presented with an opportunity to cite precedent, Justice \nOwen has instead chosen to interject her own political ideology, doing \nthe litigants before her and the rule of law a tremendous injustice. \nOur federal courts and our constituents deserve better.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as has been noted by many of my colleagues \nover the last several weeks, the Constitution commands that the Senate \nprovide meaningful Advice and Consent to the President on judicial \nnominations. I encourage the President to heed the call of our Senate \ncolleagues who brokered the deal that spared this body from the nuclear \noption--consult with both Democratic and Republican Senators before \nsubmitting judicial nominations to the Senate for consideration. Only \nthen can our Constitutional mandate of Advice and Consent be properly \nhonored.\n  In the immediate case of Justice Priscilla Owen, after reviewing her \njudicial opinions and examining her qualifications for a lifetime \nappointment on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, I feel it is my \nConstitutional duty to deny her nomination my consent, and I urge my \nSenate colleagues to join me in opposing her appointment.\n\n[[Page S5868]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 3 years ago I first considered the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. After reviewing her record, hearing \nher testimony and evaluating her answers I voted against her \nconfirmation and explained at length the strong case against \nconfirmation of this nomination. Nothing about her record or the \nreasons that led me then to vote against confirmation has changed since \nthen.\n  Now that the Republican leadership's misguided bid for one-party \nrule, the nuclear option, has been deterred, we have arrived at a \nmoment when every one of the 100 of us must examine Priscilla Owen's \nrecord and decide for him or herself whether it merits a lifetime \nappointment to the Fifth Circuit.\n  I believe Justice Owen has shown herself over the last decade on the \nTexas Supreme Court to be an ends-oriented judicial activist, intent on \nreading her own policy views into the law. She has been the target of \ncriticism by her conservative Republican colleagues on the court, and \nnot just in the context of the parental notification cases that have \nbeen discussed so often before, but in a variety of types of cases \nwhere the law did not fit her personal views, including in cases where \nshe has consistently ruled for big business and corporate interests in \ncases against worker and consumers. This sort of judging ought not to \nbe rewarded with such an important and permanent promotion.\n  In 2001, Justice Owen was nominated to fill a vacancy that had by \nthat time existed for more than four years, since January 1997. In the \nintervening 5 years, President Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel, a \ndistinguished Hispanic attorney from Corpus Christi, to fill that \nvacancy. Despite his qualifications, and his unanimous rating of Well \nQualified by the ABA, Mr. Rangel never received a hearing from the \nJudiciary Committee, and his nomination was returned to the President \nwithout Senate action at the end of 1998, after a fruitless wait of 15 \nmonths.\n  On September 16, 1999, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, \nanother outstanding Hispanic attorney, to fill that same vacancy. Mr. \nMoreno did not receive a hearing on his nomination either--over a span \nof more than 17 months. President Bush withdrew the nomination of \nEnrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit and later sent Justice Owen's name \nin its place. It was not until May of 2002, at a hearing presided over \nby Senator Schumer, which the Judiciary Committee heard from any of \nPresident Clinton's three unsuccessful nominees to the Fifth Circuit. \nAt that time, Mr. Moreno and Mr. Rangel, joined by a number of other \nClinton nominees, testified about their treatment by the Republican \nmajority. Thus, Justice Owen's was the third nomination to this vacancy \nand the first to be accorded a hearing before the Committee.\n  In fact, when the Judiciary Committee held its hearing on the \nnomination of Judge Edith Clement to the Fifth Circuit in 2001, during \nthe most recent period of Democratic control of the Senate, it was the \nfirst hearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years. By contrast, \nJustice Owen was the third nomination to the Fifth Circuit on which the \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing in less than 1 year. In spite of the \ntreatment by the former Republican majority of so many moderate \njudicial nominees of the previous President, we proceeded in July of \n2001--as I said that we would--with a hearing on Justice Owen.\n  Justice Owen is one of among 20 Texas nominees who were considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee while I was Chairman. That included nine \nDistrict Court judges, four United States Attorneys, three United \nStates Marshals, and three Executive Branch appointees from Texas who \nmoved swiftly through the Judiciary Committee.\n  When Justice Owen was initially nominated, the President changed the \nconfirmation process from that used by Republican and Democratic \nPresidents for more than 50 years. That resulted in her ABA peer review \nnot being received until later that summer. As a result of a Republican \nobjection to the Democratic leadership's request to retain all judicial \nnominations pending before the Senate through the August recess in \n2001, the initial nomination of Justice Owen was required by Senate \nrules to be returned to the President without action. The committee \nnonetheless took the unprecedented action of proceeding during the \nAugust recess to hold two hearings involving judicial nominations, \nincluding a nominee to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  In my efforts to accommodate a number of Republican Senators--\nincluding the Republican leader, the Judiciary Committee's ranking \nmember, and at least four other Republican members of the committee--I \nscheduled hearings for nominees out of the order in which they were \nreceived that year, in accordance with longstanding practice of the \ncommittee.\n  As I consistently indicated, and as any chairman can explain, less \ncontroversial nominations are easier to consider and are, by and large, \nable to be scheduled sooner than more controversial nominations. This \nis especially important in the circumstances that existed at the time \nof the change in majority in 2001. At that time we faced what \nRepublicans have now admitted had become a vacancy crisis in the \nfederal courts. From January 1995, when the Republican majority assumed \ncontrol of the confirmation process in the Senate, until the shift in \nmajority, vacancies rose from 65 to 110 and vacancies on the Courts of \nAppeals more than doubled from 16 to 33. I thought it important to make \nas much progress as quickly as we could in the time available to \nus that year, and we did. In fact, through the end of President Bush's \nfirst term, we saw those 110 vacancies plummet to 27, the lowest \nvacancy rate since the Reagan administration.\n\n  The responsibility to advise and consent on the President's nominees \nis one that I take seriously and that the Judiciary Committee takes \nseriously. Justice Owen's nomination to the Court of Appeals has been \ngiven a fair hearing and a fair process before the Judiciary Committee. \nI thank all members of the committee for being fair. Those who had \nconcerns had the opportunity to raise them and heard the nominee's \nresponse, in private meetings, at her public hearing and in written \nfollow-up questions.\n  I would particularly like to commend Senator Feinstein, who chaired \nthe hearing for Justice Owen, for managing that hearing so fairly and \nevenhandedly. It was a long day, where nearly every Senator who is a \nmember of the committee came to question Justice Owen, and Senator \nFeinstein handled it with patience and equanimity.\n  After that hearing, I brought Justice Owen's nomination up for a \nvote, and following an open debate where her opponents discussed her \nrecord and their objections on the merits, the nomination was rejected. \nHer nomination was fully and openly debated, and it was rejected. That \nfair treatment stands in sharp contrast to the way Republicans had \ntreated President Clinton's nominees, including several to the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  That should have ended things right there, but it did not. Priscilla \nOwen's nomination was the first judicial nomination ever to be \nresubmitted after already being debated, voted upon and rejected by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  When the Senate majority shifted, Republicans reconsidered this \nnomination and sent it to the Senate on a straight, party-line vote. \nNever before had a President resubmitted a circuit court nominee \nalready rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee, for the same \nvacancy. And until Senator Hatch gave Justice Owen a second hearing in \n2003, never before had the Judiciary Committee rejected its own \ndecision on such a nominee and granted a second hearing. And at that \nsecond hearing we did not learn much more than the obvious fact that, \ngiven some time, Justice Owen was able to enlist the help of the \ntalented lawyers working at the White House and the Department of \nJustice to come up with some new justifications for her record of \nactivism. We learned that given six months to reconsider the severe \ncriticism directed at her by her Republican colleagues, she still \nadmitted no error. Mostly, we learned that the objections expressed \noriginally by the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were sincerely \nheld when they were made and no less valid after a second hearing. \nNothing Justice Owen said about her\n\n[[Page S5869]]\n\nrecord--indeed, nothing anyone else tried to explain about her record--\nwas able to actually change her record. That was true then, and that is \ntrue today.\n  Senators who opposed this nomination did so because Priscilla Owen's \nrecord shows her to be an ends-oriented activist judge. I have \npreviously explained my conclusions about Justice Owen's record, but I \nwill summarize my objections again today.\n  I am not alone in my concerns about Justice Owen. Her extremism has \nbeen evident even among a conservative Supreme Court of Texas. The \nconservative Republican majority of the Texas Supreme Court has gone \nout of its way to criticize Justice Owen and the dissents she joined in \nways that are highly unusual, and in ways which highlight her ends-\noriented activism. A number of Texas Supreme Court Justices have \npointed out how far from the language of statute she strays in her \nattempts to push the law beyond what the legislature intended.\n  One example is the majority opinion in Weiner v. Wasson. In this \ncase, Justice Owen wrote a dissent advocating a ruling against a \nmedical malpractice plaintiff injured while he was still a teenager. \nThe issue was the constitutionality of a State law requiring minors to \nfile medical malpractice actions before reaching the age of majority, \nor risk being outside the statute of limitations. Of interest is the \nmajority's discussion of the importance of abiding by a prior Texas \nSupreme Court decision unanimously striking down a previous version of \nthe statute. In what reads as a lecture to the dissent, then-Justice \nJohn Cornyn explains on behalf of the majority:\n  Generally, we adhere to our precedents for reasons of efficiency, \nfairness, and legitimacy. First, if we did not follow our own \ndecisions, no issue could ever be considered resolved. The potential \nvolume of speculative relitigation under such circumstances alone ought \nto persuade us that stare decisis is a sound policy. Secondly, we \nshould give due consideration to the settled expectations of litigants \nlike Emmanuel Wasson, who have justifiably relied on the principles \narticulated in [the previous case]. . . . Finally, under our form of \ngovernment, the legitimacy of the judiciary rests in large part upon a \nstable and predictable decisionmaking process that differs dramatically \nfrom that properly employed by the political branches of government.\n  According to the conservative majority on the Texas Supreme Court, \nJustice Owen went out of her way to ignore precedent and would have \nruled for the defendants. The conservative Republican majority, in \ncontrast to Justice Owen, followed precedent and the doctrine of stare \ndecisis. A clear example of Justice Owen's judicial activism.\n  In Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, Justice Owen \nwrote another dissent which drew fire from a conservative Republican \nmajority--this time for her disregard for legislative language. In a \nchallenge by a teacher who did not receive reappointment to her \nposition, the majority found that the school board had exceeded its \nauthority when it disregarded the Texas Education Code and tried to \noverrule a hearing examiner's decision on the matter. Justice Owen's \ndissent advocated for an interpretation contrary to the language of the \napplicable statute. The majority, which included Alberto Gonzales and \ntwo other appointees of then-Governor Bush, was quite explicit about \nits view that Justice Owen's position disregarded the law:\n\n       The dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing examiner's \n     role in the . . . process by stating that the hearing \n     examiner `refused' to make findings on the evidence the Board \n     relies on to support its additional findings. As we explained \n     above, nothing in the statute requires the hearing examiner \n     to make findings on matters of which he is unpersuaded. . . .\n\n  The majority also noted that:\n\n       The dissenting opinion's misconception of the hearing \n     examiner's role stems from its disregard of the procedural \n     elements the Legislature established in subchapter F to \n     ensure that the hearing-examiner process is fair and \n     efficient for both teachers and school boards. The \n     Legislature maintained local control by giving school boards \n     alone the option to choose the hearing-examiner process in \n     nonrenewal proceedings. . . . By resolving conflicts in \n     disputed evidence, ignoring credibility issues, and \n     essentially stepping into the shoes of the factfinder to \n     reach a specific result, the dissenting opinion not only \n     disregards the procedural limitations in the statute but \n     takes a position even more extreme than that argued for by \n     the board. . . .\n\n  This is another clear example of Justice Owen's judicial activism.\n  Collins v. Ison-Newsome, is yet another case where a dissent, joined \nby Justice Owen, was roundly criticized by the Republican majority of \nthe Texas Supreme Court. The Court cogently stated the legal basis for \nits conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to decide the matter before \nit, and as in other opinions where Justice Owen was in dissent, took \ntime to explicitly criticize the dissent's positions as contrary to the \nclear letter of the law.\n  At issue was whether the Supreme Court had the proper ``conflicts \njurisdiction'' to hear the interlocutory appeal of school officials \nbeing sued for defamation. The majority explained that it did not \nbecause published lower court decisions do not create the necessary \nconflict between themselves. The arguments put forth by the dissent, in \nwhich Justice Owen joined, offended the majority, and they made their \nviews known, writing:\n\n       The dissenting opinion agrees that ``because this is an \n     interlocutory appeal . . . this Court's jurisdiction is \n     limited,'' but then argues for the exact opposite proposition \n     . . . This argument defies the Legislature's clear and \n     express limits on our jurisdiction. . . . The author of the \n     dissenting opinion has written previously that we should take \n     a broader approach to the conflicts-jurisdiction standard. \n     But a majority of the Court continues to abide by the \n     Legislature's clear limits on our interlocutory-appeal \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       [T]he dissenting opinion's reading of Government Code sec. \n     22.225(c) conflates conflicts jurisdiction with dissent \n     jurisdiction, thereby erasing any distinction between these \n     two separate bases for jurisdiction. The Legislature \n     identified them as distinct bases for jurisdiction in \n     sections 22.001(a)(1) and (a)(2), and section 22.225(c) \n     refers specifically to the two separate provisions of section \n     22.001(a) providing for conflicts and dissent jurisdiction. . \n     . . [W]e cannot simply ignore the legislative limits on our \n     jurisdiction, and not even Petitioners argue that we should \n     do so on this basis.\n\n  Again, Justice Owen joined a dissent that the Republican majority \ndescribed as defiant of legislative intent and in disregard of \nlegislatively drawn limits. This is yet another clear example of \nJustice Owen's judicial activism.\n  Some of the most striking examples of criticism of Justice Owen's \nwritings, or the dissents and concurrences she joins, come in a series \nof parental notification cases heard in 2000. They include:\n\n       In In re Jane Doe 1, where the majority included an \n     extremely unusual section explaining its view of the proper \n     role of judges, admonishing the dissent, joined by Justice \n     Owen, for going beyond its duty to interpret the law in an \n     attempt to fashion policy.\n\n  Giving a pointed critique of the dissenters, the majority explained \nthat, ``In reaching the decision to grant Jane Doe's application, we \nhave put aside our personal viewpoints and endeavored to do our job as \njudges--that is, to interpret and apply the Legislature's will as it \nhas been expressed in the statute.''\n  In a separate concurrence, Justice Alberto Gonzales wrote that to \nconstrue the law as the dissent did, ``would be an unconscionable act \nof judicial activism.'' A conservative Republican colleague of Justice \nOwen's points squarely to her judicial activism. I know that the \nAttorney General now says that when he wrote that he was not referring \nto her, and I don't blame him for taking that position. After all, he \nis the Attorney General charged with defending her nomination. But \nthere is no way to read his concurring opinion as anything other than a \ncriticism of the dissenters, Owen included. Listen to the words he \nwrote:\n\n       The dissenting opinions suggest that the exceptions to the \n     general rule of notification should be very rare and require \n     a high standard of proof. I respectfully submit that these \n     are policy decisions for the Legislature. And I find nothing \n     in this statute to directly show that the Legislature \n     intended such a narrow construction. As the Court \n     demonstrates, the Legislature certainly could have written \n     [the law] to make it harder to by pass a parent's right to be \n     involved. . . But it did not. . . . Thus, to \n     construe Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to \n     eliminate bypasses or to create hurdles that simply are \n     not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an \n     unconscionable act of judicial activism.\n\n[[Page S5870]]\n\n  Owen is one of two justices who wrote a dissent, so she is naturally \nincluded in the ``dissenting opinions'' to which he refers. It doesn't \nget much clearer than this. But you don't have to take my word for it. \nMr. Gonzales himself has acknowledged as much.\n  Twice before Justice Owen's first hearing in the Judiciary Committee, \nhe and his spokesperson admitted that his comments referred to a \ndisagreement between justices. The New York Times of April 7, 2002, \nreported that, ``a spokesman for Mr. Gonzales, minimized the \nsignificance of the disagreement, [saying] ``Judge Gonzales's opinion \nand Justice Owen's dissent reflect an honest and legitimate difference \nof how to interpret a difficult and vague statute.'' On July 22, 2003, \nthe New York Times reported that in an interview he had with the then-\nWhite House Counsel, ``Mr. Gonzales sought to minimize the impact of \nhis remarks. He acknowledged that calling someone a `judicial activist' \nwas a serious accusation, especially among Republicans who have used \nthat term as an imprecation against liberals.''\n  Of course, Mr. Gonzales went on to tell the reporter that he still \nsupported Justice Owen for the Fifth Circuit, and I expect he would. He \nworks for the President and supports his efforts to fill the federal \ncourts with ideologues and activists, and I appreciate his honesty. It \nwas only years later, when he was before the Judiciary Committee for \nhis own confirmation to be Attorney General that he told us his \ncomments did not refer to Justice Owen, rather to himself, and what he \nwould be doing if he expressed an opinion like that of the dissent. So, \nI will take the Attorney General at his word, but I will take his \noriginal writing and his earliest statements as the best evidence of \nhis view of Justice Owen's opinion in Doe 1, and leave his later, more \npolitically influenced statements, to others.\n  Jane Doe 1 was not the only one of the parental consent cases where \nJustice Owen's position was criticized by her Republican colleagues. In \nIn re Jane Doe 3, Justice Enoch writes specifically to rebuke Justice \nOwen and her fellow dissenters for misconstruing the legislature's \ndefinition of the sort of abuse that may occur when parents are \nnotified of a minor's intent to have an abortion, saying, ``abuse is \nabuse; it is neither to be trifled with nor its severity to be second \nguessed.''\n  In one case that is perhaps the exception that proves the rule, \nJustice Owen wrote a majority opinion that was bitterly criticized by \nthe dissent for its activism. In In re City of Georgetown, Justice Owen \nwrote a majority opinion finding that the city did not have to give The \nAustin American-Statesman a report prepared by a consulting expert in \nconnection with pending and anticipated litigation because such \ninformation was expressly made confidential under other law--namely, \nthe Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  The dissent is extremely critical of Justice Owen's opinion, citing \nthe Texas law's strong preference for disclosure and liberal \nconstruction. Accusing her of activism, Justice Abbott, joined by Chief \nJustice Phillips and Justice Baker, notes that the legislature, \n``expressly identified eighteen categories of information that are \n`public information' and that must be disclosed upon request . . . \n[sec. (a)] The legislature attempted to safeguard its policy of open \nrecords by adding subsection (b), which limits courts' encroachment on \nits legislatively established policy decisions.'' Id. at 338. The \ndissent further protests:\n\n     [b]ut if this Court has the power to broaden by judicial rule \n     the categories of information that are 'confidential under \n     other law,' then subsection (b) is eviscerated from the \n     statute. By determining what information falls outside \n     subsection (a)'s scope, this Court may evade the mandates of \n     subsection (b) and order information withheld whenever it \n     sees fit. This not only contradicts the spirit and language \n     of subsection (b), it guts it.\n\n  Finally, the opinion concluded by asserting that Justice Owen's \ninterpretation, ``abandons strict construction and rewrites the statute \nto eliminate subsection (b)'s restrictions.''\n  Yet again, her colleagues on the Texas court, cite Justice Owen's \njudicial activism.\n  These examples, together with the unusually harsh language directed \nat Justice Owen's position by the majority in the Doe cases, show a \njudge out of step with the conservative Republican majority of the \nTexas Supreme Court, a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her \nactivist views.\n  Justice Owen makes bad decisions even when she is not being \ncriticized by her colleagues. Among these decisions are those where she \nskews her decisions to show bias against consumers, victims and just \nplain ordinary people in favor of big business and corporations. As one \nreads case after case, particularly those in which she was the sole \ndissenter or dissented with the extreme right wing of the Court, her \npattern of activism becomes clear. Her legal views in so many cases \ninvolving statutory interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the \nplain meaning of the statute, the legislative intent, or the majority's \ninterpretation, leading to the conclusion that she sets out to justify \nsome pre-conceived idea of what the law ought to mean. This is not an \nappropriate way for a judge to make decisions. This is a judge whose \nrecord reflects that she is willing and sometimes eager to make law \nfrom the bench.\n  Justice Owen's activism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of \ncases, including those dealing with business interests, malpractice, \naccess to public information, employment discrimination and Texas \nSupreme Court jurisdiction, in which she writes against individual \nplaintiffs time and time again, in seeming contradiction of the law as \nwritten. In fact, according to a study conducted last year by the Texas \nWatch Foundation, a non-profit consumer protection organization in \nTexas, in the last six years, Owen has not dissented once from a \nmajority decision favoring business interests over victims, but has \nmanaged to differ from the majority and dissent in 22 of the 68 cases \nwhere the majority opinion was for the consumer.\n\n  One of the cases where this trend is evident in FM Properties v. City \nof Austin, I asked Justice Owen about this 1998 environmental case at \nher hearing. In her dissent from a 6-3 ruling, in which Justice Alberto \nGonzales was among the majority, Justice Owen showed her willingness to \nrule in favor of large private landowners against the clear public \ninterest in maintaining a fair regulatory process and clean water. Her \ndissent, which the majority characterized as ``nothing more than \ninflammatory rhetoric,'' was an attempt to favor big landowners.\n  In this case, the Texas Supreme Court found that a section of the \nTexas Water Code allowing certain private owners of large tracts of \nland to create ``water quality zones,'' and write their own water \nquality regulations and plans, violated the Texas Constitution because \nit improperly delegated legislative power to private entities. The \ncourt found that the Water Code section gave the private landowners, \n``legislative duties and powers, the exercise of which may adversely \naffect public interests, including the constitutionally-protected \npublic interest in water quality.'' The court also found that certain \naspects of the Code and the factors surrounding its implementation \nweighed against the delegation of power, including the lack of \nmeaningful government review, the lack of adequate representation of \ncitizens affected by the private owners' actions, the breadth of the \ndelegation, and the big landowners' obvious interest in maximizing \ntheir own profits and minimizing their own costs.\n  The majority offered a strong opinion, detailing its legal reasoning \nand explaining the dangers of offering too much legislative power to \nprivate entities. By contrast, in her dissent, Justice Owen argued \nthat, ``[w]hile the Constitution certainly permits the Legislature to \nenact laws that preserve and conserve the State's natural resources, \nthere is nothing in the Constitution that requires the Legislature to \nexercise that power in any particular manner,'' ignoring entirely the \npossibility of an unconstitutional delegation of power. Her view \nstrongly favored large business interests to the clear detriment of the \npublic interest, and against the persuasive legal arguments of a \nmajority of the court.\n  When I asked her about this case at her hearing, I found her answer \nperplexing. In a way that she did not argue in her written dissent, at \nher hearing Justice Owen attempted to cast the FM Properties case not \nas, ``a fight between and City of Austin and big business, but in all \nhonesty, . . .\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\nreally a fight about . . . the State of Texas versus the City of \nAustin.'' In the written dissent however, she began by stating the, \n``importance of this case to private property rights and the separation \nof powers between the judicial and legislative branches . . .'', and \nwent on to decry the Court's decision as one that, ``will impair all \nmanner of property rights.'' At the time she wrote her dissent, Justice \nOwen was certainly clear about the meaning of this case property rights \nfor corporations.\n  Another case that concerned me is GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce, where \nJustice Owen wrote in favor of GTE in a lawsuit by employees for \nintentional infliction of emotional distress. The rest of the court \nheld that three employees subjected to what the majority characterized \nas ``constant humiliating and abusive behavior of their supervisor'' \nwere entitled to the jury verdict in their favor. Despite the court's \nrecitation of an exhaustive list of sickening behavior by the \nsupervisor, and its clear application of Texas law to those facts, \nJustice Owen wrote a concurring opinion to explain her difference of \nopinion on the key legal issue in the case whether the behavior in \nevidence met the legal standard for intentional infliction of emotional \ndistress.\n  Justice Owen contended that the conduct was not, as the standard \nrequires, ``so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to \ngo beyond all possible bounds of decency `` The majority opinion shows \nJustice Owen's concurrence advocating an inexplicable point of view \nthat ignores the facts in evidence in order to reach a predetermined \noutcome in the corporation's favor.\n  Justice Owen's recitation of facts in her concurrence significantly \nminimizes the evidence as presented by the majority. Among the kinds of \nbehavior to which the employees were subjected--according to the \nmajority opinion--are: Upon his arrival the supervisor, ``began \nregularly using the harshest vulgarity . . . continued to use the word \n``f---'' and ``motherf---r'' frequently when speaking with the \nemployees . . . repeatedly physically and verbally threatened and \nterrorized them . . . would frequently assault each of the employees by \nphysically charging at them . . . come up fast . . . and get up over \n(the employee) . . . and yell and scream in her face . . . called (an \nemployee) into his office every day and . . . have her stand in front \nof him, sometimes for as long as thirty minutes, while (the supervisor) \nsimply stared at her . . . made (an employee) get on her hands and \nknees and clean the spots (on the carpet) while he stood over her \nyelling.'' Id. at 613-614. Justice Owen did not believe that such \nconduct was outrageous or outside the bounds of decency under state \nlaw.\n  At her hearing, in answer to Senator Edwards's questions about this \ncase, Justice Owen again gave an explanation not to be found in her \nwritten views. She told him that she agreed with the majority's \nholding, and wrote separately only to make sure that future litigants \nwould not be confused and think that out of context, any one of the \noutrages suffered by the plaintiffs would not support a judgment. \nLooking again at her dissent, I do not see why, if that was what she \ntruly intended, she did not say so in language plain enough to be \nunderstood, or why she thought it necessary to write and say it in the \nfirst place. It is a somewhat curious distinction to make to advocate \nthat in a tort case a judge should write a separate concurrence to \nexplain which part of the plaintiff's case, standing alone, would not \nsupport a finding of liability. Neither her written concurrence, nor \nher answers in explanation after the fact, is satisfactory explanation \nof her position in this case.\n  In City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, Justice Owen dissented \nfrom a majority opinion and, again, it is difficult to justify her \nviews other than as being based on a desire to reach a particular \noutcome. The majority upheld a decision giving the newspaper access to \na document outlining the reasons why the city's finance director was \ngoing to be fired. Justice Owen made two arguments: that because the \ndocument was considered a draft it was not subject to disclosure, and \nthat the document was exempt from disclosure because it was part of \npolicy making. Both of these exceptions were so large as to swallow the \nrule requiring disclosure. The majority rightly points out that if \nJustice Owen's views prevailed, almost any document could be labeled \ndraft to shield it from public view. Moreover, to call a personnel \ndecision a part of policy making is such an expansive interpretation it \nwould leave little that would not be ``policy.''\n\n  Quantum Chemical v. Toennies is another troubling case where Justice \nOwen joined a dissent advocating an activist interpretation of a \nclearly written statute. In this age discrimination suit brought under \nthe Texas civil rights statute, the relevant parts of which were \nmodeled on Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act--and its \namendments--the appeal to the Texas Supreme Court centered on the \nstandard of causation necessary for a finding for the plaintiff. The \nplaintiff argued, and the five justices in the majority agreed, that \nthe plain meaning of the statute must be followed, and that the \nplaintiff could prove an unlawful employment practice by showing that \ndiscrimination was ``a motivating factor.'' The employer corporation \nargued, and Justices Hecht and Owen agreed, that the plain meaning \ncould be discarded in favor of a more tortured and unnecessary reading \nof the statute, and that the plaintiff must show that discrimination \nwas ``the motivating factor,'' in order to recover damages.\n  The portion of Title VII on which the majority relies for its \ninterpretation was part of Congress's 1991 fix to the United States \nSupreme Court's opinion in the Price Waterhouse case, which held that \nan employer could avoid liability if the plaintiff could not show \ndiscrimination was ``the'' motivating factor. Congress's fix, in \nSection 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, does not specify whether \nthe motivating factor standard applies to both sorts of discrimination \ncases, the so-called ``mixed motive'' cases as well as the ``pretext'' \ncases.\n  The Texas majority concluded that they must rely on the plain \nlanguage of the statute as amended, which could not be any clearer that \nunder Title VII discrimination can be shown to be ``a'' motivating \nfactor. Justice Owen joined Justice Hecht in claiming that federal case \nlaw is clear--in favor of their view--and opted for a reading of the \nstatute that would turn it into its polar opposite, forcing plaintiffs \ninto just the situation legislators were trying to avoid. This example \nof Justice Owen's desire to change the law from the bench, instead of \ninterpret it, fits President Bush's definition of activism to a ``T''.\n  Justice Owen has also demonstrated her tendency toward ends-oriented \ndecision making quite clearly in a series of dissents and concurrences \nin cases involving a Texas law providing for a judicial bypass of \nparental notification requirements for minors seeking abortions.\n  The most striking example is Justice Owen's expression of \ndisagreement with the majority's decision on key legal issues in Doe 1, \nwhich I discussed earlier in a different context. She strongly \ndisagreed with the majority's holding on what a minor would have to \nshow in order to establish that she was, as the statute requires, \n``sufficiently well informed'' to make the decision on her own. While \nthe conservative Republican majority laid out a well-reasoned test for \nthis element of the law, based on the plain meaning of the statute and \nwell-cited case law, Justice Owen inserted elements found in neither \nauthority. Specifically, Justice Owen insisted that the majority's \nrequirement that the minor be ``aware of the emotional and \npsychological aspects of undergoing an abortion'' was not sufficient \nand that among other requirements with no basis in the law, she, \n``would require . . . [that the minor] should . . . indicate to the \ncourt that she is aware of and has considered that there are \nphilosophic, social, moral, and religious arguments that can be brought \nto bear when considering abortion.''\n  In her written concurrence, Justice Owen indicated, through legal \ncitation, that support for this proposition could be found in a \nparticular page of the Supreme Court's opinion in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey. However, when one looks at that portion of the Casey decision, \none finds no mention of requiring a minor to acknowledge religious or \nmoral arguments. The passage talks instead about the ability of a State \nto ``enact rules and regulations designed\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\nto encourage her to know that there are philosophic and social \narguments of great weight that can be brought to bear,'' Justice Owen's \nreliance on this portion of a United States Supreme Court opinion to \nrewrite Texas law was simply wrong.\n  As she did in answer to questions about a couple of other cases at \nher hearing, Justice Owen tried to explain away this problem with an \nafter-the-fact justification. She told Senator Cantwell that the \nreference to religion was not to be found in Casey after all, but in \nanother U.S. Supreme Court case, H.L. v. Matheson. She explained that \nin ``Matheson they talk about that for some people it raises profound \nmoral and religious concerns, and they're talking about the \ndesirability or the State's interest in these kinds of considerations \nin making an informed decision.'' Transcript at 172. But again, on \nreading Matheson, one sees that the only mention of religion comes in a \nquotation meant to explain why the parents of the minor are due \nnotification, not about the contours of what the government may require \nsomeone to prove to show she was fully well informed. Her reliance on \nMatheson for her proposed rewrite of the law is just as faulty as her \nreliance on Casey. Neither one supports her reading of the law. She \nsimply tries a little bit of legal smoke and mirrors to make it appear \nas if they did. This is the sort of ends-oriented decision making that \ndestroys the belief of a citizen in a fair legal system. And most \ntroubling of all was her indication to Senator Feinstein that she still \nviews her dissents in the Doe cases as the proper reading and \nconstruction of the Texas statute. In these cases, Priscilla Owen tried \nto insert requirements into the law that the Texas legislature had not \nincluded in the law. Simply put, Justice Owen engaged in judicial \nactivism. In fact, as I've said, it was in one of these cases that \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales, referred to Owen's position in the \ncase as ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n\n  Senators have criticized Justice Owen's activism in the parental \nnotification cases. We have not criticized the laws themselves. In \nfact, some Democratic Senators have noted their support for these kinds \nof statutes. Republicans have strayed far from the issue. What is \nrelevant here is that Priscilla Owen tried to insert requirements into \nthe law that the Texas legislature had not included. A State \nlegislature can enact constitutional parental notification laws. A \njudge is not supposed to rewrite the law but to apply it to the facts \nand to ensure its constitutionality.\n  If she wants to rewrite the law, she should leave the bench and run \nfor a seat in the state legislature.\n  At her second, unprecedented hearing in 2003, Justice Owen and her \ndefenders tried hard to recast her record and others' criticism of it. \nI went to that hearing, I listened to her testimony, and I read her \nwritten answers, many newly formulated, that attempt to explain away \nher very disturbing opinions in the Texas parental notification cases. \nBut her record is still her record, and the record is clear. She did \nnot satisfactorily explain why she infused the words of the Texas \nlegislature with so much more meaning than she can be sure they \nintended. She adequately describes the precedents of the Supreme Court \nof the United States, to be sure, but she simply did not justify the \nleaps in logic and plain meaning she attempted in those decisions.\n  I read her responses to Senator Hatch's remarks at that second \nhearing, where he attempted to explain away cases about which I had \nexpressed concern at her first hearing. For example, I heard him \nexplain the opinion she wrote in F.M. Properties v. City of Austin. I \nread how he recharacterized the dispute in an effort to make it sound \ninnocuous, just a struggle between two jurisdictions over some \nunimportant regulations. I know how, through a choreographed exchange \nof leading questions and short answers, they tried to respond to my \nquestion from the original hearing, which was never really answered, \nabout why Justice Owen thought it was proper for the legislature to \ngrant large corporate landowners the power to regulate themselves. I \nremained unconvinced. The majority in this case, which invalidated a \nstate statute favoring corporations, did not describe the case or the \nissues as Senator Hatch and Justice Owen did. A fair reading of the \ncase shows no evidence of a struggle between governments. This is all \nan attempt at after-the-fact, revisionist justification where there \nreally is none to be found.\n  Justice Owen and Chairman Hatch's explanation of the case also lacked \neven the weakest effort at rebutting the criticism of her by the F.M. \nProperties majority. In its opinion, the six justice majority said, and \nI am quoting, that Justice Owen's dissent was ``nothing more than \ninflammatory rhetoric.'' They explained why her legal objections were \nmistaken, saying that no matter what the state legislature had the \npower to do on its own, it was simply unconstitutional to give the big \nlandowners the power they were given. No talk of the City of Austin v. \nthe State of Texas. Just the facts.\n  Likewise, the few explanations offered for the many other examples of \nthe times her Republican colleagues criticized her were unavailing. The \ntortured reading of Justice Gonzales' remarks in the Doe case were \nunconvincing. He clearly said that to construe the law in the way that \nJustice Owen's dissent construed the law would be activism. Any other \ninterpretation is just not credible.\n  And no reasons were offered for why her then-colleague, now ours, \nJustice Cornyn, thought it necessary to explain the principle of stare \ndecisis to her in his opinion in Weiner v. Wasson. Or why in Montgomery \nIndependent School District v. Davis, the majority criticized her for \nher disregard for legislative language, saying that, ``the dissenting \nopinion misconceives the hearing examiner's role in the . . . \nprocess,'' which it said stemmed from, ``its disregard of the \nprocedural elements the Legislature established . . . to ensure that \nthe hearing-examiner process is fair and efficient for both teachers \nand school boards.'' Or why, in Collins v. Ison-Newsome, a dissent \njoined by Justice Owen was so roundly criticized by the Republican \nmajority, which said the dissent agrees with one proposition but then \n``argues for the exact opposite proposition . . . [defying] the \nLegislature's clear and express limits on our jurisdiction.''\n  These examples, together with the unusually harsh language directed \nat Justice Owen's position by the majority in the Doe cases, show a \njudge out of step with the conservative Republican majority of the \nTexas Supreme Court, a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her \nactivist views. No good explanation was offered for these critical \nstatements last year, and no good explanation was offered two weeks \nago. Politically motivated rationalizations do not negate the plain \nlanguage used to describe her activism at the time.\n  I also briefly set the record straight about a number of \nmischaracterizations of the opposition to Justice Owen's nomination. \nEarlier in this debate, at least one Senator said that opposition \nSenators, are ``discriminating against people of faith.'' Sadly, these \nstatements follow a pattern of despicable accusations, made often by \nthe radical interest groups backing these nominations and made too \nfrequently here by those repeated these slurs. The assertion that any \nSenator opposes someone because she is a Sunday school teacher is a new \nlow, however. Even President Bush has disavowed that attack.\n  I oppose Priscilla Owen, not because of her faith, which I respect, \nbut because she is an ends-oriented judicial activist who is so far \noutside of the mainstream that she has often been criticized harshly by \nthe Texas Supreme Court's conservative majority. In case after case, \nJustice Owen's opinions make clear that she is a judge willing to make \nlaw from the bench rather than follow the language and intent of the \nlegislature or judicial precedent. While some of the clearest examples \nof her judicial activism come in her dissents in cases involving the \nparental notification law, there are, as I have explained, many other \nexamples in cases having nothing to do with abortion.\n  Justice Owen's position as a frequent dissenter on the Texas Supreme \nCourt shows how extreme she can be and how far from the letter of the \nlaw she strays in her attempts to push her own political and \nideological agenda. Not\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nonly has the majority of that conservative court criticized her \ndissents on numerous occasions, but the majority's criticisms of her \nopinions are unusual for their harsh tone. Surely the Republican \nmembers of the Texas Supreme Court criticized Priscilla Owen not \nbecause she is a person of faith, but because she insists on \nimpermissibly legislating from the bench. I concur.\n  Senators oppose Priscilla Owen's confirmation because she has \nattempted to substitute her own views for those of the legislature. \nWhat is relevant is that she is writing law, rather than interpreting \nlaw, as evidenced in the opinions in which she would have added \nrequirements that the Texas legislature did not put into the law.\n  An evaluation of Priscilla Owen's decisions shows that it is she who \nis results-oriented; she crafts her decisions in order to promote \nbusiness interests over individuals and to advance various social \nagendas, rather than simply following the law and evaluating the facts \nof a given case. Justice Owen has been broadly and repeatedly \ncriticized by her fellow Republican Texas Supreme Court Justices for \ndisregarding statutes and the intent of the legislature, instead, \npursuing her own activist results. In many cases in which she has \ndissented and been criticized by the majority, her opinions were to \nbenefit corporate interests including numerous companies that \ncontributed to her campaign.\n  For instance, in FM Properties Operating Co. v. City of Austin, which \nI have already discussed, where she ruled to let a single developer \ndodge Austin's water quality rules, Justice Owen received $2,500 in \ncampaign contributions from one of the FM Properties company's partners \nand over $45,000 from the company's lawyers.\n  It is worth noting that my Democratic colleagues and I do not stand \nalone in opposing Priscilla Owen's nominations. We are in the good \ncompany of a broad array of newspaper editorial boards, prominent \norganizations, and individuals throughout the country and in Justice \nOwen's home state of Texas.\n  The groups opposing Justice Owen range from the AFL-CIO and the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights to the Endangered Species \nCoalition and the National Partnership for Women and Families. Texas \nopposition to the Owen nomination has come from a wide variety of \ngroups including the American Association of University Women of Texas, \nTexas Lawyers for a Fair Judiciary, and the Texas chapters of the \nNational Organization for Women and the Mexican American Legal Defense \nand Education Fund, MALDEF, just to name a few. Among the many citizens \nwho have written to oppose Justice Owen's nomination are dozens of \nattorneys from Texas and elsewhere, as well as C.L. Ray, a retired \nJustice of the Texas Supreme Court, who wrote, ``I have rarely seen a \npublic servant show so much contempt for the laws of this State.''\n  Lawyers who appear in front of Justice Owen in Texas Supreme Court \nrate her poorly as well. The most recent results of the Houston Bar \nAssociation's Judicial Evaluation Poll shows that 45 percent of the \nrespondents rated Justice Owen ``poor,'' more than gave that lowest \nrating to any other justice. She was in last place in the \n``acceptable'' category, with only 15 percent, and in second-to-last \nplace among her colleagues in receiving a rating of ``outstanding'', \nwith only 39 percent giving her that review.\n  I have heard Senator Cornyn say that Justice Owen has been supported \nby major newspapers in Texas, but that support must have been for her \nelection to the Texas Supreme Court because, to the contrary, a number \nof major newspaper editorial boards in Texas have expressed their \nopposition to Justice Owen's confirmation to the federal appellate \nbench.\n  The San Antonio Express News criticized Owen because ``[o]n the Texas \nSupreme Court, she always voted with a small court minority that \nconsistently tries to bypass the law as written by the Legislature.''\n  The Houston Chronicle cited complaints about Owen ``run from a \npenchant for overturning jury verdicts on tortuous readings of the law \nto a distinct bias against consumers and in favor of large \ncorporations,'' and the newspaper concluded that she ``has shown a \nclear preference for ruling to achieve a particular result rather than \nimpartially interpreting the law. Anyone willing to look objectively at \nOwen's record would be hard-pressed to deny that.''\n  The Austin American-Statesman wrote that Owen is ``out of the broad \nmainstream of jurisprudence'' and ``seems all too willing to bend the \nlaw to fit her views, rather than the reverse.'' The newspaper \ncontinued, ``Owen also could usually be counted upon in any important \ncase that pitted an individual or group of individuals against business \ninterests to side with business.''\n  Editorial boards throughout the country echo the opinions of Owen's \nhome state newspapers. Newspapers from the Palm Beach Post and the \nCharleston Gazette to the Los Angeles Times and the Detroit Free Press \nhave spoken out against this extreme nomination. The Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution wrote that Owen ``has a lopsided record favoring large \ncorporations,'' while the Minneapolis Star-Tribune wrote that ``[e]ven \nher court colleagues have commented on her habit of twisting law to fit \nher hyperconservative political views'' and that ``Owen's ethical \ncompass is apparently broken.'' Educated observers who review Priscilla \nOwen's record recognize that she is an ends-oriented judicial activist \nwho is not an appropriate nominee for a lifetime appointment to one of \nthe most important courts in the land.\n  When he nominated Priscilla Owen, President Bush said that his \nstandard for judging judicial nominees would be that they ``share a \ncommitment to follow and apply the law, not to make law from the \nbench.'' He said he is against judicial activism. Yet he has appointed \njudicial activists like Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown.\n  Under President Bush's own standards, Justice Owen's record of ends-\noriented judicial activism does not qualify her for a lifetime \nappointment to the federal bench.\n  The President has often spoken of judicial activism without \nacknowledging that ends-oriented decision-making can come easily to \nextreme ideological nominees. In the case of Priscilla Owen, we see a \nperfect example of such an approach to the law, and I cannot support \nit. The oath taken by federal judges affirms their commitment to \n``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich.'' No one who enters a federal courtroom \nshould have to wonder whether he or she will be fairly heard by the \njudge.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen's record of judicial activism and ends-\noriented decisionmaking leaves me with grave doubt about her ability to \nbe a fair judge. The President says he opposes putting judicial \nactivists on the Federal bench, yet Justice Priscilla Owen \nunquestionably is a judicial activist. I cannot vote to confirm her for \nthis appointment to one of the highest courts in the land.\n  I have said time and time again that if somebody walks into a federal \ncourt, they should not have to wonder whether they will be treated \nfairly based on whether they are a Republican or a Democrat, a \ndefendant or a plaintiff, rich or poor. They should know that they are \ngoing to be treated fairly no matter who they are and that their case \nwill be determined on the merits. In Priscilla Owen's case, her record \nshows that litigants cannot be sure of that. The President may well get \nthe votes to put Priscilla Owen on the Fifth Circuit today, but would \nit not have been better to have nominated someone with a record of \nfairness and impartial judging who could be confirmed by a united, not \na divided Senate.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased for our country and for \nthis body that the Senate soundly rejected an abuse of power that would \nhave done irreparable harm to Congress and to our Nation's system of \nchecks and balances. I salute my Republican colleagues who were able to \nstand up to their leadership and my Democratic colleagues who labored \nlong and hard to prevent the majority from launching the so-called \nnuclear option. I am especially thankful for our Democratic leader, \nHarry Reid, who showed a steady leadership hand through these troubling \ndays.\n  As part of the agreement reached Monday night, Priscilla Owen, \nPresident Bush's nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit, will get an up-or-down vote. It\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nappears that she will be confirmed, which I hoped would not take place.\n  Consistent with my voting record, while I respect my colleagues who \nworked hard to preserve the filibuster, I voted against invoking \ncloture on the Owen nomination yesterday and today I will vote against \nconfirming her and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I want to make it clear that I have nothing against her personally. \nToo often, Members on the other side of the aisle have depicted \nopposition to their radical nominees as a personal animus or a bias \nbased on the nominees' sex or race or religion. That could not be \nfurther from the truth, which is obvious if one looks at my voting \nrecord. I want to try to keep Priscilla Owen off the bench because she \nhas a troubling record on civil rights, reproductive rights, employment \ndiscrimination, and the rights of consumers.\n  Our Federal courts touch the lives of every American and ensure that \nour individual rights are upheld. It is imperative that all nominees \nfor the Federal bench are individuals of distinction with a record of \nfairness and impartiality. Unfortunately, Ms. Owen just has not \ndemonstrated those qualities while on the Texas Supreme Court.\n  Ms. Owen has routinely dissented on rulings regarding the rights of \nemployees, including the right to be free from invidious \ndiscrimination. She joined in dissenting opinions which effectively \ntried to rewrite a key Texas civil rights law. If she had prevailed, \nshe would have made it much more difficult for workers to prove \nemployment discrimination. Ms. Owen has sought to override jury \nverdicts, and to diminish and undermine their role in cases involving \nconsumer protections. She has repeatedly and--in my estimation--\nunfairly ruled in favor of big business at the expense of workers and \nconsumers. She has gone so far as to write and join in a number of \nopinions that severely limit the ability of working people to recover \ndamages under lawsuits involving on-the-job injuries. In almost every \nreproductive rights case decided by the Texas Supreme Court during her \ntime there, Ms. Owen has sought to restrict a woman's right to make her \nown personal decisions.\n  Ms. Owen's views are far outside of the judicial mainstream--even by \nthe standards of the conservative Texas Supreme Court. President Bush's \nown White House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales, who was a fellow Justice on \nthe Texas Supreme Court, referred to one of Ms. Owen's dissenting \nopinions as ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  On September 5, 2002, the Judiciary Committee wisely rejected \nreporting Ms. Owen's nomination to the full Senate. I have seen no \nevidence in the intervening time that makes her more suitable now than \nshe was in 2002 for a lifetime appointment to such an important \nposition.\n  The Federal courts play a critical role in upholding the fundamental \nrights and protections of all Americans. It is imperative that nominees \nto the Federal courts have a clear understanding of the importance of \nconstitutional rights and statutory protections, and of the role and \nresponsibility of the Federal courts in upholding these rights and \nprotections. She has not exhibited that understanding. Consequently, I \ndo not believe she is an appropriate nominee for the Fifth Circuit. \nAccordingly, I will vote against her confirmation.\n  It would be relatively easy for President Bush to send judicial \nnominees to the Senate who would enjoy overwhelming or even unanimous \nsupport. I hope he will stop trying to pack the Federal courts with \nextremists such as Priscilla Owen. Until he does, I have no choice but \nto do my duty to uphold the Constitution and oppose them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the time on our side has \nexpired. While we are waiting for the distinguished Republican leader \nto come to the floor, I ask to continue until he arrives. Of course, I \nwill yield to him as soon as he seeks recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That we have terminated the debate and are now voting on \nthis controversial nomination demonstrates our good will in light of \nthe agreement reached two days ago to avoid triggering the Republican \nleadership's bid for one-party rule. Fourteen of our colleagues came to \nus with a bipartisan plan to avoid the Majority leader's nuclear \noption, which was a short-sighted effort to change the more than 200 \nyears of Senate tradition, precedent and rules by destroying minority \nrights.\n  While we may not all agree with every part of the agreement, by our \nvotes yesterday and today Democrats are showing that we are prepared to \nmove on. I urge the Republican leader not to be captive of the narrow \nspecial interest that have moved and pushed so much the effort toward \nthe nuclear option. We have a great deal of work to do in this body, \nwork that can be accomplished easily by Republicans and Democrats \nworking together, not by those who want simply partisan rules.\n  I expect that in due course the Senate will consider each of the \nthree controversial nominees mentioned in Part I. A. of that Memorandum \nof Understanding. I do not expect there to be any repeat by Democrats \nof the extraordinary obstruction by Republicans of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees. For example, I do not expect any of the tactics used \nby Republicans during the extensive delay in Senate consideration of \nthe Richard Paez nomination. Judge Paez waited more than four years \nbefore we were able to get a vote on his confirmation longer than the \nPriscilla Owen nomination has been pending. I recall some Republicans \nmounting an extraordinary motion after the filibuster of his nomination \nwas broken to indefinitely postpone the vote; a last-ditch, \nunprecedented effort that was ultimately unsuccessful. Of course, Judge \nHelene White never got a vote or even a hearing in more than four \nyears. Republicans denied her a hearing for a period longer than the \nOwen nomination has been pending. Like more than 60 of President \nClinton's moderate and qualified judicial nominations, she was \nsubjected to the Republican pocket filibuster.\n  In this connection I should also note that last night the Senate, \nwith Democratic cooperation, entered into unanimous consent agreement \nto govern the consideration and vote on three additional circuit court \nnominees, Tom Griffith, Richard Griffin, and David McKeague. Those are \nnominations that will be debated and voted upon when the Senate returns \nfrom Memorial Day. The Democratic Leader deserves great credit for \nforging significant progress on these matters.\n  I have seen reports that the vote today of the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen is the ``first'' of this President's controversial \nnominees. That is not true. This administration has sent divisive \nnominee after divisive nominee to the Senate. Several controversial \njudicial nominees have already been voted upon by the Senate. Among the \n208 judges already confirmed are some who were confirmed with less than \n60 votes, some with more than 40 negative votes. The President's court-\npacking efforts are not new but continuing. Moreover, his penchant for \ninsisting on divisive nominations is not limited to the judiciary, as \nwill be demonstrated, again, when the Senate turns to the nomination of \nJohn Bolton following the vote on the Owen nomination.\n  As for the nomination of Priscilla Owen, after reviewing her record, \nhearing her testimony and evaluating her answers I am voting against \nher confirmation. I believe Justice Owen has shown herself over the \nlast decade on the Texas Supreme Court to be an ends-oriented judicial \nactivist, intent on reading her own policy views into the law. She has \nbeen the target of criticism by her conservative Republican colleagues \non the court in a variety of types of cases where the law did not fit \nher personal views, including in cases where she has consistently ruled \nfor big business and corporate interests in cases against worker and \nconsumers. This sort of judging ought not to be rewarded with such an \nimportant and permanent promotion. She skews her decisions to show bias \nagainst consumers, victims and just plain ordinary\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\npeople in favor of big business and corporations.\n  As one reads case after case, particularly those in which she was the \nsole dissenter or dissented with the extreme right wing of the Court, \nher pattern of activism becomes clear. Her legal views in so many cases \ninvolving statutory interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the \nplain meaning of the statute, the legislative intent, or the majority's \ninterpretation, leading to the conclusion that she sets out to justify \nsome pre-conceived idea of what the law ought to mean. This is not an \nappropriate way for a judge to make decisions. This is a judge whose \nrecord reflects that she is willing and sometimes eager to make law \nfrom the bench.\n  Justice Owen's activism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of \ncases, including those dealing with business interests, malpractice, \naccess to public information, employment discrimination and Texas \nSupreme Court jurisdiction, in which she writes against individual \nplaintiffs time and again, in seeming contradiction of the law as \nwritten. In fact, according to a study conducted last year by the Texas \nWatch Foundation, a non-profit consumer protection organization in \nTexas, in the last six years, Owen has not dissented once from a \nmajority decision favoring business interests over victims, but has \nmanaged to differ from the majority and dissent in 22 of the 68 cases \nwhere the majority opinion was for the consumer.\n\n  It is worth noting that the opposition to Priscilla Owen's nomination \nincludes a broad array of newspaper editorial boards, prominent \norganizations, and individuals throughout the country and in Justice \nOwen's home state of Texas. Groups opposing Justice Owen range from the \nAFL-CIO and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights to the Endangered \nSpecies Coalition and the National Partnership for Women and Families. \nOpposition to the Owen nomination has come from a wide variety of \ngroups in Texas including the American Association of University Women \nof Texas, Texas Lawyers for a Fair Judiciary, and the Texas chapters of \nthe National Organization for Women and the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Education Fund (MALDEF), just to name a few. Among the many \ncitizens who have written to oppose Justice Owen's nomination are \ndozens of attorneys from Texas and elsewhere, as well as C.L. Ray, a \nretired Justice of the Texas Supreme Court, who wrote, ``I have rarely \nseen a public servant show so much contempt for the laws of this \nState.''\n  Lawyers who appear in front of Justice Owen in Texas Supreme Court \nrate her poorly as well. The most recent results of the Houston Bar \nAssociation's Judicial Evaluation Poll shows that 45 percent of the \nrespondents rated Justice Owen ``poor,'' more than gave that lowest \nrating to any other justice. She was in last place in the \n``acceptable'' category, with only 15 percent, and in second-to-last \nplace among her colleagues in receiving a rating of ``outstanding,'' \nwith only 39 percent giving her that review.\n  I have heard Senator Cornyn say that Justice Owen has been supported \nby major newspapers in Texas, but that support must have been for her \nelection to the Texas Supreme Court because a number of major newspaper \neditorial boards in Texas have expressed their opposition to Justice \nOwen's confirmation to the federal appellate bench.\n  When he nominated Priscilla Owen, President Bush said that his \nstandard for judging judicial nominees would be that they share a \ncommitment to follow and apply the law, not to make law from the bench. \nHe said he is against judicial activism. Yet he has nominated judicial \nactivists like Priscilla Owen. Under President Bush's own standards, \nJustice Owen's record of ends-oriented judicial activism does not \nqualify her for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.\n  I have said time and time again that if somebody walks into a federal \ncourt, they should not have to wonder whether they will be treated \nfairly based on whether they are a Republican or a Democrat, a \ndefendant or a plaintiff, rich or poor. They should know that they are \ngoing to be treated fairly no matter who they are and that their case \nwill be determined on the merits. In Priscilla Owen's case, her record \nshows that litigants cannot be sure of that. The President may well get \nthe votes to put Priscilla Owen on the Fifth Circuit today, but would \nit not have been better to have nominated someone with a record of \nfairness and impartial judging who could be confirmed by a united, not \na divided Senate?\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Republican leader now on the \nfloor of the Senate. I will close--so that he may be recognized--by \nsaying, again, when somebody walks into a Federal court, they should \nnot have to ask themselves: Is this a Republican court or Democratic \ncourt? This is an independent judiciary.\n  I yield to the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will finally \nvote up or down on the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Four years--it has been a long road for \nJustice Owen, much longer than anyone would have or could have \nanticipated when she was nominated about 4 years and 2 weeks ago.\n  She has endured 4 years of delay, 9 hours of committee hearings, \nhundreds of questions, and more than 100 hours of debate on this Senate \nfloor. In fact, it is interesting, the Senate has debated Justice Owen \nmore days than all the sitting Supreme Court Justices combined. Today \nshe will get the fair up-or-down vote she deserves.\n  Justice Owen has withstood an orchestrated partisan attack on her \nrecord as a judge and, indeed, at times on her character. Only a few \ndays ago, opponents unfairly labeled her as too extreme to serve on the \nFederal bench, but those unfair attacks have not succeeded. Justice \nOwen, as we all know, is a distinguished mainstream jurist. She has \nexhibited extraordinary patience and courage in the face of continuous \nand sometimes vicious criticism. But today finally she will get that \nfair up-or-down vote, and I am confident she will be confirmed.\n  Today does mark a triumph of principle over politics, results over \nrhetoric. For far too long on judicial nominees, the filibuster was \nused to facilitate partisanship and to subvert principle. Through this \ndebate, we have exposed the injustice of judicial obstruction in the \nlast Congress and advanced those core constitutional principles that \nall judicial nominees deserve a fair up-or-down vote.\n  This vote should mark--will mark, I hope--a new beginning in the \nSenate, a step forward for principle, a step forward for fairness and \nthe Constitution, but we cannot stop at this single step. I look \nforward to confirming other previously blocked nominees. I look forward \nto reading about partisan judicial obstruction only in the history \nbooks, and I hope the constitutional option does not become necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the confirmation of \nJustice Owen.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Priscilla Richman Owen, of Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Fifth Circuit? The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. STEVENS (after having voted in the affirmative). Mr. President, \non this vote, I voted ``yea.''

Madam President, we would be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John Robert \nBolton, of Maryland, to be the Representative of the United States of \nAmerica to the United Nations, with the rank and status of Ambassador \nExtraordinary and Plenipotentiary, and the Representative of the United \nStates of America in the Security Council of the United Nations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senate meets today to debate the \nnomination of John Bolton to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. \nIn this capacity, he would play an important role in securing greater \ninternational support for the national security and foreign policy \nobjectives of the United States. It is my judgment that Secretary \nBolton should be confirmed as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  In recent years, the Foreign Relations Committee has made a special \neffort to work in a bipartisan manner. For 3 straight years, we have \nreported out foreign affairs authorization bills by unanimous votes. \nDuring the last Congress, we met 247 times, which was 50 percent more \nfrequently than any other committee in the Senate. In almost every \ncase, the subject of the meeting and the selection of witnesses enjoyed \nbipartisan support.\n  We have undertaken the cooperative path, not because we always agree, \nbut because we know the stakes are high for our country in the \ninternational arena. We face severe threats capable of undermining our \nnational security and our economic well-being. We believe we should \nstrive to approach these questions with as much unity as possible.\n  On the John Bolton nomination, our committee could not develop a \nconsensus position. From the start, members had widely divergent views \nof Secretary Bolton and his suitability for the U.N. ambassadorship. \nMembers formed different opinions about the nominee based on their \nassessment of the role of the United Nations, their interpretation of \nSecretary Bolton's statements, their judgments on the testimony of many \nwitnesses, their perspectives on managerial conduct, their philosophy \non how much latitude a President should have in nominating \nsubordinates, and many other factors.\n  On top of these different perspectives, allegations were raised about \nSecretary Bolton that led to an expanded inquiry. Republicans and \nDemocrats differed on some procedural aspects related to this inquiry, \nas well as on the relevance of some allegations and documents. Despite \nthese substantive disagreements, we were able to work together in an \neffort that represents one of the most intense and most far-reaching \nexaminations of a nominee in my experience.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has interviewed 29 witnesses, \nproducing approximately 1,000 pages of transcripts. We have received \nand reviewed more than 830 pages of documents from the State \nDepartment, from USAID, and the CIA regarding the Bolton nomination. We \nhave questioned Secretary Bolton in person for 7 hours, and we have \nreceived responses to nearly 100 questions for the record, many \ncontaining numerous subparts. The depth and breadth of the 11-week \ninquiry is particularly notable, given that Secretary Bolton has been \nconfirmed 4 times by the Senate already and that most of us have had \npersonal experiences with him.\n  I thank both Democrat and Republican members of our Foreign Relations \nCommittee for their patience and their perseverance throughout this \nprocess. Although we disagree in our conclusions, we share the view \nthat the committee must work together even when we have different \nperspectives. We also agreed that the nomination has provided an \nopportunity for debate on larger issues related to the conduct of U.S. \nforeign policy.\n\n  At the core of any nomination process is the question of whether the \nnominee is qualified to undertake the task for which he or she is \nnominated. I have no doubt Secretary Bolton is extremely well \nqualified. He has just served 4 years in a key under secretary position \nthat technically outranks the post for which he is being nominated. He \nhas succeeded in several high-profile negotiation settings. He was the \nprimary negotiator in the creation of the successful Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative and the landmark Moscow Treaty. He played a large \nrole in the agreement with Libya on the surrender of that nation's \nweapons of mass destruction program and the ``10 Plus 10 Over 10'' \nagreement that resulted in $10 billion in pledges from other G-8 \ncountries to secure former Soviet Union weapons of mass destruction \narsenals. These are among the Bush administration's most important and \nindisputable foreign policy successes.\n  Opponents have argued that Secretary Bolton's personality will \nprevent him from being effective at the U.N., but his diplomatic \nsuccesses over the last 4 years belie that expectation. Few in \nGovernment have thought more about U.N. reform than has John\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\nBolton. He served 4 years as the Assistant Secretary of State \noverseeing international organizations under the first President Bush. \nHe has written and commented extensively on that subject.\n  During his confirmation hearing, Secretary Bolton demonstrated an \nimpressive command of issues related to the United Nations. Senator \nBiden acknowledged to the nominee at his hearing that:\n\n       There is no question you have extensive experience in UN \n     affairs.\n\n  Deputy Secretary Rich Armitage recently told reporters:\n\n       John Bolton is eminently qualified. He's one of the \n     smartest guys in Washington.\n\n  Secretary Bolton also demonstrated his ability to get things done \nprior to becoming Under Secretary of State. Perhaps the best example is \nhis initiative to repeal U.N. Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism \nwith racism.\n  In May 1991, as Assistant Secretary of State for International \nOrganizations, John Bolton refused to accept the common wisdom that \nrepealing this infamous resolution was impossible. He and his staff \ninitiated a campaign to change votes in the General Assembly, even \nthough they were advised they would not be successful. Within a few \nmonths, they had made substantial progress. By the fall, the State \nDepartment put its full weight behind that effort. On December 16, \n1991, the U.N. General Assembly voted to repeal the resolution by a \nvote of 111 to 25.\n  In the private sector, Secretary Bolton made some blunt statements \nabout the United Nations. Many of these statements were made in \nacademic or think-tank settings where debate on these subjects was \nencouraged. Many of the quotes that have been repeated by opponents \ncame in the context of much larger speeches that were more nuanced. The \nfact that he has strong views and a long record of commentary on the \njob that he is about to undertake should not be disqualifying.\n  During our hearing with Secretary Bolton, he spoke of the United \nNations important role in international security. He has emphasized \nthat he wants the institution to work well on behalf of international \nsecurity and the interests of the United States.\n  Beyond qualifications, we should recognize that Secretary Bolton has \nthe confidence of the President of the United States and the Secretary \nof State. The President has made it clear this is not a casual \nappointment. He wants a specific person to do a specific job. President \nBush has a reform agenda in mind at the U.N. This reform agenda is \ngenerally supported by the U.N. Secretary General who has put forward a \nreform plan of his own. The President wants John Bolton, an avowed and \nknowledgeable reformer, to carry out that reform agenda. Kofi Annan has \nwelcomed John Bolton's appointment.\n  I would emphasize that Secretary Bolton is being appointed to a \nposition that is within the chain of command of the President and the \nSecretary of State. The Ambassador to the United Nations reports \ndirectly to the President and to the Secretary of State. In fact, \nhistorically this ambassadorship has reflected directly on the \nPresident. The ambassador is seen as the President's voice at the U.N. \nConsequently, there are few positions in Government where the President \nshould have more latitude in choosing his nominee. In my judgment, it \nwould take absolutely extraordinary circumstances for the Senate to \ntell the President he cannot have his choice to carry out his \ndirectives at the U.N., even though the nominee is highly experienced \nand knowledgeable about U.N. affairs.\n  At times during this process, opponents have suggested that Secretary \nBolton sits outside the mainstream in the Bush administration. The \nproblem with this assertion is that President Bush is telling us this \nis not so. President Bush is telling us Secretary Bolton accurately \nreflects his views about the U.N. and how that institution should be \nreformed. President Bush is saying Secretary Bolton is his considered \nchoice to implement his policies and diplomatic initiatives at the \nUnited Nations.\n\n  Some observers who want a different program than the President's may \nnot agree with the President's choice, but the results of the 2004 \nelection give the President the responsibility and the right to \nnominate like-minded representatives and to define who a like-minded \nrepresentative is.\n  We have ample evidence that the United Nations is in need of reform. \nThe Foreign Relations Committee held the first congressional hearing on \nthe U.N. oil-for-food scandal more than a year ago. Since that time, \nthrough the work of Paul Volcker, our own colleague on the committee, \nSenator Coleman, and many others, we have learned much more about the \nextent of the corruption and mismanagement involved. This knowledge has \nsupported the case for reform.\n  We know billions of dollars that should have been spent on \nhumanitarian needs in Iraq were siphoned off by Saddam Hussein's regime \nthrough a system of surcharges, bribes, and kickbacks. This corruption \ndepended upon members of the U.N. Security Council who were willing to \nbe complicit in these activities. It also depended on U.N. officials \nand contractors who were dishonest, inattentive, or willing to make \ndamaging compromises in pursuit of a compassionate mission.\n  The U.N. reform is not a new issue. The structure and the role of the \nUnited Nations have been debated in our country almost continuously \nsince the U.N. was established in 1945. But in 2005 we may have a \nunique opportunity to improve the operations of the U.N. The \nrevelations of the oil-for-food scandal and the urgency of \nstrengthening global cooperation to address terrorism, the AIDS crisis, \nnuclear proliferation, and many other international problems have \ncreated momentum in favor of constructive reforms at the U.N.\n  Secretary General Kofi Annan has proposed a substantial reform plan \nthat will provide a platform for further reform initiatives and \ndiscussions. The United States must be a leader in the effort to \nimprove the United Nations, particularly its accountability. At a time \nwhen the United States is appealing for greater international help in \nIraq, in Afghanistan, and in troubled spots around the world, a \ndiminishment of U.N. credibility because of scandal reduces United \nStates options and increases our own burdens.\n  Secretary Bolton has become closely associated with the U.S. efforts \nto reform the U.N. If he goes to the U.N. and helps achieve reform, the \nU.N. will gain in credibility, especially with the American people. If \nreform moves forward, Secretary Bolton will be in an excellent position \nto help convince skeptics that reform has occurred and that the United \nNations can be an effective partner in achieving global security. If we \nreject Secretary Bolton, President Bush's hand will be weakened at the \nU.N. We will recover, but we will have wasted time. And we will have \nstrengthened the position of reform opponents.\n  In the days immediately following Secretary Rice's March 7 \nannouncement of Secretary Bolton's nomination, most Democratic members \nof the Foreign Relations Committee expressed their opposition to the \nnomination on policy grounds. A March 8 Associated Press report states:\n\n       Almost immediately after Bolton's nomination was announced, \n     Democrats objected.\n\n  The March 8 edition of the Baltimore Sun said:\n\n       Reaction from Senate Democrats promised contentious \n     confirmation hearings for Bolton when he goes before the \n     Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n  In several cases, the statements by Democrats were unequivocal in \nopposition. In several other cases, statements were very negative, \nleaving open only the smallest of possibilities that the Senator would \nultimately support the nominee. In all of these cases, objections were \nbased on Secretary Bolton's supposed attitudes toward the United \nNations.\n  Senator Dodd said that Secretary Bolton's ``antipathy to the U.N. \nwill prevent him from effectively discharging his duties as our \nambassador.''\n  Senator Kerry said that the Bolton nomination was ``the most \ninexplicable appointment the President could make to represent the \nUnited States to the world community.''\n  Senator Boxer said of Secretary Bolton:\n\n       He's contemptuous of the U.N.\n\n  By March 31, still almost 2 weeks before the first Bolton hearings, a \nLos Angeles Times report noted:\n\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\n\n       Democrats are likely to vote unanimously against John R. \n     Bolton when his nomination to be United States ambassador to \n     the United Nations comes before the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee . . . according to Democratic and Republican \n     lawmakers and aides.\n\n  Senators have the right to oppose a nominee because of his \nsubstantive views and his past statements. However, it is important to \nacknowledge that the ethical inquiry into Secretary Bolton's background \nhas been pressed by Members who had planned to vote against him even \nbefore we began interviewing witnesses. They have the right to ask \nquestions, and the committee of jurisdiction has a responsibility to \nfollow up on credible allegations. But we should also understand that \nat times the inquiry has followed a more prosecutorial path than most \nnominees have had to endure.\n  Our committee staff has worked long and hard to run down the salvo of \nallegations that were levied at Secretary Bolton. The end result is \nthat many of the accusations have proven to be groundless or, at worst, \noverstated. New information has cast others in a different light. There \nis no doubt that Secretary Bolton has been blunt and combative in \ndefense of his perspectives. Indeed, this is one of the qualities that \nPresident Bush and Secretary Rice have cited as a reason for their \nselection of this nominee.\n\n  As I have said previously, Secretary Bolton's blunt style alienated \nsome colleagues. Our review showed that on several occasions he made \nincorrect assumptions about the behavior and motivations of \nsubordinates. A few other times he failed to use proper managerial \nchannels or unnecessarily personalized internal disputes. But there is \nno evidence that he has broken laws or engaged in serious ethical \nmisconduct. The picture is one of an assertive policymaker with an \nintense commitment to his missions--missions that, in fact, were \nsupported by President Bush.\n  With regard to the most serious charge, that Secretary Bolton sought \nto improperly manipulate intelligence, the insights we have gained do \nnot support the conclusion. He may have disagreed with intelligence \nfindings, but in the end he always accepted the final judgment of the \nintelligence community, and he always delivered speeches in their \ncleared form.\n  During this inquiry, there has been an implication that if the \nnominee challenged or opposed the conclusions of intelligence analysts, \nhe somehow committed an ethical violation. I think we need to be very \nprecise that arguing in favor of one's own reading of intelligence \nwithin the context of an internal policy debate is not wrongdoing. \nIntelligence reports are not sacrosanct. They involve interpretation. \nThey are intended to stimulate debate.\n  Many Senators participate in classified briefings. The word \n``briefing'' is a misnomer because, as Senators, we spend much of the \ntime during briefings questioning the panel. We probe to determine not \njust what analysts think but why they think it, and often we challenge \ntheir conclusions.\n  Earlier this year, for example, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee held a highly classified briefing on North Korea in which one \nof our members pointedly disputed the conclusions of the briefer. There \nwas a blunt exchange of views, and no resolution to this disagreement \nwas achieved. I am doubtful that any of us who have attended a good \nnumber of intelligence briefings have not done the same thing on \noccasion. My point is that the act of challenging or disputing \nintelligence conclusions is not in and of itself wrong.\n  Some have appeared shocked that Secretary Bolton might have \nchallenged intelligence conclusions or advanced alternative \ninterpretations, even though the same thing happens every day in \nmultiple departments and agencies. Congress has the benefit of \nsomething called the ``speech and debate clause.''\n  Article I, section 6 of the Constitution states that Members of \nCongress ``shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the \nPeace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session \nof their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the \nsame; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be \nquestioned in any other Place.''\n  The Founders put this extraordinary provision in the Constitution \nbecause they saw the value of debate. The context surrounding arguments \nwithin an administration over intelligence is different, but the \nprinciple is the same. Policymakers should be free to exert opinions \nand interpretations during the policymaking process. Clearly, there are \nlines that should not be crossed. Some may argue that Secretary Bolton \ncrossed these lines. But the proof is in the result. After fighting for \nhis interpretation, Secretary Bolton conformed to the clearance process \nand gave the speeches as they had been approved.\n  It has been charged that Secretary Bolton sought to retaliate in some \nway against analysts and others with whom he disagreed. Our inquiry \nlooked into these cases thoroughly, and in each one I believe the \nallegations are overstated.\n  In the case of Christian Westermann, the INR analyst whom the \ncommittee heard about from Carl Ford, the dispute was over a procedural \nissue, and Mr. Westermann continued in his job.\n  We should recall that the focus of Mr. Ford's complaint was that Mr. \nBolton should not have raised his objections directly with Mr. \nWestermann, not that Mr. Bolton was wrong to raise the issue. Our \nDemocratic colleagues last month made much of the fact that after this \nincident Secretary Powell had to go all the way down to INR to boost \nmorale. But we heard from Secretary Powell's chief of staff that such \nvisits were not uncommon. It was part of the Secretary's leadership \nstyle to visit with staff in the ``bowels of the building,'' including \nINR.\n  In the case of the NIO for Latin America, e-mails the committee staff \nhas viewed make it clear that Secretary Bolton's primary objection was \nover disparaging and inaccurate comments the analyst made to Members of \nCongress about a speech. Secretary Bolton took his complaint to the \nCIA. Although the NIO has said he feels his career was damaged by \nSecretary Bolton, his superiors fully backed him at the time, and other \nwitnesses have told the committee that if he did not get the promotions \nhe felt he deserved, it was for other reasons. Again, as far as \nSecretary Bolton was concerned, the dispute was procedural. There was \nno attempt to fabricate intelligence.\n  Other allegations related to managerial style show the same pattern \nupon examination--disagreement over procedure, not policy. In the case \nof Rexon Ryu, a mid-level civil servant in the non-proliferation bureau \nunder Secretary Bolton, no policy issues were involved at all. \nSecretary Bolton believed--incorrectly, according to Mr. Ryu's \nsupervisor--that Mr. Ryu had deliberately neglected to share \ninformation with Bolton's office. Some months later, Mr. Ryu was up for \na job that would have required him to work closely with Secretary \nBolton. Secretary Bolton, perhaps regrettably, expressed his opposition \nto working with Mr. Ryu. Mr. Ryu was given another prized post instead, \nan assignment to the deputy secretary.\n  The case of the State Department attorney, also raised by the other \nside, is even more off the mark. This attorney fully supported what \nSecretary Bolton wanted to do. It was only because of miscommunication \nthat Secretary Bolton thought the attorney had given out wrong \ninformation on a case involving sanctions against a Chinese company. \nThe State Department Legal Advisor, Will Taft, told our staff that he \nquickly straightened things out. The attorney stayed on the case, and \nhe even wrote the affidavit that Secretary Bolton later submitted to \ncourt.\n  Staff also looked at a new case that came up. Secretary Bolton's \nchief of staff, we learned, went to an INR analyst to complain that he \nhad inappropriately attached to a CIA document a cover memo that took \nexception to some of the CIA's findings regarding China. No action was \nsought against the analyst and none was taken. The issue was \nprocedural, no intelligence was manipulated, and Secretary Bolton was \nnot even directly involved, because he was out of the country at the \ntime.\n  Secretary Bolton's credibility has also been called into question \nregarding his testimony before our committee on April 11. Senator Biden \nquestioned whether Mr. Bolton really went to the CIA to learn about the \nNational Intelligence Council. Stuart Cohen, the acting head of the \nNIC, said that while he could not recall why Secretary\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\nBolton wanted to come, it was ``perfectly reasonable'' to believe that \nwas the reason. In fact, he added, ``I was delighted at the prospect \nthat somebody would come out wanting to know more about the NIC.'' He \nalso said that Secretary Bolton only talked about reassigning, not \nfiring, the NIO just as Mr. Bolton testified. Our investigation has \nfound nothing contrary to Secretary Bolton's claim that his dispute \nwith Mr. Westermann was over procedure, not policy.\n  Former Ambassador to South Korea, Thomas Hubbard, called the \ncommittee after Secretary Bolton's testimony about a controversial \nspeech he gave in South Korea. Secretary Bolton testified that \nAmbassador Hubbard had thanked him for the speech afterwards. The \nambassador told us he indeed had thanked Secretary Bolton afterwards, \nbut only for making certain changes in the speech that he had \nrequested. Ambassador Hubbard told our staff that he wanted to correct \nthe record on that point, but he was not accusing Secretary Bolton of \nbeing deliberately misleading.\n  That speech was one of several by Secretary Bolton that opponents of \nthe nomination have questioned. Our investigation showed that many of \nthese speeches and congressional testimony were preceded by strong \npolicy debates within the administration. As one witness told our \nstaff, ``That's how good policy is made.'' In each case we found that, \nin the end, Secretary Bolton delivered a speech that was properly \ncleared and that expressed official U.S. policy.\n  One of the most sensationalized accusations against Secretary Bolton \nis that 11 years ago, he chased a woman around a Moscow hotel throwing \nthings at her. This is problematic first because the behavior described \nseems so out of place. But secondly, because it has been very difficult \nfor our staffs, despite many hours of interviews on this matter, to \nascertain just what happened.\n  The woman, Melody Townsel, who lives in Dallas, admits that she is a \nliberal Democrat who worked for Mothers Opposing Bush in the last \nelection. Ms. Townsel also told our staffs that her original \naccusation, contained in a letter that was made public, may have been \ntoo strong in some places. She said: `` `Chasing' may not be the best \nword.'' What she meant was that Secretary Bolton would approach her \nwhenever he saw her at the hotel where they were both staying because, \nas she describes it, she did not want to meet with him over a legal \nmatter. It is important to remember that Secretary Bolton was a private \nlawyer at that time. He was not representing the U.S. Government. He \nwas working for a company against which Ms. Townsel had made some very \nserious charges--charges which proved unfounded--that could have cost \nhis company an important USAID contract in the former Soviet Union.\n  Ms. Townsel provided no eyewitnesses to the incidents, which are said \nto have occurred in public or open areas of the hotel. Moreover, \nalthough she claimed this was a highly traumatic encounter and that she \ntold several people about it, staff had difficulty finding others who \nknew about it. Three people whom Ms. Townsel identified as having heard \nher complaints at the time of the events told staff that they had no \nrecollection of Ms. Townsel mentioning Mr. Bolton. Her boss, Charles \nBlack, of Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly, who hired her for the post, \nsaid she never mentioned it to him. Neither did her immediate \nsupervisor back in Washington. An employee of a sister company who \nassisted Ms. Townsel in making her charges against the prime contractor \non her project and with whom she said she was in close touch at the \ntime, also knows nothing about it. Staffs talked to three \nrepresentatives of the contractor, a small Virginia firm which has long \nexperience working for USAID overseas. Those officials also heard \nnothing about this encounter. They said that Secretary Bolton was in \nMoscow at that time, but he was working as a consultant for a health \nproject they were involved in, not doing legal work for them. We did \nfind one of her friends and co-workers from that time, who was not in \nMoscow, who recalls talking with her by telephone about it, as well as \na subordinate of hers in a later USAID-funded project who recalls her \nmentioning it.\n  Ultimately, Ms. Townsel went on to another USAID project in the \nformer Soviet Union, and the company she accused of mismanagement was \nawarded more USAID contracts and continues to be well regarded.\n  The original charge against Secretary Bolton is uncorroborated and \noverstated. On the basis of what we do know, there is nothing to offset \nSecretary Bolton's long record of public service in several \nadministrations. It has been charged that collectively the allegations \nagainst Secretary Bolton form an unacceptable pattern of behavior. This \nis an unfortunate argument by opponents because it depends on doubts \narising from an intense investigation of accusations, many of which had \nno substantiation. By its nature, it also discounts the dozens of \npositive testimonials on Secretary Bolton's behalf from former \ncoworkers who attest to his character and his effectiveness.\n  We need to think clearly about the context of the allegations leveled \nagainst Secretary Bolton. First, this has been an extremely public \ninquiry. By its nature, it has encouraged anyone with a grudge or \ndisagreement with Secretary Bolton, stretching back to 1983, to come \nforward and tell their story. There have been no thematic limits on the \nallegations that opponents of the nominee have asked to be \ninvestigated.\n  I simply submit that no one working in Washington in high-ranking \npositions for that long would come out unscathed from such a process. \nAny assertive policymaker will develop opponents based on stylistic \ndifferences, personal disputes, or partisan disagreements. Most Members \nof the Senate have been in public life for decades. If we were \nnominated for a similar position of responsibility after our terms in \nthe Senate, how many of us would want the same standard to be applied \nto our confirmation process? How many of us would want any instance of \nconflict or anger directed at our staffs or our colleagues to be fair \ngame?\n  Second, as mentioned, the oldest allegation dates back all the way to \n1983. Thus, we are subjecting 22 years of Secretary Bolton's career to \na microscope. This included service in many Government jobs, as well as \ntime spent in the private sector. Given the length of John Bolton's \nservice in high-ranking positions, it is inevitable he would have a \nconflict with coworkers of various ranks and political persuasions. He \nwould have had literally thousands of contacts, meetings, and issues to \ndeal with during his career. In this context, the volume of alleged \nincidents is not that profound.\n  Third, in John Bolton's case, unsubstantiated charges may seem more \nmaterial than they are because he has a reputation for being an \naggressive and blunt negotiator. But this should not be a disqualifying \nfactor, especially for posts that historically have included a number \nof blunt, plain-spoken individuals, including Jeane Kirkpatrick and our \nformer colleague, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. In fact, President Bush has \ncited John Bolton's direct style as one of the reasons he has picked \nhim for this particular job.\n  It is easy to say any inquiry into any allegation is justified if we \nare pursuing the truth, but as Senators who are frequently called upon \nto pass judgment on nominees, we know reality is more complicated than \nthat. We want to ensure that nominees are qualified, skilled, honest, \nand open.\n  Clearly, we should pursue credible reports of wrongdoing, but in \ndoing so, we should understand that there can be human and \norganizational costs if the inquiry is not focused and fair.\n  We have all witnessed quality nominees who have had to endure a \ncontentious nomination process that opened them up to any charge \nleveled from any direction. Both Republicans and Democrats have been \nguilty of employing prosecutorial tactics to oppose nominees with whom \nthey did not agree. Some would say that nominees are fair game. If they \naccept appointment, they enter the public arena where no quarter will \nbe given. But we need capable people who are willing to serve our \nGovernment and the American people.\n  Among all the other qualifications, it seems we have required \nnominees to subject themselves and their families to partisan scrutiny. \nThis has implications well beyond this current nomination.\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\n  Our Democratic colleagues have recognized this fact when they have \ndefended Democratic nominees in the past. With respect to one nominee \nin October 1993, Senator Biden said:\n\n       The Senate does nothing to fulfill its responsibility to \n     advice and consent on Presidential nominations and does \n     nothing to enhance its reputation as the world's greatest \n     deliberative body by entertaining a long and disagreeable \n     litany of past policy disagreements, nor by entertaining \n     anonymous and probably false allegations.\n\n  With regard to a troubled 1999 nomination, Senator Dodd quite \ninsightfully stated:\n\n       I am one, Mr. Chairman, who worries deeply about our \n     ability to attract the best our society can produce to serve \n     our country. It is not easy to submit yourselves and your \n     families to the kind of public scrutiny that a nomination \n     of this magnitude involves. We have got to sort out some \n     ways in which we can go through this process without \n     making it so discouraging to people that those who watch \n     the process who think one day they might like to serve \n     their country will be discouraged from doing so in any \n     administration, and I am deeply worried that if we do not \n     get a better handle on this, that will be the net result \n     of what we accomplish.\n\n  Senator Dodd also provided comments for a March 1, 1997, Washington \nPost article about the travails of a different nominee. He said:\n\n       It's getting harder and harder to get good people to serve \n     in government. Advice and consent does not have to be abuse.\n\n  In an investigation of this type, we constantly have to ask, where do \nyou draw the line? Where does legitimate due diligence turn into \npartisanship? Where does the desire for the truth turn into a \ncompetition over who wins and who loses? Not every line of the inquiry \nis justified by our curiosity or even our suspicions.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has focused a great deal of energy \nexamining several accusations against the nominee. This may leave some \nobservers with the false impression that John Bolton's service has been \ndominated by discord and conflict. We need to acknowledge that a great \nmany officials with whom he has worked have endorsed him and many \nsubordinates have attested to his managerial character. I would like to \ncite just a few of the comments received by the committee in support of \nSecretary Bolton.\n  Former Secretaries of State James Baker, Larry Eagleburger, Alexander \nHaig, Henry Kissinger, and George Shultz, former Secretaries of Defense \nFrank Carlucci and James Schlesinger, former Ambassadors Jeane \nKirkpatrick and Max Kampelman, former National Security Adviser Richard \nAllen, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Director Kenneth \nAdelman, former Assistant Secretary of State David Abshire and former \nDepartment of State Counselor Helmut Sonnenfeldt strongly endorsed \nSecretary Bolton in a letter to the committee. They said:\n\n       It is a moment when we must have an ambassador in place \n     whose knowledge, experience, dedication and drive will be \n     vital to protecting the American interest in an effective, \n     forward-looking United Nations. . . . Secretary Bolton, like \n     the administration, has his critics of course. Anyone as \n     energetic and effective as John [Bolton] is bound to \n     encounter those who disagree with some or even all of the \n     administration's policies. But the policies for which he is \n     sometimes criticized are those of the President and the \n     Department of State which he has served with loyalty, \n     honor and distinction.\n\n  Andrew Natsios, the current USAID administrator and M. Peter \nMcPherson, a former USAID administrator, along with 37 officials who \nworked with John Bolton during his year at USAID wrote:\n\n       We know John to be a forceful policy advocate who both \n     encourages and learns from rigorous debate. We know him to be \n     a man of balanced judgment. And we know him to have a sense \n     of humor, even about himself. John leads from in front with \n     courage and conviction--especially positive qualities, we \n     believe, for the assignment he is being asked to take on. He \n     is tough but fair. He does not abuse power or people. John is \n     direct, yet thoughtful in his communication. He is highly \n     dedicated, working long hours in a never-ending quest to \n     maximize performance. Yet he does not place undue time \n     demands on his staff, recognizing their family obligations. \n     What he does demand from his staff is personal honesty and \n     intellectual clarity.\n\n  Another letter from former Attorneys General Ed Meese and Dick \nThornburgh; former Governors William Weld and Frank Keating; former \ncounsels to the President C. Boyden Gray and Arthur Culvahouse Jr.; and \n39 other distinguished Officials stated:\n\n       Each of us has worked with Mr. Bolton. We know him to be a \n     man of personal and intellectual integrity, deeply devoted to \n     the service of this country and the promotion of our foreign \n     policy interests as established by this President and \n     Congress. Not one of us has ever witnessed conduct on his \n     part that resembles that which has been alleged. We feel our \n     collective knowledge of him and what he stands for, combined \n     with our own experiences in government and in the private \n     sector, more than counterbalances the credibility of those \n     who have tried to destroy the distinguished achievements of a \n     lifetime.\n\n  Another letter came from 21 former officials who worked with John \nBolton in his capacity as Assistant Secretary of State for \nInternational Organization Affairs. It states:\n\n       Despite what has been said and written in the last few \n     weeks, John has never sought to damage the United Nations or \n     its mission. Quite the contrary--under John's leadership the \n     organization was properly challenged to fulfill its original \n     charter. John's energy and innovation transformed IO from a \n     State Department backwater into a highly appealing work place \n     in which individuals could effectively articulate and advance \n     U.S. policy and their own careers as well.\n\n  A letter also arrived from 43 of John Bolton's former colleagues at \nthe American Enterprise Institute. It stated:\n\n       As we have followed the strange allegations suddenly \n     leveled at Mr. Bolton in recent days and reflected among \n     ourselves on our own experiences with him, we have come to \n     realize how much we learned from him, and how deep and \n     lasting were his contributions. . . . Contrary to the \n     portrayals of his accusers, he combines a temperate \n     disposition, good spirit, and utter honesty with his well-\n     known attributes of exceptional intelligence and intensity of \n     purpose. This is a rare combination and, we would think, \n     highly desirable for an American ambassador to the United \n     Nations.\n\n  Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wrote in a recent \nletter to Secretary Bolton:\n\n       To combine, as you do, clarity of thought, courtesy of \n     expression and an unshakeable commitment to justice is rare \n     in any walk of life. But it is particularly so in \n     international affairs. A capacity for straight talking rather \n     than peddling half-truths is a strength and not a \n     disadvantage in diplomacy. Particularly in the case of a \n     great power like America, it is essential that people know \n     where you stand and assume that you mean what you say. With \n     you at the UN, they will do both. Those same qualities are \n     also required for any serious reform at the United Nations \n     itself, without which cooperation between nations to defend \n     and extend liberty will be far more difficult.\n\n  During consideration of the Bolton nomination, we have spent a good \ndeal of time scrutinizing individual conversations and incidents that \nhappened several years ago. Regardless of how each Senator plans to \nvote, we should not lose sight of the larger national security issues \nconcerning UN reform and international diplomacy that are central to \nthis nomination.\n  The President has tapped Secretary Bolton to undertake this urgent \nmission. Secretary Bolton has affirmed his commitment to fostering a \nstrong United Nations. He has expressed his intent to work hard to \nsecure greater international support at the UN for the national \nsecurity and foreign policy objectives of the United States. He has \nstated his belief in decisive American leadership at the UN, and \nunderscored that an effective United Nations is very much in the \ninterest of U.S. national security.\n  I believe that the President deserves to have his nominee represent \nhim at the United Nations. I am hopeful that we will vote to send this \nnominee to the United Nations without further delay and with a maximum \namount of enthusiactic support.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that quorum calls \nbe charged equally against both sides for the duration of the debate on \nthe Bolton nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to state what is obvious to \nthe Chair and my colleagues, that I will oppose the nomination of John \nBolton to be U.S. representative to the United Nations. I regret, \nfrankly, we are even debating this nomination while the administration \ncontinues to withhold relevant material about Mr. Bolton that the \ncommittee has requested, and for which no reasonable explanation has \nbeen given as to why it has not been provided other than they do not \nthink the information is ``relevant'' to our inquiry. I will return to \nthat issue later today.\n  The job to which Mr. Bolton has been nominated is one of the most \nimportant ambassadorships the President fills. It is, in fact, the most \nimportant one. In the past, it has often held Cabinet rank. Leading \nfigures of their day have held that job, people such as Republican \nHenry Cabot Lodge, Democrat Adlai Stevenson, President George Herbert \nWalker Bush, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Richard \nHolbrooke, Senator Jack Danforth. Aside from the President and the \nSecretary of State, the U.N. ambassador is the best known face of \nAmerican diplomacy.\n  It is a job that in my view requires a person with diplomatic \ntemperament, a person willing to listen to other points of view, and \nblessed with the power to be able to persuade, such as President Bush's \nfather George Herbert Walker Bush was.\n  It is a job that requires a person of great credibility, such as \nGovernor Adlai Stevenson.\n  It is a job that requires a person who is not an ideologue, such as \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who served a Republican \nPresident as ambassador to the United Nations.\n  And it is a job, in my view, that requires a person who has the \ncomplete confidence of the President of the United States and Secretary \nof State, such as Jeane Kirkpatrick did.\n  Mr. Bolton is not that person. He is no diplomat, as evidenced by his \ncontempt for opposing views and his inability or unwillingness to \nlisten. His credibility is in grave doubt, as evidenced by his repeated \nefforts to distort facts to fit preformed views. He is an ideologue--a \nbright ideologue, but nonetheless an ideologue, as evidenced by his \nlong record both in and out of Government. And he lacks the trust and \nconfidence of his superiors, as evidenced by the fact that the \nSecretary of State has felt the need to assure Senators in this Chamber \nthat Mr. Bolton will be ``closely supervised.'' As one of our \ncolleagues said, why in the Lord's name would you send someone to the \nUnited Nations who had to be ``closely supervised?''\n\n  The job of U.N. ambassador is important, to state the obvious, \nbecause of the many challenges the United States confronts in the year \n2005. I would argue it is a more important post than at any time since \n1962 and the Cuban missile crisis. We confront a monumental threat by \nradical Islamic fundamentalists bent on destroying America and our \nallies. We confront a radical regime in North Korea and a theocracy in \nIran that seek nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. We \nconfront the challenge of building democratic states in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, two countries that have known mostly dictatorship and \nsuffering for generations. We confront the challenges of the AIDS \npandemic, war and humanitarian catastrophes across the African \ncontinent, and the threat of instability in every continent.\n  Despite our vast economic and military power we cannot--or I should \nsay more appropriately, we need not--face these challenges alone. \nAmerica's security is enhanced when we work with our allies, and the \nUnited Nations is one of the places we can find them. Our security is \nenhanced when even those who are not considered our allies understand \nthat the threat that we are concerned about is common to all of us, to \nthem as well as us, to almost all nation states.\n  For better or worse, the United Nations is an essential forum for the \nadvancement of U.S. foreign policy and national security interests in \nthe year 2005--a troublesome forum but in fact a necessary forum. For \nbetter or worse, the U.N. Security Council makes decisions that affect \ninternational security and stability. Granted, they cannot make any \ndecision without the United States signing off--we can veto it--but \nthey have the ability to isolate us instead of isolating those who \nshould be isolated.\n  For better or worse, the United Nations provides a means for the \nUnited States to gain international support for difficult missions it \nseeks to undertake, not only in our interest but in the interest of \nothers, allowing us to share the cost and burdens with others and not \nput it all on the back of the American taxpayer.\n  The United Nations is not perfect, as the Presiding Officer well \nknows--far from it. It needs significant reform--again as the Presiding \nOfficer knows. But let's not equate reform of the United Nations with \nJohn Bolton, as some of our colleagues have attempted to do. We have, \nunder the leadership of Jesse Helms and with my help, passed the Helms-\nBiden legislation reforming portions of the United Nations. Much more \nneeds to be done.\n  I would note that when we had John Danforth, an incredibly well \nrespected ambassador, up until a couple of months ago, and before him \nMr. Negroponte, there was not all this talk about the primary \nresponsibility being reform. They were fully capable of dealing with \nreform.\n\n  I would point out that not even the Secretary of State, Condoleezza \nRice, believes John Bolton is necessary for reforming the United \nNations. Four days after the Bolton nomination was announced, Dr. Rice \nappointed another person, Dr. Shirin Tahir-Kheli, ``to serve as the \nSecretary's senior advisor and chief interlocutor on United Nations \nreform.'' The State Department press release announcing the appointment \nmade no mention of Mr. Bolton.\n  Mr. Bolton was not picked because his job was United Nations reform. \nThat is the job of every U.S. ambassador to the U.N., or part of the \njob. No, this debate is not about U.N. reform or U.N. interests; it is \nabout whether the appointment of Mr. Bolton is in the national \ninterests of the United States of America. I firmly believe, as my \nfriend from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, does, that it is not in the U.S. \ninterests.\n  There are four reasons to vote no on Mr. Bolton. Each, standing \nalone, in my view, would justify a negative vote, but taken together \nthey provide an overwhelming case. What is even more extraordinary is \nthat much of the evidence for this case comes from senior officials in \nthe Bush administration who worked with Mr. Bolton. The bulk of the \nevidence to make the cases I am about to make came from senior \nRepublican administration officials who worked with Mr. Bolton. They \nhad nothing to gain and a good deal to lose by appearing before our \ncommittee, but everyone came voluntarily. No one had to be subpoenaed. \nWe asked and they came.\n  The first reason Mr. Bolton should, in my view, be denied the \nambassadorship to the United Nations is that Mr. Bolton repeatedly \nsought to remove intelligence analysts who disagreed with him. Mr. \nBolton was not content to fight the normal policy battles. He had to \ncrush people, even if they were just doing their jobs.\n  One analyst was Christian Westermann, an expert on biological and \nchemical weapons with a 20-year career in the U.S. Navy who worked in \nthe State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research after \nretiring from the U.S. military.\n  In February of 2002, Mr. Westermann was asked by Mr. Bolton's staff, \nwhich is standard operating procedure, to begin the intelligence \ncommunity clearance process for three sentences that Mr. Bolton wanted \nto put in a speech about the biological weapons effort of Cuba. The \nspeech was not made\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\nyet; the speech was in the making. What is a normal operating procedure \nin this State Department, the last State Department, and the ones \nbefore that, is that when a policymaker wishes to include in a speech \nintelligence data or assertions that the U.S. government or the \nintelligence community believes thus and so, it has to be cleared first \nby the intelligence community.\n  Mr. Westermann, the State Department's intelligence analyst for \nbiological weapons, had two roles in this process of clearing these \nthree sentences. One was to transmit the material to a clearance \ncoordinator at the CIA who would then seek clearance from all the other \nintelligence agencies in the Government--Defense Intelligence, et \ncetera, a whole panoply of the intelligence community. The second \nfunction Mr. Westermann had as the intelligence officer at the State \nDepartment for biological weapons was to provide the substantive \ncomments of his Bureau--that is, INR--on Mr. Bolton's text to this \nclearance coordinator; in other words, in addition to what the other \nintelligence agencies thought about these three sentences, to say what \nthe intelligence analysts in the State Department thought about these \nthree sentences.\n  In performing that latter function, Mr. Westermann proposed \nalternative language to the three sentences submitted by Mr. Bolton's \nstaff, a standard means of trying to help a policymaker say something \nabout classified matters so that the sources and methods are not \ncompromised and so that the statement is consistent with the \nintelligence community's judgments on that point being spoken to. When \nMr. Bolton found out that Mr. Westermann suggested alternative \nlanguage, he hit the roof. He summoned Mr. Westermann to his office and \ngave him a tongue lashing.\n  Look, Mr. Westermann does not work directly for Mr. Bolton. There is \nwithin the State Department Mr. Bolton's operation, the people who work \ndirectly for him, and then there is the intelligence operation, INR, \nheaded at the time by a guy named Carl Ford. At the bottom of the food \nchain is the guy in charge of biological weapons as an intelligence \nanalyst; that is, Mr. Westermann.\n  Mr. Bolton summoned Mr. Westermann into his office and, according to \nMr. Westermann, Bolton was ``red faced'' and yelling at him. When Mr. \nWestermann tried to explain what he had done, Mr. Bolton threw him out \nof his office.\n  Then, over the course of the next 6 months, Mr. Bolton tried on three \nseparate occasions to have Mr. Westermann removed from his position. \nDuring the committee hearing, Mr. Bolton grudgingly conceded that he \nsought to remove Mr. Westermann from his portfolio, but he tried to \nminimize his involvement. Mr. Bolton suggested that he asked one of Mr. \nWestermann's supervisors to give Mr. Westermann a new portfolio, but \nthen, he said, ``I shrugged my shoulders and moved on.'' But the \nevidence is clear that Mr. Bolton did not, as he said, ``move on.'' He \ntried twice more to remove Mr. Westermann, the biological weapons \nexpert. A few days later, he tried to remove him, and then several \nmonths later.\n  My friend from Indiana--and as we say here, he is my friend--argues \nthis does not matter. Mr. Westermann kept his job, no harm, no foul--my \nwords. But the system had to work overtime to counteract the harmful \neffects of this episode. Don't take my word for it. Listen to Carl \nFord, the former Assistant Secretary of State for INR, who says he \nsupports the President and, in his words, is a huge fan of Vice \nPresident Cheney, and not anyone who has ever been accused of being a \nliberal Democrat.\n\n  Mr. Ford testified that the analysts in his Bureau were ``very \nnegatively affected by this incident--they were scared.'' Ford said \nthat after the Westermann incident, he tried to make the best of a bad \nsituation by using the incident as a training vehicle to explain to his \npeople how to handle similar situations if they came up. At Ford's \nrequest, Secretary Powell made a special trip to speak to the INR \nanalysts, where Mr. Powell singled out Mr. Westermann and told the \nanalysts they should continue to ``speak truth to power.'' They had to \ndo this because Mr. Bolton was allergic to people delivering news that \nhis proposed language was not supported by the evidence.\n  As one of Mr. Westermann's supervisors recounted, Mr. Bolton declared \n``he wasn't going to be told what he could say by a mid-level munchkin \nanalyst.'' At the U.N., the special representative has to listen to a \nlot of people who disagree with him and then report back faithfully on \nwhat they are saying. Is Mr. Bolton capable of doing that?\n  The second analyst Mr. Bolton tried to remove from his position is a \nmore remarkable case for two reasons: The analyst worked in another \nagency; and his portfolio did not involve Mr. Bolton's area of \nresponsibility, which was arms control and weapons of mass destruction.\n  The analyst was the National Intelligence Officer for Latin America. \nHe disputed language on Cuba that was used in a speech Mr. Bolton had \ngiven, and that he then wanted to give again in congressional \ntestimony.\n  During the committee hearing, Mr. Bolton again tried to minimize his \nactions, stating that his effort to remove this individual was ``one \npart of one conversation with one person, one time . . . and that was \nit, I let it go.''\n  The evidence shows that he did not let it go but, rather, that he and \nhis staff actively discussed the removal of this National Intelligence \nOfficer over the course of 4 months.\n  In early June of 2002, an aide to Mr. Bolton circulated a draft \nletter from Mr. Bolton and Ambassador Otto Reich, Assistant Secretary \nof State for Latin America. The draft was addressed to Director of \nCentral Intelligence Agency, Mr. George Tenet.\n  The draft letter urged the immediate replacement of the National \nIntelligence Officer and indicated that Bolton and Reich would take \nseveral measures on their own, including banning the National \nIntelligence Officer from official meetings at the State Department and \nfrom official travel in the Western Hemisphere.\n  A response to the e-mail from a colleague reported that he discussed \nthe same matter with Mr. Bolton, whom he said ``would prefer at this \npoint to handle this in person with [Mr.] Tenet.''\n  The following month--again, going to the issue of whether he tried to \nget this guy removed--Mr. Bolton traveled to the CIA headquarters to \nmeet with Mr. Stuart Cohen, the Acting Chairman of the National \nIntelligence Council, where he asked that the National Intelligence \nOfficer be removed from his position.\n  Mr. Cohen, the Acting Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, \nsaid he did not remember many details about the meeting with Mr. Bolton \nother than Mr. Bolton's intent was clear: He wanted the National \nIntelligence Officer for Latin America removed.\n  Later that month--again, remember, Mr. Bolton said: I did not try to \nget this guy. I let it alone--a senior aide to Mr. Bolton told a senior \naide to Mr. Reich that Bolton wanted to meet Reich to ``discuss the \ndraft letter to CIA on our favorite subject'' and said that ``John \ndoesn't want this to slip any further.''\n  The next day, the same aide to Mr. Bolton e-mailed Secretary Reich \nand his aide and had a new draft to the letter. He said that the draft \n``relies on John's tough talk with [Mr.] Cohen ``about the national \nintelligence officers.\n  So much for not trying to get him removed.\n  Two months later, in September, another draft letter urging the \nremoval of the National Intelligence Officer was exchanged between Mr. \nBolton's office and Mr. Reich's office.\n  Now, does that sound like he ``let it go,'' as he said he did? \nRemember, his staff said Mr. Bolton said he doesn't want to let this \nmatter ``slip any further.'' If you ask me, this was more than ``one \npart of one conversation . . . one time,'' as Mr. Bolton said. It was a \ncampaign, a vendetta, against a person Mr. Bolton had never met and \nwhose work Mr. Bolton acknowledges he cannot recall ever reading, all \nbecause he questioned Mr. Bolton.\n  If this is how Mr. Bolton reacts to someone he has never met, how \nwill he control himself in New York? Secretary Rice, the Secretary of \nState, told the Senator from Ohio that Mr. Bolton will be ``closely \nsupervised.''\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\nHow much energy at the State Department will be diverted to supervising \nMr. Bolton?\n  Thankfully, senior management at CIA had the good sense to rebuff Mr. \nBolton's attempts to remove the National Intelligence Officer. The \nformer Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, John McLaughlin, \nremembers that when the issue was raised with him, he adamantly \nrejected it. Here is what the Deputy Director of the CIA said:\n\n       Well, we're not going to do that, absolutely not. No way. \n     End of story.\n\n  Mr. McLaughlin, at the CIA, explained why he so strongly opposed Mr. \nBolton's proposal to get rid of this national intelligence officer. And \nI quote from Mr. McLaughlin, formerly at the CIA:\n\n       It's perfectly all right for a policymaker to express \n     disagreement with an . . . analyst, and it's perfectly all \n     right for them to . . . challenge their work vigorously. But \n     I think it's different to then request, because of the \n     disagreement, that the person be transferred. And . . . \n     unless there is malfeasance involved here--and, in this case, \n     I had high regard for the individual's work; therefore, I had \n     a strong negative reaction to the suggestion about moving \n     him.\n\n  He is speaking of the National Intelligence Officer.\n  That, all by itself, is reason to vote against Mr. Bolton--thoroughly \noutrageous conduct as it related to two intelligence officers who \ndisagreed with him.\n  A second reason to oppose Mr. Bolton is that he frequently sought to \nstretch the intelligence--the available intelligence--to say things in \nspeeches and in testimony that the intelligence community would not \nsupport. The committee report lays out this allegation in extensive \ndetail, and it is there for every Senator to see. There is ample \nevidence that Mr. Bolton sought to cherry-pick, as one analyst said, \ncherry-pick intelligence; sought to game the system, to get the \nclearances he wanted, or simply sought to intimidate intelligence \nanalysts to get them to say what he wanted.\n  Again, don't take my word for it. Take the word of an administration \nappointee, Mr. Robert Hutchings, the Chairman of the National \nIntelligence Council from 2003 to 2004. Chairman Hutchings said, in the \nsummer of 2003, that Mr. Bolton prepared a speech on Syria and weapons \nof mass destruction that ``struck me as going well beyond . . . where \nthe evidence would legitimately take us. And that was the judgment of \nthe experts on my staff, as well.''\n  Now, remember, this is 2003. We had 160,000 troops in Iraq and in \nAfghanistan. There was all kinds of talk on the floor of the Senate and \nin the Nation about whether we would invade Syria next. There was all \nkinds of discussion and supposition that the weapons of mass \ndestruction that were never found in Iraq--and we later learned had not \nexisted after 1991 or 1995--had been smuggled, for hiding, into Syria. \nIt was a very delicate moment, in which if, in fact, a senior \nadministration official came forward and said there was evidence that \nthere was a nuclear weapons program in Syria, we might have had a war.\n  Mr. Bolton wanted to make a speech about that, and here is the guy \nwho headed up the National Intelligence Council, the chairman. He said \nthat what Bolton wanted to say ``struck me as going well beyond . . . \nwhere the evidence would legitimately take us. And that was the \njudgment of the experts on my staff, as well.''\n  This is not minor stuff. I remind the American people and my \ncolleagues that an awful lot of Senators voted to go to war in Iraq on \nthe assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, which now the \nadministration itself acknowledges they did not have. Mr. Bolton, \naccording to the chairman of the National Intelligence Council, wanted \nto say things about Syria and weapons of mass destruction that struck \nhim and his experts as going beyond what could legitimately be stated.\n  Chairman Hutchings said that Bolton took ``isolated facts and made \nmuch more of them to build a case than I thought the intelligence \nwarranted.''\n  Does that sound familiar to you? Remember aluminum tubes, offered by \nthe Vice President as evidence that Iraq had a gas centrifuge system, \nhad reconstituted their nuclear capability, when, in fact, the most \ninformed elements of the intelligence community said those tubes--\nbecause they were anodized--couldn't be used for a gas centrifuge \nsystem? Facts taken out of context to make a case that didn't exist got \nus into war prematurely.\n  Here we now have Mr. Bolton, when people are talking about going to \nwar with Syria, and the head of the National Intelligence Council says \nMr. Bolton took ``isolated facts and made much more of them to build a \ncase than I thought the intelligence warranted. It was a sort of \ncherry-picking of little factoids and little isolated bits that were \ndrawn out to present the starkest-possible case.''\n  Let me take you back to aluminum tubes, out of context, an isolated \nfact, drawn out to present the starkest possible case that Iraq had \n``reconstituted its nuclear capability.''\n  There used to be an expression my dad used to say in World War II: \nLoose lips sink ships. Cherry-picking little factoids and little \nisolated bits drawn out to present the starkest-possible case can cause \nwars.\n  Listen to Larry Wilkinson, who served as Secretary of State Colin \nPowell's Chief of Staff, a military man himself. He told us that \nbecause of the problems that the State Department was having with Mr. \nBolton's speeches not always being properly cleared by the State \nDepartment offices and officials--think of this now, the Chief of \nStaff, a military man himself, I think a colonel, working for the \nformer chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then Secretary of State, \nsaid that because Mr. Bolton didn't properly clear his speeches with \nthe appropriate authorities and experts within the State Department--\nthe Deputy Secretary of State, the No. 2 man, Secretary Armitage ``made \na decision that John Bolton would not give any testimony, nor would he \ngive any speech that wasn't cleared first by Rich [Armitage].''\n  Think of that. Here is the guy, head of the arms control and \nnonproliferation piece of the President's operation at the State \nDepartment who needs, as much as anyone, classified information and \naccurate intelligence, and he has to be told by the No. 2 man at the \nState Department that he is no longer authorized to make any speech \nwithout it first being cleared by the No. 2 man at the State \nDepartment. I don't do that with my senior staff. I don't have to. It \nis truly remarkable.\n  This may have occurred with one of the six other Presidents with whom \nI have served since I have been here, but if it has, I am unaware of \nit, and I would like to know.\n  Powell's Chief of Staff later told the New York Times, referring to \nwhat I just talked about--restrictions that Mr. Bolton could not make a \nspeech without it being cleared by the No. 2 man at the State \nDepartment--that ``if anything, the [restrictions] got more stringent'' \nas time went on. ``No one else''--I assume he means in the entire State \nDepartment--``was subjected to these tight restrictions.''\n  Consider this: we have the chairman of the National Intelligence \nOrganization, the Chief of Staff for the President, Secretary of State, \nthe former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, the former head of \nan office within the CIA named Mr. Cohen, and the former head of the \nintelligence apparatus at the State Department--all of them, nary a \nDemocratic appointee in the crowd, pointing out how Mr. Bolton \noverreached, cherry-picked, had to be disciplined, had to be overruled, \nhad to be supervised. And here Mr. Bolton was, an Assistant Secretary \nof State, and we want to send him now to the No. 2 job in diplomacy \nafter the Secretary of State?\n  Listen to Mr. Bolton's own loyal staff. After being told that the \nintelligence community could not support a statement Mr. Bolton wanted \nto make on Cuba, a member of Mr. Bolton's staff wrote to a CIA official \nand said that ``several heavy hitters are involved in this one, and \nthey may choose to push ahead over the objections of the CIA and INR . \n. . unless there is a serious source and methods concern.''\n  We have all been around here. Let's translate that. This is Mr. \nBolton's staff writing to a CIA official, when CIA is telling Mr. \nBolton that he cannot say what he wants to say. Mr. Bolton's staff \nwrites to the CIA official who said Mr. Bolton could not do that:\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\n``Several heavy hitters are involved in this one.''\n  I am sure no staff on the floor of the Senate could possibly be \nintimidated to maybe reconsider a recommendation they made if, in fact, \nthe Chief of Staff of the majority leader or the minority leader, or \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, or the ranking member sent \nout an e-mail or a letter to them saying: Look, Jack, I know what you \nsaid, but let me tell you something, there are several heavy hitters \nhere who may go beyond you. Translated: Are you sure you want to say he \ncannot do this? You would have had to have your head in a rain barrel \nfor the past 20 years not to understand what the message was that was \nbeing communicated.\n  Mr. Bolton's staff was saying that Mr. Bolton might make statements \nin the name of the Government, or at least with the claim that they \nwere supported by U.S. intelligence, despite the analysts' views that \nthese statements were not justifiably based on the evidence. That is \nmore than mere arrogance. It suggests a willingness to defraud the \nAmerican people, and it suggests that there is a price that will be \npaid by you, you not-so-senior person, if you raise a ruckus about \nthis.\n  That e-mail I described was not a one-time event. Mr. Bolton's staff \nlater informed the intelligence community that they wanted to change \nthe rules for reviewing proposed speeches to limit their objections to \nonly those objections related to sources and method.\n  Let me translate that. I see my friend from Maryland on the floor. If \nhe were an intelligence officer in the United States government who \nfound out that another country was supporting an al-Qaida undertaking \nand my friend from Maryland was a CIA operative in that other country, \nif I were to expose the fact that that country was cooperating with the \nCIA, I might inadvertently disclose who the source of that intelligence \nis and, by doing so, maybe get my friend killed. Or if that information \nis picked up by a bugging device placed in a meeting room, if I were to \nsay on the floor that we have a recording saying that Official A of \nCountry A met with al-Qaida, clearly, they might be able to figure out \nhow we knew that, what the method of picking up the information was.\n  So we are very fastidious in this Senate--those of us who deal with \nintelligence matters--not to ever reveal a source or a method, and even \nthough the information revealed may not be so classified that we are \ntold by the Agency you cannot say this for fear of revealing a source \nor a method of picking up this information, we do not disclose it.\n  There is a second type of intelligence, and that is the intelligence \nanalysis that says: Syria does not have nuclear weapons. That is an \nanalysis by experts in our intelligence community who reached the \nconclusion, from all kinds of sources and methods, that Syria doesn't \nhave nuclear weapons, if that were the conclusion.\n  Now, Mr. Bolton had been stopped repeatedly by various intelligence \nagencies from saying things that the intelligence did not support. I am \nmaking this up. Let's assume Mr. Bolton wanted to say that Syria has \nnuclear weapons and the CIA analysis says it doesn't. Under the present \nrules, CIA can say to Mr. Bolton that he cannot say that. So what does \nMr. Bolton do? He goes back and says to the intelligence community, \nthrough his staff, we want to change the rule. You cannot tell me, I \nsay to my friend from Maryland, what I can say about whether or not \nthey have nuclear weapons. I can say they do, even though you say they \ndon't.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. First, let me finish this point. But, his staff says, you \ncan tell Mr. Bolton he cannot say it only if it will reveal a source or \na method. In other words, his staff was seeking carte blanche to allow \nMr. Bolton to cherry-pick, as the former chairman of the National \nIntelligence Council said, factoids in isolation to make a case that \ndidn't exist.\n  I will yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that if a policymaker wants to \nmake a statement reflecting an intelligence judgment, representing the \nposition of the Government--not his own personal position, but the \nposition of the Government--the standard practice is for the statement \nto be submitted to the intelligence community for clearance, to be \ncertain that the statement accurately reflects the judgment of the \nintelligence community; is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So you don't have policymakers making assertions about \nintelligence matters that are not supported by the intelligence \ncommunity. If you stop and think about that, it seems to me that is a \nvery wise rule. Otherwise, policymakers can run around making all kinds \nof assertions about intelligence matters, portraying them as \nrepresenting the considered judgment of the Government and, therefore, \nthe considered judgment of the intelligence community. That is the kind \nof review that the intelligence community--in addition to the sources \nand methods review--was undertaking to do.\n  As I understand it, it is standard operating procedure for any \npolicymaker----\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I may interrupt the Senator, any administration \nofficial who wishes to purport that he speaks for the administration, \nwhich includes the intelligence community, has to have his or her \nstatement cleared on that specific point, yes. That is standard \noperating procedure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And that was the very thing that Bolton not only \ncomplained about, but for which he sought to have certain intelligence \nanalysts punished; is that right?\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is absolutely right. When an intelligence analyst \nsaid to him, on two occasions--Mr. Westermann being one--no, Mr. \nSecretary, you cannot say that because the intelligence community \ndoesn't believe that, the intelligence community doesn't think what you \nare about to say is accurate, you cannot say it, what did Mr. Bolton \ndo? He tried to get that intelligence analyst fired for doing nothing \nbut his job and telling him, no, boss, you cannot say that; that is not \nwhat the intelligence community believes.\n  That is different than if Mr. Bolton had said: I am going to go out \nand say, You know, the intelligence community doesn't agree with me, \nbut I, John Bolton, I believe these are the facts. He probably would \nget fired by the President for doing that, but that is not a violation \nof any procedure. He is not purporting to speak for the intelligence \ncommunity when he does that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield for a further question, I \nunderstand that the analyst with whom Bolton had this confrontation \nsaid that what Bolton was seeking to say didn't represent the judgment \nof the intelligence community. In other words, the analyst was stating \ncorrectly the position of the intelligence community which Mr. Bolton \nwas, in effect, seeking to ignore or go against. So it is not as though \nthe analyst was seeking to impose his own personal opinion. His \njudgment corresponded with the vetted judgment of the broader \nintelligence community; is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, not only the community he \nworked for, but the entire community. This National Intelligence \nOfficer, who remains nameless because he is undercover, did not give \nhis own opinion. He gave the opinion of what was the consensus of the \nintelligence community.\n  The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Mr. McLaughlin, said: \nNo, my guy, my CIA officer is right; Mr. Bolton is wrong, and it is \nwrong to try to get him fired.\n  In addition to both of these intelligence analysts being backed up by \ntheir bosses at the highest level--one at INR, the intelligence \noperation within the State Department, and one in CIA--in addition to \nbeing backed up by them, they got backed up by the policymakers who are \ntheir bosses--the Secretary of State of the United States of America \nand the Deputy Secretary of State of the United States of America--both \nof whom were superior in terms of authority to Mr. Bolton.\n  So it is Mr. Bolton who was chastised by the Deputy Secretary of \nState as a consequence of these encounters, because the Deputy \nSecretary of State said: Hey, look, John, in addition to the analysts \nbeing correct, you are no longer authorized to make any speech that is \nnot cleared by me; you are no\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\nlonger authorized to give any testimony before the Congress that is not \ncleared by me.\n  So not only were these analysts backed up by their superiors in the \nintelligence hierarchy, they were backed up by the policymakers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Surely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I apologize if I am anticipating his statement. As I \nunderstand it, when a policymaker requests the transcripts of \nintelligence intercepts, let's say the intercept of a conversation, the \ndocuments that are provided identify the foreign source but they do not \nusually identify the American; is that how it usually works?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me restate in my own words, so the Senator from \nMaryland understands. Let's assume there is the country of Xanadu and \nan American is meeting with the President of Xanadu. In all \nprobability, an American official is meeting with the President of \nXanadu. The National Security Agency--with the ability to intercept \nconversations by multiple methods--picks up a conversation, or \nsomebody's report of a conversation, between an American and the \nPresident of Xanadu. That gets reported back, based on subject matter, \nto the appropriate officer within the State Department or the Defense \nDepartment who they feel should know about this conversation because \nmaybe the President said to the American: You know, we have right here \nin our country 47 al-Qaida operatives. That should go to the person who \nhas that responsibility.\n  So a lot of stuff went to Mr. Bolton because he is the guy in charge \nof dealing with nonproliferation and other matters. He would get these \nNSA, National Security Agency, intercept reports. But in order to \nprotect the identity of the American, for privacy reasons, he would get \na statement and it would say: On such and such a date at such and such \na time, the President of Xanadu met with an American. They discussed \nthe following things. Here is what they said, here is the conversation.\n\n  That is what I understand to be--I know to be--the way in which NSA \nintercept reports treat a case involving an American.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is my understanding that what Mr. Bolton had \nrequested to know, although it was not revealed when they initially \nprovided him the intercepts, was who were the Americans in each of \nthese instances; is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. At least in 10 instances. On 10 different occasions, when \nhe got access to an NSA intercept that mentioned ``an American,'' Mr. \nBolton went back to NSA, and, as I understand it--and I ask to be \ncorrected by my staff--but as I understand it, Mr. Bolton has to say to \nthe head of NSA: I want to know more about this intercept, and I want \nto know the name of the American in order to better understand the \nintercept. He did that 10 times.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And he got the name, presumably.\n  Mr. BIDEN. To the best of our knowledge, he got the name of the \nAmerican.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand in trying to do due diligence on the \nBolton nomination on the part of the committee, the very able Senator \nfrom Delaware, who has had extensive experience on investigatory \nmatters, requested that we be provided with the names of the Americans \nthat Bolton had received from the intelligence agency; is that correct?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, that is correct. Not only did I \nask that, but the chairman of the committee asked that, and it was \nresolved that we were not asking it to be made public, we were not \nasking those names to necessarily be made available to the whole \nForeign Relations Committee, although that was the chairman's \npreference, and ultimately the chairman concluded it should not even be \nprovided directly to me or the chairman, but it should be made \navailable to the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the \nranking member or vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nand they should decide how our committee would review the information.\n  I think the information should be provided to me and to Senator \nLugar, as well, but the way this was parsed out, it was going to be \nthat the National Security Agency was going to come and brief the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, of which I am no longer a member, and--I \nthought--tell them the names of these Americans. I might add further, \nthe reason for that is, there are unsubstantiated--I emphasize \n``unsubstantiated''--allegations that Mr. Bolton may have been seeking \nthe names of these Americans to seek retribution; that it may have been \nintelligence analysts with whom he disagreed or policymakers against \nwhom he was trying to make a case in terms of the direction of American \nforeign policy. I do not know that to be the case. The question is why \ndid he need the names.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It seems to me a further question is that if Mr. Bolton \nwent back to get those names for some reason--he must have had a reason \nfor doing so--why the committee, in deciding whether to confirm him, \nshould not have access to that same information so that we are in a \nposition to ascertain what, if anything, may have been in play by these \nrequests.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, to the best of my knowledge, \nthere is absolutely no substantive reason why information that was \nprovided to an Under Secretary of State down the food chain, and the \nUnder Secretary of State's staff, to the best of my knowledge, why the \ninformation provided to them could not be provided to a Senator who has \nserved 28 years, as the Senator has, in the Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And Senators who are charged with making this very \nimportant decision about whether this nominee should be confirmed for \nthis very important position. It seems to me clearly relevant in \nreaching some judgment about the nominee to have this information \nprovided to those who have to render the judgment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If my friend from Maryland will further yield, Senator \nLugar, the Republican chairman of the committee, and I received a \nletter today dated May 25, addressed to both him and me, from the vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, saying: It is important to \nnote, however, that our committee did not interview Mr. Bolton, so I am \nunable to answer directly the question of why he--Mr. Bolton--felt it \nnecessary for him--Mr. Bolton--to have the identity information--that \nis, the name of the Americans--in order to better understand the \nforeign intelligence contained in the report. Furthermore, based on the \ninformation available to me--the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee--I do not have a complete understanding of Mr. Bolton's \nhandling of the identity information after he received it.\n  Continuing quoting: The committee--the Intelligence Committee--has \nlearned during its interview of Mr. Frederick Fleitz, Mr. Bolton's \nacting chief of staff, that on at least one occasion Mr. Bolton is \nalleged to have shared the un-minimized identity information he \nreceived from the NSA with another individual in the State Department. \nIn this instance, the NSA memorandum forwarding the requested \nidentity--meaning the memorandum forwarding the names of the Americans \nto Mr. Bolton--to State/INR--that is the State Department's \nintelligence agency--included the following restriction: ``Request no \nfurther action be taken on this information without prior approval of \nNSA.''\n  Continuing to quote the vice chairman of Intelligence:\n\n       I have confirmed with the NSA that the phrase ``no further \n     action'' includes sharing the requested identity of U.S. \n     persons with any individual not authorized by the NSA to \n     receive the identity.\n\n  Continuing from the Intelligence Committee vice chairman:\n\n       In addition to being troubled that Mr. Bolton may have \n     shared U.S. person identity information without required NSA \n     approval, I am concerned that the reason for sharing the \n     information was not in keeping with Mr. Bolton's requested \n     justification for the identity in the first place. The \n     identity information was provided to Mr. Bolton based on the \n     stated reason that he needed to know the identity in order to \n     better understand the foreign intelligence contained in the \n     NSA report.\n       According to Mr. Fleitz--\n\nMr. Bolton's acting chief of staff--\n\n     Mr. Bolton used the information he was provided in one \n     instance in order to seek out the State Department official \n     mentioned in the report . . .\n\n  It goes on. But my point is, on the one case that Senator Rockefeller\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\nknows of, Mr. Bolton apparently violated the restriction which was \nimposed upon him when he requested the information, and used that \ninformation for a purpose different than he requested.\n\n  Having said all of that, even the Intelligence Committee was not \nprovided the names of the Americans, which is a critical issue.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. SARBANES. These are the very names that were provided to Mr. \nBolton; is that right?\n  Mr. BIDEN. And his staff, yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And his staff?\n  Mr. BIDEN. And his staff.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But there is a refusal to provide them to the committee \nwhich now has to make a judgment as to whether Mr. Bolton should be \nconfirmed to be the American ambassador to the United Nations?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator would yield, not only a refusal to provide \nthem to our committee that has that responsibility, refusal to provide \nthem even to the Intelligence Committee that is once removed from this \nprocess--the same information that was made available to one of several \nUnder Secretaries in the State Department and his staff.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, what rationale is advanced, if any, for this \nbackhanded treatment of the institutions of the Senate, these two \nimportant committees, the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign \nRelations Committee, both of which are trying to conduct due diligence \non this nominee?\n  I might say to my colleague, I remember when we held the nomination \nhearings for John Negroponte and Richard Holbrooke. That investigation \nwent over an extended period of time and probed very deeply. The end \nresult, of course, was that questions that had been raised were \nanswered satisfactorily, and the body was able to come to a consensus \nabout those nominees.\n  I cannot think of a rationale that can be offered that would warrant \na withholding of this information.\n  Mr. BIDEN. There is no institutional, constitutional, or previously \nasserted rationale that has been offered in denying access of the \nIntelligence Committee or, for that matter, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee chairman and ranking member to this information. I do not \nremember the exact quote. It may apply to the information we are \nseeking on Syria--I am not sure--saying that they did not think it was \nrelevant, but I do not recall.\n  I say to my friend from Maryland, there was no assertion on the part \nof the NSA, that I am aware of, that asserted that it was executive \nprivilege or even that it was extremely sensitive. We have access to \nincredibly sensitive information. That is the reason we have an \nIntelligence Committee. That is the reason we on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee have cross-pollination on that committee. So there is no \nreason--the Senator asked why they would deny it. The Senator's \nspeculation is as good as mine. It seems to me they can end this thing \nvery quickly. The only request being made is that Senator Lugar, \nSenator Roberts, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, and I sit down in a room on the fourth floor of this \nbuilding that is totally secure, have someone from the National \nSecurity Agency come in and say: Here are the 10 intercept reports and \nthe U.S. person names.\n  I know more about--I will date myself--I know more about the PSI of \nan SS-18 Soviet silo, which is highly classified information. Why am I \nnot able to get information in the execution of my responsibilities \nunder the Constitution that is available to a staff member of an Under \nSecretary of State? Members can guess for themselves. I do not know \nwhy. I know it is just not appropriate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for yielding. I just underscore \nthis raises, I think, very fundamental and difficult questions about \nhow we are supposed to carry out our responsibilities, in terms of \nadvice and consent, if we are not allowed to get what appears to be \nrelevant information or what might well be relevant information.\n  The request is fairly limited, as I understand it, in terms of what \nis being sought. It seems to me that information ought to be provided \nto the Senate, or the appropriate agents or organs of the Senate, in \norder to put us into a position to at least address that aspect of this \nsituation.\n  There are many other aspects of the Bolton situation that I want to \nspeak to later. But this one, it seems to me, is clearly an instance in \nwhich we are simply being blocked or frustrated from having information \nwhich is important to us carrying out our task, and is in such contrast \nwith the inquiries that were made about other nominees to be U.S. \nAmbassadors to the United Nations. Of course, I mentioned two of those. \nThe inquiries there went over quite a sustained period of time.\n  We heard these complaints that Bolton is being held up. His \nnomination only came to us in March, I believe, of this year--March. \nAmbassador Holbrooke was nominated in June of 1998. He was finally \nconfirmed in August of 1999. In the interim, these extensive \ninvestigations were run. I do not have the exact dates on Ambassador \nNegroponte, but I know that period of time extended well beyond what is \nalready involved with respect to John Bolton.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I think Negroponte was \nnominated in May and confirmed in September.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, there you are. That underscores the point I am \ntrying to make.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me continue.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator from Delaware how \nmuch longer he expects to be?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be about another 12 to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. OK.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, while my friend from Maryland is here, I \nwant to point out, first of all, the request is very limited. We are \nlooking for the names in 10 reports. It is totally circumscribed, the \nrequest as relates to this issue which you so painstakingly went \nthrough, explaining what it was that worried everybody--and worries \neverybody--about Mr. Bolton and the use of intelligence information, \neven after he has been proscribed, prevented, from being able to speak \nwithout clearance, which is--you and I have been here a long time--\nfairly remarkable. That may have happened to other people in the State \nDepartment. I can't recall it happening.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, this is an Under Secretary \nof State. This is like the No. 4 person in the Department.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That's right. Now, after that occurs, or in the process of \nthis occurring, Mr. Bolton's Chief of Staff contacts the CIA on a \ndisputed issue about what can be said, and says--I don't know if you \nwere here when I said this. To tell you the truth, I thought I knew all \nthis, but I was surprised when my staff pointed this out. Mr. Bolton's \nacting Chief of Staff said Mr. Bolton wanted to make a statement on \nCuba, and they didn't want to let him make that statement.\n  Mr. Bolton's staff gets back to the CIA and says: Several heavy \nhitters are involved in this one, and they may choose to push ahead \nover your objections and the objections of INR, unless there is serious \nsource and method concerned.\n  Remember, going back to our discussions?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Then he, this staff member, goes and contacts the CIA and \nsays: You know, we would like to change the ground rules. We can say \nthe intelligence community thinks the following, even if you disagree. \nWe don't have to clear it with you. The only thing we have to clear \nwith you is whether or not we are exposing a source or a method. Let's \nhave that new deal.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, that represented a sharp departure from \nprevious practice.\n  Mr. BIDEN. A complete departure. But the point I am trying to make is \nhe keeps pushing the envelope, he keeps pushing the envelope.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I take it, if the Senator will yield--I take it this is \nof such importance now because we are dealing with this problem as to \nwhether intelligence is being misused.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Decisions are being made by policymakers that reflect \ntheir policy attitude--\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not substantiated or backed up by the findings of the \nintelligence community. We have been through this issue. It seems to me \na critically important issue.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Right. I would argue it is being pushed by a person whom \neveryone would acknowledge is an ideologue, or at least confirmed in \nwhat his views are and who seeks facts to sustain his opinion.\n  Look, the big difference, I say to my friend from Maryland, is that \nevery time he tried to do that, repeatedly tried to do that in his job, \nhis present job--every time he tried to push the envelope, every time \nhe tried to intimidate, fire, cajole an intelligence officer to change \nhis reading to comport with his prejudice, there was somebody there to \nintervene to stop him beyond the intelligence officer. There was the \nintelligence officer's boss, the deputy head of the CIA; the head of \nINR; the Deputy Secretary of State, the No. 2 man; the Secretary of \nState. That was bad enough.\n  But now where is Bolton going? Bolton is going to be the equivalent \nof the Secretary of State at the U.N. Bolton has, I don't know how \nlarge the embassy is, but a very large contingent of Americans working \nfor him in New York City--I am told there are about 150 people there. \nNo one, in that operation, can control the day-to-day, moment-to-moment \nassertions he is making. No one can say: You cannot do that, John. He's \nhis own boss.\n  Now there is only one person who can do that. Well, the President can \nalways do that. There is only one other person who can do that, and \nthat is the Secretary of State.\n  Go back to the comment our friend from Ohio made, our Republican \nfriend, in the committee. He said, when he spoke to the Secretary of \nState, she said, and I am paraphrasing: Don't worry. We will control \nhim. Acknowledging that even though you are sending this guy up to what \nhas been a Cabinet-level position, another Cabinet-level officer is \ngoing to have to control him. I would respectfully suggest our \nSecretary of State has her hands full as it is, without having to \nbabysit Mr. Bolton so he doesn't get America in trouble--America; I \ndon't care about John Bolton; I don't even care about the U.N. in this \nregard; I care about America.\n  This isn't complicated. Anybody can figure this out. Everybody \nacknowledges this guy is a loose cannon. Everybody acknowledges this \nguy has done things that, if he were able to do them unfettered, not \noverruled, would have at least raised the ante in the tension and the \npossibility of conflict with at least Syria and Cuba, among other \nplaces. And everybody acknowledges that he so far stepped out of line \nin the State Department that the Republican head of the State \nDepartment, Colin Powell, had to go down to analysts and say, \nbasically: Don't pay attention to him. You did the right thing.\n  And then the No. 2 man at the State Department, a former military man \nhimself, says: By the way Mr. Bolton, no more speeches by you unless I \nsign off on them.\n  Now we are going to take this guy, we are going to send him to the \nsingle most important ambassadorial spot in all of America's interests, \nand to make us feel confident, the Secretary of State says: Don't \nworry, we will supervise him.\n  Come on.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on one other point I would like \nto make?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Please.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First of all, I want to pay tribute to the intelligence \nanalysts and their superiors who stood up to this pressure to which the \nSenator has referred. They were put in an extremely difficult \nsituation, and they performed admirably.\n  It is asserted by some that no harm resulted from the pressure Mr. \nBolton and his staff were placing on these people because they did not \ndo what Mr. Bolton wanted them to do.\n  That seems to me to be an upside down argument. The fact that they \nhad the strength to resist this is a tribute to them, but it is \ncertainly no excuse for Mr. Bolton and his staff engaging in this \nbehavior. And the fact they resisted--which is a credit to them--is \nstill a detriment to Mr. Bolton and his staff for engaging in this \npractice.\n  So the argument that Mr. Bolton and his staff did not succeed in \ntheir efforts does not absolve them of responsibility for having tried.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is as though I try to rob a bank and it turns out they \nshipped all the money out and there was no money there. I walk out and \nI get arrested. I say: Wait a minute, no harm, no foul, I didn't get \nany money. I went in to rob the bank, that is true, but I didn't get \nany money. So what is the problem? What is the problem?\n  Look, I told you about Mr. Bolton's staff, I assume with Mr. Bolton's \nauthority, trying to get the intelligence community to change the \ngroundrules. I gave the one example.\n  There is a second example. He did not just do this once. The e-mail I \njust described was not a one-time event. Later, Mr. Bolton's staff \ninformed the intelligence community they wanted to change the rules for \nthe review of Mr. Bolton's proposed speeches and to have the CIA and \nthe intelligence community limit their objections only to matters \nrelated to the source and methods. They go on, in one meeting with \nintelligence analysts--a meeting Mr. Bolton called but he was unable to \nattend at the last minute--his staff informed the assembled analysts \nthat Mr. Bolton wanted to hear only concerns relating to sources and \nmethods from them or ideas that would strengthen his argument. But if \nhis arguments were merely wrong, he did not want to hear about it.\n  Got that? I am not making this up. He, Bolton, calls the meeting of \nthe CIA types, the INR types, to come into his office--he calls them \ninto his office, and I guess he got called away and could not attend. \nBut his staff says: The boss wants to make it clear there are only two \nthings he wants to hear from you. If he wants to say the Moon is made \nof green cheese, the only thing he wants to hear from you is: You \ncannot say that because you will give away the fact that we have eyes. \nWe have a source and a method that we do not want to release. Or he \nwants to hear from you how we can bolster the argument that the Moon is \nmade of green cheese. But he does not want to hear from you if he is \nwrong. He does not want to hear from you if you do not believe the Moon \nis made of green cheese. That is none of your business. He does not \nwant to hear that.\n  Look, I don't know how you define an ``ideologue.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is a pretty good definition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think it is pretty close. It is like that famous \nexpression in a different context of Justice Holmes. He said prejudice \nis like the pupil of the eye. The more light you shine upon it, the \ntighter it closes.\n  It seems the more information you gave Mr. Bolton that conflicted \nwith his predetermined ideological notion, the less he wanted to hear \nit. If you persisted in giving it to him, which was your job, he would \ntry to get you fired.\n  This is not a minor deal. At the very moment when whoever we have as \nour ambassador to the United Nations is going to be the man, \nunfortunately, or woman, who will have to stand up before the whole \nworld and say, We have evidence that North Korea is about to do the \nfollowing; or, We have evidence that Iran has pursued their nuclear \noption to a point they are violating the NPT--let me ask the Senator, \nare we going to send John Bolton to a place where we have already \nsquandered our credibility by saying something that we did not know, or \nsaying things we thought we knew that were wrong, are we going to send \nJohn Bolton up to be the guy to make a case relating to our national \nsecurity?\n\n  I ask my friend a rhetorical question--if, in fact, we fail to \nconvince the Security Council, if we fail to convince our allies and \nthose with a common interest that a threat exists and they do not come \nalong, what are our options? Our options are to do nothing about it or \nto act alone. That is what I mean when I say I am concerned about U.S. \ninterests.\n  There is a story I first heard from Zbigniew Brzezinski that I have \nused many times since. The Senator knows it as well. During the Cuban \nmissile crisis, the very time when Adlai Stevenson stood up and said, \ndon't tell me that, we know the President of the United States, John \nKennedy, desperately needed--although we could have done it alone--\ndesperately needed the support of the rest of our allies in the world \nfor what we were about to do,\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\nconfront the Soviet Union. And he sent former Secretary of State Dean \nAcheson to Paris to meet with then-President Charles de Gaulle. I am \ntold this is not an apocryphal story; it is historically accurate. \nAcheson walked in to the Presidential palace, the President's office, \nand made his case. Then, after making his case, allegedly, he leaned \nover to pick up the satellite photographs to show President de Gaulle \nthat what he spoke of was absolutely true, and he had pictures to show \nit.\n  At that moment, paraphrasing, to the best of my knowledge, de Gaulle \nput up his hands and said: You need not show me the evidence. I know \nPresident Kennedy. And I know he could never tell us anything that \ncould take us to war that wasn't true.\n  Do you think there is anyone, anyone, anyone--including our own \ndelegation in the United Nations--who would accept an assertion from \nJohn Bolton on the same grounds?\n  Now, my friend, the chairman and others, will argue: Well, Joe, if it \nis that critical, he will not be making the case. That is probably \ntrue. It may be the Secretary of State making the case, who has great \ncredibility. It may be the President of the United States. But there \nare a thousand little pieces that lead up to building coalitions that \nrelate to our self-interest, based upon an ambassador privately sitting \nwith another ambassador and assuring him that what he speaks is true.\n  This is absolutely the wrong man at the wrong time for the most \nimportant job in diplomacy that exists right now.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, is John Bolton a man in the \ntradition of Adlai Stevenson or Jack Danforth or any number of people I \ncan name?\n  There is a third reason to oppose Mr. Bolton.\n  This is one that has animated the interest and concern of my friend \nfrom Ohio even more than it has me; and that is, that Mr. Bolton \nengages in abusive treatment of colleagues in the State Department, and \nhe exercises frequent lapses of judgment in dealing with them.\n  Again, do not take my word for it. Carl Ford, the former Assistant \nSecretary of State for Intelligence, described Mr. Bolton--and I am \nusing Carl Ford's colorful language, I guess it is an Arkansas \nexpression; he is from Arkansas--he said Mr. Bolton is a \n``quintessential kiss-up, kick down kind of guy.''\n  He also objected, Mr. Ford did, in strong terms, to the treatment of \none of his subordinates, Mr. Westermann. He said:\n\n       Secretary Bolton chose to reach five or six levels below \n     him in the bureaucracy, bring an analyst into his office, and \n     give him a tongue lashing. . . . he was so far over the line \n     that [it's] one of the sort of memorable moments in my 30-\n     plus year career.\n\n  Listen to Larry Wilkerson, Secretary Powell's chief of staff, who \nreferred to Mr. Bolton--I am not making up these phrases--he referred \nto Bolton as a ``lousy leader.'' And he told the committee that he--\nWilkerson had an open-door policy. Some Senators and others have that \npolicy. They literally keep their door open so anyone in the \norganization can feel free to walk in and say what is on their mind. He \nsaid his open-door policy--this is the chief of staff for the Secretary \nof State--he said his open-door policy led to a steady stream of senior \nofficials who came into his office to complain about Mr. Bolton's \nbehavior.\n  Listen to John Wolf, a career Foreign Service Officer for 35 years, \nwho worked under Mr. Bolton as the Assistant Secretary of State for \nNonproliferation. Mr. Wolf said that Mr. Bolton blocked an assignment \nof a man he--Mr. Wolf--described as a ``truly outstanding civil \nservant,'' some 9 months after that civil servant made an inadvertent \nmistake.\n  And Mr. Wolf says that Mr. Bolton asked him to remove two other \nofficials because of disagreements Mr. Bolton had over policy, and that \nMr. Bolton ``tended not to be enthusiastic about alternative views.''\n  If that is not a quintessentially State Department, career Foreign \nService Officer phrase: he ``tended not to be enthusiastic about \nalternative views.''\n  Listen to Will Taft, a man whose name became known here in the \ninvestigations relating to Abu Ghraib and the treaties that were \ndiscussed about the treatment of prisoners. Mr. Taft served in the \nState Department as legal adviser under Secretary Powell during the \ntenure of Mr. Bolton. And before that, he was general counsel in two \nother Government Departments, as well as Deputy Secretary of Defense, \nand formerly an ambassador to NATO--significant positions.\n  Mr. Taft told our committee he had to take the extraordinary step of \ngoing to his boss--Mr. Taft's boss--to rein in Mr. Bolton after Bolton \nrefused to work with the State Department attorney on a lawsuit in \nwhich the State Department was a defendant.\n  This resulted--I will skip a little bit here--this incident caused \nthe Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Armitage, to write to Mr. Bolton a \nmemo reminding him that the rules applied to him, as well as others in \nthe State Department, and that he was required--Mr. Bolton was \nrequired--to work with State Department lawyers.\n  There is a fourth reason, beyond his treatment of individuals--and I \ncould go on for another hour citing examples of his alleged \nmistreatment of subordinates and colleagues at the State Department and \nin other endeavors--there is a fourth reason that, all by itself, would \njustify Mr. Bolton not being confirmed; and that is, Mr. Bolton gave \ntestimony to the Foreign Relations Committee under oath that at best \nwas misleading.\n  Again, do not take my word for it. It is true that I think Mr. Bolton \nshould not go to the United Nations, and I am of a different party. But \ndo not take my word for it. Listen to Tom Hubbard, referred to by the \nchairman earlier today. Mr. Hubbard is a retired Foreign Service \nOfficer whose last post was as Ambassador to South Korea. During our \nhearing on April 11, Senator Chafee asked Mr. Bolton about a speech \nthat Mr. Bolton gave in Seoul, South Korea, in 2003.\n\n  Let me give you some context. This was on the eve of the President's \ninitiative to begin what is referred to as the Six-Party Talks: the two \nKoreas, Japan, Russia, the United States, and China--a very delicate \nmoment. Mr. Bolton has made it clear, in many speeches he has made, \nwhat he thinks of Kim Jong Il, and that is not inappropriate. And he \nhas made it pretty clear that he rejected the idea proffered by me, and \nI believe even by Senator Lugar, and by other Senators here, several \nyears ago that we should talk to the North Koreans--not negotiate, talk \nwith them--and find out what it would take to make a deal and let them \nknow what our bottom line was.\n  Mr. Bolton is not the architect of, but a disciple of, the policy of \ncontaining and putting the North Korean regime in a position where he \nthinks if enough pressure is put on them they would topple. And we are \ngoing back to when he was making a speech in Seoul, South Korea, in \n2003, on the eve of the first Six-Party Talks.\n  The speech was filled with inflammatory rhetoric, even though it may \nbe true, about the North Korean leadership. The result of him having \ngiven the speech was that the talks were almost scuttled.\n  Mr. Bolton, in reply to Senator Chafee of our committee regarding \nthat speech, said:\n\n       I can tell you [Senator] what our Ambassador to South \n     Korea, Tom Hubbard, said after the speech.\n\n  Meaning his speech.\n\n       He said [to me], ``Thanks a lot for that speech, John. \n     It'll help us a lot out here.''\n\n  Got this, now: He makes what is termed an inflammatory speech. He is \nasked: Wasn't that inflammatory, and didn't that cause us real trouble \nin pursuing the foreign policy objectives of the President to get these \ntalks underway? And Bolton, in effect, says: No. And then the Senator, \nin effect, says: Well, didn't our Ambassador to South Korea think it \nwas damaging? And he says: No. He not only didn't think it was \ndamaging, he said to me: ``Thanks a lot for that speech, John. It'll \nhelp us a lot out here.''\n  Now, you would draw from that exchange that this speech was totally \nconsistent with the administration's policy, that it was something that \nwas helpful, and that Bolton was doing a good job.\n  Now, we didn't call Ambassador Hubbard. I may be mistaken, but I \nthink the Republican majority staff got a call from Mr. Hubbard, the \nformer ambassador to South Korea, who I guess saw this on C-SPAN. I \ndon't know what\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\nexactly prompted it. Maybe he read it in the newspaper. And he says: I \nwant to talk to you guys. And in an interview which was totally \nappropriate, without minority staff there, he paints a very different \nstory, accurately reported by the majority staff.\n  Ambassador Hubbard remembers that little exchange about the Bolton \n2003 speech on the eve of the Six-Party Talks quite differently. The \nday after the committee hearing, Hubbard voluntarily contacted the \ncommittee to make clear that he disagreed at the time with the tone of \nthe speech and thought the speech was unhelpful to the negotiating \nprocess and--this is the important part--and that he, Bolton, surely \nknew that, that I, Hubbard, thought it was unhelpful and was damaging.\n  Hubbard then told the Los Angeles Times that although he had talked \nto Mr. Bolton and thanked him for removing from his speech some of the \nattacks on South Korea. Remember this now, the speech was about North \nKorea. The only thing the ambassador was able to convince Bolton to do \nwas take out some of the stuff that attacked our ally South Korea, \nwhom, I might note parenthetically, if, God forbid, there is a war, we \nneed on our side. We have 30,000 American troops there. Bolton is \nmaking a speech characterized as an inflammatory speech about North \nKorea and is going to attack our ally South Korea, as well.\n  And our ambassador says: Please don't do that stuff about South \nKorea. And so Hubbard says: It is true. I thanked him for removing some \nof the attacks he was about to make on South Korea.\n  Then he went on to say, but ``it's a gross exaggeration to elevate \nthat [statement] to praise for the entire speech and approval of it.''\n  I don't know how you can comport how those two statements work out. \nBolton saying: Remember that the ambassador said, thanks a lot for that \nspeech, John. It helps us a lot out here. And the ambassador is saying \nthat Mr. Bolton knows better. That is a gross exaggeration.\n  In other testimony, Mr. Bolton frequently tried to claim he had not \nsought to fire or discipline the INR intelligence analyst, Mr. \nWestermann.\n  He said:\n\n       I never sought to have [him] fired.\n\n  He later said:\n\n       I, in no sense, sought to have any discipline imposed on \n     Mr. Westermann.\n\n  And finally, he said:\n\n       I didn't try to have Mr. Westermann removed.\n\n  This is incredibly disingenuous. It is just not true. The record is \nclear that Bolton sought on three occasions that I referenced earlier \nto have Mr. Westermann removed from his position and given another \nportfolio. And by the way, you don't get another portfolio. If the only \njob you do in a restaurant is cook and they say you can't cook anymore, \nthere are not many jobs left for you. This guy's expertise was dealing \nwith chemical and biological weapons. Mr. Bolton wanted him taken off \nthe case.\n  As a lawyer, Mr. Bolton surely knows that civil servants have job \nprotections and can't be readily fired. By asking repeatedly that this \nman be moved from his established area of expertise, he was endangering \nthe man's career and sending a message of intimidation that was heard \nloud and clear throughout the Intelligence and Research Bureau. Mr. \nBolton did not have the honesty or the courage to admit that fact to \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. Where is this straight talker we hear \nso much about?\n  The President has said that in his second term, one of his priorities \nis ``to defend our security and spread freedom by building effective \nmultinational and multilateral institutions and supporting effective \nmultilateral action.'' If this is a serious objective, he sure is \nsending the wrong man to put together these kinds of coalitions.\n  It is manifestly not in our interest to send John Bolton to the \nUnited Nations.\n  It is not in our interest to have a person who is ``a lousy leader'' \nin charge of a mission of 150 professionals who need leadership.\n  It is not in our national interest to have a conservative ideologue \nwho doesn't listen to others trying to rebuild frayed alliances at the \nUnited Nations.\n  It is not in our national interest to have a man with a reputation as \na bully trying to construct coalitions necessary to achieve U.N. \nreform.\n  It is not in our interest to have someone with a reputation for \ntaking factoids out of context, exaggerating intelligence information, \nas our spokesman in New York during the crises to come with Iran and \nNorth Korea, when we will have to convince the world to take action to \nstop nuclear weapons programs.\n  Is this the best the President of the United States can do? Is this \nthe best among the many tough-minded, articulate, conservative \nRepublican foreign policy experts?\n  The record presented by the Foreign Relations Committee is clear. The \ndocuments we have uncovered; the interviews with those who had to pick \nup the pieces at INR and CIA, in the office of the Secretary of State, \nand in South Korea; the testimony of former Assistant Secretary of \nState Carl Ford, a conservative Republican; all of this record has \ngiven us clear warning that Mr. Bolton is the wrong man for this job.\n  Mr. Bolton's nomination is not--I emphasize ``not''--in the interest \nof the United States of America. I don't know that I have ever said \nthis before on the floor, but I believe that if this were a secret \nballot, Mr. Bolton would not get 40 votes in the Senate. I believe the \nPresident knows that. I wish the President had taken another look at \nthis and found us someone--I am not being facetious and I am not the \nfirst one to say this, I say to my friend from Virginia, the single \nbest guy we could send to the United Nations right now at this critical \nmoment is former President Bush. I cannot think of anybody better. He \nwould get absolutely unanimous support on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. Bolton is no George Herbert Walker Bush. I guess not many people \nare. But this guy should not be going to the U.N.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the years I have been privileged to \nserve in this Chamber, I have so thoroughly enjoyed working with my \ngood friend from Delaware. We have done a lot of things together. I \nlistened carefully to his framework and remarks. I respectfully \ndisagree, and I will so state my reasons momentarily.\n  But I wondered if we could discuss for a few minutes the following. \nBefore we start, I think it would be advisable for both sides to have \nfrom the Presiding Officer the time remaining on both sides for the \nrecord, so Senators listening will have an idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 116 minutes remaining of \ntime, and the minority has 64 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: Is that for today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And there is additional time tomorrow, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to my good friend from Delaware, one of \nthe interesting aspects of what has occurred in the Senate over the \nlast week or so is an impetus to go back and do a lot of historical \nresearch. I went back and looked at the Articles of Confederation and \nthe Founding Fathers and what they had to say about this provision of \nadvise and consent in the Constitution.\n  It is interesting. I was very taken aback with how they went about \nmodifying. If the Senator and others will indulge me, I would like to \ndiscuss that for a moment or two because I think it poses a question I \nwould like to put to my good friend. That begins at this juncture.\n  You may ask why it is particularly appropriate for the Senate to be \nin executive session today, because on this day in 1787, 218 years ago, \nour Founding Fathers of the United States Constitution first reached a \nquorum so that the Constitutional Convention could draft our \nConstitution and they could proceed. It took several years to get it \ndone. George Washington had been calling for such a convention for \nyears, but it was not until this day, 218 years ago, that the \nconvention finally began.\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\n  From May 25, 1787, straight through the summer, 55 individuals \ngathered in Philadelphia to write our Constitution. It was a hot \nsummer, with long and arduous debate, and many drafts went back and \nforth. Careful consideration was given. Finally, in mid-September, it \nwas over. It was a monumental achievement, one that would enable the \nUnited States today, 200-plus years later, to become the oldest, \ncontinuously surviving republic form of Government on Earth today.\n  I mention all this because one of the key compromises our Founding \nFathers made throughout the Constitutional Convention was with respect \nto the advise and consent clause. Our Framers labored extensively over \nthis section of the Constitution, deferring final resolution of the \nclause for several months. Some of the Framers argued that the \nPresident should have total authority to appoint. Others thought both \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate should be involved in the \nprocess. Ultimately, a plan that was put forth by James Madison--if I \nmay say proudly--of Virginia, won the day, where the President would \nnominate judges and executive nominees, and the Senate would reject or \nconfirm them.\n\n  In Federalist Paper No. 76, in 1788, Alexander Hamilton explains in \ndetail exactly why this compromise was so important. Let me read a \nportion of Hamilton's quote:\n\n       It has been observed in a former paper that ``the true test \n     of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce \n     a good administration.'' If the justness of this observation \n     be admitted, the mode of appointing the offices of the United \n     States contained in the foregoing clauses must, when \n     examined, be allowed to be entitled to particular \n     commendation. It is not easy to conceive a plan better \n     calculated than this to promote a judicious choice of men for \n     filling the offices of the Union.\n\n  I presume he wasn't looking into the future, so I will add ``women.''\n  Today, this great compromise can be found, unmodified, in article II, \nsection 2 of the Constitution. This section of the Constitution reads \nin part as follows:\n\n       The President shall nominate, and by and with the Advice \n     and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . public \n     Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all \n     other Officers of the United States. . . .\n\n  Thus, the Constitution provides a role for both the President and the \nSenate in this process. The President has the responsibility to \nnominate, and the Senate has the responsibility to render advice and \nconsent on the nomination.\n  While article II, section 2 of the Constitution doesn't explicitly \nmake a distinction between the Senate's role with respect to executive \nbranch nominees and judicial nominees of the other branch of \nGovernment, the tradition of the Senate, in recognition of the \nConstitution, dictates otherwise.\n  Traditionally, a President, especially after taking office following \nan election, is given greater latitude in selecting individuals to \nserve in the executive branch of Government. This is in recognition of \nthe fact that the Constitution treats Senate-confirmed executive branch \nnominees far differently than Senate-confirmed judges.\n  In contrast to Federal judicial nominees who, once confirmed under \nthe Constitution, serve a lifetime appointment in the third branch of \nGovernment, independent of the President, executive branch nominees \nserve under the President solely at the pleasure of the President. That \nphrase, ``at the pleasure of the President,'' is paramount. This time-\nhonored phrase, ``at the pleasure of the President,'' has been used by \nPresidents throughout American history to show the American people that \nthe President is the final arbiter of accountability for executive \nnominees.\n  I say that because I have fought hard here recently to deal with this \nquestion of the judicial nominees, along with some others. I am not \nhere to seek whether we did right or wrong; history will judge that. \nBut it was a magnificent experience to go back and study the process \nand listen to many scholarly people and to read extensively. But it is \nclear to me there is a difference between the judicial nominee who goes \nfor life on the third independent branch--independent of Congress and \nthe executive branch--and the President's right to select those \nindividuals who he, together with his fellow Cabinet officers and \nothers in the administration, feels are best suited to do the job. \nWould you agree there is a difference in that? I yield for the purpose \nof answering the question.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will answer the question. Let me say to \nmy friend that regarding Federalist No. 76, I suffer from teaching the \nsubject. For the last 16 years, I have taught a course in the \nseparation of powers. I wrote a treatise, an entire book, on this \nsubject. There is another phrase in Federalist No. 76 the Senator \ndidn't read that I think is appropriate to mention.\n  Federalist No. 76 was about the issue--remember, the Federalist \nPapers were trying to convince a public that didn't have a television \nset or a radio that their legislative body should ratify the \nConstitution. It was sort of pamphleteering. That is what they were \ndoing. They were taking arguments against the Constitution and framing \nthem, setting them up, knocking them down, and making the case. The \nissue in Federalist No. 76 was whether the President would have undue \ninfluence on the Senate. Would he not be able to pressure the Senate \nbecause he was chief executive officer? Hamilton said: Don't worry \nabout that. He went on to explain that there could be no better system \nthan the one that was arrived at.\n  The compromise he is talking about, by the way, is the Connecticut \nCompromise. It was not until shortly before that the Founders decided--\nthis is the only reason this got resolved--that the great State of \nVirginia with, I think, the first or second largest population at the \ntime, could only have two Senators, and the small State of Delaware \nwould have two Senators. That was the Connecticut Compromise. That is \nwhat it was about.\n  The reason it came about was that is they wanted to make sure that \nthe minority would be able to be protected. He used the phrase--and I \ncompliment and associate myself with my friend from Virginia; I know \nthat is not why he sought recognition and why he asked the question, \nbut what he did yesterday with Senator Byrd is what Alexander Hamilton \nwas talking about--Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 76 used the \nfollowing phrase in rebutting the argument that the President would be \nable to pressure the Senate. He said there will always be a sufficient \nnumber of men of rectitude to prevent that from happening. The Senator \nfrom Virginia demonstrated yesterday that there always is a sufficient \nnumber of men of rectitude--he and Senator Byrd--in averting a showdown \nthat may have literally, not figuratively----\n  Mr. WARNER. Together with 14 in total.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is true.\n  Mr. WARNER. Coequal.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and Senator Byrd \nwere the catalyst that came along and rescued something that had been \nattempted and written off, at least by the six Democrats with whom I \nhad been talking, as failed until the two of them came along. This in \nno way is to denigrate the significant efforts of the others.\n  Mr. WARNER. The leadership of Senators McCain, Ben Nelson, and \neverybody else.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The reason I say this is that, in the debates in the \nConstitutional Convention on this nominating process, on three \noccasions I believe it was Governor Wilson of Pennsylvania--I am not \npositive of that--proposed a motion that the President of the United \nStates should have the power alone to appoint his Cabinet and inferior \nofficers in the court. It never got, to the best of my knowledge, more \nthan seven votes. The only consideration that almost passed twice was \nthat only the Senate, without the President even in on the deal, could \nmake those appointments. If we look at the constitutional history, the \nPresident was an afterthought in the nominating process. That is what \nMadison's notes show. That is what the history of the debate in the \nState legislative bodies shows.\n  So here we are, the Connecticut Compromise comes along guaranteeing \nthat small States will be able to have an impact on these choices, but \ngo back and look, and I think it is Federalist 77--do not hold me to \nthat--but it is Hamilton's treatise on why there was a need\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\nto have the Senate involved in choosing not only judges but \nappointments to the Federal Government. There was the fear that what \nhappened in the British Parliament would be repeated; that, in fact, \nthe King and the leaders of the majority would appoint incompetent \npeople, such as their brothers-in-law, their friends, to be surrounding \nthem in their Cabinets, in the lesser offices of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  So it was a genuine concern and a clear understanding--I think the \nphrase in Federalist 76 is; this is off the top of my head--if by this \nwe are limiting the President, so be it; that is our intention.\n  To the specific question, yes, there is more deference given to the \nPresident of the United States in the appointment of his Cabinet than \nthere is to his appointments to the Supreme Court, district court, any \nlower court, or any other appointed office in the Government. But the \nsingle exception that was intended by the Framers, if you read what \nthey said, in terms of even appointing those around him, if the persons \nhe would pick, notwithstanding that they would reflect the President's \npolitical views, if the appointment inures to the detriment of the \nUnited States, they should be opposed.\n  There have not been many occasions when I have opposed nominees to \nthe President's Cabinet or Cabinet-level positions, and I imagine there \nhave not been many my friend from Virginia has opposed. But I opposed \ntwo in the Clinton administration. I opposed one in the Carter \nadministration. I think I opposed two in the Reagan administration. In \neach case, my opposition--and this would be only the second one I have \nopposed in this administration--is because the appointment of that \nindividual, notwithstanding the fact that he or she is the choice of \nthe President, would have the effect of negatively affecting the \nstanding, security, or well-being of the United States.\n  So there are exceptions, and I would argue Mr. Bolton, as my friend \nfrom Ohio, I suspect, is going to make a compelling case, falls into \nthe category of, yes, the President gets who he wants, unless the \nappointment of that person would inure to the detriment of the United \nStates.\n  That is the central point I am trying to make. I understand my friend \ndoes not agree with me, but I honestly believe Mr. Bolton going to the \nU.N. will inure to the detriment of the United States, notwithstanding \nthe President's judgment that it would not do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the colloquy. We \ndid settle clearly that greater latitude is given to the President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is right; I acknowledge that.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Virginia does not infer that \nlatitude is a rubberstamp, that everyone goes through. Clearly--and I \nknow my good friend from Delaware speaks as a matter of clear \nconscience--I speak as a matter of clear conscience.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I am confident that is true \nabout the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Correct, and we have a difference of views as it relates \nto our conscience.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I respect that difference.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend. I would also go back to Federalist 76 \nand read the following provision dated Tuesday, April 1, 1788, author \nAlexander Hamilton:\n\n       The President is ``to nominate, and, by and with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other \n     public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, \n     and other officers of the United States whose appointments \n     are not otherwise provided for in the Constitution. But the \n     Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior \n     offices as they think proper in the President alone, or in \n     the courts of law, or in the heads of departments. The \n     President shall have the power to fill up all vacancies which \n     may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting \n     commissions. . . .\n\n  This is the operative paragraph to which I wish to refer:\n\n       It has been observed in a former paper that ``the true test \n     of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce \n     a good administration.''\n\n  I said that.\n\n       If the justness of this observation be admitted, the mode \n     of appointing the officers of the United States contained in \n     the foregoing clauses, must, when examined, be allowed to be \n     entitled to particular commendation. It is not easy to \n     conceive a plan better calculated than this to promote a \n     judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the Union; \n     and it will not need proof, that on this point must \n     essentially depend the character of its administration.\n\n  Mr. President, our distinguished President has served in office 4 \nyears. He was reelected with a clarity by the votes. He is now putting \ntogether his administration for these coming years. The nomination of \nJohn Bolton, with whom I have had considerable experience in work, in \nwhom I have a strong sense of confidence--he has chosen this \nindividual, I might say by and with the consent of his Secretary of \nState, a very able and most credible individual, in my experience, in \nworking with the distinguished current Secretary of State.\n  The President, together with his principal Cabinet officers, has put \ntogether an extraordinary national security team. John Bolton will be a \nvaluable addition to this team.\n  The President and his Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, have been \nclear in their belief that John Bolton has the experience and skills to \nrepresent the United States at the United Nations and to carry out the \nPresident's priorities to strengthen and reform the United Nations. I \nagree with the confidence they place in this nominee.\n  John Bolton has had a long and distinguished career in public service \nand in the private sector. Most recently, he has served for the past 4 \nyears as the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security Affairs. In that capacity, Secretary Bolton \nworked to build a coalition of over 60 countries to help combat the \nspread of weapons of mass destruction through the Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative, PSI. He was a leader in creating the G-8 Global \nPartnership, which invited other nations to support the Nunn-Lugar \nnuclear threat reduction concept. As a result, many other nations are \nnow participating with the United States in helping to eliminate and \nsafeguard dangerous weapons and technologies which remain in the \ncountries of the former Soviet Union.\n  Previously, John Bolton has served as Assistant Secretary of State \nfor International Organization Affairs, as an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in the Department of Justice, and many years ago he held \nseveral senior positions in the Agency for International Development. \nHe has also had a distinguished legal career in the private sector.\n  It is no secret that Mr. Bolton has at times advocated or represented \npositions which have sparked controversy. He has done so with a \nfrankness and assertiveness that demonstrate his strongly held beliefs. \nAs the Senate considers this nomination, we should keep in mind the \nwords of Secretary Rice. She stated:\n\n       The President and I have asked John Bolton to do this work \n     because he knows how to get things done. He is a tough-minded \n     diplomat, he has a strong record of success and he has a \n     proven track record of effective multilateralism. Secretary \n     Rice concluded her remarks by saying, and I quote again: \n     John, you have my confidence and that of the President.\n\n  Given the enormity of problems facing the U.N. today, we have an \nobligation to send a strong-minded individual to help constructively to \nsolve these problems and to build the confidence of the American people \nin the U.N.\n  I share the President's and the Secretary's belief that John Bolton \nwill enthusiastically advance the President's goal of making the United \nNations a stronger, more effective international organization.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination and to send Mr. \nBolton to the U.N. to represent our Nation and to advance the \nPresident's agenda of reform. Such reform is necessary to restore \nAmerican confidence in the U.N. and to ensure that the U.N. will remain \na vital and respected international organization in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two \narticles from the New York Times and the Washington Post with regard to \nthe Bolton nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 11, 2005]\n\n                        The Best Man for the Job\n\n              (By James A. Baker III and Edwin Meese III)\n\n       The image that critics are painting of John Bolton, \n     President Bush's nominee to be our\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\n     representative at the United Nations, does not bear the \n     slightest resemblance to the man we have known and worked \n     with for a quarter-century.\n       While we cannot speak to the truthfulness of the specific \n     allegations by his former colleagues, we can speak to what we \n     know. And during our time with Mr. Bolton at the Justice and \n     State Departments, we never knew of any instance in which he \n     abused or berated anyone he worked with. Nor was his loyalty \n     to us or to the presidents we served ever questioned. And we \n     never knew of an instance in which he distorted factual \n     evidence to make it fit political ends.\n       At the heart of the claims made by Mr. Bolton's critics is \n     the charge that he was imperious to those beneath him and \n     duplicitous to those above. The implication is that Mr. \n     Bolton saw himself as something of a free agent, guided by \n     nothing more than his own notions of what he thought good \n     policy might be. Woe be to those who might dare to disagree, \n     according to these critics, be they lower-level analysts or \n     cabinet members.\n       In our experience, nothing could be further from the truth. \n     John Bolton was as loyal as he was talented. To put it \n     bluntly, he knew his place and he took direction. As cabinet \n     members, we took our direction from our presidents, and Mr. \n     Bolton was faithful to his obligations as a presidential \n     appointee on our respective teams. In his service as \n     assistant attorney general and assistant secretary of state, \n     we had complete confidence in him--and that confidence turned \n     out to have been well placed. In our view he would be no \n     different in fulfilling his duties as our United Nations \n     ambassador.\n       In any administration there are going to be disagreements \n     over process and policy, both in formulation and execution. \n     It is not uncommon to have battle lines within any \n     administration drawn between idealists and pragmatists. But \n     what has made John Bolton so successful in the posts he has \n     held, and what makes him so well suited for the position at \n     the United Nations, is that he exhibits the best virtues of \n     both idealists and pragmatists.\n       Mr. Bolton's political principles are not shaped by \n     circumstances or by appeals to the conventional wisdom. He \n     knows, as Abraham Lincoln once put it, that ``important \n     principles may and must be inflexible.'' He also knows that \n     those principles often have to be fought for with vigor.\n       On the other hand, he understands from his long experience \n     at the highest levels of government that in order to succeed, \n     one has to work with those whose views may differ; he knows \n     the importance of principled compromise in order to make \n     things happen.\n       A most fitting example was his contribution, when serving \n     as an assistant secretary of state, in getting the United \n     Nations General Assembly in 1991 to abandon its morally \n     noxious doctrine that Zionism was a form of racism. This took \n     extraordinary diplomatic skill, combining the clear \n     articulation of the philosophic position of the United States \n     and his own personal persuasiveness. That this effort \n     succeeded where earlier efforts had failed came as no \n     surprise to anyone who had worked with Mr. Bolton. The power \n     of his mind and the strength of his convictions make him a \n     most formidable advocate.\n       These skills have been on display more recently in his \n     current position as undersecretary of state for arms control \n     and international security. Not even his detractors deny, for \n     example, that he was instrumental in building a coalition of \n     60 countries for President Bush's Proliferation Security \n     Initiative to combat the spread of nuclear weapons \n     technology.\n       At a time when all sides acknowledge that fundamental \n     reform is needed at the United Nations lest it see its moral \n     stature diminished and its possibilities squandered, we need \n     our permanent representative to be a person of political \n     vision, intellectual power and personal integrity. John \n     Bolton is just that person.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 24, 2005]\n\n                          Blunt but Effective\n\n                      (By Lawrence S. Eagleburger)\n\n       President Bush's nomination of John Bolton as U.S. \n     ambassador to the United Nations has generated a bad case of \n     dyspepsia among a number of senators, who keep putting off a \n     confirmation vote. That hesitation is now portrayed as a \n     consequence of Bolton's purported ``mistreatment'' of several \n     State Department intelligence analysts. But this is a smoke \n     screen. The real reasons Bolton's opponents want to derail \n     his nomination are his oft-repeated criticism of the United \n     Nations and other international organizations, his rejection \n     of the arguments of those who ignore or excuse the \n     inexcusable (i.e., the election of Sudan to the U.N. Human \n     Rights Commission) and his willingness to express himself \n     with the bark off.\n       As to the charge that Bolton has been tough on \n     subordinates, I can say only that in more than a decade of \n     association with him in the State Department I never saw or \n     heard anything to support such a charge. Nor do I see \n     anything wrong with challenging intelligence analysts on \n     their findings. They can, as recent history demonstrates, \n     make mistakes. And they must be prepared to defend their \n     findings under intense questioning. If John pushed too hard \n     or dressed down subordinates, he deserves criticism, but it \n     hardly merits a vote against confirmation when balanced \n     against his many accomplishments.\n       On Dec. 16, 1991, I spoke to the U.N. General Assembly on \n     behalf of the United States, calling on the member states to \n     repeal the odious Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with \n     racism. As I said then, the resolution ``labeled as racist \n     the national aspirations of the one people more victimized by \n     racism than any other.'' That we were successful in obtaining \n     repeal was largely due to John Bolton, who was then assistant \n     secretary of state for international organizations. His moral \n     outrage was clearly evident as he brilliantly led and managed \n     the successful U.S. campaign to obtain sufficient votes for \n     repeal. The final vote, 111 to 25, speaks volumes for the \n     success of his ``direct'' style.\n       Bolton's impressive skills were also demonstrated at the \n     time of the Persian Gulf War, when he steered a critical \n     series of resolutions supporting our liberation of Kuwait \n     through the U.N. Security Council. During this period we \n     negotiated some 15 resolutions up to and through the removal \n     of Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. Adoption of the key \n     Security Council document, Resolution 678, was not a foregone \n     conclusion and faced the possibility of a Chinese veto until \n     the final vote. While our diplomacy to obtain this and other \n     council votes was conducted on a global scale, Bolton was \n     deeply engaged in managing this worldwide effort.\n       These are but two examples of why I believe Bolton \n     possesses the substantial qualifications necessary to be our \n     ambassador to the United Nations. By now it should be obvious \n     to all that the halcyon days when our advice was sought and \n     our leadership welcomed because the security of others \n     depended on the protection we gave are no more. I recognize \n     that John's willingness to speak bluntly has raised \n     questions. Perhaps there was a time when those concerns had \n     merit--but not now. Given what we all know about the current \n     state of the United Nations, it's time we were represented by \n     someone with the guts to demand reform and to see that \n     whatever changes result are more than window dressing.\n       It is clear that the future of the United Nations and the \n     U.S. role within that organization are uncertain. Who better \n     to demonstrate to the member states that the United States is \n     serious about reform? Who better to speak for all Americans \n     dedicated to a healthy United Nations that will fulfill the \n     dreams of its founders?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I recently sent my colleagues a letter \nregarding the nomination of John Bolton. I realize that they are all \nbusy and likely they have not had an opportunity to read the letter. I \nwill begin my remarks today by reading the letter to my colleagues so \nthat it will be a part of the Record.\n\n       Dear colleague: Throughout my time in the Senate, I have \n     been hesitant to push my views on my colleagues. However, I \n     feel compelled to share my deep concerns with the nomination \n     of John Bolton to be Ambassador to the United Nations. I \n     strongly feel that the importance of this nomination to our \n     foreign policy requires us to set aside our partisan agenda \n     and let our consciences and our shared commitment to our \n     nation's best interests guide us. At a time when the United \n     States strives to fight terrorism globally, to build a stable \n     and free Iraq, to find a peaceful resolution to the nuclear \n     ambitions of Iran and North Korea, to spread democracy in the \n     place of oppressive regimes, and to enact needed reforms at \n     the United Nations, it is imperative that we have the support \n     of our friends and allies internationally. These strong \n     international relationships must be built upon robust and \n     effective public diplomacy.\n       I applaud our President for understanding this and for his \n     leadership on U.S. public diplomacy. He and Secretary Rice \n     have taken important steps to reach out to the international \n     community and strengthen relationships.\n       Additionally, I applaud the President's decision to appoint \n     Karen Hughes to enhance U.S. public diplomacy at the State \n     Department and recently to get even the First Lady involved \n     in these important efforts to promote public diplomacy [and \n     improve the world's opinion of the United States of America].\n       However, it is my concern that John Bolton's nomination \n     sends a negative message to the world community and \n     contradicts the President's efforts. In these dangerous \n     times, we cannot afford to put at risk our nation's ability \n     to successfully wage and win the war on terror with a \n     controversial and ineffective Ambassador to the United \n     Nations. I worry that Mr. Bolton could make it more difficult \n     for us to achieve the important U.N. reforms needed to \n     restore the strength of the institution. I strongly believe \n     that we need to reform the U.N., make it a viable institution \n     for world security, and remove its anti-Israel bias. However, \n     I question John Bolton's ability to get this job done.\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\n       I know that you are very busy, but I would appreciate it if \n     you would review my edited statement before the Foreign \n     Relations Committee as to why I think we can do much better \n     than John Bolton . . .\n\n  In my closing words I stated this:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I am not so arrogant to think that I should \n     impose my judgment and perspective of the U.S. position in \n     the world community on the rest of my colleagues. We owe \n     it to the President to give Mr. Bolton an up or down vote \n     on the floor of the U.S. Senate. My hope is that, on a \n     bipartisan basis, we send Mr. Bolton's nomination to the \n     floor without recommendation and let the Senate work its \n     will.\n       I plead with my colleagues in the Senate that if this \n     nomination gets to the floor--\n\n  And we are here today--\n\n     to consider this decision and its consequences carefully, to \n     read all the pertinent material, and to ask themselves \n     several pertinent questions: Is John Bolton the best possible \n     person to serve as the lead diplomat to the United Nations? \n     Will he be able to pursue the needed reforms at the U.N., \n     despite his damaged credibility? Will he share information \n     with the right individuals, and will he solicit information \n     from the right individuals, including his subordinates, so \n     that he can make the most informed decisions? Is he capable \n     of advancing the President's and the Secretary of State's \n     efforts to advance our public diplomacy? Does he have the \n     character, leadership, interpersonal skills, self discipline, \n     common decency, and understanding of the chain of command to \n     lead his team to victory? Will he recognize and seize \n     opportunities to repair and strengthen relationships, promote \n     peace and uphold democracy--as a team--with our fellow \n     nations?\n\n  I mentioned in my letter the Senate faces today a very important \ndecision, whether to send John Bolton to New York to be the next U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations. I believe we can do better, and we \nowe it to the United States of America, the U.S. State Department, our \nsoldiers overseas, our children, and our grandchildren to do better \nthan Mr. Bolton. This is not my opinion alone. The overwhelming opinion \nof the colleagues I have talked to about John Bolton is that he is not \nan ideal nominee; that they are less than enthusiastic about him and \nmany were surprised at the decision. Many of my colleagues have said \nthat the only reason they are going to vote for him is because he is \nthe President's nominee. I agree with my colleague, Senator Biden. I \nthink if we had a secret vote on John Bolton, he would not get 50 votes \nfrom the Senate.\n\n  I want to explain to my colleagues here today why it is I think Mr. \nBolton should not be confirmed. One of my deepest concerns about this \nnomination involves the big picture of U.S. public diplomacy and the \nPresident's acknowledged need to improve it. It was not too long ago \nwhen America's love of freedom was a force of inspiration to the rest \nof the world, and America was admired for its democracy, generosity, \nand willingness to help others in need of protection. Today, the United \nStates is criticized for what the world calls arrogance, unilateralism, \nfor failure to listen and seek support of its friends and allies. There \nhas been a drastic change in the attitude of our friends and allies in \nsuch organizations such as NATO and the countries' leaders whom we need \nto rely upon for help.\n  I discovered this personally during a trip I took to London, Serbia, \nMontenegro, and Italy last year, where I met with several individuals \nfrom various international backgrounds and attended the NATO \nparliamentary meeting in Venice. In London I met with several \nindividuals from the Atlantic Partnership, chaired by Lord Powell, who \ntold me that the United States needed to do something to improve its \npublic diplomacy with countries where leaders are under a great amount \nof pressure. They mentioned Tony Blair, who has put his neck on the \nline to support the United States and needed the United States to \nimprove its public diplomacy to meet the concerns of his constituency.\n  We all know that Tony Blair lost a significant number of \nparliamentary seats because of these concerns. The group emphasized \nthat we needed to do more in public diplomacy to reach out to our \nfriends and allies so that we could work together to accomplish the \ndaunting tasks before us.\n  In Venice I attended the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. I could not \nbelieve some of the comments that were being made about the United \nStates--from our allies. It was a stark contrast to the parliamentary \nmeetings I attended in Budapest in 2000, when our allies voiced the \nconcern: What about this Bush who is running for President? Is he an \nisolationist?\n  In Venice I heard their concerns that the United States is very much \ninvolved in international affairs but acts unilaterally, without any \nconcern by the United States of its allies and friends.\n  I have traveled a great deal in my career, and I have met with \nleaders and academics in the international community during previous \nwars. There has never been as drastic a shift in the international \ncommunity's perception as there has been during the last 2 or 3 years. \nThe countries that previously admired the United States for its values \nand principles of democracy and freedom, encouraging other nations to \ndevelop their own democracies and speak out against injustices, now \ncriticize the United States for its failure to respect their views and \nopinions.\n  It troubles me deeply that the United States is perceived this way in \nthe world community. I am troubled because the United States will face \na deeper challenge in achieving its objectives without their support. \nWe will face more difficulties in conducting the war on terrorism, \npromoting peace and stability worldwide, and building democracies, \nwithout help from our friends to share the responsibilities, \nleadership, and costs.\n  Even as recently as last night, the former President of the Czech \nRepublic and champion of democracy, Vaclav Havel, told me over dinner \nthat the United States needs to improve its public diplomacy, that we \nhave become isolated in too many instances.\n  If the United States wants to win the war on terrorism, win the peace \nin Iraq, promote freedom globally, and prevent new conflicts, we need \nto have the help of our friends. In order to have the help of our \nfriends we need to have robust public diplomacy. For if we cannot win \nover the hearts and minds of the world community, we are not going to \nbe able to create the team that we need and our goals will be more \ndifficult to achieve.\n  Additionally, we will be unable to reduce the burdens on our own \nresources, the most important of which is the lives of the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces who are leaving their families every day to \nserve this country overseas.\n  Now, 1,700 U.S. men and women--over that--have given their lives in \nIraq and Afghanistan; over 12,000 have been wounded.\n  Nothing can compare to the cost of human lives, but the financial \ncosts of the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan are also placing a \ntremendous human resources burden on our country. Weeks ago we passed \nthe $82 billion supplemental bill for our operations in Afghanistan and \nIraq. I understand that we will need at least $50 billion next year. \nThe costs of this war are not going down anytime soon.\n  We need the help of other countries to share the financial burden \nthat is adding to our national debt, and the human resource burden that \nour Armed Forces, National Guardsmen, contractors, and their families \nare bearing so heavily now. The key is public diplomacy.\n\n  As I say, I applaud the President and the Secretary of State for \nunderstanding that public diplomacy is an important objective and \nbeginning this new term with an emphasis on repairing relationships. I \napplaud the President and Secretary Rice for reaching out to our \nfriends in the world community and articulating that the United States \ndoes respect international law and protocol.\n  The President's recent visits to Latvia, the Netherlands, Moscow, and \nGeorgia, underscore the priority he places on strengthening U.S. public \ndiplomacy. The way that he embraced the Russian people will serve the \ncountry well as we negotiate with President Putin to improve nuclear \nsecurity cooperation and support U.S. positions on Iran and North \nKorea.\n  The President has also enlisted the added value of the First Lady in \npursuing an agenda to improve U.S. public diplomacy in the Middle East, \nan important initiative. I also applaud the President's decision to \nappoint Karen Hughes to help lead the public diplomacy effort at the \nState Department.\n  Let's send Karen Hughes to be the next ambassador to the United \nNations. There is someone who would\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\nreally make a difference for us, and deal with the challenge that we \nhave in public diplomacy.\n  The President clearly understands the importance of renewing our \nrelationships and making clear that we want to work with our friends to \nachieve our many foreign policy goals. It is important to send a \nmessage that, though the United States may have differences with our \nfriends at times, and though we may need to be firm about our \npositions, we are willing to sit down, talk about them, discuss our \nreasoning, and work for a solution.\n  It is my strong belief in the need to improve U.S. public diplomacy \nand in the efforts of the President that has caused me to pause and \nreflect so deeply on the nomination of Mr. Bolton because, I asked \nmyself, what message are we sending to the world community? In the same \nbreath we are considering a nominee for ambassador to the United \nNations who has been accused of being arrogant, of not listening to his \nfriends, of acting unilaterally, and of bullying those who do not have \nthe ability to properly defend themselves. These are the very \ncharacteristics we are trying to dispel in the court of world opinion.\n  We must understand, next to the President, Vice President, and \nSecretary of State, the most prominent public diplomat is our \nambassador to the United Nations. It is my concern that the \nconfirmation of John Bolton would send a contradictory and negative \nmessage to the world community about U.S. intentions. I am afraid that \nhis confirmation will tell the world we are not dedicated to repairing \nour relationships or working as a team but that we believe only someone \nwith sharp elbows can deal effectively with the international \ncommunity.\n  I want to make it clear that I do believe that the U.N. needs to be \nreformed if it is to be relevant in the 21st century. We need to pursue \nits transformation aggressively, sending the strong message that \ncorruption will not be tolerated. The corruption that occurred under \nthe Oil for Food Program made it possible for Saddam's Iraq to \ndiscredit the U.N. and undermine the goals of its members. This must \nnever happen again, and severe reforms are needed to strengthen the \norganization. And, yes, I believe it will be necessary to take a firm \nposition so that we can succeed. But it will take a special individual \nto succeed in this endeavor, and I have great concerns with the current \nnominee and his ability to get the job done.\n  To those who say a vote against John Bolton is a vote against reform \nof the United Nations, I say nonsense. Frankly, I am concerned that Mr. \nBolton would make it more difficult for us to achieve the badly needed \nreforms to this outdated institution. I believe there could be even \nmore obstacles to reform if Mr. Bolton were sent to the U.N. than if it \nwere another candidate. Those in the international community who do not \nwant to see the U.N. reformed will act as a roadblock, and I fear Mr. \nBolton's reputation will make it easier for them to succeed.\n  I believe that some member nations in the U.N. will use Mr. Bolton as \npart of their agenda to further question the credibility and integrity \nof the United States of America and to reinforce their negative U.S. \npropaganda.\n  If we send Mr. Bolton to the United Nations, the message will be lost \nbecause our enemies will do everything they can to use Mr. Bolton's \nbaggage to drown his words. The issue will be the messenger--the \nmessenger and not the message.\n\n  Another reason I believe Mr. Bolton is not the best candidate for the \njob is his tendency to act without regard to the views of others and \nwithout respect to chains of command. We have heard Mr. Bolton has a \nreputation for straying off message. He is reported to have strayed off \nmessage more often than anyone else holding a responsible position at \nthe State Department during Secretary Powell's years as Secretary of \nState.\n  U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Thomas Hubbard testified that Bolton \nrejected his request to soften the tone of a July 2003 speech on North \nKorea policy and stated that the speech hurt, rather than helped, \nefforts to achieve the President's objectives.\n  Here is the question from a committee staffer:\n\n       And what was your impression of the speech when you first \n     read it, the day before it was going to be delivered? Did you \n     suggest changes in it?\n\n  We are talking now of the question to Ambassador Hubbard.\n\n       I think our most important comment was that we thought the \n     tone was way too strong, that he used derogatory terms about \n     Kim Jung Il . . . throughout the speech, in virtually every \n     sentence. And I and my staff argued that was \n     counterproductive to our interest in getting the North \n     Koreans back into the talks [on their reducing their nuclear \n     threat.]\n\n  Committee staffer:\n\n       And was Mr. Bolton aware of the South Korean request to \n     avoid inflammatory language that might complicate the Six-\n     Party process?\n\n  Ambassador Hubbard:\n\n       Yes.\n\n  Committee staffer:\n\n       Did he make all the changes [in the July 2000 speech] that \n     had been suggested?\n\n  Ambassador Hubbard:\n\n       No, I don't believe so. You know, I think that--to be very \n     clear, we didn't go through the speech, scratching out the \n     word ``dictator'' every time we saw it--you know, that--we \n     made an overall comment . . . that we felt that was \n     counterproductive and overblown.\n\n  Committee staffer:\n\n       Did you believe the speech advanced the President's \n     objective of achieving a peaceful denuclearization of the \n     Korean Peninsula through negotiations? Or, if not, why not?\n\n  Ambassador Hubbard:\n\n       No, I don't think it advanced the process . . . In my view, \n     the invective . . . gave the North Koreans another excuse or \n     pretext not to come back to the committee.\n\n  Committee staffer:\n\n       Did Bolton advance President Bush's North Korea policy?\n\n  Ambassador Hubbard:\n\n       My belief is that his actions hurt.\n\n  According to reliable sources at the State Department, it was after \nthat speech that it was made clear to Mr. Bolton he would have to clear \nany future speeches through the Secretary or Deputy Secretary and that \nhe would be put on a very short leash. This was just one of the many \ntimes he was called on the carpet.\n  In fairness to Mr. Bolton, the sources have said to me, once \nreprimanded, Bolton got back on track but that he needed to be kept on \na short leash.\n  Who is to say that Bolton will not continue to stray off message as \nambassador to the U.N.? Who is to say he will not hurt, rather than \nhelp, United States relations with the international community and our \ndesire to reform the United Nations?\n  When discussing all of these concerns with Secretary Rice--John \nBolton's propensity to get off message, his lack of interpersonal \nskills, his tendency to abuse others who disagree with him--I was \ninformed by the Secretary of State she understood all these things and \nin spite of them still feels John Bolton is the best choice. She \nassured me she would be in frequent communication with him and that he \nwould be supervised very closely.\n  My private thought, and I should have shared this with the Secretary \nof State, is why in the world would you want to send someone to the \nUnited Nations who requires such supervision?\n  I am also concerned about Mr. Bolton's interpersonal skills. I \nunderstand there will be several vacant senior posts on the staff when \nMr. Bolton arrives in his new position. As a matter of fact, I \nunderstand all the top people are leaving. I understand one of the most \nrespected and qualified people at the U.N., Anne Patterson, will be \nleaving her post, and others will be departing, as I mentioned.\n  As such, Mr. Bolton will face a challenge of inspiring, leading, and \nmanaging a new team, a staff of roughly 150 individuals, perhaps more, \nwhom he is going to need to rely upon to get the job done. As we know, \nall of us are only as good as the team we have surrounding us. We are \nall aware of the testimony and observations related to Mr. Bolton's \ninterpersonal and management skills.\n\n  With that record in mind, I have concern about Mr. Bolton's ability \nto inspire and lead a team so he can be as effective as possible in \ncompleting the important tasks before him. And I am not the only one. \nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee received letters from 102 U.S. \ndiplomats who served under administrations for both sides of the aisle \nsaying Mr. Bolton is the wrong man for the job.\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\n  Colin Powell's chief of staff, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, testified \nbefore the committee that Mr. Bolton would make ``an abysmal \nambassador,'' and that ``he is incapable of listening to people and \ntaking into account their views.''\n  I would like to read some of Mr. Wilkerson's testimony.\n  Mr. Wilkerson:\n\n       I would like to make just one statement. I don't have a \n     large problem with Under Secretary Bolton serving our \n     country. My objections to what we've been talking about \n     here--that is, him being our ambassador at the United \n     Nations--stem from two basic things. One, I think he's a \n     lousy leader. And there are 100 to 150 people up there that \n     have to be led; they have to be led well, and they have to be \n     led properly. And I think, in that capacity, if he goes up \n     there, you'll see the proof of the pudding in a year.\n\n  I would also like to highlight the words of another person I myself \nrespect and who worked closely with Mr. Bolton. He told me if Bolton \nwere confirmed, he would be ok for a short while, but within 6 months \nhis poor interpersonal skills and lack of self-discipline would cause \nmajor problems. He told me Mr. Bolton is unable to control his temper.\n  I would like to read some quotes from the testimony of Christian \nWestermann, the analyst from the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, \nand Tom Fingar, Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and \nResearch, about Mr. Bolton's patterns of losing his temper and getting \nangry.\n  Mr. Westermann:\n\n       He was quite upset that I had objected and he wanted to \n     know what right I had trying to change an Under Secretary's \n     language.\n\n  This was in a speech and Mr. Westermann had to send that speech over \nto the CIA and then it came back from the CIA.\n\n       And what he would say, or not say or something like that. \n     And I tried to explain a little bit of the same things about \n     the process of how we clear language. And I guess I wasn't \n     really in a mood to listen and he was quite angry and \n     basically told me I had no right to do that.\n\n  By the way, Mr. Westermann did not work in Mr. Bolton's section of \nthe State Department. He worked in INR, another department, another \ndepartment, not under his direct supervision.\n\n       And he [Mr. Bolton] got very red in the face, shaking his \n     finger at me and explaining to me I was acting way beyond my \n     position, and for someone who worked for him. I told him I \n     didn't work for him.\n\n  Staffer:\n\n       And when [Bolton] threw you out of the office, how did he \n     do that?\n\n  Committee staffer:\n\n       He just told me to get out and get Tom Fingar, he was \n     yelling and screaming and red in the face, and wagging his \n     finger. I'll never forget the wagging of the finger.\n\n  Committee staffer:\n\n       Could you characterize your meeting with Bolton? Was he \n     calm?\n\n  Mr. Tom Fingar:\n\n       No, he was angry.\n\n  Additionally, I want to note my concern that former Secretary of \nState Colin Powell, the person to whom Mr. Bolton answered over the \nlast 4 years, was conspicuously absent from a letter signed by former \nSecretaries of State recommending Mr. Bolton's confirmation. Of all the \npeople who worked with Mr. Bolton, Powell is the most qualified person \nto judge the man and his ability to serve as the Secretary's ambassador \nto the U.N. and he did not sign the letter.\n  In fact, I have learned that several well-respected leaders in our \nforeign policy community were shocked by Mr. Bolton's nomination \nbecause he is the last person thought to be appropriate for the job.\n  There are several interesting theories on how Mr. Bolton got the \nnomination. I am not going to go into them in the Senate. If anyone \nwould like to talk to me about that, I am happy to discuss it with \nthem; otherwise, I urge you to get in touch with senior members of the \nForeign Relations Committee and ask them.\n  We are facing an era of foreign relations in which the choice of our \nambassador to the United Nations should be one of the most thoughtful \ndecisions we make. The candidate needs to be both a diplomat and a \nmanager. He must have the ability to persuade and inspire our friends, \nto communicate and convince, to listen, to absorb the ideas of others. \nWithout such virtues, we will face more efforts in our war on \nterrorism, to spread democracy and to foster stability globally.\n  The question is, is John Bolton the best person for the job? The \nadministration says they believe he is the right man. They say despite \nhis interpersonal shortcomings, he knows the U.N., he can reform the \norganization and make it more powerful and more relevant to the world.\n  There is no doubt John Bolton should be commended and thanked for his \nservice and his particular achievements.\n  He has accomplished some important objectives against great odds. As \nthe sponsor of legislation that established an office on global anti-\nSemitism in the State Department, I am particularly impressed by his \nwork to repeal the U.N. legislation equating Zionism with racism. I \nwholeheartedly agree with Bolton that we must work with the U.N. to \nchange its anti-Israel bias, and I applaud his work on this issue.\n  In 2003, I sent a letter to Secretary General Kofi Annan of the \nUnited Nations to express my profound concern about the appalling \ndevelopments in the U.N. and the Palestinian Observer's equation of \nZionism with Nazism and ask that the United Nations condemn the remarks \nand maintain a commitment to human rights.\n  Further, I am impressed by Mr. Bolton's achievements in the area of \narms control, specifically on the Moscow Treaty, the G8 ``10-Plus-10-\nOver-10'' Global Partnership Fund, and the President's Proliferation \nSecurity Initiative.\n  Now, it has been suggested that we should vote for Mr. Bolton because \nof his achievements and qualifications despite his reputation as a \n``bully'' and his poor interpersonal skills.\n  I agree that Mr. Bolton has had some achievements, but I am dubious \nthat Mr. Bolton's record of performance has been so overwhelmingly \nsuccessful that we should ignore his negative pattern of behavior and \ncredibility problems with the international community.\n  For the last 4 years, Mr. Bolton served as the top arms control and \nnonproliferation official for the State Department. The most pressing \nnonproliferation issues affecting U.S. national security today involve \nthe threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, the threat of North Korea's \nnuclear ambitions, and the need to expand and accelerate our \ncooperation with the Russian Federation to secure and dismantle \nRussia's nuclear and WMD infrastructure to keep it out of the hands of \nwould-be terrorists or proliferant nations.\n  The United States has not had significant success on these issues in \nthe last 4 years. In the case of North Korea, they have withdrawn from \nthe Nonproliferation Treaty and the situation has become more critical \nduring Bolton's watch. Our U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, Thomas \nHubbard, stated that Mr. Bolton's approach on North Korea was damaging \nto U.S. interests. With regard to our cooperation with Russia to secure \nits WMD infrastructure and fissile material, I have read several \nreports that Mr. Bolton also hurt efforts to move beyond the legal \nholdup of ``liability'' that has stymied our programs.\n  On May 16, a Newsweek article reported that for several years, the \ndisposal of Russia's 134-ton hoard of plutonium has been stymied by an \nobscure legal issue in which Washington has sought to free U.S. \ncontractors from any iability for nuclear contamination during cleanup. \nIt says that: Bolton bore a very heavy responsibility for festering the \nplutonium issue. It reports that a former State Department official \nsaid: In 2004, Bolton quashed a compromise plan by his own \nnonproliferation bureau, even after other agencies had approved it.\n  I must say I am unimpressed by Mr. Bolton's failure to secure a \ncompromise during his 4 years that would enable us to move forward to \nsecure this material from terrorists.\n  The situation in Iran is also very concerning and has only worsened \nin the last 4 years.\n  Among our accomplishments in nonproliferation, there is no doubt that \nLibya's decision to dismantle its WMD infrastructure was one of the \nlargest successes of the last 4 years.\n  We really rejoiced over that. However, there is credible reporting \nthat Mr. Bolton was sidelined from the negotiations by the White House \nand that some believed he might hurt their chances of succeeding with \nLibya. Additional reports indicate that Mr.\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\nBolton was sidelined at the request of British officials working on the \nissue, because they felt he was a liability during the negotiations.\n  Mr. Bolton has also been given a great deal of credit for his work on \ngetting Article 98 agreements with several countries and important \nmilitary partners. Article 98 agreements secure U.S. military officers \nfrom prosecution under the International Criminal Court while \nconducting operations or military exercises in a foreign country.\n  I support the efforts to secure Article 98 agreements and protect \nU.S. Forces against what could be a politically driven trial in a \nforeign country. However, I understand that Mr. Bolton worked to secure \nthese agreements by putting a hold on all U.S. military education and \ntraining assistance to these countries--understanding that the last \nseven countries we brought into the United Nations never signed that \nArticle 98 treaty.\n\n  This assistance that we provide to these countries provides education \nto military officials about U.S. and Western military doctrine, the \nimportance of a civilian-run military, civil-military relations, and \nrespect for human rights. It provides basic leadership training and \nother important training that enables foreign troops to interoperate \nwith U.S. forces and international forces--such as English language \ntraining and general combat training. This is very important assistance \nat a time when we are fighting with a coalition in Afghanistan and a \ncoalition in Iraq. But at the very same time that we were seeking \nadditional supporters in Iraq, some military officials arriving at U.S. \nairports to receive the military education training were turned away \nbecause of Mr. Bolton's strong-arming tactics.\n  As I understand it, several different State Department officials \nasked Mr. Bolton to remove the holds because of the negative impact \nthey were having on our allies, and he refused to listen to their \nviews.\n  I ran into this when I was in Croatia a couple weeks ago. I talked to \nthe new Prime Minister of Croatia, Ivo Sanader, and he was saying: I \nhave to sign Article 98. If I don't get it, then we get no help \nwhatsoever in terms of advice about how we civilianize our Army and so \nforth. And there are people in the Defense Department who think it is a \ngood idea. And I think it is a good idea because we have to be \nconcerned, in some of those countries that have gone democratic, that \nif things get bad, we do not want to see a coup d'etat come from the \nmilitary part of their operation. So we should be doing everything we \ncan to civilianize it. But, no, can't do it. Mr. Bolton doesn't want to \ndo it.\n  Mr. President, how are we supposed to persuade our friends and allies \nto join us in Iraq and Afghanistan when we are cutting off the English-\nlanguage training and other military training that would enable them to \nsend troops to serve with us?\n  In fact, the policy is contradictory to U.S. public diplomacy efforts \nas well as efforts to secure support in Iraq and Afghanistan, but Mr. \nBolton did not listen to the views of his staff who told him that the \npolicy was damaging our bigger picture interests.\n  For this reason, I question the suggestion that Mr. Bolton's \nqualifications and his record of performance is so outstanding that we \nshould vote for him, despite his negative pattern of behavior.\n  But this is another issue that is deeply concerning to me. We cannot \ndeny that Mr. Bolton's record shows a pattern of behavior that is \ncontradictory to that of an effective Ambassador.\n  I would like to read to you a quote by Mr. Carl Ford, who headed the \nBureau of Intelligence and Research, INR, in the State Department from \n2001 to 2003. He testified that Mr. Bolton is a ``kiss up and kick \ndown'' leader who does not tolerate those who disagree with him and \ngoes out of his way to retaliate for their disagreement.\n  Here is what Mr. Ford said:\n\n       Unfortunately, my judgment, my opinion, he's a \n     quintessential ``kiss-up, kick-down'' sort of guy . . . I'm \n     sure you've met them. But the fact is that he stands out, \n     that he's got a bigger kick and it gets bigger and stronger \n     the further down the bureaucracy he's kicking.\n\n  Others who have worked closely with Mr. Bolton have stated that he is \nan ideologue and that he fosters an atmosphere of intimidation and does \nnot tolerate disagreement, does not tolerate dissent, and that he \nbullies those who disagree with him.\n  I would like to read some excerpts from the testimony of the \nAmbassador to South Korea, Thomas Hubbard, and Mr. John Wolf, Assistant \nSecretary of the Nonproliferation Bureau, who worked directly under Mr. \nBolton.\n\n       Committee staffer. There have been press reports--one in \n     December of 2003, in USA Today, that--I'll just read you the \n     quote from that story. Quote, ``In private, Bolton's \n     colleagues can be scathing. One high-level coworker calls \n     Bolton `an anti-diplomat who tries to intimidate those who \n     disagree with his views.' Another diplomat says, `No one in \n     the Department dares to criticize Bolton on the record, \n     because he has support at the highest levels of the \n     Administration. Despite his often blunt public \n     pronouncements, he's never publicly chastised or \n     contradicted,' the diplomat says.'' Does that sound like the \n     John Bolton you know?\n       Ambassador Hubbard. It sounds, in general, like what I \n     experienced.\n       Committee staffer. Did that--did Mr. Bolton prevent those \n     views of debate [on policy issues from the Nonproliferation \n     Bureau] from getting up to the Deputy Secretary?\n       Mr. Wolf, [Assistant Secretary of Nonproliferation]: There \n     were long and arduous discussions about issues before they \n     got to the Secretary.\n       Committee staffer. And, in those discussions, how would you \n     characterize Mr. Bolton's demeanor and professionalism in \n     listening to alternative points of views or listening to \n     those who disagreed with his point of view? Did he have an \n     open mind?\n       Mr. Wolf. He tended to hold on to his own views strongly, \n     and he tended not to be--he tended not to be enthusiastic \n     about alternative views.\n\n       Mr. Wolf. He did not--he did not--he did not encourage \n     differing views. And he tended to have a fairly blunt manner \n     of expressing himself.\n       Committee staffer. Would you go so far as to say that he \n     discouraged alternative views through his demeanor and \n     through his response when people presented alternative views \n     to him?\n       Mr. Wolf. He did not encourage us to provide our views to \n     the Secretary . . . our alternative views.\n\n  Colin Powell's chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson testified that Mr. \nBolton tended to focus on accomplishing his own goals as a matter of \n``bean-counting'' and refused to consider the repercussions of his \nmethods on the greater policy objectives of the United States.\n  I would like to quote from Colonel Wilkerson's testimony:\n\n       Second, I differ from a lot of people in Washington, both \n     friend and foe of Under Secretary Bolton, as to his, quote, \n     ``brilliance,'' unquote. I didn't see it. I saw a man who \n     counted beans, who said ``98 today, 99 tomorrow, 100 the next \n     day,'' and had no willingness--in many cases, no capacity--to \n     understand the other things that were happening around those \n     beans. And that is just a recipe for problems at the United \n     Nations. And that's the only reason that I said anything.\n\n  Mr. Wilkerson again:\n\n       My prejudice and my bias will come out here, because I \n     think one of the number-one problems facing the country right \n     now--and, you know, I'm here because of my country--\n\n  This is Wilkerson. He volunteered. We didn't go out and get him. He \nvolunteered.\n\n     --not because of anybody else--is North Korea . . . So when \n     people ignore diplomacy that is aimed at dealing with that \n     problem in order to push their pet rocks in other areas, it \n     bothers me, as a diplomat, and as a citizen of this country.\n\n  And I have citations on all of this in the testimony.\n  Wilkerson again:\n\n       It was the same thing with nonproliferation. The statistic \n     I mentioned before, which I think Under Secretary Bolton \n     mentioned in his speech in Tokyo on February the 7th, if I \n     remember right--I still keep up with this stuff, Northeast \n     Asia--and he said the Clinton Administration, in eight years, \n     had sanctioned China eight times, and the Bush \n     Administration, in four years, had sanctioned China 62 times. \n     As I used to say, what's the measurement of effectiveness \n     here? What's it done? Is the sanctioning of 62 times an \n     indication that China is proliferating more? Or is it an \n     indication that we're cracking down? I'd love to see the \n     statistic for the next four years, if Bolton were to remain \n     Under Secretary. It would be 120 or 140. And what is the \n     effectiveness of this? Are we actually stopping proliferation \n     that was dangerous to our interest? Or are we doing it, and \n     ignoring other problems that cry out for cures, diplomatic? \n     And no one sits and says, you know, ``Okay, that's correct, \n     that's correct, this is correct, this is what's effective, \n     this isn't effective.'' The one time I had a conversation \n     with John about this, I asked him, ``How do you go beyond \n     sanctions, John? War?'' [Bolton's implied answer was:] ``Not \n     my business.'' [In other words, that was not his problem.]\n\n  Former Assistant Secretary of the Intelligence and Research Bureau \nCarl Ford testified he had never seen anyone behave as badly in all his \ndays at\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nthe State Department and that he would not have even testified before \nthe Committee if John Bolton had simply followed protocol and simple \nrules of management.\n\n       Mr. Ford. I can guarantee you . . . that if Secretary \n     Bolton had chosen to come to see me, or in my absence, my \n     Principal Deputy, Secretary Tom Fingar, I wouldn't be here \n     today. He could have approached me in the same tone, and in \n     the same attitude--shaking his finger, red in the face, high \n     tone in his voice--and I wouldn't be here today. If he had \n     gone to Secretary Powell, or Secretary Armitage, and \n     complained loudly about the poor service that he was \n     receiving from INR and the terrible treatment that he had \n     been stabbed in the back by one of INR's analysts, I wouldn't \n     be here today. The fact is, it is appropriate, if someone is \n     unhappy with the service they're getting from one of the \n     services or organizations in a bureaucracy, that they should \n     complain. They should yell as loud as they want to. But, \n     instead of doing any of those three things, Secretary Bolton \n     chose to reach five or six levels down below him in the \n     bureaucracy--\n\n  By the way, a bureaucracy he was not in charge of\n\n     --bring an analyst into his office, and give him a tongue \n     lashing, and I frankly don't care whether he sang scat for \n     five minutes, the attitude, the volume of his tone, and what \n     I understand to be the substance of the conversation--he was \n     so far over the line . . . That is, I've never seen anybody \n     quite like Secretary Bolton . . . I don't have a second and a \n     third or fourth, in terms of the way he abuses his power and \n     authority with little people . . . There are a lot of \n     screamers that work in government, but you don't pull \n     somebody so low down in the bureaucracy that they're \n     completely defenseless. It's an 800 pound gorilla devouring a \n     banana. The analyst was required simply to stand there and \n     take it, and Secretary Bolton knew when he had the tirade \n     that, in fact, that was the case.\n\n  I want to note that in Mr. Bolton's testimony, he justifies his anger \nand retaliatory actions against Mr. Westermann by citing an apologetic \ne-mail from Mr. Tom Fingar, Assistant Secretary of the Intelligence \nBureau. And when I met privately with Mr. Bolton, he said: Right after \nit happened, I received this apologetic e-mail from Mr. Fingar. So we \nasked Mr. Fingar and Mr. Ford about the e-mail.\n\n       Committee staffer. You said . . . that what Mr. Westermann \n     did was entirely within the procedure, he was never \n     disciplined, it was perfectly normal, that the only failure \n     of his was lack of prudence. And then here [in the e-mail to \n     Bolton] you say it's ``entirely inappropriate,'' and ``we \n     screwed up, it won't happen again.'' That seems like a rather \n     different assessment.\n       Mr. Fingar. Well, I knew I was dealing with somebody who \n     was very upset, I was trying to get the incident closed, \n     which I didn't regard as a big deal. I know John [Bolton] was \n     mad. I assumed, when people are mad, they get over it. So, \n     did I lean over in the direction of ``Sure, we'll take \n     responsibility?'' He thanked me for it, at least as far as \n     I'm concerned, in my dealings with Bolton, that closed it.\n\n  So basically it was, somebody is mad. You send them back an e-mail \nand say our guy didn't do what he was supposed to do. You hope they \nwill get off your butt and it will be over with. But it wasn't over. He \nkept going after him. We have to move this guy. We have to bring \nsomebody else in here. I can't deal with him. That is the way he acts.\n  Mr. Ford:\n\n     . . . knowing him [Fingar] well, I'm assuming it simply was, \n     as you said, this guy [Bolton] was furious, he could \n     potentially do great damage to the bureau, and he [Fingar] \n     was just trying to put him back in the box and keep him from \n     doing any more harm. And I can't fault him for that.\n\n  I also want to point out that Carl Ford, Lawrence Wilkerson, and \nalmost all of the witnesses who came before our committee are \nappointees of the Bush administration. These are loyal Republicans who \nsay: I am a conservative Republican. I am loyal to the President, that \nthey could not abide Mr. Bolton's nomination because of their concern \nfor his conduct and his erratic, often unprofessional, behavior.\n  That is what this is about.\n  I have to say that after pouring over the hundreds of pages of \ntestimony and speaking with many individuals, I believe John Bolton \nwould have been fired if he had worked for a major corporation. That is \nnot the behavior of a true leader who upholds the kind of democracy \nPresident Bush is seeking to promote globally. This is not the behavior \nthat should be endorsed as the face of the United States to the world \ncommunity at the United Nations.\n  It, rather, is my opinion that John Bolton is the poster child of \nwhat the diplomatic corps should not be. I worry about the signal we \nare sending to the thousands of individuals under the State Department \nwho are serving their country in foreign service and civil service, \nliving in posts across the world and in some cases risking their lives, \nall so they can represent our country, promote diplomacy, and \ncontribute to the safety of Americans everywhere.\n  What are we saying to these people? And I care about human capital. I \nhave been working on it now for over 6 years. When we say to these \npeople that we look to confirm an individual with this record to one of \nthe highest positions in the State Department, what are we saying to \nthese people? I was in Croatia. I was in Slovenia. They can't believe \nit.\n  I want to emphasize that I have weighed Bolton's strengths carefully. \nI have weighed the fact that this is the President's nominee. All \nthings being equal, it is my proclivity to support the President's \nnominee, as most of us. However, in this case, all things are not \nequal. It is a different world today than it was 4 years ago. Our \nenemies are Muslim extremists and religious fanatics who have hijacked \nthe Koran and have convinced people that the way to get to Heaven is \nthrough Jihad and against the world, particularly the United States. We \nmust recognize that to be successful in this war, one of our most \nimportant tools is public diplomacy, more than ever before--\nintelligence and public diplomacy. After hours of deliberation, \ntelephone calls, personal conversations, reading hundreds of pages of \ntranscripts, and asking for guidance from above, I have come to the \ndetermination that the United States can do better than John Bolton. We \nneed an ambassador who understands the wisdom of Teddy Roosevelt's \npolicy to walk softly and carry a big stick. The U.S. needs an \nambassador who is interested in encouraging other people's points of \nview and discouraging any atmosphere of intimidation. The world needs \nan American ambassador to the U.N. who will show that the United States \nhas respect for other countries and intermediary organizations, that we \nare team players and consensus builders and promoters of symbiotic \nrelationships.\n  In moving forward with the international community, we should \nremember the words of the Scot poet Bobbie Burns who said:\n\n       Oh, that some great power would give me the wisdom to see \n     myself as other people see me.\n  And when thinking of John Bolton earlier today, I thought of one--I \ndon't know whether it is a fairy tale, or whatever, called ``The \nEmperor Has No Clothes.'' We are going to vote tomorrow, and I am \nafraid that when we go to the well, too many of my colleagues are not \ngoing to understand that this appointment is very important to our \ncountry. At a strategic time when we need friends all over the world, \nwe need somebody who is going to be able to get the job done. Some of \nmy friends say: Let it go, George. It is going to work out.\n  I don't want to take the risk. I came back here and ran for a second \nterm because I am worried about my kids and my grandchildren. I just \nhope my colleagues will take the time before they get to this well and \ndo some serious thinking about whether we should send John Bolton to \nthe United Nations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a second to say to my \nfriend and colleague from Ohio, I have been through a lot of this \ndebate over the last several weeks and months. A lot of things are \ngoing on today, but I hope my colleagues and others--if they have not \nhad a chance to listen to my colleague from Ohio--will read his \ncomments. They are heartfelt. I know the feeling. I remember several \noccasions, but there was a time when I was one of two Democrats to \nsupport John Tower many years ago, when he was being considered for the \nnomination as Secretary of Defense. I supported John Ashcroft to be \nAttorney General from the previous administration.\n  I know when you are being different and standing up and going against \nthe tide from people on your own side, it can be a lonely moment. I \nknow what it feels like to be there. If you do it out of conviction and \nbelief and because of how important these issues are, then I think all \nof us, regardless of where you\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\ncome out on the issue, appreciate the courage and the determination of \na Member who does it.\n  I am comfortable with my colleagues' remarks, with his position. As I \ntold him the other day, I have been here a long time now--24 years in \nthe Senate--and there are moments like this when I am deeply proud to \nserve with my colleagues. George Voinovich and I don't agree on a lot \nof issues. We are of different political persuasions and parties. But \nmy respect for him as a Member of this body is tremendous. Whether you \nagree with George Voinovich or not, this is a Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I deeply respect my colleague from Ohio, \nand I deeply respect the passion that he brings to his concern about \nthis nomination.\n  I also bring passion and concern. I have been involved as chairman of \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and have been looking at \nthe U.N. and the oil for food scandal--a scandal which allowed Saddam \nHussein to rebuild his military capacity, to bribe individuals close to \nthe leadership of member states of the Security Council, to fund \nterrorism. I have looked at the U.N. over recent years, at the scandals \nof sexual abuse and child prostitution in Africa, where U.N. officials \nwere not responded to for months and months. I have looked at the world \nin which we live, and the challenges we face, and I realize the United \nStates cannot be the world's sole policeman, the world's sole \nhumanitarian provider. We cannot do it on our own. We need partners and \nwe need a U.N. that is strong and credible.\n  This President has made a decision that the person who can best do \nthe heavy lifting that is required for U.N. reform is John Bolton. He \ndoes that by looking at the record of John Bolton. I respect the \nPresident for that commitment to reform the United Nations, and as I \nlook at this dangerous world in which we live, I think it is essential \nthat we seize this moment of opportunity now. I think it is essential \nthat we confirm this nomination.\n  The reality is that John Bolton is a man of strong conviction. \nClearly, there are some differences of perspective even in the State \nDepartment. There was an editorial in the Washington Post on May 12 of \nthis year in which the writer said:\n\n       The committee interviews have provided some colorful \n     details without breaking new ground on what has long been a \n     well-understood split in the first Bush administration, a \n     split between those who saw themselves as the pragmatic \n     diplomats, (the Powell camp) and those, like Mr. Bolton, who \n     saw themselves as more willing to bruise feelings here and \n     abroad in standing up for U.S. interests.\n\n  In the end, the Post concludes:\n\n       The nominee is intelligent and qualified; we still see no \n     compelling reason to deny the president his choice.\n\n  Former Secretary of State--perhaps the model of the Secretaries of \nState--Lawrence Eagleburger, a career foreign service officer, said in \nan April 22 Washington Post op-ed:\n\n       The real reasons Bolton's opponents want to derail his \n     nomination are his oft-repeated criticism of the United \n     Nations and other international organizations, his rejection \n     of the arguments of those who ignore or excuse the \n     inexcusable (i.e., the election of Sudan to the Human Rights \n     Commission) . . .\n\n  And a couple weeks ago the election of Zimbabwe.\n\n       As to the charge that Bolton has been tough on \n     subordinates, I can say only that in more than a decade of \n     association with him at the State Department, I never saw or \n     heard anything to support such a charge. Nor do I see \n     anything wrong with his challenging intelligence analysts on \n     their findings.\n\n  My colleague from Ohio and my colleagues across the aisle talked \nabout an incident with an analyst--Westermann--in which Bolton had a \nspeech that he was preparing on the issue of Cuba's capacity to develop \nbiological weapons. That speech then was supposed to be sent to \nanalysts in the process. That is the process--send it around to \nanalysts and they come back and tell you whether you can say what you \nwant to say. In the end, the speeches have to get cleared.\n  What happened with Mr. Westermann is this. What you have heard so far \nis that John Bolton was angry at Mr. Westermann. My colleague from Ohio \nsaid he was quite upset as to why he would change language. That is \nwhat happened. What happened is not that Westermann sent something \naround and then got it back, and then Bolton had a concern with the \nconclusion. What happened is that when Bolton gave the document with \nthe language to Westermann, he sent it on. What he told Bolton's chief \nof staff was: I sent your language to the CIA intact and only at its \nsource citations.\n  What really happened, and what the record shows and demonstrates, is \nthat what Westermann did is that he had sent it around, but he inserted \nlanguage that basically said what Bolton wanted to say would not fly. \nSo Bolton doesn't know, when he gets it back, that that piece is out. \nClearly, he wanted to say it, but they said he could not. His concern \nwith Westermann--and the testimony reflects this also--was not about \npolicy. He said: I disagree with you going behind my back. I disagree \nwith you not being honest with me, not telling me up front that in fact \nthis is what you did rather than saying I circulated it, but I find out \nthat, in effect, you lied to me.\n  John Bolton was angry and he said: I have lost confidence in someone \nwho cannot be honest with me, who goes behind my back, and I have to \nfind out about it from another source. That was the conversation he had \nwith Westermann. What you hear and what is portrayed about Mr. Bolton \nis that somehow there is this pattern of abuse. What is cited is that \nhe had this conversation with Westermann--by the way, after that \nconversation, Mr. Bolton did check with Westermann's superiors and got \nan e-mail. We heard about that e-mail. The e-mail said--and this is \nfrom Mr. Fingar, one of the superiors of Westermann:\n\n       We screwed up but not for base reasons. It won't happen \n     again.\n\n  So Bolton finds out that he has been tooled by somebody who did not \ntell him the truth about what happened. He checks with his superior and \ngets an e-mail that says, by the way, we made a mistake, this will not \nhappen again.\n  My colleague from Ohio says they were just doing that because they \nfound out somebody was upset. But if you are looking at it from John \nBolton's perspective, what you see is: I was angry because somebody did \nsomething which is confirmed by their source, the senior person there, \nthat, in fact, what they did was wrong.\n  It is interesting because Fingar basically said it was not a big \ndeal. As far as I am concerned, that closed it.\n  We get a representation somehow that did not close it, that John \nBolton is going around pounding this issue and looking for retribution \nwith Mr. Westermann. In fact, the report shows just the opposite.\n  What happened here is Bolton was upset. He went to the guy who caused \nthe problem. He also tried contacting his superior. He was not around. \nHe eventually got to Fingar who came back with an e-mail--I use his \nlanguage--``We screwed up,'' and that is it. That is it.\n  Then we hear the testimony of Carl Ford, a long-term, good, loyal \nemployee of the State Department, and we hear about Ford and his \nrepresentations about Mr. Bolton. John Bolton's interaction with Carl \nFord was a 2 or 3-minute conversation in front of a water fountain. So \nit was not a matter of somebody going around to get retribution and \nthey are angry. That was it, literally Bolton ran into Ford at a water \nfountain. What Ford was upset about was that John Bolton went to his \nguy. It was his guy on his team. Ford was upset with that. I guess you \nhave two guys with pretty strong feelings. But that was the \nconversation.\n  John Bolton did not call the Secretary of State, did not call the \nDeputy Secretary of State, did not call others in the Department, did \nnot pursue it. If I am angry about something, really angry about \nsomething, I want to take care of it and I take care of it, \nparticularly a guy like John Bolton. He is not a soft guy, no question \nabout that. But the interaction regarding Westermann was bumping into \nsomeone at a water fountain and having an exchange. Westermann's boss \nbasically said: Don't mess with my guys. And that is Mr. Ford. His \nexperience with John Bolton is essentially that 2-minute conversation--\nthat is it--I think until he leaves.\n  Then the only other conversation on the record that Mr. Bolton had \nabout Mr. Westermann is a number of months later, he was visiting with \nanother official within the agency and asked how\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\nare things going and is there anything that troubles you? Only when \nasked that question does he even bring up the incident again, and that \nis it.\n  So this image being portrayed about somehow hounding down a lower \nlevel employee--by the way, Westermann was a 20-year Navy veteran; he \nwas not a kid wet behind his ears. I have to tell you, if it was the \nprivate sector, Mr. Westermann may have been fired for not being honest \nwith his superior, for going behind somebody's back. That is what \nhappened.\n  I want to go back to the Washington Post article, the Eagleburger \ncomment. Here is what is really happening here. When John Bolton's name \nwas put forward as the nomination by the President, my colleagues on \nthe other side made it very clear they were going to oppose this \nnomination. The issue then was his comments he made about the United \nNations. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle did not think \nJohn Bolton was respectful enough of the United Nations and he did not \ndeserve to be confirmed. That was the issue. It was about policy \ndifferences between John Bolton and my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  What happened is because that argument did not sell, they then began \nan examination of some of these interpersonal exchanges and what became \nthe Westermann issue, what became a series of contacts with John \nBolton, with legitimate concerns, characterized as a series of a \npattern abuser.\n  There were concerns raised about North Korea and about John Bolton's \ncomments regarding North Korea, somehow that he was straying off \nmessage, that he was saying things that should not have been said, that \nhe gave a speech in July 2000 in which I think he called Kim Jong Il, \nthe North Korean President, a tyrant, which, by the way, he is. The \ncomment was he was straying off message, that he was saying things that \nshould not have been said.\n  I have a copy of a letter from former Secretary of State Colin \nPowell. It is dated August 26, 2003, when he was Secretary of State. He \nis sending a letter to Jon Kyl of the Senate. He says:\n\n       Dear Jon, I am pleased to reply to your recent letter \n     concerning John Bolton's speech in Korea and our reaction.\n       Undersecretary's Bolton speech was fully cleared within the \n     Department. It was consistent with Administration policy, did \n     not really break new ground with regard to our disdain for \n     the North Korean leadership and, as such, was official.\n\n  `` . . . and, as such, was official.'' ``Fully cleared,'' ``was \nofficial.''\n  If one sat here and listened to what was said before, one would think \nsomehow this guy was off there on his own saying things that were \ndisruptive to policy.\n  That is not the way it works. For the public who may not understand, \nwhen we have a senior State Department official making speeches in \nNorth Korea, making speeches about Cuba and its policy regarding \nprocurement of biological weapons, these speeches are cleared. There is \na process. There is not a single instance in the record where John \nBolton is somehow substantiated for having said things that were not \npolicy, said things that were disruptive of policy.\n  At times did he challenge analysts? Yes, he did, and that is probably \na pretty good thing to do. Analysts do not speak from a holy mountain. \nThey come in with a perspective. We have seen enough history now in the \nlast couple of years where analysts had a perspective and they were \nwrong. John Bolton challenged analysts, but in the end, each and every \ntime, what he did was he delivered the message he was supposed to be \ndelivering.\n  There was a question concerning Libya and the allegation, by the way, \nin Newsweek--an allegation in Newsweek. My colleagues quote Newsweek as \nif it is the Holy Bible. Newsweek--credible reporting that he was \nsidelined, and then there was a conversation, an anonymous source, that \nsomehow the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was complaining to \nPowell about John Bolton. The anonymous source, according to a Bush \nofficial, told them that Secretary of State Powell's Under Secretary \nfor Arms Control was making it impossible to reach allied agreement on \nIran's nuclear program. Powell turned to an aide and said: Get a \ndifferent view on the problem, Bolton is being too tough. Jack Straw \nflatly rejects this. Here is what Straw's press spokesman is saying:\n\n       Conversations between the Foreign Secretary and our U.S. \n     counterpart are private and we do not normally comment on \n     their content. However, the Foreign Secretary has no \n     recollection whatsoever of telling the U.S. administration or \n     any other whom it should or should not put in charge of its \n     business. John Bolton held a senior position in \n     counterproliferation arms control in the last administration \n     and senior UK officials worked closely with him on a range of \n     issues.\n\n  The bottom line is Mr. Powell never told Mr. Bolton he was being too \ntough in dealing with our European allies. Mr. Bolton has continued to \nrepresent the Bush administration's firm position that Iran has yet to \nmake their strategic decision not to pursue nuclear weapons capability \nand, therefore, Iran's violation of its commitments under the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty should be referred to the United Nations \nSecurity Council.\n  There was another concern about an article 98 issue. The allegation \nwas that somehow Mr. Bolton blocked military aid for Eastern European \nNATO candidate countries, even though there are article 98 \nrestrictions, concerns for not agreeing to take U.S. servicemen to the \nInternational Criminal Court, have been waived. Bolton wanted to \npressure them to sign the article 98 agreements.\n  Rich Armitage, the No. 2 person at the State Department under Colin \nPowell, has refuted this claim. He said: I did not consider this \nunusual at all. Different fiefdoms at State often have different \npositions and Deputy Secretaries resolve them. It was part and parcel \nof daily life. Again, allegation made and claim simply not true.\n  I could go on. I would just like to touch upon a few more. One of \nthem had to do with an allegation that Mr. Bolton, before he worked for \nthe State Department, was involved in a situation where he yelled at a \ncolleague, a woman whom he worked with. I think this conversation was \nsupposed to have taken place in Moscow at the time. This individual \nsaid that Bolton had yelled and screamed at her, chased her around.\n  We had a full committee hearing. The allegation was raised. It was \nraised in front of the press, raised in front of the media that somehow \nJohn Bolton--there was a source that said this woman had complained. It \nended up that this woman, a very political woman, one of the leaders of \nMothers Against Bush, a liberal activist, had made the claim on liberal \nAir America. Under questioning, when asked about whether she had been \nchased or harassed by Mr. Bolton, her testimony was: Well, I may have \noverstated that.\n  We then get letters from the president of the company that held the \ncontract for which this woman worked. He said: I certainly did not hear \ncontemporaneously from any other employee in Moscow that anything \noccurred between Mr. Bolton and Ms. Townsel in Moscow. Consequently, it \nis difficult to understand how she could make such accusations with any \nveracity. He then went on to talk about some of her conduct and was \nvery concerned about that. He concluded that he found Bolton to be very \nintelligent, hard working, loyal, ethical, and there was nothing to \nthis. Ultimately, my colleagues on the other side kind of dropped that \nbut after it was made public, after they discussed it in public, though \nI believe they had in their hands the same letters, the same rebuttal. \nThat is one of the problems. There are individuals who--John Bolton, by \nthe way, has been before this Senate three and perhaps four times. He \nhas been before this body, been scrutinized, been confirmed three to \nfour times. Now we reach a point, and maybe it is the atmosphere around \nhere, maybe the partisan divide has gotten so great, but what starts \nout with a concern over policy then slips into attacks on the personal. \nPeople's character is disparaged, even though there is no basis for it, \ndisparaged publicly, disparaged in the media.\n  Folks then rely upon credible reporting in Newsweek magazine, when \nthe sources then who are close to the issue come back and say that \ncredible reporting simply is not very credible. People go through a \nringer. If I was listening to some of these allegations, I would come \nto some conclusions about character, but then when one looks, for \ninstance, at the Westermann incident and hears about serial abuse, they \nfind out it was one conversation because\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nMr. Bolton believed he got stabbed in the back; that the other \nconversation took place over a water fountain and that was it, except \nwhen asked, about 6 months later, ``Is there anything that bothered \nyou?'' and he said, ``He has not bothered me.'' But we get a \ncharacterization of temperament and loss of temper and somehow being \nimpolitic. It is simply not credible.\n  I was there for just about every portion of every hearing and heard \nall the evidence. For all of these claims that are made, if one looks, \nas they say, at the rest of the story, they find out that they are not \ncredible.\n  It really gets back perhaps to where we started, that in the end this \nis about policy. We should end where it began. There are those who \nsimply disagree with Mr. Bolton's approach. When I say ``approach,'' \nMr. Bolton has made it very clear that he believes in the institution; \nthat he is committed. He made the commitment--and I am going to take \nhim at his word--to work with the institution. That is what he is going \nto do.\n  I think we have to take him at his word, and we have to accept the \nfact that the President believes that U.N. reform is important and Mr. \nBolton has the capacity to do the job. He negotiated the Treaty of \nMoscow, negotiated the U.N. reversing its position on a resolution that \nhad been in place a number of years which said Israel was a racist \nstate. Everybody said that would be impossible to change, and John \nBolton provided the leadership to get the U.N. to reverse itself on \nthat issue. He clearly has the qualifications and the skills. He has \nthe support of the President. He has the support of the Secretary of \nState. He has my support. I know how important this job is. I know we \nhave this window of opportunity and we have to seize it.\n  I was a former prosecutor, and I know how it works. In Minnesota, the \nprosecution gives a closing argument and the defense goes after. There \nis no prosecution rebuttal. So I would often go in front of the jury \nand I would say: What you have to watch out for is the ``rabbits in the \nhat'' approach, that what you are going to hear come out on the other \nside is they are going to unleash a number of rabbits that are going to \ncome running out of that hat.\n\n  In this case, the first rabbit is of positions on the U.N.; the \nsecond rabbit is of policy positions; the third rabbit is saying things \nthat should not have been said; the fourth rabbit is personal behavior, \net cetera, hoping that somebody on the jury chases one of those \nrabbits. Instead, what we need folks to do is keep their eye on the \nmain thing. The main thing, as Steve Covey said: One thing is keep the \nmain thing the main thing.\n  The main thing is that this President has a belief that this U.N. \nneeds reform. The main thing is that John Bolton has a long and \ndistinguished record of service to this country and an ability to get \nthings done. He has the toughness it is going to take to get 191 \nnations to stop putting Zimbabwe and Sudan on the Human Rights \nCommission. He has that ability. He has the confidence of the \nPresident. In the end, elections matter. The President of the United \nStates won the election. He has chosen someone to carry out that \nvision, and that person has the record and the ability to do that. \nThere is nothing in this record that undermines that. There is nothing \nin this record that he ever said he changed intelligence. There is \nnothing in this record that he ever got anybody fired.\n  What is in this record is a distinguished record that has been \nattacked, savaged, and abused. I hope that does not have the chilling \neffect on others who want to serve this country.\n  John Bolton is willing to serve this country. He deserves the right \nto do that, and I hope that my colleagues agree and they support his \nconfirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I speak as vice chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, and I oppose the nomination of John \nBolton to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. I purposely \nhighlight that position on the Intelligence Committee because it is Mr. \nBolton's pattern of attempting to distort and to misuse intelligence \nthat is primary as a reason for my opposing his nomination. I have many \nreasons to oppose his nomination, but I will restrict myself to my work \non the Intelligence Committee.\n  Senator Biden and other members of the Foreign Relations Committee \nhave walked through some of these facts, although perhaps not all of \nthem yet, related to Mr. Bolton. So I will not go into all of the \ndetails. I do intend to provide some background and expand on at least \none critical issue. I want to explain why this issue should matter to \nmy colleagues and why Mr. Bolton's actions should disqualify him from \nthis position.\n  As my colleagues know, beginning in June of 2003, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee undertook an exhaustive inquiry into the \nintelligence concerning Iraq prior to the war. After more than a year, \nthe committee unanimously approved a scathing 511 page report \ndescribing the intelligence community's systematic failures, \nparticularly on issues related to weapons of mass destruction. One of \nthe central issues to the committee's review was the question of \n``whether any influence was brought to bear on anyone to shape their \nanalysis to support policy objectives.''\n  It was a question so important, in fact, and so fundamental to our \ncommittee's oversight role that answering it was one of the four \nspecific tasks laid out by Chairman Roberts and me at the beginning of \nthis inquiry.\n  The issue of maintaining objectivity goes to the very heart of \nintelligence and intelligence oversight. Our intelligence agencies are \ncharged with gathering information around the world and then \nobjectively analyzing the information and providing it to the rest of \nthe Government. Intelligence consumers, then, rely on that intelligence \nfor a variety of activities. Often, that information forms the \nfoundation of the very national security policies we depend upon to \nkeep our country safe. It is absolutely essential that our intelligence \nis objective, independent, and accurate. If it is not, then the system \ndoes not work, we waste billions of dollars each year, and we end up \nmaking a critical national security decision or a series of them based \nupon flawed assumptions.\n\n  In the extreme, intelligence that is manipulated or shaped to fit \npreconceived conditions could lead the country into a war that we \nshould not be fighting. This, of course, was the concern that many of \nus had when we began our investigation of prewar intelligence. It was a \ncentral point of the committee's review--a central point. It was \nsomething we pursued aggressively. In that case, the committee did not \nfind evidence that the administration officials as a whole attempted to \ncoerce, influence, or pressure analysts to specifically change their \njudgments--specifically change their judgments--relating to Iraq's WMD. \nI supported that finding, although in my additional views I described \nwhat I thought was a more pervasive environment of pressure, created \nprior to the war, to reach conclusions that supported the \nadministration's policies.\n  I describe this effort now, however, not to revisit these issues that \nwe investigated but to impress upon my colleagues and the public how \nserious it is when policymakers are accused of attempting to manipulate \nthe intelligence process. This is behavior we cannot tolerate, and this \nis the pattern of behavior Mr. Bolton has exhibited during his tenure \nas Under Secretary of State. As I said, Senator Biden, Senator Dodd, \nand others have done a superb job in describing the specific incidents. \nLet me add a few points to provide context for these episodes.\n  First, I want everyone to understand that the Intelligence Committee \nwas aware of these allegations long before Mr. Bolton was nominated to \nthis job. These are not incidents dredged up after he had been \nnominated.\n  The committee's Iraq report briefly mentions the case of an INR \nanalyst--that is, the State Department intelligence analyst--who had \nthe courage to stand up in a committee hearing and acknowledge what he \ndescribed as political pressure. When the committee staff interviewed \nthis analyst, they discovered that the instance involved Cuba and not \nIraq. That being the case, the committee did not pursue a review \nbecause we were doing Iraq, not Cuba.\n  Unfortunately, the committee's final report described and commented \non this incident without conducting a\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\ncomplete investigation of the facts. It is now clear from the record \ndeveloped by the Foreign Relations Committee in their excellent work \nthat Under Secretary Bolton attempted to exact retribution against this \nintelligence analyst because his analysis did not support Mr. Bolton's \nviews.\n  As with the case of the INR analyst, the State Department analyst, \nthe committee previously was aware of the allegations of politicization \nrelated to the former National Intelligence Officer for Latin America. \nWe knew about it. In the course of a briefing to the committee staff in \nNovember of 2004, this individual described an effort to have him \nremoved because his analysis was at odds with the views of certain \npolicymakers, including Secretary Bolton. Unfortunately, the committee \ndid not follow up on these allegations until March, when the minority \nstaff on the committee began scheduling interviews. I speak now of the \nIntelligence Committee, not the Foreign Relations Committee. It is \nclear from these interviews that the minority staff on the Intelligence \nCommittee did and from the much more extensive work done by the Foreign \nRelations Committee that Under Secretary Bolton and others, \nparticularly Otto Reich, who was Acting Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Latin America, sought to have the National Intelligence Officer \nreassigned because his analysis did not support their policies.\n\n  These two episodes, in my mind, are enough to disqualify Mr. Bolton \nfrom this position. But there is more to this pattern of abusing the \nintelligence process. During the course of the nomination process, we \nlearned that on at least 10 occasions, Mr. Bolton had sought to learn \nthe identity of 19 U.S. persons--this has been discussed on the Senate \nfloor, but I am going to add something--19 U.S. persons mentioned in \nintelligence reports. There has been a great deal of speculation as to \nwhy he wanted these names, whether it was proper to seek this \ninformation.\n  To answer these questions, Chairman Lugar asked Chairman Roberts and \nme to solicit information from the appropriate agencies. Eventually--\neventually--eventually, the new Principal Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence, GEN Michael Hayden, briefed Senator Roberts and myself. \nHe did not brief Senator Lugar and Senator Biden--Chairman Lugar and \nRanking Member Biden. That is a mystery to me. I don't understand that. \nBut he briefed us on the content of the intelligence in question.\n  Let me be clear. We did not receive the names, the very names \nprovided to Under Secretary Bolton--which is an extraordinary sense of \ncontrol of one branch of Government over another. We did not receive \nthose names. We read everything associated with those names but not the \nnames themselves. They were not given to us.\n  Based on my limited review, I noted from the rest of the context \nnothing improper about the request. That, however, was not the end of \nthe story. As part of our effort to respond to Chairman Lugar's request \nfor information, the committee staff interviewed several individuals \nwith knowledge of Under Secretary Bolton's request for these names. \nDuring one of those interviews, a senior member of his staff described \nactions Under Secretary Bolton took after he received one of those \nnames.\n  According to this individual, upon receiving the name from the \nNational Security Agency, the NSA, Under Secretary Bolton shared that \ninformation with another State Department official. The reasons for \nthis action are not clear, but it seems inconsistent with the stated \nreasons for obtaining the name.\n  Let me explain. I must take a moment to describe the information we \nare talking about and put Mr. Bolton's action in some context. When a \nU.S. intelligence agency--in this case, the National Security Agency--\nreceives a report that includes information concerning a U.S. person, \nthat information is, so to speak, minimized--that is the technical \nterm--for privacy reasons, meaning that the U.S. name is replaced with \na generic designation such as ``named U.S. Government official,'' or \n``named U.S. citizen,'' but that is all. Remember, this is information \nthat is already classified at the highest levels, or it would not \nreceive this treatment--classified at the highest levels and shared \nwith a very limited number of people in order to protect the source of \nthat information. The U.S. name is even more closely guarded and not \nprovided unless an appropriately cleared official reading that \nintelligence report makes a specific request for it in order to better \nunderstand the foreign intelligence, and it is only intelligence that \nthat person can be concerned with.\n  The rules for dealing with this kind of comprehensive information are \nvery strict. It is only provided on a case-by-case basis at the request \nof a specific individual. The National Security Agency has a formal and \nvery well established procedure for processing such requests and for \nproviding the names to the requester.\n  When a decision is made to release the name, it is transmitted with a \ncover sheet with the following admonition:\n\n       Request no further action be taken on this information \n     without prior approval of the National Security Agency.\n\n  Probably that would not have to be there because anybody at that \nlevel understands that already, but nevertheless it is there, front and \ncenter. This language is clear. This language is unambiguous. But Mr. \nBolton apparently disregarded it. Neither the NSA, the National \nSecurity Agency, nor the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and \nResearch has a record of him seeking the necessary approval to further \ndisseminate the name. Now his defenders say he never saw that \nrestriction. I don't know if that is accurate, but I do know that it is \nentirely irrelevant because he knew about that. Anybody who is \nexperienced to receive intelligence at that level has to know that.\n\n  He knew the classification of the intercepts. He knew the sensitivity \nof information referencing U.S. persons. He knew the special procedures \nhe had to go through to get that name. He knew the requirement to \nclosely guard this information, even if he had not seen the specific \nlanguage on the transmittal letter. Any attempt to place blame for his \naction on others is thinly veiled, sad, and wrong.\n  I still have questions about this episode, but it appears to me on \nits face that he violated the restrictions placed on this information \nby the National Security Agency. Even if we discover his actions were \ntechnically not a security violation, if by a 1 in 1,000 percent chance \nit turned out to be true, it emphasizes something even worse, and that \nis a cavalier attitude to be, therefore, projected into the future in \ndealing with extremely sensitive intelligence information.\n  This is part of a pattern which shows a blatant disregard for the \nimportance of the intelligence process which is the spear tip of this \nNation's internal security and security around the world and the \nsensitivity of the information contained in intelligence products.\n  When viewed collectively, these actions demonstrate Mr. Bolton's \nunfitness for this position. I thereby urge my colleagues to oppose his \nconfirmation. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me thank my colleague from West Virginia who holds the \nvery difficult position, along with Senator Roberts, of being the \nranking member and chairman, respectively, of the Intelligence \nCommittee. It is a very difficult job.\n  For those who have served some time, we appreciate immensely the \ntremendous difficulty of trying to manage and handle the information \nthat comes their way. I am particularly grateful to my colleague for \nhis comments here today regarding the issue of the intelligence \nanalysts and the handling of very delicate information.\n  As my colleague from West Virginia knows, and I state this in the \nform of a question, Senator Biden, obviously, and Senator Lugar, going \nback to April 11, have requested information regarding the intercepts \nthat the Senator from West Virginia has just described, along with \nother information from the State Department regarding testimony that \nMr. Bolton was to give before a House committee dealing with weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq. We have been unable the last number of weeks \nto get the necessary information from the administration regarding \nthese allegations.\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\n  As such, we are asking the administration today if they would not be \nforthcoming with that information, to give the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Intelligence Committee unredacted versions of these \nintercepts, along with the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee--not all members of the committee, not all Members \nof the Senate. I believe this is the normal operating procedure when \nmatters like this arise, that requests are made of the administration \nfor information and they go to selected, designated members to review, \nto determine whether there is something that as Members of this body we \nought to be aware of in the consideration--relevant information in the \nconsideration of a nomination.\n  My question is, Is this an inappropriate request from the Senator \nfrom Delaware and the Senator from Indiana, to get unredacted versions, \nto go to the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee \nfor them to be able to review, to determine whether they would be \nrelevant to this nomination?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator from Connecticut it is not only \nappropriate, but it is necessary. The Senator from Connecticut \ndescribed the very condition of its sensitivity and its importance and \ntherefore the importance of its place in this nomination consideration.\n  The fact that only Senator Roberts and myself were briefed for a long \nperiod of time is part of the way the administration either shares very \nsensitive information which they do not want other committee members to \nhave--which, of course, makes other committee members furious, as it \nwould me, but they cannot take chances--but what that emphasizes is the \nimportance and the confidentiality and the high degree of sensitivity \nof the information. When you are putting somebody potentially into the \nUnited Nations to effect policy, to reflect the views of the President \nmore directly than the President can do on a daily basis, to reflect \nthe views of the rest of the world toward the United States, this kind \nof thing must be available to Senator Roberts and myself and, just as \nimportantly, to Senator Lugar as chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for Heavens' sake, and Senator Joe Biden, the ranking \nmember.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me further ask my colleague, if I may, as I understand \nit, when a policymaker requests of the National Security Administration \nthe raw data on an intercept, there must be a written explanation for \nwhy the policy center or policymaker is seeking that information; is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct. And that is not available.\n  Mr. DODD. That was my second question. Was that available to the \nranking member and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. No, it was not available and it is part of this \npattern.\n  We have to decide if there are two branches of Government or one.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague and I appreciate again his comments.\n  I will be very brief in my comments this afternoon. I notice there \nare other Members here. I saw my friend from Virginia, Senator Allen, \nin the Chamber. Senator Coleman of Minnesota has already spoken, but he \nmay want to speak. I think Senator Levin of Michigan may be coming over \nshortly.\n  I will reserve for tomorrow further discussion of the nominee himself \nand the reasons for my objection for this nomination going forward, \nbut, rather, I will focus in these brief minutes, if I may, on where we \nare and the procedural situation in which we find ourselves.\n  I say to my colleagues it is awkward. We have just come through a \nrather contentious period in the history of the Senate over the last \nnumber of days dealing with how we deal with executive branch nominees. \nIt would not have been my choice to have this matter come up in the \nmidst of all this or in the wake of all of this. I would have preferred \nwe had dealt with judicial nominations, which I thought was the primary \nrationale for the crisis we ran into over the extended debate rule.\n  However, it is clearly the choice and the right of the majority, in \nmy view, to set the agenda. As such, they have set the agenda to bring \nMr. Bolton's nomination up before the Senate rather than additional \njudicial nominations before the Memorial Day recess.\n  I have been asked and objected to a unanimous consent request that \nwould have allowed for an up-and-down vote on Mr. Bolton at some point \ntomorrow afternoon. I have said to the majority leader and the minority \nleader, it is not my intention at all to filibuster this nomination. \nThat is not what I want to have occur at all.\n  I have suggested we ask the administration, once again, would they be \nforthcoming and give us this information about the National Security \nAgency intercepts to go just to Senator Rockefeller, Senator Roberts, \nSenator Lugar, and Senator Biden for review to determine what, if any, \ninformation in those 10 intercepts involving 19 names of American \ncitizens that might have some relevancy to the nomination of Mr. \nBolton. That request has been rejected since April 11, basically, and \nthere have been numerous requests.\n  The second request involves a request that Senator Biden has \nexpressed a strong interest in detailed information regarding testimony \nof the weapons of mass destruction in Syria that was to be the subject \nof congressional testimony by Mr. Bolton. That information is also \nbeing sought.\n  I commend and thank the majority leader, by the way. Earlier today in \nmy conversations with him, I expressed that I had no desire to \nfilibuster this nomination but would he transmit the request--I am not \nsuggesting he support the request--but would he transmit the request to \nthe appropriate personnel at the State Department or the White House \nregarding this information. Graciously, the majority leader has said he \nwould do so, and I presume he has.\n  No cloture motion has yet been filed, but it is my understanding, \nbecause it is the way I framed the request, that I would not insist \nupon a normal period of time to expire before a cloture motion could be \ninvoked, or could be raised, nor would I insist that there be an \nadequate amount of time after the cloture motion, if it were invoked, \nbe required, the 30 hours of debate; but, rather, we would truncate all \nof that some time tomorrow afternoon to give everyone an exact time to \nexpress themselves on either the motion to invoke cloture or on the \nnomination itself.\n  If we are unable to get this data, information, which has been \nrequested now for 6 weeks, I will urge my colleagues not to invoke \ncloture. I would do so most reluctantly, and I urge my colleagues, \nregardless of feelings about the nominee.\n  This is what I want to address. We all have had strong views on Mr. \nBolton. I see my friend from Virginia. He has been eloquent in his \ndefense of Mr. Bolton, as has my friend from Minnesota.\n  I listened to the remarkable speech given by our colleagues: Senator \nVoinovich of Ohio, Senator Biden, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nRockefeller, and others. There are strong feelings about this \nnomination. But put aside your strong feelings about the nominee and \nthink for a minute about what we are asking for as an institution; that \nis, data that pertains to this nomination.\n  I noted with some interest earlier today that one of the newspapers \nthat covers Capitol Hill reported that a House Appropriations \nCommittee, obviously under the control of the Republicans--the \nmajority--was expressing a similar problem in getting information out \nof the administration on matters they thought were important.\n  I do not think this desire to deprive the committees of information \non Mr. Bolton is unique. I believe it is a pattern that we, as Members \nof this coequal branch of Government, must defend ourselves on, that if \nthe administration--this administration or any administration--believes \nthey can successfully deprive legitimate requests for information \npertaining to a matter that is before us, particularly one that invokes \nas much debate as this nomination has, then we all suffer. Whether you \nare for Mr. Bolton or against Mr. Bolton is not the point. The point \nis, we ought to have a right to have information given to us, under \ncontrolled circumstances--not to the availability\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\nof every Member under every circumstance but we have set up mechanisms \nwhich allow us to have information to determine its relevancy to \nsomething such as this.\n  Consider, if you will--I am speaking hypothetically now, obviously--\nthat the administration deprives us of this information, the Senate \ninvokes cloture, and there is then a vote to confirm Mr. Bolton and in \na matter of days or weeks we discover that the very information \nrequested is so damming that every Member of this body would have been \nagainst the nomination had they known the information at the time of \nthe vote. There is the possibility of that, I would suggest to my \ncolleagues, or I would not have requested the information.\n  How would we feel institutionally at that point if we did not stand \nup for ourselves as Senators in insisting that this administration--or \nany administration when there was a legitimate request for information \npertaining to a nomination such as this--ought to be forthcoming, and \nwe ought not to have to go through the parliamentary procedures and \ndebates and invoking various tactics in order to put pressure, in order \nto get this information? It seems to me that ought to be forthcoming. \nFor those reasons, I am grateful to the majority leader for \ntransmitting the request.\n  I have also said, just to complete this, that if, in fact, cloture is \ninvoked, that then I am prepared to vote immediately thereafter on the \nBolton nomination. To make my point, I am not anxious for an extended \ndebate or filibuster beyond cloture. Obviously, if cloture is not \ninvoked, then my assumption would be the matter would go over until \nafter the Memorial Day recess, in which case we might have some \nadditional time to solicit the information we are seeking.\n  My preference would be we get the information. We still have time. It \nis only 5:30 in the evening tonight. If the administration would say: \nListen, we can give you this information--even if we do not get it \nuntil tomorrow morning, there ought to be adequate enough time, from \ntomorrow morning to the afternoon, by the appropriate committees to go \nover the unredacted versions of this--by the way, not crossing out the \nnames of the very people we want to know--who they are--in addition to \nthe rationale for the request, so we can make a determination as to \nwhether those intercepts, and the requests of them, have pertained to \nMr. Bolton's determination to punish certain people in the intelligence \nbranch of the State Department because of their analysis that Mr. \nBolton had some difficulty with.\n  Also, of course, there is the request that Senator Biden is calling \nupon; that is, whether there was some effort here to cook up the books \nregarding the weapons of mass destruction or the allegation of weapons \nof mass destruction in Syria.\n  That is not going to be that hard. It could be done in a matter of \nhours, and we could then vote on Mr. Bolton's nomination by tomorrow \nafternoon, up or down, one way or the other. I would hope my colleagues \nwould join in this effort. If we tell the administration as a body that \nwe have a right to this information, I would wage anything to my \ncolleagues that the administration would be forthcoming with it. It is \nbecause they believe there are more than 40 Senators here who will vote \nto invoke cloture that they will not provide the information. The \nminute they think we might insist upon seeing it, I think the \ninformation will be forthcoming.\n  There are those who have told me, by the way, as a general matter \nthat while this was an extraordinary request in some sense, in others \nit may not have been an extraordinary request. I am thinking about Mr. \nBolton's request now. So there may very well be there is nothing in \nthese requests that should cause any of us any concern. It may be true, \nas well, regarding the Syria allegations. If that is the case, then \nthere is nothing to fear by any of this to bring it up. But in the \nmeantime, institutionally, in my view, as Senators representing a \ncoequal branch of Government, when there is a legitimate request for \ninformation and an appropriate and proper means by which we receive and \nhandle that information, it ought to be forthcoming. When we fail to \ninsist upon that, in any administration, we weaken the ability of this \nplace to do its job. That is really what is at stake in the debate here \nmore than anything else at this moment.\n\n  Now, there will, obviously, be further debate about Mr. Bolton. We \nall know that. We have been through it. Those of us who serve on this \ncommittee have had hours of debate on this issue. I suspect my friends \nfrom Virginia and Minnesota could quote my remarks about Mr. Bolton, as \nI could theirs. We have listened to each other for countless hours \nabout this issue. Our colleagues will soon get the benefit of these \nremarks as we repeat them again in the next 24 hours or so.\n  That is not the issue tonight for this Senator. The issue for this \nSenator tonight is, does the Senate, as a body, when there is a \nnomination before it--when there is critical information that serious \nMembers of this body believe is pertinent to the debate before us--\nshould we have the ability under controlled circumstances to access \nthat information? If my colleagues believe the answer is no and the \nadministration is not forthcoming, then you ought to invoke cloture. If \nyou believe we ought to have a right to this information, even though \nyou support the nominee, as a matter of principle, as U.S. Senators \ncharged under the Constitution to be responsible for the confirmation \nof high-level Federal employees and nominees, then it seems to me our \nanswer, despite our views about the nominee, ought to be yes and to say \nwith one voice: We support the nominee--if we do--but, Mr. President, \nin your administration, it is appropriate that you be forthcoming on \nthe request.\n  There is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the ranking \nmember, and there is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nand the ranking Democrat--four Senators. For them to get the unredacted \nversions of these intercepts and the information regarding Syria is not \nsome breach of intelligence. Remember, Mr. Bolton and his staff had \naccess to this information. They could read those names. They know what \nis in it. Does some Under Secretary of State have more rights than the \nSenator from Virginia or the Senator from Minnesota or the Senator from \nConnecticut or the Senator from Kansas? I don't think so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the minority has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will conclude just by saying I would hope \nmy colleagues would consider this, and rather than get to the point \ntomorrow night of having to invoke cloture, would they not even quietly \nask the administration to be forthcoming? We do not need to go through \nthis. We could have a vote on Mr. Bolton up or down tomorrow afternoon, \none way or the other, and avoid this precedent-setting circumstance \nwhere legitimate information is not forthcoming. That is the point I \nwanted to make this evening.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly and yield to my \ncolleague from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I would note that the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee is here, and I suspect he will respond to some of these \nissues.\n  There is just one point the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nraised again and again, and I just want to make the Record very clear; \nthat is, again, he stated that it is clear, in his words, that the \nUnder Secretary criticized this employee ``because his analysis did not \nsupport Bolton's view.'' I want to make it clear, the record does not \nsupport that. In fact, it was very clear that John Bolton said to the \nintelligence analyst:\n\n       You are welcome to disagree with me, but not behind my \n     back.\n\n  That is what this was about. In fact, the analyst himself gave some \nconflicting reasons of why he did not tell Bolton that he had tubed his \nlanguage before he sent it around. He never told him that. That is what \nthis is about. In fact, when the analyst was asked whether he disagreed \nwith the statement ``You are welcome to disagree with me''--it is \nBolton speaking to the analyst--``but not behind my back,'' his comment \nwas, ``That does ring a bell.'' So that is what this is about. It is \nabout process, it is not about policy.\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\n  The last thing I would note is that we have had 10 hours of hearings, \n35 separate staff interviews, 2 business meetings, 29 different people \nproducing 1,000 pages of transcripts and 800 pages of documents from \nthe State Department. This individual has gone through a very thorough \nreview.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Connecticut not holding us up.\n  Clearly, if cloture is invoked, we could wait another 30 hours. I \nthank him for that. But the record is clear it is time to move forward.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my wonderful colleague from \nMinnesota, Senator Coleman, for his rebuttals of what has been said. As \nSenator Coleman and I have listened to this in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for many weeks--and all of these different issues and \nallegations and charges that have been refuted--we understand that what \nwe are now off on are the detours and tangents, avoiding the reality \nand what is important; that is, John Bolton being the right person to \nbring accountability, being a watchdog for the $2 billion the American \ntaxpayers send to the United Nations every year. The United Nations \nought not to be a front for terrorist organizations or anti-\nAmericanism.\n  John Bolton has a record of performance that is exemplary, from the \nProliferation Security Initiative to repealing the odious resolution \nthat likened Zionism to racism. They don't want to talk about the \nUnited Nations and the reform that is needed.\n  They talk about John Bolton being straightforward. He is \nstraightforward. He is not going to get seduced by the flowery language \nand pontifications of bureaucrats internationally. He is going to \nadvance freedom and the interests of the United States and get other \ncountries to join us.\n  Having been a quarterback, there is a key player you always want to \nput in when you want to refute allegations of the side in opposition. I \nnote that all of these individuals who have been criticizing Mr. \nBolton, before they heard any of these allegations about intercepts, \nanything about the sensibilities of different Government officials \nbeing offended by Mr. Bolton, all of them--Senators Biden, Boxer, \nKerry, Dodd, Sarbanes, and Rockefeller--in 2001, voted against Mr. \nBolton in his position as Under Secretary before they heard any of \nthese allegations.\n  Now to talk about and to present the facts on this latest fishing \nexpedition that we are hearing from the opposition of Mr. Bolton \ninsofar as the conversations, the perfect person to speak on this and \nto answer the issue is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Roberts of Kansas. He will rebut the allegations so far as \nmatters dealing with intelligence are concerned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is now recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Chair. I certainly thank the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia. This is sort of a quandary for me in that \nsitting in my office listening to the debate, I was having a hard time \nputting two and two together with my understanding of what the \nIntelligence Committee determined--not the committee but the vice \nchairman and myself. And in listening to the statements, they just \ndidn't jibe. It is not my intent to perjure the intent of the \ndistinguished vice chairman, but I sure have a different take on this. \nI think it is supported by facts.\n  I am rising in the hope of providing some clarification surrounding \none of the issues related to the nomination of John Bolton to be U.S. \nambassador to the U.N.\n  On April 28, the vice chairman and I, Vice Chairman Rockefeller, \nreceived a letter from the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar. In that letter, the chairman asked \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee to look into all information \nsurrounding the process by which Mr. Bolton, between the years 2001 and \n2004, requested the names of U.S. persons that had been redacted from \nvarious intelligence products. The Intelligence Committee was asked to \nsolicit all information regarding the process by which Mr. Bolton's \nrequests were handled, the contents of the responses, and the process \nby which they were communicated, as well as any conclusions reached by \nthe appropriate intelligence agencies or elements thereto as to any \nviolations of procedures or directives or regulations or law by those \nwith knowledge of Mr. Bolton's requests. That was a pretty clear \nletter. That sets out some pretty clear questions.\n  It is my understanding that the vice chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished vice chairman and a person whom I respect, Senator \nRockefeller, sent his own letter to Senator Biden with a different \ninterpretation of the issues than I have described. I also understand \nthat Senator Biden read that letter on the floor this afternoon. I \nregret that a meeting in the Intelligence Committee did prevent me from \nresponding at that particular time, but since the distinguished vice \nchairman has made his remarks and his interpretation, perhaps this \ntiming is even better. But what I don't understand is why the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware read only one of the letters from \nthe vice chairman when he had both in his possession.\n\n  Nevertheless, in his letter of April 28, Senator Lugar asked the \nIntelligence Committee to assist the Foreign Relations Committee in \nascertaining the facts. This is what I attempted to do, and I think my \nletter certainly speaks for itself. Unfortunately, I believe that the \nvice chairman's account did omit some important facts which I believe \ngive a much clearer picture of what actually took place.\n  This morning, I sent a letter back to Senator Lugar detailing my \nfindings and conclusions. This letter, which was also provided to \nSenator Biden, provides the rest of the story. With your indulgence, I \nwill read my letter into the Record, as addressed to the Honorable \nRichard G. Lugar, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. It \nreads:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman:\n       I write in response to your April 28, 2005 letter asking \n     this committee to examine a number of intelligence-related \n     issues that have been raised during the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations' consideration of the nomination of Under Secretary \n     John Bolton to be the United States Representative to the \n     United Nations. My hope was to respond jointly with Vice \n     Chairman Rockefeller.\n       While we both agreed there was nothing within the contents \n     of the intelligence reports in question that caused us any \n     concern, we were unable to agree on a final text in response.\n\n  This was not for lack of trying. One day, 2 days, 3 days, a week, I \nthink it was 10 days, trying to work out a joint letter. It just didn't \nhappen. So we have two versions. I don't quite understand why, but \nespecially since we both met with General Hayden, who is the Director \nof National Intelligence and who was the head of the NSA and, as such, \nis the head of intercepts and signals intelligence.\n  I might say right now that I really do not like this business of \ncoming to the floor of the Senate and talking about signals \nintelligence and intercepts. That causes me great concern. It is of the \nhighest classification.\n  I continued to Senator Lugar:\n\n       Nevertheless, I am going to convey to you my findings and \n     conclusions.\n       After completing an examination of these issues I have \n     found no evidence that there was anything improper about any \n     aspect of Mr. Bolton's requests for minimized identities of \n     U.S. persons. I further found no violations of procedures, \n     directives, regulations or law by Mr. Bolton. Moreover, I am \n     not aware that anyone involved in handling these requests had \n     any concerns regarding these requests at any point in the \n     process.\n       State Department records indicate that Under Secretary \n     Bolton's office did request the minimized identities of U.S. \n     persons that are contained in the National Security Agency \n     signals intelligence products on ten separate occasions. \n     Every request was processed by the State Department's Bureau \n     of Intelligence and Research.\n\n  The acronym for that is INR.\n\n       In each case, INR personnel followed standard procedure by \n     preparing a written request which included a justification \n     for the request.\n       INR sought the identities on behalf of Secretary Bolton's \n     office in each instance to better understand or assess the \n     foreign intelligence value of the information that was \n     contained in these documents. Senior INR officials were then \n     responsible for determining whether the requests were \n     reasonably related to Under Secretary Bolton's area of \n     responsibility.\n\n  Continuing my response to Senator Lugar:\n\n       In every instance, they were so determined and \n     electronically transmitted to the NSA for approval. The NSA \n     approved all ten of\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\n     Mr. Bolton's requests and transmitted its responses to [the \n     State Department and the] INR. INR officials then notified \n     Mr. Bolton's staff that they had received the responses and \n     made them available.\n       Committee staff interviewed INR analysts and NSA officials \n     responsible for processing the requests for the identities of \n     U.S. persons contained in signals intelligence products. None \n     of the individuals interviewed indicated that there was \n     anything improper or inappropriate about Mr. Bolton's \n     request.\n       We were also briefed by General Michael Hayden, former \n     Director of the NSA and current Principal Deputy Director of \n     National Intelligence--\n\n  He is a man who I think gives the best briefing of anybody in the \nintelligence community, and who was approved in regard to his \nnomination to that position by unanimous consent by this body.\n\n       He also stated that Under Secretary Bolton's requests were \n     not only appropriate, but routine. In fact, INR records \n     indicate that since May 2001, INR submitted 489 other \n     requests for minimized identities.\n\n  John Bolton requested 10.\n\n       Finally, the Vice Chairman and I reviewed all ten \n     documents--\n\n  We reviewed the intercepts. That is what we are supposed to do. That \nis the job of the Intelligence Committee. It is limited to only us two, \nand for darn good reason, because of the classified nature of the \nsubject at hand.\n\n     --containing the references to U.S. persons that generated \n     Under Secretary Bolton's requests. The documents we received \n     did not contain the actual identities of the minimized U.S. \n     persons. After reviewing the content of each report, however, \n     it was apparent to us both--\n\n  This is my recollection of the meeting, and I cannot conceive of any \nother recollection that is accurate.\n\n     --that it was not necessary to know the actual names to \n     determine whether the requests were proper.\n       Ultimately, I found no basis to question the justification \n     for, or the appropriateness of, Mr. Bolton's requests for the \n     identities of U.S. persons contained therein.\n\n  I continue in my letter to Senator Lugar:\n\n       Further, General Hayden informed us that it is not uncommon \n     for senior government officials above the rank of Assistant \n     Secretary to make such requests. It is worth noting that Mr. \n     Bolton did not request the identity of every U.S. person \n     referenced in the documents which would have been his \n     prerogative.\n\n  I can remember the distinguished vice chairman's comments indicating \nthey didn't even ask for all of them.\n\n       While I found that Mr. Bolton's conduct was entirely \n     appropriate and consistent with the protection of \n     intelligence sources and methods, I did find that there are \n     significant deficiencies in the process by which U.S. person \n     identities are provided to requesters of such information.\n\n  We have had a lot of discussion about questioners.\n\n       As your committee has now learned, a request for a U.S. \n     person identity is a routine occurrence in the intelligence \n     process. The incidental collection of U.S. person identities \n     is a fact of life in the signals intelligence business. \n     Because U.S. persons are not the targets of foreign \n     intelligence collection, their identities are, as a matter of \n     policy, redacted or minimized to protect their privacy. When \n     an intelligence analyst or policymaker determines that a U.S. \n     person identity is necessary to better understand and assess \n     the intelligence value of the information, they are permitted \n     to request that identity. The NSA evaluates that request and \n     either grants it or denies it. As already discussed, all of \n     Mr. Bolton's requests were reviewed by both the INR and NSA \n     and were granted.\n       In the course of our review, we found that the Assistant \n     Secretary for INR requested the identities so that they could \n     be passed to Under Secretary Bolton. The NSA provided the \n     U.S. person identities to the INR in the form of Information \n     Memoranda addressed to the Assistant Secretary for INR. We \n     were provided a copy of one of the memoranda, dated 20 \n     February, 2003. This document included a paragraph which \n     stated:\n       ``You may disseminate the information as requested, \n     provided it retains the classification as stated in paragraph \n     two above. Request no further action be taken on this \n     information without prior approval of NSA.''\n\n  Now, that is important--``request no further action be taken on this \ninformation without prior approval of NSA.''\n\n       The NSA confirmed that it uses standard dissemination \n     guidance language in response to customer requests for \n     release of identities. We were also told that Mr. Bolton was \n     not provided the 20 February 2003 Information Memorandum \n     containing this language.\n       Upon further inquiry, we learned INR does not provide the \n     NSA transmittal sheets containing the U.S. person \n     information, or the handling information contained therein, \n     to the requesters of the identities, nor does it specifically \n     instruct the requester on the handling of such information. \n     The INR passes U.S. person identities verbally, without any \n     further guidance. The NSA expects the INR to provide specific \n     handling instructions at the time INR provides the identity \n     to the requester.\n       Not only did INR not provide such instructions to Mr. \n     Bolton, it does not provide them to anyone. Also, it has \n     never established any formal procedures to train or educate \n     requesters Department-wide on the appropriate handling of \n     U.S. person identities.\n\n  This came as somewhat of a shock to me, and it is something we have \nto review in the Intelligence Committee.\n\n       In fact, in the case of the 20 February 2003 memorandum, \n     the INR did not pass the identity directly to Under Secretary \n     Bolton, but rather passed it to an individual within his \n     office, an action which violated the express dissemination \n     guidance contained in the Information Memorandum. The \n     Assistant Secretary at the time of this violation was Carl \n     Ford.\n       The NSA did not in this particular instance, and does not \n     as a matter of course, do anything to ensure that its \n     dissemination guidance is actually followed by the Assistant \n     Secretary for INR or any official in any other Department \n     government-wide.\n       The NSA depends upon the recipient to provide specific \n     handling instructions to the requester and to handle the \n     information appropriately and in accordance with \n     instructions. It appears that Assistant Secretary Carl Ford \n     did neither in this case. The INR's failure to instruct the \n     recipients of U.S. person identities on their proper handling \n     has left the State Department officials essentially to fend \n     for themselves.\n       During the course of this review, we learned that Mr. \n     Bolton, in the absence of any guidance from INR or the NSA, \n     discussed the U.S. person identity contained in the 20 \n     February 2003 Information Memorandum with one other \n     individual.\n\n  This has been pointed out as a big deal by the vice chairman and my \ngood friends across the aisle.\n\n       This particular individual was the person referenced in the \n     report.\n       This person worked directly for Under Secretary Bolton, \n     possessed the necessary security clearances, received and \n     read the same intelligence report in the course of his \n     duties, and understood that he was the U.S. person referred \n     to therein.\n\n  I don't see what the problem is in that regard. Is this the big \nproblem here that somebody is alleging illegal activities? By the way, \nthe first time I learned about that was reading about it in the New \nYork Times, as opposed to reading the letter disseminated by Senator \nRockefeller to the distinguished vice chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n\n       The NSA request that recipients of information about \n     specific identities of U.S. persons take ``no further \n     action'' with regard to the information provided is driven by \n     concerns about the privacy rights of named individuals. These \n     privacy concerns do derive from Attorney General-approved \n     minimization procedures which regulate the collection, \n     processing, retention, and dissemination of information to, \n     from, or about any U.S. persons. The request is also prompted \n     by concerns about protecting intelligence sources and \n     methods.\n\n  Not to mention the chilling effect it would have in regards to all \nintelligence analysts.\n\n       Mr. Bolton's actions in this instance would not implicate \n     any of these concerns. He discussed the identity with the \n     actual named person who was not only fully cleared to receive \n     the information, but already possessed the same information. \n     It is also important to note that the NSA's guidance is \n     formulated as a ``request,'' not a mandate. When asked why \n     the NSA ``requests'' rather than requires, that ``no further \n     action'' be taken with a U.S. person identifies without prior \n     approval, the NSA responded by stating that the language is \n     now ``currently under review.''\n\n  So it is a pretty nebulous standard we are referring to in terms of \nany alleged misconduct.\n\n       I intend to work closely with the Director of National \n     Intelligence to ensure that our intelligence agencies and \n     elements are doing everything they can to assist and educate \n     the requesters of U.S. person identities in the proper \n     handling and protection of this information. We must do \n     everything we can to not only protect the privacy of our \n     citizens, but to protect and preserve intelligence sources \n     and methods.\n\n  I do not think you will find any quarrel among anyone on the \nIntelligence Committee or the vice chairman or myself on that.\n\n       It is for this reason that I was a bit surprised and \n     dismayed when a member of your committee--\n\n  Again, this is the letter that I sent to Senator Lugar--\n\n     broached this issue in the course of your public confirmation \n     hearings. Normally, intelligence sources and methods are \n     discussed in closed session to protect our continuing ability \n     to collect the intelligence we all agree is so vital to our \n     Nation's security.\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\n       As is often the case, some individuals, who are not \n     familiar with intelligence issues, perceive that something is \n     unusual and concerning when, as in this instance, it is \n     actually very routine. That is why the U.S. Senate created \n     the Intelligence Committee to deal with these issues in an \n     informed, responsible, and secure manner. It is my hope, in \n     the future, intelligence issues will be discussed in \n     executive session so that we can protect what are vital \n     national security assets.\n       I appreciate your recognition of our unique ability to \n     assist with intelligence-related issues as you consider this \n     very important nomination. We take very seriously our \n     oversight responsibilities and our obligation to protect \n     highly sensitive intelligence information. Your consideration \n     of our duty to protect intelligence sources and methods is \n     greatly appreciated.\n       Sincerely Pat Roberts, Chairman.\n\n  With a copy showing to the Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\n  Mr. President, I said I beg your indulgence in the reading of that \nentire letter on the floor of the Senate. That is the text of the \nletter I did send back to Senator Lugar and obviously copied to Senator \nBiden as of this morning.\n  Why my colleagues chose to give you only part of the story is a \nquestion only they can answer. I have my thinking about that, but I am \nnot going to go into that on the floor of the Senate.\n  I also would like to add a bit of texture to some of the statements \nthat have been made here today in regards to Mr. Carl Ford of ``kiss up \nand kick down fame.'' That has been quoted a lot. Mr. Ford has made a \nnumber of other statements that I think are relevant to these issues \nraised by my friends in opposition to Bolton's nomination.\n  For example, on page 276 of the Senate Intelligence Committee's Iraq \nWMD report, Mr. Ford addressed the issue of whether it was appropriate \nfor policymakers to view intelligence assessments with skepticism.\n  I will just tell you that every member of the Intelligence Committee \nnow, after our WMD report, does not take anything at face value, and I \nthink that has helped. We just had a hearing today in which we had a \nresponse that I think was certainly more candid: Tell me what you know; \ntell me what you don't know; tell me what you think. I think there has \nbeen a historic change in the intelligence community as a result of our \nreport and the WMD Commission, appointed by the President and the 9/11 \nCommission, in the interest of all Senators.\n  Mr. Ford said if a policymaker ``believed everything that the \nintelligence community told him, including what INR tells him, he'd be \na fool. You should know better than anybody that a lot of the stuff we \nturn out is''--well, I am going to change the name. I am not going to \nsay what is here. I am going to say it is a lot of what we have in our \nDodge City feedlots--``and that a policymaker who sticks to that \nintelligence, I don't even want to be in the same room with. They've \ngot to know the stuff isn't that good. So the notion that they \nsometimes disagree with us I find fine.''\n\n  That is a little slightly different take on what we have been hearing \nso far. I guess what Mr. Ford meant to say--and he has been before the \ncommittee many times; he is a fine man--is that it is fine to disagree \nwith intelligence analysts as long as you are not John Bolton. I only \nhighlight some of the things to emphasize that there seems to be a \ndouble standard for this particular nominee.\n  With the indulgence of my colleagues, I would also like to address \nsome additional misperceptions about the intelligence community that \nwere published as minority views in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee report on Mr. Bolton's nomination. The minority claims that \npolicymakers should be restricted from making public statements that \n``defame U.S. intelligence agencies.'' I find this to be a rather \nabsurd concept.\n  I do not know how one ``defames'' an entire Government agency, but I \ndo know that criticism played a vital role in our collective effort to \nreform the intelligence community and demand change for failure. I am \nnot aware of any special status that insulates members of the \nintelligence community from criticism, nor should there be. That should \nbe a slam dunk.\n  I am also unaware of any special status that prevents intelligence \nanalysts from having their views or actions challenged by policymakers. \nIntelligence analysis is not an exact science. Intelligence analysts \nare not infallible and their assessments are not unassailable. While \nthe intelligence community has had many successes in the past few years \nfor which it should, and can, be proud--there are many good things they \nhave done in protecting the homeland and providing real-time \nintelligence to the warfighters--astounding failures, such as 9/11 and \nIraq, should make it clear that the intelligence community does make \nmistakes.\n  I often lament that policymakers did not ask enough tough questions \nabout Iraq's suspected WMD programs prior to the war. Let me just say \nthat persistent questioning to an analyst is not viewed by the \nanalysts, in the 250 analysts we interviewed, as being pressured. If \nanything, we should be asking more questions. If anything, several \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee, whom I admire and respect and am \nvery proud to be their chairman, ask more repetitive questions of \nwitnesses every time we have a hearing than people are complaining \nabout in this particular case.\n  Perhaps, if we all had been more diligent, the intelligence community \nwould have been more attuned to the gaps in its information and more \naccurate in its judgment. I, for one, now make it a point to repeatedly \nand persistently question analysts who come before our committee to \nensure that I understand their judgments, understand the information \nupon which they base those judgments, and form my own opinions about \ngaps in their logic.\n  The vice chairman and I have agreed on that, to look at every \ncapability we have in regard to national security threats. Do we have \nthe intelligence capability? Do we have the collection? Do we have the \nanalysis? Is there a consensus threat analysis that makes sense? Are \nthere gaps?\n  We do not want to repeat past mistakes. I am not going to go down the \nlaundry list, starting with Khobar Towers and ending up with 9/11 or \nthe Madrid bombing or whatever it is we are talking about, or the USS \nCole. We have to put that one in.\n  So basically I resent any suggestion that this performance of my duty \nis somehow improper. I do not think that is right. Intelligence is a \nserious business, dealing with life-and-death issues. In my experience, \nour intelligence analysts understand this. They know that defending \ntheir views is vital to the process and are fully capable of doing so. \nThese are individuals who work every day to defeat terror and defend \nour national security. They are tough and they are good. They are not \ndelicate, hothouse flowers unable to defend their views or take \ncriticism. They are, however, humans involved in a fundamentally human \nprocess. Intelligence analysts can make mistakes and their judgments \nare not immune from their own biases.\n  Intelligence assessments should inform policy, not dictate it. \nUltimately, as policymakers we need to understand that intelligence is \nmerely a tool that at times can have great value as well as serious \nlimitations.\n  If we are going to make an informed judgment of Mr. Bolton's fitness \nfor this position, please, I implore my colleagues, let us do it based \nupon all the facts known to us, not just the facts we like or pick out.\n  In conclusion, I have looked at the intercept issue and allegations \nsurrounding Mr. Bolton's management style. I have found nothing which \nwould give me pause in voting for his confirmation. I support the \nBolton nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield before he leaves the floor?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Sure. Why not.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for doing so. Let me preface my \nquestion to him by telling him how much--as I said to Senator \nRockefeller, I have great admiration and respect for the work the \nchairman and the ranking member do.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. DODD. It is a very difficult committee and I respect immensely my \ncolleagues' efforts there. I note in my friend's letter which he has \nprovided and read in detail to us, there was a reference--and to be \nquite candid, I think I am the Senator the Senator is\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\nreferencing here because I am the Senator who raised the question \nduring the Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing of Mr. \nBolton. Here my colleague says, and I am quoting now from page 4, the \nlast paragraph of the Senator's letter to Senator Lugar, and I am \ngetting down near the end of it, maybe the last sentence of that \nparagraph: It is for this reason that I was a bit surprised and \ndismayed when a member of your committee--speaking of this Senator--\nbroached this issue in the course of your public confirmation hearings. \nNormally intelligence sources and methods are discussed only in closed \nsession.\n  I will ask unanimous consent that the transcript of the question I \nraised to Mr. Bolton at that particular time be printed in the Record.\n  The question was basically a very simple one. The question was: I \nwant to know whether you requested to see NSA information about other \nAmerican officials? That is the question. There was no reference to \nsources and methods. A simple question: Did you request to see this \ninformation, yes or no?\n  And he went on to answer the question.\n  Now, I ask the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is that an \ninappropriate question to ask of a nominee? It was a simple question: I \nwant to know whether you requested to see NSA information about any \nother American officials? Mr. Bolton's answer is: Yes, on a number of \noccasions I can think of, and he goes on to talk about it.\n  My point of your letter is, there is a discussion that this Senator \nwas acting inappropriately because I was seeking methods and sources. \nThe only question I asked of Mr. Bolton in that public hearing was: Did \nyou make such a request? Does my colleague believe I was violating some \nprocedures regarding the gathering of intelligence by asking that \nsimple question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would never raise the question about my colleague and \nfriend about acting inappropriately, especially in regard to intent. I \nam concerned about us talking about intercepts and all of this that I \nwent through in the letter on the Senate floor. I am concerned about \nmany things that have been talked about publicly, quite frankly, leaks \nthat appeared in the press that I find out about later as chairman and \nhave to address. I cannot speak to them because they are classified. It \nis the classic case of Catch-22, where something appears in the press \nor perhaps somebody says something on the floor inadvertently--if it is \ndone on purpose, that is another matter. That can be referred to the \nEthics Committee--and that certainly is not the case in terms of my \ndistinguished colleague. Then comes sort of a feeding frenzy and we end \nup with things that should not be in the public discourse that are \nhighly classified, highly compartmented. Signals intelligence is one of \nthe highest compartmented topics we deal with.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with my colleague.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It was only Senator Rockefeller and myself who were \nbriefed by General Hayden, and that was a very good meeting. We went \nover virtually every intercept, as it should be. That was my point. \nThat is what the Intelligence Committee does. It is accepted practice \nfor the full committee, which many members of the full committee have \ntrouble understanding, that only the vice chairman and the chairman \nhave access to this kind of highly compartmented material. So when this \nkind of thing is bandied about on the floor in a generic way, it causes \nme great concern.\n  Mr. DODD. Well, I understand that. It is just that this Senator in \nthis--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas controls the time.\n  Mr. DODD. If he would yield, this sentence in this letter suggests \nthat this Senator--because I am the one who asked the question--crossed \nthe line. Let me read my whole question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am not referring to the Senator from Connecticut by \nname. OK?\n  Mr. DODD. I am the only one who asked the question that day.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Pardon me?\n  Mr. DODD. I am the only one who asked the question of Mr. Bolton. I \nasked the question in this way: I want to read the question because I \nwant to make sure I do not overstep a line here, and then I asked the \nquestion: Did \nyou . . .\n  My concern is that there is a suggestion, as the one who asked the \nquestion, that I had somehow--and I do not disagree with my colleague, \nby the way.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Reclaiming my time, I think I addressed the Senator's \npersonal concern. The Senator knows me well enough to know that when I \nsay I am not accusing him personally of anything that would be \ninappropriate, I have stated I am talking about open discussion of \nintelligence information, quite frankly, not only in this nomination \nprocess but in the Intelligence Authorization Act in regard to a whole \nseries of other subjects I will not go into, that many people have \nspoken to on the floor, many people have talked to the press about, and \nI do not think it is appropriate.\n  I will say again, I am not accusing the Senator of anything \ninappropriate. I think from the whole standpoint of this body, subjects \nsuch as this should be done in executive session. I think that because \nof all the problems we have had in regard to leaks and in regard to \ninformation that is not helpful to our national security. That is about \nas far as I will go with it. I could go through quite a laundry list of \nconcerns I have of things that have been made public and what has \nhappened in regard to our adversaries, what has happened in regard to \nour intelligence capability, and I worry about it. So my concern was \nbasically the continued open discussion of things of this nature, not \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Will my colleague from Kansas yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I take it my colleague from Kansas was not at the \nbusiness meeting when the Bolton nomination was discussed. My colleague \nfrom Kansas was not at the hearing where the Bolton nomination was \ndiscussed. I do not know if it would surprise my colleague to note that \nin the business meeting, other Senators, not the Senator from \nConnecticut--this issue of intercept was raised again by another \nSenator and a similar question was asked. So it is not just the Senator \nfrom Connecticut who raised the issue during the questioning of Mr. \nBolton.\n  But, in fact, during the business meeting this came up again and \nagain. I presume my colleague from Kansas must have been informed of \nthat, to raise the level of concern he has.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for his clarification.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield for just one additional point. I \nagree with respect to General Hayden as well. I noted because I watched \nthe hearing--our colleague from Michigan is here and participated in \nthe hearing--when General Hayden, in his confirmation hearing, was \nbefore the Armed Services Committee, there was a rather extensive \ndiscussion with General Hayden about the whole issue of intercepts. \nGeneral Hayden was very forthcoming in that discussion about it. I have \ngreat respect for him as well. About the Web site here, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the Web page for the National \nSecurity Agency, the page headed, ``Signals Intelligence.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Signals Intelligence\n\n       The National Security Agency collects, processes and \n     disseminates foreign Signals Intelligence (SIGINT). The old \n     adage that ``knowledge is power'' has perhaps never been \n     truer than when applied to today's threats against our nation \n     and the role SIGINT plays in overcoming them.\n       NSA's SIGINT mission protects the nation by:\n       Providing information in the form of SIGINT products and \n     services that enable our government to make critical \n     decisions and operate successfully.\n       Protecting the rights of U.S. citizens by adhering to the \n     provisions of the 4th amendment to the Constitution.\n       Using the nation's resources responsibly, according to the \n     best management processes available.\n       SIGINT is derived from the signals environment that is \n     described by the graphic above. Other agencies within the \n     Intelligence Community are responsible for other types of \n     intelligence:\n       Human Intelligence (HUMINT) is primarily the responsibility \n     of the CIA and DIA,\n       Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) belongs to NGA,\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\n       Military Intelligence and Measurement and Signature \n     Intelligence (MASINT) belongs to DIA.\n       Together, these different yet complementary disciplines \n     give our nation's leaders a greater understanding of the \n     intentions of our enemies.\n       NSA's SIGINT mission provides our military leaders and \n     policy makers with intelligence to ensure our national \n     defense and to advance U.S. global interests. This \n     information is specifically limited to that on foreign \n     powers, organizations or persons and international \n     terrorists. NSA responds to requirements levied by \n     intelligence customers, which includes all departments and \n     levels of the United States Executive Branch.\n       The prosecution of the SIGINT mission has evolved from the \n     relatively static, industrial age, Cold War communications \n     environment to the ubiquitous, high speed, multi-functional \n     technologies of today's information age. The ever-increasing \n     volume, velocity and variety of today's communications make \n     the production of relevant and timely intelligence for \n     military commanders and national policy makers more \n     challenging than ever.\n       NSA has a strong tradition of dedicated, highly qualified \n     people deeply committed to maintaining the nation's security. \n     While technology will obviously continue to be a key element \n     of our future, NSA recognizes that technology is only as good \n     as the people creating it and the people using it. NSA \n     remains committed to its core mission of exploiting the \n     Agency's deep analytical skill and technological capabilities \n     to ensure the nation maintains a significant strategic \n     advantage in the advancement of U.S. interests around the \n     world.\n       As much as modem telecommunications technology poses \n     significant challenges to SIGINT, the many languages used in \n     the nations and regions of the world that are of interest to \n     our military and national leaders require NSA to maintain a \n     wide variety of language capabilities. Successful SIGINT \n     depends on the skills of not only language professionals but \n     those of mathematicians, analysts, and engineers, as well. \n     The nation is indebted to them for the successes they have \n     won.\n       SIGINT plays a vital role in our national security by \n     employing the right people and using the latest technology to \n     provide America's leaders with the critical information they \n     need to save lives, defend democracy, and promote American \n     values.\n\n                        Introduction to NSA/CSS\n\n       The National Security Agency/Central Security Service is \n     America's cryptologic organization. It coordinates, directs, \n     and performs highly specialized activities to protect U.S. \n     information systems and produce foreign intelligence \n     information. A high technology organization, NSA is on the \n     frontiers of communications and data processing. It is also \n     one of the most important centers of foreign language \n     analysis and research within the government.\n       Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) is a unique discipline with a \n     long and storied past. SIGINT's modern era dates to World War \n     II, when the U.S. broke the Japanese military code and \n     learned of plans to invade Midway Island. This intelligence \n     allowed the U.S. to defeat Japan's superior fleet. The use of \n     SIGINT is believed to have directly contributed to shortening \n     the war by at least one year. Today, SIGINT continues to play \n     an important role in keeping the United States a step ahead \n     of its enemies.\n       As the world becomes more and more technology-oriented, the \n     Information Assurance (IA) mission becomes increasingly \n     challenging. This mission involves protecting all classified \n     and sensitive information that is stored or sent through U.S. \n     government equipment. IA professionals go to great lengths to \n     make certain that government systems remain impenetrable. \n     This support spans from the highest levels of U.S. government \n     to the individual warfighter in the field.\n       NSA conducts one of the U.S. government's leading research \n     and development (R) programs. Some of the Agency's R \n     projects have significantly advanced the state of the art in \n     the scientific and business worlds.\n       NSA's early interest in cryptanalytic research led to the \n     first large-scale computer and the first solid-state \n     computer, predecessors to the modern computer. NSA pioneered \n     efforts in flexible storage capabilities, which led to the \n     development of the tape cassette. NSA also made ground-\n     breaking developments in semiconductor technology and remains \n     a world leader in many technological fields.\n       NSA employs the country's premier cryptologists. It is said \n     to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the United \n     States and perhaps the world. Its mathematicians contribute \n     directly to the two missions of the Agency: designing cipher \n     systems that will protect the integrity of U.S. information \n     systems and searching for weaknesses in adversaries' systems \n     and codes.\n       Technology and the world change rapidly, and great emphasis \n     is placed on staying ahead of these changes with employee \n     training programs. The National Cryptologic School is \n     indicative of the Agency's commitment to professional \n     development. The school not only provides unique training for \n     the NSA workforce, but it also serves as a training resource \n     for the entire Department of Defense. NSA sponsors employees \n     for bachelor and graduate studies at the Nation's top \n     universities and colleges, and selected Agency employees \n     attend the various war colleges of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n       Most NSA/CSS employees, both civilian and military, are \n     headquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland, centrally located \n     between Baltimore and Washington, DC. Its workforce \n     represents an unusual combination of specialties: analysts, \n     engineers, physicists, mathematicians, linguists, computer \n     scientists, researchers, as well as customer relations \n     specialists, security officers, data flow experts, managers, \n     administrative officers and clerical assistants.\n  Mr. DODD. It is on public document and goes on at some length. I am \nnot sure, my colleague may want to look at this. Maybe the agencies \nmight be more careful about what it says here as well.\n  The point all along here is the simple question whether access to \nthese records will be granted to the appropriate Members here in the \nSenate. I appreciate immensely what my colleague said here today. He's \na remarkable Senator who does a terrific job, and I thank him for \nengaging with me a bit in this colloquy, but I was concerned when I saw \nthat line as somehow being singled out about raising the question about \nwhether or not Mr. Bolton made a request. That is all I asked that day. \nI knew it was an important matter, and it ought to be dealt with not in \na public setting, that that ought to be done behind closed doors with \nthe Intelligence Committee to go into further detail about what \nactually went on. That is why I tried to word it very cautiously and \ncaution myself not to go over a line in asking the question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I only wish all Senators would have the same caution. I \nthank the Senator for his personal comments in my regard.\n  I think he has made his point. As the farmer said as he crawled \nthrough the barbed-wire fence: One more point and we will be through.\n  I suspect that you are through, and since I yielded back my time \nabout 10 minutes ago, I yield it back one more time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed for 20 minutes. I am very sorry the Senator from Kansas left. \nLet me first ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that transcripts of two public \nhearings where I asked questions of General Hayden, relative to the \nprocess of seeking identification of people who are referred to or who \nparticipate in intercepted conversations--that those unclassified, \npublic hearing transcripts, or portions thereof, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       LEVIN. Thank you.\n       General, this morning's New York Times had an article, \n     which troubled me, about the number of times in which \n     communications that had been intercepted by the NSA were \n     released to John Bolton. I was troubled by the number of \n     times that this happened, frankly.\n       But since you're here and you're in a position to give us \n     some facts on this subject, I want to ask you a number of \n     questions about it.\n       I gather that, according to the article, access to names \n     may be authorized by NSA only in response to special \n     requests, and these are not common, particularly from policy-\n     makers. That's the quote in there. Is that an accurate \n     statement?\n       HAYDEN. I think that's a very accurate description. In \n     fact, I read Doug Jehl's article. And I think Doug laid it \n     out in a very clear way.\n       The way it works, Senator, is that we are required to \n     determine what is minimized U.S. person identity. Now, there \n     is a whole body of law with regard to protecting U.S. \n     privacy. But in an agency like ourselves, it is not uncommon \n     for us to come across information to, from or about what we \n     would call a protected person--a U.S. person. And then the \n     rules kick in as to what you can do with that information.\n       The rule of thumb in almost all cases is that you minimize \n     it, and you simply refer to named U.S. person or named U.S. \n     official in the report that goes out.\n       LEVIN. How often did Mr. Bolton request the names?\n       [Crosstalk.]\n       HAYDEN. I don't know.\n       HAYDEN. We would have a record of it. Interestingly enough, \n     I double-checked this, this morning, after reading the \n     article, just to make sure I had this right. Because I did \n     approve, from time to time, the release of U.S. person \n     identity.\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\n       And it's not very often. I have to do it when the identity \n     is released to a U.S. law enforcement agency. Just done for \n     foreign intelligence purposes, it's about three layers below \n     me in the NSA rule chart.\n       LEVIN. Was there an unusual number of accesses requested by \n     Mr. Bolton compared to requests from other senior officials?\n       HAYDEN. I don't know that, Senator; I really don't. And the \n     requests from Secretary Bolton were not of such a number that \n     they came to my attention.\n       LEVIN. In other words, he obviously made requests. You say \n     that someone other than you would have approved those.\n       HAYDEN. On a normal basis; that's right.\n       LEVIN. But you do have records as to how often...\n       HAYDEN. Yes, sir; we would.\n       LEVIN. Thank you.\n       HAYDEN. I should add: And that's a formal process. That's \n     just not a phone call.\n       LEVIN. OK, thank you.\n       HAYDEN. It's documented.\n       LEVIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n       ROBERTS. Senator Levin, I wanted to let you know that in \n     answer to the number three question that I asked, why the \n     general replied in terms of cooperating with the committee, \n     deal with me to to provide documents or any material \n     requested by the committee in order for it to carry out its \n     oversight and its legislative responsibilities. We didn't put \n     a time frame on it, but you have. And his answer was an \n     emphatic yes.\n       LEVIN. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\n\n            4/21/05 SASC Nomination Hearing (NSA Intercepts)\n\n       LEVIN. The Bolton nomination has raised a question about \n     protected U.S. identities. These are U.S. people who are \n     either participants in a conversation, communication which is \n     intercepted and included in a SIGINT product, where the \n     identity of that person is blocked, or sometimes, as said, is \n     minimized, and is referred to generally as a U.S. person.\n       There are also many cases where that person is not a \n     participant in the conversation but is referred in a \n     conversation, and the identity of that person is also \n     protected as well.\n       At the Intelligence Committee hearing with you last week, \n     you said that there's a formal written and documented process \n     for U.S. government officials to request the identity of a \n     U.S. person referred to in a SIGINT process. Is that correct?\n       HAYDEN. Yes, sir, that's correct.\n       LEVIN. Now, I take it there are a significant number of \n     requests, a large number of requests which come in for the \n     identity of a U.S. person who's been minimized.\n       Can you tell us whether the majority of those requests, \n     indeed the vast majority of those requests, are made where \n     the person identified is not the participant in the \n     conversation, but rather is someone who is referred to in the \n     conversation?\n       HAYDEN. Thank you very much for that question, Senator, \n     because when this comes up--I mean, first of all, to frame \n     the issue for me as director of NSA, I mean, the issue here \n     is the protection of American privacy. And everything then \n     devolves out of that fundamental principle: How do we protect \n     U.S. privacy?\n       And in the course of accomplishing our mission, it's almost \n     inevitable that we would learn information about Americans, \n     or to or from, in terms of communications.\n       The same rules apply, though, in protecting privacy, \n     whether it's to, from or about an American. You're correct. \n     In the vast majority of the cases the information is about an \n     American being referred to in communications between \n     individuals that I think the committee would be most \n     enthusiastic that we were conducting our operations against.\n       LEVIN. And that's a very, very helpful clarification.\n       My time is up. Can I just perhaps end this line of \n     questioning?\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.\n       I think the press has already indicated that there were \n     apparently 10 requests from Mr. Bolton.\n       HAYDEN. Yes, sir, I've seen that number.\n       LEVIN. Ok. Do you know or not the majority of his requests \n     were for persons that were referred to in the conversation or \n     for a participant in the conversation?\n       HAYDEN. Yes, sir. I would like to respond to that for the \n     record in a classified way.\n       LEVIN. That's fine.\n       And the other question that relates not just to him, but I \n     guess to anybody, the person who makes this written \n     application for the information states specifically what that \n     purpose is that they want that information for. Is that \n     correct?\n       HAYDEN. Yes, sir, Senator. But in all cases the purpose \n     comes down to the fundamental principle: I need to know the \n     identity of that individual to understand or appreciate the \n     intelligence value of the report.\n       LEVIN. And is that printed there as a purpose, or does that \n     have to be filled in by the applicant?\n       HAYDEN. Senator, I'm not exactly sure what the form looks \n     like, but I can tell you that's the only criteria on which we \n     would release the U.S. person information.\n       LEVIN. But you don't know how that purpose is stated in \n     these thousands of applications?\n       HAYDEN. I'd have to check, Senator.\n       LEVIN. Or in Mr. Bolton's application?\n       HAYDEN. Correct.\n       LEVIN. Ok. And then once the information is obtained, you \n     do not know the use to which that information is put, I \n     gather. Is that correct?\n       HAYDEN. No, we would report the information to an \n     authorized consumer in every dimension, in terms of both \n     security clearance and need to know, just like we would \n     report any other information.\n       LEVIN. But then you don't know what...\n       HAYDEN. No, sir.\n       LEVIN. . . . that person does with that information.\n       HAYDEN. No. The presumption, obviously, is the individual \n     uses that then to appreciate the original report.\n       LEVIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The journalist Carl Bernstein once said, ``We have a \nnational memory in this country of about 7 minutes.'' Once more, he has \nbeen proven right.\n  Here we are, 2 years after one of the worst intelligence disasters in \nour history, debating the nomination of a man to the U.N. \nambassadorship, a man who has a track record of attempting to \nmanipulate intelligence by seeking to punish intelligence analysts who \ndo not support his view. We are so slow to learn from our history, and \nwe are so quick to repeat it.\n  The issue here--and I am sure my friend from Connecticut would \nagree--is not the issue of whether or not policymakers have a right to \ndisagree with analysts; of course, they do. We all should challenge \nanalysts and analysis. We do not do enough of it. I happen to agree \nwith the Senator from Kansas on that. That is not the issue.\n  The question is whether or not we manipulate intelligence or try to \nmanipulate intelligence by trying to force analysts, who are supposed \nto be objective, to reach conclusions with which they don't agree in \norder to get support for our own policy positions. That is what is \nunacceptable. It is not unacceptable to disagree with analysts or not \nto follow their analysis. That is not at all unacceptable. That is what \npolicymakers are here for, to make judgments, to pick between analyses. \nBut what is unacceptable is what Mr. Bolton did repeatedly, which is to \ntry to get analysts, who are supposed to be objective, fired or removed \nor transferred because they would not come to the conclusion to which \nhe wanted them to come. That is the issue here with Mr. Bolton.\n  This administration does not hold people who politicize intelligence \nto account. Following the major intelligence failures before 9/11 and \nIraq, the administration has failed to hold anybody accountable for \neither failure. In fact, the President gave one of the people most \nresponsible for the intelligence disaster before Iraq, the CIA \nDirector, a gold medal. Now the President wants to give John Bolton a \npromotion, although John Bolton has, in unconscionable--and I believe \neven potentially dangerous--ways attempted to get intelligence analysts \nto shape their views to his views and, if they wouldn't bend, to break \nthem.\n\n       We know what happens when intelligence is politicized. \n     Before the Iraq war, ``a slam dunk'' was the CIA assessment, \n     although the underlying intelligence contained nuances, \n     qualifications, and caveats. Too often the CIA told the \n     administration what it thought the administration wanted to \n     hear.\n\n  The July 2004 bipartisan report of the Senate Intelligence Committee \nconcluded the following:\n\n       Most of the major key judgments in the intelligence \n     community's October 2002 ``National Intelligence Estimate, \n     Iraq's Continuing Programs for Mass Destruction,'' either \n     overstated or were not supported by the underlying \n     intelligence reporting.\n\n  Just this month, newspapers reported on leaked notes from a July 23, \n2002, meeting of the British Prime Minister and his senior national \nsecurity staff. According to the note, the head of British foreign \nintelligence told Prime Minister Blair, 7 months before the war, that \nPresident Bush:\n\n     . . . wanted to remove Saddam through military action \n     justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the \n     intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\n\n  Those are contemporaneous notes, prior to the war against Iraq. Such \nreports reinforce the view of much of the world that the administration \nshaped intelligence to serve policy purposes and that it strayed from \nthe critical principle that intelligence must be objective, \nindependent, and free from political influence.\n  Twenty-five years ago, the Iran-Contra Committee reaffirmed the \nprinciple that, after heavy manipulation of intelligence by CIA \nDirector Bill Casey:\n\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\n\n     . . . the gathering, analysis and reporting of intelligence \n     should be done in a way that there could be no question that \n     the conclusions are driven by the actual facts rather than by \n     what a policy advocate hopes those facts will be.\n\n  That was 25 years ago. That was Iran-Contra. That was a bipartisan \ncriticism of the then-CIA Director Casey.\n  Intelligence must be gathered and analyzed in a way that there can be \nno doubt but that the conclusions are driven by the actual facts, not \nby what a policy advocate hopes those facts will be.\n  It is going to take years of hard work to regain credibility in our \nintelligence assessments after the massive failures in Iraq. The Senate \nbegan that work with the intelligence reform bill in 2004. In that \nbill, Congress explicitly stated that national intelligence should be \n``objective'' and ``independent of political considerations.'' That is \nthe law of the land. We require the process to ensure alternative \nanalyses within the intelligence community.\n  The nomination of John Bolton shows a disdain for objective, \nindependent intelligence and flies in the face of the Senate's effort \nto reform our intelligence system. Indeed, Mr. Bolton is the \npersonification of what has been wrong with our system. Mr. Bolton has \na deeply disturbing history of trying to punish intelligence analysts \nwho do not agree with his views, of trying to squelch intelligence \nanalysis and of distorting the intelligence community's view when they \ndo not agree with his own.\n  He is aggressive about pursuing the answer that he wants, regardless \nof what the objective intelligence analysts say, and his actions have \nhad a noticeably chilling effect on the intelligence analysts that he \ntries to intimidate and a harmful effect on the intelligence process \nitself.\n  Let's just look at his record. Mr. Bolton's view on intelligence on \nCuba can be gained from an e-mail to him from his chief of staff that \ncalled the intelligence community's language on Cuba ``wimpy.'' As a \npolicymaker, he is entitled, and was entitled, to his own view. I make \nit clear that what the Senator from Kansas said, I agree with. Mr. \nBolton was entitled to his own view, but what he was not entitled to do \nwas force intelligence analysts to change their views.\n  In preparation for his speech to the Heritage Foundation, Mr. Bolton \nrepeatedly sought clearance for stronger language on Cuba's biological \nwarfare effort than the intelligence community would support. He was \nrepeatedly rebuffed by intelligence analysts at the State Department \nand the CIA, and he repeatedly responded by seeking those analysts' \ndismissal or removal, thereby crossing a vital line, a clear line, a \nred line, the line between ignoring intelligence analyses which, wise \nor not, is his right to do as a policymaker, that is on one side of the \nline. But the other side of the line he must not cross, trying to \nintimidate analysts into shaping intelligence analyses to his liking, \nthat is totally impermissible. It is potentially dangerous, and it is \nclearly on the wrong side, the unacceptable side, the intolerable side \nof the line.\n  When he did not receive the analysis he wanted on Cuba, Mr. Bolton \nunleashed a tirade against the intelligence analyst.\n  Soon afterwards, he went to see Tom Fingar, the Principal Deputy \nAssistant for INR, to try to have the analyst removed. Mr. Fingar \ntestified that Secretary Bolton was still visibly upset during their \nmeeting, and he said that ``he wasn't going to be told what he could \nsay by a midlevel INR munchkin analyst.''\n  Mr. Bolton had made clear to the analyst he was his boss, and in \nessence had asked his subordinate: How dare you disagree with your \nsuperior?\n  Mr. Fingar then testified that Mr. Bolton said he wanted the analyst \n``taken off his accounts.'' Mr. Fingar protested and said ``he is our \nchemical and biological challenge weapons specialist, this is what he \ndoes''--making clear to Mr. Bolton that reassignment would really mean \ntermination. Mr. Bolton persisted.\n  The record then shows that Mr. Bolton sought the analyst's removal \ntwo more times over a 6-month period. In one of those attempts, Mr. \nBolton met with then-Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence, \nCarl Ford, who later said the following:\n\n       I left that meeting with the perception that I had been \n     asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for \n     what he had said and done. In my experience no one had ever \n     done what Secretary Bolton did.\n\n  Months later, Mr. Bolton made yet another attempt when Neil Silver \nbecame the analyst's supervisor. In his testimony to the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Mr. Bolton even conceded he was still pursuing the \nanalyst's transfer.\n  In his attempt to manipulate intelligence on Cuba, Mr. Bolton also \ntried to have a national intelligence officer from the CIA transferred. \nMr. Bolton went personally to the CIA at Langley to argue for the \nanalyst's dismissal. This is an analyst Mr. Bolton had never met, an \nanalyst to whom he had never spoken. He had never read the analyst's \nwork. He only knew one thing: The analyst disagreed with his views and, \ntherefore, he had to be brought to heel.\n  This effort, too, lasted several months and involved repeated \nattempts by Mr. Bolton and his staff. Former Deputy Director of the CIA \nJohn McLaughlin said of the request to dismiss the intelligence officer \nthat it is ``the only time I had ever heard such a request.''\n  So we have the Deputy CIA Director John McLaughlin as saying nobody \nhas ever made a request to him, that he knew of, to dismiss an \nintelligence officer because of a disagreement with that officer's \nanalysis--very similar to what Mr. Ford said at the office of the \nAssistant Secretary of State: ``in his experience, no one had ever done \nwhat Secretary Bolton did,'' which was to fire an intelligence analyst \nfor what he had said and done.\n  In the end, both analysts were supported by their supervisors and \nthey rightfully kept their positions. The only person who should have \nbeen fired over those incidents was Mr. Bolton.\n  Mr. Bolton's defenders like to claim no harm, no foul. That is, \nbecause none of his targets were fired despite his efforts; that \neverything is just fine. But the harm is in the attempt. Shooting at \nsomeone is still a crime even if you miss. As soon as a policymaker \nthreatens an intelligence analyst with removal for disagreeing with \nthat analyst's analysis, the harm is done.\n  As Mr. McLaughlin testified--and this is something the Senator from \nKansas either overlooked or ignores. Listen to Mr. McLaughlin's \ntestimony: It is perfectly all right for a policymaker to express \ndisagreement with an intelligence officer or an analyst. And it is \nperfectly all right for them to challenge their word vigorously. But I \nthink it is different, McLaughlin said, to then request, because of \nthis disagreement, that the person be transferred.\n  That is the line. That is the line which Mr. Bolton crossed. That is \nthe line that we ought to insist on. Every Member of this body should \ninsist that line never be crossed. We ought to protect the right of \npolicymakers to disagree, to question, and to ignore the analysis. We \nshould never condone a policymaker who wants to see an analyst fired \nbecause the policymaker disagrees with that person's analysis. That is \nthe line which is dangerous to cross because the pressure that puts on \nthe analyst is to come up with the answer that the policymaker wants to \nhear. That is what is dangerous, when we hear an analyst, or you hear a \nCIA Administrator say it is a slam dunk, when it isn't, because he \nthinks that is what the policy maker wants to hear.\n  We cannot tolerate people being fired, discharged, transferred \nbecause the policymaker disagrees with the analysis of that analyst.\n\n  Mr. McLaughlin is right. It was different. It was dangerous. And \naccording to Mr. Ford, Mr. Bolton's actions had an impact. Word of the \nincident, according to Mr. Ford, ``spread like wildfire among the other \nanalysts.'' Mr. Ford testified:\n\n       I can only give you my impressions, but I clearly believe \n     that the analysts in INR were very negatively affected by \n     this incident. They were scared.\n\n  Mr. Bolton's actions were so damaging that Secretary of State Powell \nmade a special personal visit to offer encouragement to the analysts. \nIn his remarks, Secretary Powell specifically referred to the analysts \nthat Mr. Bolton had targeted. He told them: Continue to call it like \nyou see it. Continue to speak truth to power.\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\n  Former Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation John Wolf \nconfirmed what should be all too clear about Mr. Bolton, that these \nexamples of his behavior are not isolated instances but a persistent \npattern. Mr. Wolf testified that Mr. Bolton sought the removal of two \nofficers from a nonproliferation bureau over policy differences, and \nthat, in general, officers in the bureau--and now this is Assistant \nSecretary of State John Wolf--that officers in the bureau ``felt undue \npressure to conform to the views of [Mr. Bolton] versus the views they \nthought they could support.''\n  Events of the past few years involving the completely missed \nintelligence on Iraq, the distorted intelligence on Iraq, have shown \nthat we need to be encouraging independent and alternative analysis, \nnot squelching it.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee report on the intelligence \ncommunity's prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq concluded that a \nlack of alternative analysis contributed to the failure of that \nintelligence.\n  The committee wrote that:\n\n     . . . the analysts' and collectors' chains of command, their \n     respective agencies, from immediate services to the National \n     Intelligence Council and the Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, all share responsibilities for not \n     encouraging analysts to challenge their assumptions, fully \n     consider alternative arguments, or accurately characterize \n     the intelligence report.\n\n  ``Most importantly,'' according to the committee, they failed ``to \nrecognize when analysts had lost their objectivity and take corrective \naction.''\n  Our Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, said \ncorrective action should be taken when analysts lose their objectivity. \nMr. Bolton tried to get analysts punished for insisting on their \nindependence. Mr. Bolton did not value independent and objective \nanalysis. He scorned it. He sought not to encourage alternative views \nbut to impose his own. He did not challenge analysts. He bullied them. \nAnd he tried to fire those who disagreed with him.\n  Now, this is not ``water cooler'' gossip about an obnoxious boss. \nObjective, factual analysis can make the difference between success and \nfailure, between life and death. In the near future, we may face a \ncrisis over North Korea's nuclear program or Iran's nuclear intentions. \nCongress and the public must be confident that intelligence assessments \nrepresent information that has been assessed objectively, not shaped to \nserve policy goals. And if we need to go to the United Nations to make \na case against a country based on our intelligence about that country's \ndangerous activity, the world must have confidence in the U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  When Bush decided to make the case against Iraq to the United \nNations, he sent Secretary of State Colin Powell, one of America's most \ncredible diplomats. Today, we are being asked to confirm one of \nAmerica's least credible diplomats to serve in an important diplomatic \npost, where we need credibility, we need the confidence to bring other \ncountries to our side. We should not allow a situation in which the \nworld might question whether it is hearing a credible view or whether \nit is hearing a Bolton view of intelligence.\n  Perhaps the biggest canard of the debate is that John Bolton is the \nbest person to reform the United Nations. The U.N. needs reform, but so \ndoes the intelligence community. So does its systems. And, frankly, so \ndoes John Bolton. Any number of people would be a far more credible \nvoice for reform at the United Nations.\n  This is a momentous decision for this body. It is shocking and sad--\nit is shocking and sad--to me that the Senate may vote on this \nnomination while Senators are being denied critical, relevant \ninformation that members of the Foreign Relations Committee have \nsought. Members of that committee have requested information about the \nnumber of requests by Mr. Bolton for the names of U.S. persons cited in \nintelligence intercepts. The administration has refused to provide \nrelevant information to members of the Foreign Relations Committee and \nto this body.\n  Now, those requests may be benign that Mr. Bolton made for the names \nof those persons and what they were saying in those intercepts. They \ncould be part of an effort by this nominee to politicize and punish, \nsince that was the pattern of his activity. We do not know that. But we \nhave a right to know that. We have a right to ask why those requests \nwere made. But this administration has refused to provide that \ninformation. We should insist on this information before we vote on \nthis nomination. We should insist that at least the leaders of our \ncommittees, the Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, be given access to the names of people that Mr. Bolton asked \nthe intercepts relative to.\n  Denying the Congress and the Members of this body--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed his time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and I ask unanimous consent for 3 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Denying Members of this body information is part of a \nwoeful pattern of this administration denying information to the \nCongress. Even the Republicans of the House Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittees and the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee over in the House included language in their bill which \nsays that the Bush administration should be criticized ``for its lack \nof responsiveness to repeated Congressional requests for information.''\n  Mr. President, this Senate, as a body, should insist on legitimate \nrequests for information from its Members. Every Member--every Member--\nshould add his or her voice to the demand for the production of \nrelevant documents which Senators need to decide on confirmation or for \nany other legitimate reason. This body will be a lesser place if we do \nnot stand with each other when it comes to gaining access to documents, \nat least in the absence of a claim of executive privilege.\n  Now, I happen to believe we should give deference to the President on \nthe selection of his team, but deference does not mean abdication of \nour best judgment when a nominee crosses the line. If we do that, we \nwill send the wrong message to anyone working in the intelligence \ncommunity who sees Mr. Bolton's behavior rewarded rather than seeing \nhim held accountable. If we do that, we will send the wrong message to \nthe international community, to send a repeat abuser of intelligence \nand an abuser of intelligence analysts to be our representative at the \nUnited Nations.\n\n  We have the opportunity to send a different message to the \nintelligence community and to the world. We can cast a vote for \nobjectivity in intelligence, for intelligence that is free of political \ninfluence, and for accountability. But before we vote--before we vote--\nlegitimate requests for documents and information from Members of this \nbody should be honored and should be supported by every Senator. That \nis a need which, at one time or another, each one of us has, and as an \ninstitution we should, in one voice, demand that need be met.\n  This is a demand for relevant documents relevant to the \nqualifications of this nominee to be confirmed to this high office. It \nis a demand for documents which relate to an issue which is clearly \ninvolved in this nomination, and that has to do with a pattern, on the \npart of Mr. Bolton, of punishing people who analyze intelligence who do \nnot give him an analysis that he likes and that supports his own \npolicy.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and thank my good friend from \nMinnesota for yielding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes to \nengage my colleague from Michigan in a little colloquy. Will my friend \nfrom Minnesota object to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my friend.\n  I want to compliment my friend from Michigan on a very fine \nstatement. He has focused, in my view, exactly on the central question \nhere and that is not that there was disagreement over intelligence but, \nrather, whether someone went beyond a good, healthy fight over whether \nor not intelligence was accurate and took additional steps to dismiss \nor to change the jobs of the individuals involved.\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\n  I appreciate my colleague calling into question the access of \ninformation because this is central. That is why this Senator has taken \nthe extraordinary step of asking my colleagues to potentially oppose a \nmotion to invoke cloture on this nomination if the information is not \nforthcoming.\n  The reason I want to raise this is because our good friend from \nKansas, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, read into the \nRecord a letter he sent to Senator Lugar regarding this request for the \nintercept information. And the pertinent paragraph, to this Senator, I \nwant to read quickly. It says:\n\n       Finally, the Vice Chairman and I reviewed all ten documents \n     containing the references to U.S. persons that generated \n     Under Secretary Bolton's requests. The documents we reviewed \n     did not contain the actual identities of the minimized U.S. \n     persons. After reviewing the content of each report, however, \n     it was apparent to us both that it was not necessary to know \n     the actual names to determine whether [or not] the requests \n     were proper.\n\n  Now, the letter goes on, but that is the important paragraph because \nthe very identity of the individual names was redacted. The chairman of \nthe Committee on Intelligence and the ranking member on Intelligence \nwere not allowed to see the names, the very names that Mr. Bolton was \nable to see and apparently his staff was able to see. That is the \nrelevant information that we are seeking--the names of the individuals.\n  Does my colleague have any comment on that particular point? Because \nthat, to me, is the central admission in this letter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the names of the people that he sought \ninformation on are incredibly relevant to the question of why he sought \ninformation on those people, what was his motive. There is a pattern \nhere, a pattern of punishment of people if they did not provide \nanalysis that he agreed with, if they disagreed with his views. And \nwhen he asks for those intercepts, he may have had a perfectly benign \nreason for doing it. On the other hand, it may have been part of this \ntotally unacceptable pattern.\n  But the Senate has the same right to know what he knew and he asked \nfor, which was intercepts of particular people who were either involved \nin the conversation or referred to in the conversation.\n  If the Senate doesn't insist on that right for every Member of this \nbody, we are a lesser body. We should insist upon that for Members who \nagree with us or not. This is an institutional issue of great \nmagnitude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my friend for a good statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern over the \ninstitutional issue of having access. I join my colleague in getting \nthat information. Where I disagree is that when we have the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee stating to us in this letter--saying: After \nreviewing the content of each report, it was apparent to us both that \nit was not necessary to know the actual names to determine whether the \nrequests were proper. Ultimately, he found no basis to question the \njustification nor appropriateness of Mr. Bolton's request for the U.S. \npersons contained therein. So we have an individual we all deeply \nrespect, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, saying ``it was \napparent to us,'' the chairman and the ranking member, and then the \nletter went on.\n  I would say there is an institutional issue that we should resolve at \nsome point. In the context of this nomination, where we have a very \nclear statement that this specific information that was requested--it \nwas ``not necessary to know the actual names to determine whether the \nrequests were proper.'' Then it is basically saying the requests were \nproper.\n  Let us move forward with this nomination because we have a statement \nsaying the information wasn't needed to make a determination. Let us \npursue with great vigor the right of Members of this body to have \naccess to that kind of information. I think we really have to separate \nthe two, based on the statement of the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I ask unanimous \nconsent that entire paragraph I quoted from the chairman be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Finally, the Vice Chairman and I reviewed all ten documents \n     containing the references to U.S. persons that generated \n     Under Secretary Bolton's requests. The documents we reviewed \n     did not contain the actual identities of the minimized U.S. \n     persons. After reviewing the content of each report, however, \n     it was apparent to us both that it was not necessary to know \n     the actual names to determine whether the requests were \n     proper.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I raise this point. I appreciate his point. \nObviously, there is a disagreement between the ranking member and \nchairman, unfortunately, which is not a healthy thing to see coming out \nof the Intelligence Committee. The point I am trying to make here is, \nwith all due respect to the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and \nthe ranking member, it was, in fact, the very names involved which \ncould be the very names we are talking about that have been redacted \nfrom the document that would be terribly revealing. If, for instance, \nthere is the name--we have called him ``Mr. Smith'' to protect his \nidentity at the CIA. If there is overwhelming evidence that Mr. Bolton \ntried to have ``Mr. Smith'' dismissed as an intelligence analyst, and \nif one of the names being sought by Mr. Bolton was Mr. Smith, it seems \nthat ought to send red flags up to everybody. Why? It is Mr. Bolton \nrequesting to know who Mr. Smith was and what he said, an individual he \nwas trying to have dismissed from the CIA. We don't know whether Mr. \nSmith's name is on there because the name was redacted. The chairman \nand ranking member cannot read that name.\n  Without knowing the name of the individual, you cannot get to the \npoint. Obviously, the people at the State Department--it is the same \nthing. Without knowing the names, without the identities, I don't know \nhow you can draw the conclusion that it wasn't relevant. That is my \npoint.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. As I recall the statement from the ranking member, he \nsaid these incidents were not new to them. Some of these had been \nraised before. One was regarding Cuba. They had knowledge of this. \nAgain, I would defer to the good judgment of the chair of the \nIntelligence Committee, who said we looked at it and it wasn't \nrelevant. And then on and on in the letter again, and again he comes to \nthe same conclusion: nothing inappropriate, nothing unusual, no \nviolation of procedures. It is very clear.\n  I urge my colleagues to let us pursue this issue. I don't think there \nis a reasonable basis for holding up this confirmation based on the \nconcern of getting this type of information.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, my good friend from Minnesota. \nIf you agree that the Senate is entitled to this information, but not \nnow--if not now, when? The reason for seeking this information relates \nto the nomination of Mr. Bolton. That is why this is so relevant and \nimportant. I think the members of the Foreign Relations Committee have \nbeen seeking this information for many weeks. So it is not as though \nthis is a last-minute request which is holding up the vote on a \nnomination or would hold it up until we receive that information.\n  By the way, I happen to believe--and I don't know if my good friend \nfrom Connecticut agrees with me--that if the chairman and vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee saw the names and concluded that none of \nthose names had any relationship to this nomination because none of the \nnames are people he tried to get fired, transfer, or punish, that would \nsatisfy me. But the administration knows the names. John Bolton got the \nnames. But the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the \nchairman won't be given those names and they are redacted. I believe \nthe Senate cannot accept that standard and hold ourselves up as a body \nthat is equal in power to the executive branch. We cannot. We cannot \nsay to ourselves that this body will look at all relevant evidence that \nrelates to confirmation before we give our consent to it and protect \nthe Members' requests for information if we do not insist that at least \nthe chairman\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nand vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee have access to the \nnames and see whether those names are relevant to this nomination in \nterms of the specific people John Bolton tried to punish or get \ntransferred.\n  I find this really intolerable, incredible, that we as a body will \nnot stand with a legitimate request for relevant information that \nrelates to a pending nomination that was promptly and timely made.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, again, I remind my colleagues that it is \na nomination with 10 hours of hearings, 2 business meetings, 35 staff \ninterviews with 29 different people, a thousand pages of transcripts \nand 800 pages of documents, the opportunity for the chairman and the \nranking member of the Intelligence Committee to look at this \ninformation, and they came to the conclusions they came to. In the end, \nI think perhaps--I agree with my colleagues on crossing the line. I \nagree. You should not be harassing intelligence officials because of \npolicy disagreements to the point where you drive them out of the job. \nBut that just didn't happen here.\n  In fact, Mr. President, if you look at the statement of Carl Ford, he \nhimself in the minority report said this incident didn't turn into the \npoliticization of intelligence. Carl Ford--and I was there and listened \nto the testimony--said this incident didn't turn into the \npoliticization of intelligence.\n  We can walk through this again and again. We had the discussion over \nCuba and the issue of biological weapons capacity. Again, the \nallegation was made that somehow Mr. Bolton took views that were his \nown and disregarded the views of the administration in regard to Cuba. \nCarl Ford testified before the Foreign Relations Committee on March 19, \n2002. He stated that the United States believes that Cuba has at least \nlimited developmental offensive biological warfare and research \ncapability--on and on. What does John Bolton say when he gives his \nspeech? He says the same thing.\n\n  The point is, in each and every instance when colleagues raise a \nconcern about Mr. Bolton giving his own opinion versus that which is \napproved, it is simply not the case. I think my colleague from Kansas \nsaid this is a case of ``the rest of the story.'' It is true on the \nCuba issue. It is true on Mr. Bolton's testimony about Syria. Again, \nthe same concern was raised. The record is saying something very \ndifferent--that in each and every instance, there may have been \ndiscussion and challenges, but in the end Secretary Bolton delivered \nthe approved language. North Korea, the same thing. Allegation was made \nthat he was off on his own, and Secretary Powell came back and said, \nno, he delivered the opinion of the administration, of the Secretary of \nState.\n  What we have here--and the record is clear--is an individual with \nstrong views and strong opinions, who challenged personnel, but never, \nnever took any action against a single individual. Phrases are thrown \nout that there were threats to be fired or transferred. The reality is \nwhen Mr. Westermann back-doored Mr. Bolton, he lost confidence in him \nand said: I want him transferred. That is all you have.\n  In the end, Mr. President, what we have is an individual who has \nserved this country well, who has a record of distinguished service, \nwho has the support of a litany of Secretaries of State, of individuals \nwho have worked with him for years and years, who negotiated the treaty \nof Moscow and got the U.N. to reverse itself on the odious resolution \ndeclaring Zionism as racism, who has the support of the Secretary of \nState, who has the confidence of the President of the United States to \ndo what has to be done, and that is the heavy lifting in reforming the \nUnited Nations.\n\n  From the very beginning, my colleagues on the other side simply have \nsaid he is not acceptable, he has the wrong political perspective on \nthe United Nations, he has the wrong political perspective perhaps on \nthe war in Iraq and other issues, which morphed into allegations which, \nin the end, when we look at the rest of the story, simply are \nunsubstantiated.\n  John Bolton deserves our support. He deserves to be confirmed. I will \nproudly vote for his confirmation tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to \nChairman Lugar and to Ranking Member Biden from Senator Rockefeller \ndated May 25 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                             Select Committee on Intelligence,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lugar and Biden: I write in response to the \n     Chairman's April 28, 2005 letter asking that the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence examine a number of \n     intelligence-related issues that were raised during your \n     Committee's consideration of the nomination of Under \n     Secretary John Bolton to be the United States Representative \n     to the United Nations.\n       As you may be aware, I wrote to then-Director of the \n     National Security Agency (NSA), Lieutenant General Michael V. \n     Hayden, on April 20, 2005, requesting any documentation \n     related to Mr. Bolton's requests for the identity of a U.S. \n     person included in classified intelligence reports produced \n     by the NSA.\n       In response, General Hayden provided Chairman Pat Roberts \n     and me the opportunity to review all ten NSA documents \n     containing the references to U.S. persons that generated Mr. \n     Bolton's requests. We were not permitted to retain these \n     intelligence reports and other members of our Committee were \n     not permitted access to them. Additionally, the actual U.S. \n     identities provided by the NSA to Mr. Bolton were not shared \n     with us.\n       State Department records indicate that Mr. Bolton requested \n     the minimized identities of nineteen U.S. persons contained \n     in ten NSA signals intelligence reports. These requests were \n     processed by the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence \n     and Research (INR). In each instance, the INR request to the \n     NSA, on behalf of Mr. Bolton, included the justification that \n     the identity of the U.S. person(s) was needed in order to \n     better understand or assess the foreign intelligence value of \n     the information contained in the intelligence report. This is \n     the standard justification required by NSA in order for \n     officials to request the identity of a U.S. person contained \n     in a signals intelligence report.\n       Based on my personal review of these reports and the \n     context in which U.S. persons are referenced in them, I found \n     no evidence that there was anything improper about Mr. \n     Bolton's ten requests for the identities of U.S. persons.\n       It is important to note, however, that our Committee did \n     not interview Mr. Bolton, so I am unable to answer directly \n     the question of why he felt it was necessary for him to have \n     the identity information in order to better understand the \n     foreign intelligence contained in the report.\n       Furthermore, based on the information available to me, I do \n     not have a complete understanding of Mr. Bolton's handling of \n     the identity information after he received it.\n       The Committee has learned during its interview of Mr. \n     Frederick Fleitz, Mr. Bolton's acting Chief of Staff, that on \n     at least one occasion Mr. Bolton is alleged to have shared \n     the un-minimized identity information he received from the \n     NSA with another individual in the State Department. In this \n     instance, the NSA memorandum forwarding the requested \n     identity to State INR included the following restriction: \n     ``Request no further action be taken on this information \n     without prior approval of NSA.'' I have confirmed with the \n     NSA that the phrase ``no further action'' includes sharing \n     the requested identity of U.S. persons with any individual \n     not authorized by the NSA to receive the identity.\n       In addition to being troubled that Mr. Bolton may have \n     shared U.S. person identity information without required NSA \n     approval, I am concerned that the reason for sharing the \n     information is was not in keeping with Mr. Bolton's requested \n     justification for the identity in the first place. The \n     identity information was provided to Mr. Bolton based on the \n     stated reason that he needed to know the identity in order to \n     better understand the foreign intelligence contained in the \n     NSA report. According to Mr. Fleitz, Mr. Bolton used the \n     information he was provided in one instance in order to seek \n     out the State Department official mentioned in the report to \n     congratulate him. This use of carefully minimized U.S. person \n     identity information seems to be not in keeping with the \n     rationale provided in Mr. Bolton's request.\n       An interview of Mr. Bolton by your Committee may provide a \n     more complete understanding of the extent to which he may \n     have shared with others the nineteen U.S. person identities \n     he requested and received from the NSA. I believe it is a \n     matter that deserves more thorough attention.\n       I hope this information is of assistance to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           John D.

Mr. President, last Friday, May 13, Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Paul Wolfowitz ended his distinguished tour of duty at the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  During his 4 years at the Pentagon, Secretary Wolfowitz played a \ncritical role as our Nation responded to the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, and our military defeated the Taliban in Afghanistan and \nliberated Iraq from decades of tyranny. We continue to fight an all-out \nglobal war on terrorism, guided by the policies which Secretary \nWolfowitz, acting as a true partner to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, \nhelped to craft.\n  He was a true partner with Rumsfeld throughout. I have had some \nmodest experience in the Department having served there myself during \nthe war in Vietnam as Secretary of the Navy. I served under Messrs. \nLaird and Packard. I served under three Secretaries.\n  Their partnership, as the two principal's sharing an evergrowing, \nawesome, level of responsibilities has been exemplary in the annals of \nthe Department of Defense.\n  On April 29, I was privileged to attend a ceremony at the Pentagon in \nhonor of Secretary Wolfowitz's years of service. The speeches given \nthat day--by General Pace, Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Wolfowitz--\nare among the finest I have ever heard, and are a true testament to \nthis extraordinary individual. I wish Secretary Wolfowitz well as he \nprepares for his new duties as the President of the World Bank. I ask \nunanimous consent to have these speeches printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld Hosts a Full Honor Review and \n     Award Ceremony for Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz\n\n  (With Remarks by: General Pete Pace, Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of \n                                 Staff)\n\n       Dr. Paul Wolfowitz is recognized for exceptionally \n     distinguished public service as deputy secretary of Defense \n     from March 2001 through April 2005. During that critical \n     period, Dr. Wolfowitz's performance was brilliant. While \n     overseeing many of the department's day-to-day operations, he \n     was also a key leader in developing United States policy to \n     respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001.\n       A leader in developing United States policy to respond to \n     terrorist attack, and an internationally recognized voice for \n     freedom,\n       Dr. Wolfowitz contributed to the intellectual framework for \n     operations in Afghanistan and Iraq that removed two brutally \n     oppressive regimes that encouraged and gave sanctuary to \n     terrorists. Fifty million people are now free from the bonds \n     of tyranny. Self-government is on the march in countries once \n     believed beyond freedom's reach. And Afghanistan and Iraq \n     have become our newest allies in the war on terror.\n       While addressing these sizable challenges, Dr. Wolfowitz \n     was a driving force in addressing President Bush's charge to \n     transform the Department of Defense to better fit the \n     challenges of the 21st century. He encouraged a culture of \n     planning that stresses innovation and supports intelligent \n     risk in areas ranging from defense organization to technology \n     development and training.\n       And Dr. Wolfowitz is a tireless advocate for America's men \n     and women in uniform. A frequent visitor to wounded forces \n     and their families in hospitals and rehabilitation centers, \n     he paid particular attention to the needs and concerns that \n     went beyond the typically excellent care they receive. Dr. \n     Wolfowitz oversaw the creation of a 24-hour operations center \n     to reduce bureaucratic procedures for the severely injured, \n     significantly improving the flow of information to ease their \n     burdens during recovery.\n       Dr. Wolfowitz's countless achievements reflect his keen \n     intellect, management acumen, vision and compassion.\n       Through his dedication to the pursuit of policies of \n     freedom and transformation, Dr. Wolfowitz contributed greatly \n     to the work of the Department of Defense and the United \n     States. The distinctive accomplishments of Dr. Wolfowitz \n     reflect great credit upon himself, the Department of Defense, \n     and the United States of America.\n       Dr. Wolfowitz has also received the Decoration for \n     Distinguished Civilian Service from the secretary of the \n     Army, the Distinguished Public Service Award from the \n     secretary of the Navy, and the Decoration for Exceptional \n     Civilian Service from the acting secretary of the Air Force.\n       Gen. Pace. Secretary Rumsfeld, Mrs. Rumsfeld, Senator \n     Warner, Senator Coleman, assembled leadership of the \n     Department of Defense, special guests and friends, and \n     especially to our wounded servicemembers who are here today.\n       It is my distinct honor and privilege to stand here \n     representing our Chairman, General Dick Myers, and all the \n     men and women who are proud to wear the uniform of the United \n     States Armed Forces to say farewell and thank you, Mr. \n     Secretary, for all you've done for all of us in uniform \n     during your tenure as our deputy secretary of Defense.\n       It's been my great honor and privilege, Secretary \n     Wolfowitz, to have known you and worked with you for the last \n     three-and-a-half years, and in that time, I think I've gotten \n     to know a little bit about the man.\n       You have great humility. Of all the titles that you have \n     earned--doctor, professor, dean, ambassador, secretary--the \n     two you prefer most are Dad and Paul. That says a lot about \n     you.\n       You're a man of great intellect. Put simply, you work hard \n     and you're smart. And you make those of us who work with you \n     feel good about our contributions, and you elicit from us our \n     very best recommendations, because you are, in fact, a \n     facilitator and a person who values the judgment of others--\n     and for that, we thank you.\n       You're also a man of great courage. Those of us who wear \n     the uniform understand courage on the battlefield, but \n     there's another very distinct form of courage, and that is \n     intellectual courage. Many times it has been my great \n     pleasure to watch you, when conversations have been going in \n     a particular direction, and someone would turn to you and \n     say, ``Don't you agree, Paul?'' And you would say, ``No, I \n     don't.'' And then you'd explain why you didn't in a very, \n     very well-reasoned, articulate way that although did not \n     always carry the day, certainly made everybody in that room \n     understand that you were part of this process, and that you \n     were going to speak your mind as you knew it should be \n     spoken, and benefit all of us in uniform by always speaking \n     the truth, as you knew it.\n       You're also a man of compassion. If I speak too much about \n     this, I will blow your cover. But the fact is that many, many \n     times in the halls of this building, you have said to me, \n     ``Pete, Sergeant so-and-so--or Lieutenant so-and-so, or \n     General so-and-so--has a problem, and I think if you say \n     something to him, or you look into this, it will make life \n     better for him.'' Certainly, all that you have done for the \n     wounded, both in your official capacity, but also as a human \n     being in your visits to the hospitals, in your caring for the \n     families, in your attendance at funerals, in your caring for \n     the families of the fallen.\n       In all those ways, Mr. Secretary, you have shown enormous \n     compassion. And for that, we are grateful. We will miss you, \n     but we know that there are millions of people around this \n     world who are now going to benefit from the intellect, \n     strength and compassion of Paul Wolfowitz as you go to lead \n     the World Bank.\n       It is my great honor now to introduce the man in this \n     building who works harder than anybody else, has more focus \n     than anybody else, and makes the rest of us work very, very \n     hard, very diligently, to be part of the team that is trying \n     to do for this country all that we should be doing.\n       Mr. Secretary: Secretary Rumsfeld.\n       Sec. Rumsfeld. Well, thank you all for coming. We're \n     pleased you're here. A special welcome to Paul Wolfowitz and \n     his family and friends and lovely daughter, Rachel, sitting \n     there. And welcome to Chairman John Warner. We appreciate \n     your being here, your old stomping grounds. And Senator \n     Coleman, thank you so much for being here, and all the senior \n     military and civilian officials of the Department of Defense \n     and guests. Welcome.\n       Three years ago, The Economist magazine had an interesting \n     take on the job of deputy Cabinet secretary. It wrote, ``Most \n     deputy secretaries live lives of quiet frustration. They get \n     stuck with all the grunt work, while their bosses swan around \n     in the limelight. And they have to sit mutely while the\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\n     best ideas are either buried or stolen.'' And then there's \n     Paul Wolfowitz. (Laughter.)\n       History is not always generous to the men and women who \n     help to shape it. Great abolitionists like John Quincy Adams \n     and Frederick Douglas would not live to see full equality for \n     African Americans that they had envisioned and fought to \n     bring about. Many brave East Germans were shot as they tried \n     to breach the Berlin Wall and would never see the wall \n     crumble under the weight of lies and pretensions that built \n     it. But sometimes history is kind, and it gave President \n     Harry Truman, for example, and George Marshall the chance to \n     see the fall of the Third Reich and the fulfillment of their \n     charge to rebuild Western Europe.\n       And it allowed Corazon Aquino, with the help from a young \n     assistant secretary of State, Paul Wolfowitz, to see the \n     triumph of people power in the Philippines, the dream her \n     husband had nurtured and for which he was cut down before it \n     was fulfilled.\n       And although it may not always have seemed to Paul, the \n     fact is history has smiled on Paul, as it should.\n       So he leaves us today with the good fortune of seeing so \n     much accomplished--or being accomplished, I should say--he \n     helped bring to fruition or things that he helped set in \n     motion: reform and the modernizing of America's defense \n     establishment, the dispatch of dangerous regimes in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq, the spark of freedom and self-\n     government that is finding oxygen in the Middle East.\n       Paul now will add one more title to all the titles that \n     Pete Pace listed, and it's a heady list. When I stood with \n     Paul at his welcoming ceremony at the Pentagon way back in \n     2001, more than four years ago--it seems like eight--\n     (laughter)--I noted that this was Paul's third tour in the \n     Department of Defense. I told him we were going to keep \n     bringing him back until he got it right.\n       Well, he got it right this time. The activities he has been \n     involved with over the past four years are extensive. He has \n     helped craft four defense budgets and supplementals. He has \n     helped bring new technologies to protect our troops. And he \n     has helped to reconfigure a number of Cold War systems and \n     organizations to help us meet the threats of the 21st \n     century.\n       So as we bid Paul a warm farewell, I might just say a word \n     or two about the Paul Wolfowitz that I have worked with these \n     past four years. They say in life people tend to fall into \n     one of two categories--dreamers and doers. Well, our friend \n     Paul is a bit of a ``mugwamp,'' as they used to say in the \n     old days; he's a bit of both, one who lives the creed that \n     ``think as a man of action and act as a man of thought''.\n       He grew up in Brooklyn in a household of Polish immigrants \n     for whom names like Hitler and Stalin and words like \n     holocaust were not abstractions or simply pages in a history \n     book. And it should be no surprise to those who know him that \n     one of Paul's early political acts--at the age of 19, I'm \n     told--was to participate in the March for Civil Rights with \n     Dr. Martin Luther King.\n       Paul was a bright young mathematician who drifted into \n     political science, undoubtedly disappointing his father, who \n     I am told would have preferred he pursue a career in a real \n     subject, like chemistry or something like that. But Paul's \n     analytic talents have been put to excellent use as someone \n     who has grasped future trends and threats before many were \n     able to and before some probably wanted to.\n       As early as the 1960s, he foresaw the dangers of nuclear \n     weapon programs in the Middle East In the 1970s he identified \n     the territorial ambitions of Iraq as a future concern for the \n     U.S. military. And before September 11th, he grasped that the \n     civilized world could not make a separate peace with \n     terrorists and that our future security was certainly linked \n     to addressing the freedom deficit in much of the Muslim \n     world.\n       History will see Paul as one of the consequential thinkers \n     and public servants of his generation. He's worked to ease \n     the burdens of the wounded and their families, as we've seen. \n     And he's departing the Pentagon now, but the legacy that Paul \n     has been a part of, the ideas he has helped to weave into \n     public and private debates, the effects of the policies that \n     he's championed so effectively and with such courage and \n     determination are not going anywhere, because they're not \n     found only in this building or only in the department all \n     across the globe; they are found now in towns and villages in \n     Indonesia, where I'm told that pictures still hang in tribute \n     to an American ambassador who put the aspirations of \n     dissidents and ordinary Indonesians above the temporary \n     convenience of power politics.\n       They're found in Afghanistan today, where a democratically \n     elected government now protects women and imprisons \n     terrorists, instead of imprisoning women and harboring \n     terrorists. And they're found in a schoolroom in Iraq, where \n     a young girl will learn real history and real subjects \n     instead of lies and tributes to tyrants.\n       That girl is free, and so are millions like her--and that, \n     in part, is because of you, Paul. You've been on their side. \n     And as General Pace said, you have never wavered. The \n     threatened, the oppressed and the persecuted around the world \n     must know in their heart that they have had a friend in Paul \n     Wolfowitz. You are one of those rare people who, as the \n     Talmud puts it, would rather light candles than curse the \n     darkness.\n       So I thank you, your country thanks you, and on behalf of \n     the Department of Defense, we wish you Godspeed in your new \n     post, a post of service to the world. The department will \n     miss one of its finest public servants, and I will miss a \n     treasured friend. Godspeed.\n       Staff: Ladies and gentlemen, Deputy Secretary Paul \n     Wolfowitz.\n       Mr. Wolfowitz. Thank you all for coming today.\n       Thank you for braving the weather. Thank you, all of you \n     who helped arrange the weather so that we could stay \n     outdoors. I appreciate it enormously.\n       Senator Warner, great chairman of our Armed Services \n     Committee and a good friend all these many years, and \n     particularly the last four years, thank you for being here. \n     Senator Coleman, and so many distinguished guests. You really \n     do me honor to be here.\n       Secretary Rumsfeld, thank you for those extremely generous \n     remarks. Thank you for an award, which recognizes me, but \n     actually recognizes the work of literally millions of great \n     Americans. Your remarks call to mind something that President \n     Johnson said on a similar occasion many years ago when he \n     said he wished that his late parents could have been alive to \n     hear that introduction because his father would have been so \n     proud, and his mother would have believed it. (Chuckles.) \n     (Laughter.)\n       Maybe now is the time to come clean and to thank you for \n     something else. For four years now, I've been \n     telling audiences about what you said about keeping--\n     bringing me back until I got it right. It gets a laugh \n     every time. So I want to thank you for that great line. \n     It's been good to me all those years.\n       And now I'd like to just turn the tables a little bit and \n     trade a story somewhat along the same lines. It may be \n     apocryphal, but it's just too good to check whether it's true \n     or not. It's about how Don Rumsfeld once asked Henry \n     Kissinger if he was planning to come back as secretary of \n     State. And Kissinger said, ``No, Don, I got it right the \n     first time.'' (Laughter.)\n       So, Don, it looks like we've been in the same boat all \n     along!\n       Truthfully, Don Rumsfeld has a great sense of humor, that's \n     why I can tease him a bit too. And he's known for many other \n     things: His determination, his forcefulness, his command of \n     the podium, his charm, his matinee idol good looks--yes, he's \n     one of the stars of C-SPAN!\n       But to be totally serious, what really stands out for me is \n     something that may not be widely known, and that is what a \n     great teacher Don Rumsfeld is. He has sharpened everybody's \n     thinking and raised everybody's standards. And he's taught me \n     an enormous amount. He encourages and cajoles everyone to do \n     better, always for the purpose of making this Defense \n     Department as good as it can be, and to make our country more \n     secure.\n       It's been my good fortune, Don, to have you as a friend, \n     and America's to have your steady leadership at this \n     demanding helm. Thank you.\n       I also want to say thank you to so many of my wounded \n     veteran friends from Walter Reed and Bethesda who have braved \n     the weather to be here today. There are so many other \n     distinguished guests and friends and colleagues, that if I \n     tried to mention you all and give you the thanks you deserve, \n     I'd just get into deeper trouble. At a time like this, words \n     inevitably fall short, and I'm sure I'd leave someone out. \n     But you don't do a job like this without enormous amounts of \n     help.\n       So, to each one of you who has been there along the way, \n     just know that I am deeply grateful for what we've shared \n     during this most important chapter of American history.\n       And I'm particularly grateful to my personal staff, an \n     extraordinary combination of civilians and military, active \n     and reserve, officers and enlisted, who make a difference \n     every day.\n       Last Friday I was privileged to be present at the White \n     House when President Bush announced his nominee to be our \n     next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There in front of \n     me was an extraordinary team of civilian and military \n     leaders. First, there was our president, whom it's been such \n     an honor to serve. I've been privileged to be there as George \n     W. Bush has made some of the toughest decisions a leader can \n     make. I can tell you that this is a man who understands the \n     true costs of war, and his charge to defend what we hold most \n     dear. We are blessed in this time of testing to have a \n     president who possesses the deep moral courage to do what it \n     takes to protect our country.\n       Next to him was Secretary Rumsfeld, and there too was our \n     chairman, General Dick Myers. As we wage this global war, \n     Dick's been a leader of quiet, reassuring confidence; a rock \n     of strength and a source of steady judgment and deep concern \n     for those he serves. Dick never forgets that every decision \n     he makes directly affects the individual men and women who \n     serve this country so well.\n       And its been my good luck to have as my closest military \n     counterpart most of these past four years, General Peter \n     Pace, our vice chairman. It was a special moment last Friday, \n     Pete, to see you nominated to be the first Marine to serve as \n     chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. You have the \n     character, the commitment and the courage to do an \n     outstanding job as our top military leader.\n       I'm delighted, Gordon--that Gordon England, our secretary \n     of the Navy, who has been an outstanding member of this \n     civilian military leadership team, has agreed to take\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n     on this challenging job--and it is challenging.\n       Over the last four years, I've had the privilege of working \n     with perhaps the finest group of Joint Chiefs and combatant \n     commanders that we've ever had. And our many outstanding one- \n     and two-star flag officers promise to continue or even exceed \n     that record of excellence.\n       But the people who have earned a truly special place in my \n     heart, in all of our hearts, are the men and women whose \n     names don't appear in the papers or on the evening news; the \n     ones who serve America quietly and professionally every day, \n     the men and women who wear this country's uniform, and the \n     dedicated civil servants who support them. They are the ones \n     who deserve our special and lasting gratitude. They are \n     represented here today by these magnificent troops and by our \n     wounded veterans. Please join me now in recognizing them for \n     their service.\n       And let us remember in a special way those who have fallen \n     in service to this nation. They remain in our hearts, each \n     one of them, a reminder that our country is blessed beyond \n     all measure. Let us never forget how much we owe them.\n       When terrorists attacked us so ruthlessly on September \n     11th, they may have thought they knew who we were. They may \n     have thought we were weak, grown used to comfort, softened by \n     everything we enjoy in this great nation. But they \n     were wrong. They must have failed to notice that it was by \n     the sweat and blood of each soldier, sailor, airman, and \n     Marine, and each member of the Coast Guard, that America \n     has met every threat throughout our history.\n       When we needed them, the heroes of this generation stepped \n     forward to defend America from terrorists. In the process, \n     two brutal regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq--regimes that \n     harbored and encouraged terrorists--have been removed from \n     power. And as a result, 50 million people, almost all of them \n     Muslims, have also been released from tyranny.\n       In a region where many thought freedom and self-government \n     could never succeed, those values are beginning to take hold. \n     The tide is turning against the terrorists' brand of \n     totalitarianism. Like Nazism and communism before them, this \n     false ideology is headed for the ash heap of history.\n       And at the same time that we are facing the enormous of \n     winning a global war, we've also advanced the president's \n     agenda for transforming the department. We've made major \n     adjustments in programs such as the Trident Submarine Force, \n     new classes of surface ships, unmanned aerial vehicles, Army \n     artillery and Army aviation, missile defense and \n     transformational communications across the department.\n       We've introduced a whole new civilian personnel system for \n     the department. And along the way, we've done four regular \n     budgets, four budget amendments, and at least six \n     supplementals. None of these decisions was easy; indeed, many \n     were difficult. But in no small measure, because of what \n     seemed, at times, like endless hours of meetings--and no, \n     Don, I'm not complaining--we managed to achieve agreement \n     between the senior civilian and military leadership of DoD.\n       Senator Ted Stevens paid tribute to that fact this past \n     week when he said, ``I've never seen such a relationship \n     between chiefs and the secretary--open discussions, open \n     critique--and really, a give and take that was very helpful \n     and very healthy as far as the department is concerned.''\n       However, as important as these programmatic decisions have \n     been, transformation is most of all about new ways of \n     thinking; about how to use old systems in new ways. During \n     the last four years, the concepts of transformation and \n     asymmetric warfare have gone from being theoretical concepts \n     to battlefield realities, and are even penetrating our vast \n     acquisition apparatus, from the bureaucracy, to industry, to \n     Congress.\n       But I don't have to tell this audience that all our \n     marvelous machines and technology would mean nothing without \n     innovative and skillful people to employ them.\n       And even then, this department would be of little value if \n     our people lacked one particular quality. It's the \n     indispensable quality and the most precious one of all, human \n     courage. In this job, which has been so much more than a job \n     to me, I've seen courage in abundance.\n       I remember the valor of an Army sergeant named Steve \n     Workman. In the desperate moments after Flight 77 slammed \n     into these walls, he risked his life to get Navy Lieutenant \n     Kevin Shaeffer out of the building and to the medical \n     attention he desperately needed. Sergeant Workman stayed with \n     the badly wounded--burned officer and kept him talking and \n     kept him alive.\n       I'll remember the bravery of people like Corporal Eddie \n     Wright, a Marine who was hit by an RPG that ruptured his \n     eardrum, broke his femur and, most seriously, blew off both \n     his hands. In the confusion, Marines who had never seen \n     combat before needed reassurance, and it was Eddie Wright, as \n     badly wounded as he was, who gave it to them, telling them he \n     was fine, giving instructions on his own first aid, pointing \n     out enemy positions while directing his driver to get them \n     out of the ambush zone. Like so many of our wounded heroes, \n     Eddie's moving on in life with the same courage that he \n     summoned in those desperate moments in Iraq.\n       And I remember October 26, 2003, the day our hotel in \n     Baghdad, the AI-Rashid, was attacked. Tragically, a great \n     soldier, Lieutenant Colonel Chad Buehring, was killed that \n     day, and five others, civilian and military, were severely \n     wounded.\n       Visiting the hospital that afternoon, I spoke to an Army \n     colonel who was the most severely wounded. I asked him where \n     he was from, and he said, ``I live in Arlington, Virginia, \n     but I grew up in Lebanon, in Beirut.'' So I asked him how he \n     felt about building a new Middle East. He gave me a thumbs-\n     up, and despite his obvious pain, he also gave me a smile. \n     Today Colonel Elias Nimmer is now virtually recovered and \n     still on active duty with the U.S. Army.\n       But courage comes in many forms. Sometimes moral courage, \n     the courage to face criticism and challenge-received wisdom \n     is as important as physical courage, and I see many examples \n     of that. One such hero I've been privileged to know is Navy \n     Medical Doctor Captain Marlene DeMaio. She was convinced that \n     there was a serious flaw in the way we were designing body \n     armor. In the face of considerable resistance and criticism, \n     she put together a team whose research proved the need to \n     modify the body armor design. She and her team took on the \n     bureaucracy and won. Her moral courage has saved countless \n     American lives in Afghanistan and in Iraq.\n       There are so many other stories I could share, but I will \n     tell you just one more. Three months ago, I attended a \n     funeral at Arlington for a soldier from St. Paul, Minnesota. \n     Sergeant Michael Carlson had been killed just before the \n     January 30th elections in Iraq. Not long after those historic \n     elections, I received a letter from his mother.\n       Mrs. Carlson wrote to tell me how much it meant to her to \n     see the joy on the faces of Iraqi voters, men and women who \n     had risked their lives for something they believed in. She \n     knew her son shared that same sort of vision, and she sent me \n     an essay that he had written as a high school senior that \n     explained how she could be certain of that. It's a remarkable \n     essay, particularly from such a young man.\n       Michael had been an outstanding high school football \n     player, but he didn't want to become a professional athlete. \n     He wrote, ``I want my life to count for something more than \n     just a game. I want to be good at life. I want to fight for \n     something, be part of something that is greater than myself. \n     The only way to live forever,'' this high school senior \n     wrote, ``is to live on in those you have affected. I \n     sometimes dream of being a soldier, helping to liberate \n     people from oppression. In the end,'' he said, ``there's a \n     monument built to immortalize us in stone.''\n       Men and women like that, men and women like Michael Carlson \n     do become immortalized because they live on in our nation's \n     soul.\n       President Reagan used to ask, where do we find such people? \n     And he would answer: We find them where we've always found \n     them, on the streets and the farms of America. They are the \n     product of the freest society man has ever known.\n       On one of my visits to Iraq, I met a brigade commander who \n     told me how he explained his mission to his men. He said, ``I \n     tell them what they're doing in Iraq and what their comrades \n     are doing in Afghanistan is every bit as important what their \n     grandfathers did in Germany and Japan in World War II, or \n     what their fathers did in Korea or Europe during the Cold \n     War.''\n       That colonel was right.\n       It's been a privilege of a lifetime to serve with the \n     heroes of this generation who will be remembered with the \n     same gratitude as we remember those who have gone before. \n     Nothing is more satisfying than to be able to do work that \n     can really make a difference, and I've been lucky to have \n     many opportunities to do that, but this one was as good as \n     they come.\n       Now the president has asked me to take on a new mission \n     that of working on behalf of the world's poor. Although I \n     leave the Department of Defense, I believe both our missions \n     serve the goal of making this world a better place. It's an \n     honor. But I have one big regret: I'll be leaving some of the \n     most dedicated, most capable, most courageous people in the \n     world.\n       In many speeches over these years, I've been accustomed to \n     ask the good Lord to bless our troops and our country. While \n     I do it for the last time as your deputy secretary, I want \n     you to know that I will always carry these words as a prayer \n     in my heart: May God bless you, may God bless the men and \n     women who serve this country so nobly and so well, and may \n     God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5916-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5916-S5917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PUTTING PARTISANSHIP ASIDE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, when I was running for the \nSenate in 2000, I pledged to put partisanship aside to do what is right \nfor Nebraska. I told Nebraskans that if they elected me they could \ncount on me to carefully consider the issues and ultimately do what I \nthink is best.\n  From tax cuts, to Medicare reform to campaign finance reform and now \nto the battle over stalled judicial nominations, I have distanced \nmyself from the partisan atmosphere in Washington to get things done.\n  Over the past few months and with great intensity over the past two \nweeks, I have been working with a bipartisan group of moderate-minded\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\nSenators to craft an alternative to the ``nuclear option''--the \npartisan and political attempt to force a change in the rules of the \nSenate to end filibusters against judicial nominations.\n  The nuclear option is a temporary political fix to a very serious and \nongoing problem: The Senate's failure to confirm more than 60 \nnominations during the last administration and the filibustering of ten \nof President Bush's nominations. To address this problem, I would \nprefer a permanent rules change to the Senate over a temporary \nprocedural maneuver like the nuclear option that can be reversed if the \nWhite House or the Congress changes hands.\n  The Senate was designed by our Founding Fathers to act as a counter \nbalance to the House of Representatives which represented States based \non population. The Senate was the chamber where each State would have \nequal representation, two Senators and two votes. The intent was to \nprevent the power in Congress from becoming concentrated in large \npopulation States like New York, California, Florida and Texas. In the \nSenate, a Senator from Nebraska has the same power as a Senator from \nany other State.\n  As a former Governor and a firm believer in the power of the \nexecutive branch to appoint Cabinet members, judges and other \nofficials, I do not support filibustering nominations. In fact, as \nNebraska's Senator, I have voted against filibustering judicial \nappointments in every case but one where I was denied access to \nbackground information on the nominee. However, I also do not think the \nnuclear option is the solution to the impasse over judicial \nnominations.\n  We have built consensus behind a plan whereby seven Republican \nSenators pledge to vote against the nuclear option in exchange for an \nagreement from seven Democrats to allow most of the stalled nominations \nto get up-or-down votes as well as a pledge to not support filibusters \nof future nominations except in extraordinary circumstances.\n  Our compromise would be constructed completely within the existing \nrules of the Senate; it would prevent the nuclear option and the \nexpected fallout of bringing all Senate business, including the energy \nbill and other important legislation, to a halt; and would preserve the \nrights of the Senate minority not only for this Congress but for future \nCongresses regardless of who is in the majority. Protecting the \nSenate's minority rights might seem to go against the concept of \ndemocracy and majority rule. In reality and without the spin on this \nissue that the special interest groups from both extremes put on this \nmatter, the Senate's minority rights are part of the system of checks \nand balances that keep any branch of government from dominating the \nothers.\n  The minority rights aren't always about party politics either. Many \nfilibusters throughout history were conducted by Senators who disagreed \nwith the president or the majority of Senators. Filibusters also give \nsmall States such as Nebraska an important tool to protect itself from \nthe will of the larger States.\n  The debate over these judges has consumed the Senate and all of \nWashington. When I am in Nebraska most folks do not ask me about the \njudicial nomination process. Nebraskans tell me they want an energy \nbill that will boost ethanol production and reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. Nebraskans are concerned about the President's plan to \ndivert Social Security funds to private accounts and a myriad of other \nimportant legislative priorities.\n  Those who do mention judges and nominations express concern about \nwhere the Senate seemed to be headed. Many expressed to me the desire \nto stop the bickering and get on with the Senate's business. Others \noffered encouraging words in support of the compromise effort and those \ncomments made me feel that Nebraskans were appreciative of our efforts.\n  The business, that we as Senators are tasked with carrying out for \nthe American people would cease in the Senate if the majority leader \nfollows through on his threats to employ the nuclear option. Nebraskans \nwaiting for the energy bill, a Federal budget, asbestos litigation \nreform and even confirmation of future judicial nominations are the \nones who will suffer if the nuclear option is detonated.\n  With our compromise everybody wins. Those seeking to protect minority \nrights win. Those seeking to confirm judicial nominations win. Small \nStates win.\n  We accomplished this by working together with common purpose and \nshared concern for the future of this body. I am proud of what we have \naccomplished and I will treasure the new friends I made in the process. \nI thank you, all of you, for working with me, for trusting me, and for \njoining me in this great challenge.\n  I would like to include all the names of the signatories on the \nmemorandum of understanding as part of my statement.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to those men \nand women of the U.S. armed services, who have given their lives to \ndefend our Nation and the ideals it represents.\n  Since the birth of our Nation 229 years ago, millions of Americans \nhave answered the call to serve. They left behind the comfort of home, \nfamily and friends, to protect the American way of life and insure that \nour country would remain free and a land of opportunity for all. On \nthis day I would like to remember those whom did not return.\n  On this Memorial Day, I am put in mind of the 200th and 515th Costal \nArtillery units of the New Mexico National Guard, better known as the \nNew Mexico Brigade. The New Mexico Brigade played a prominent and \nheroic role in the fierce fighting in the Philippines, during those \nfirst dark days of the Second World War. For 4 months the men of the \n200th and 515th helped hold off the Japanese only to be defeated by \ndisease, starvation and a lack of ammunition.\n  Tragically the survivors of the Battle of Bataan from the New Mexico \nBrigade were subjected to the horrors and atrocities of the 65 mile \n``Death March'' and to years of hardship and forced labor in Japanese \nprisoner of war camps. Sadly, of the 1800 men of the New Mexico Brigade \nmore than 900 lost their lives in that far off place. This day belongs \nto them and all other Americans such as them.\n  I believe it is especially important not to forget; the men and women \nof America's Armed Forces have given their lives not only in defense of \nour Nation, but to preserve the freedom of others around the globe. \nThis is almost unquiet in human history, and no praise can be too great \nfor those individuals.\n  Today I would like to make special mention of those New Mexicans who \nhave given their lives in Operation Iraq Freedom and the global war on \nterror. I ask that New Mexicans on Memorial Day think of them and their \nfamilies and give thanks that we are blessed with such heroic men and \nwomen.\n  We must never forget the sacrifices of our solders, sailors, airmen, \nand marines. I encourage New Mexican's and all Americans on Memorial \nDay to take a moment to remember and honor the brave men and women whom \nhave fallen in our defense. At this moment in America's history, our \nmen and women in uniform are again furthering the cause of freedom \naround the world and ensuring the safety of the United States of \nAmerica. They serve with the same courage and commitment shown by \nAmericans of generations past and they deserve our thoughts and prayers \non this Memorial Day as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5917-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5917-S5918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           49TH FIGHTER WING\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \noutstanding men and women of the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman Air \nForce Base in New Mexico.\n  The 49th has received a deployment order to the Western Pacific \nregion in support of our national defense objectives.\n  Around 250 personnel from Holloman, along with approximately 15 F-\n117A\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\nNighthawks, are preparing to depart for the Republic of Korea. Their 4-\nmonth deployment is part of an ongoing measure to maintain a credible \ndeterrent posture and presence in the region and demonstrates the \ncontinued U.S. commitment towards fulfilling security responsibilities \nthroughout the Western Pacific.\n  The F-117A, and the personnel that fly and maintain them, continue to \nbe vital to our national security strategy. This is why I am so pleased \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee included my bill to restrict \nretirement of any Nighthawks in fiscal year 2006 in the committee \npassed bill.\n  We must maintain the ability to deliver precision munitions onto time \nsensitive, high value targets, wherever and whenever the need arises. \nAnd I am so proud of the men and women from New Mexico that take on \nthis very dangerous but important mission in service to their country. \nThey are all superstars that deserve the heartfelt appreciation of a \ngrateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5918-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFRO-LATINOS\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nsituation of Afro-Latinos throughout Latin America, in the hopes that \nwe can encourage more action on this issue. From Colombia to Brazil to \nthe Dominican Republic to Ecuador, persons of African descent continue \nto experience racial discrimination and remain among the poorest and \nmost marginalized groups in the entire region. While recent positive \nsteps have been taken in some areas--for example, giving land titles to \nAfro-Colombians and passing explicit anti-discrimination legislation in \nBrazil--much work still needs to be done to ensure that this is the \nbeginning of an ongoing process of reform, not the end.\n  In places where civil conflict has taken hold, Afro-Latinos are much \nmore likely to become victims of violence or refugees in their own \ncountries. In many areas, Afro-Latinos are also subject to aggression \nby local police forces at far greater rates than those perceived to be \nwhite. Access to health services is another serious concern, and recent \nstudies have shown that Afro-Latino communities are at greater risk of \ncontracting HIV/AIDS.\n  In the last Congress, there was not one mention in the Senate of the \nmillions of Afro-Latinos who continue to experience this widespread \ndiscrimination and socioeconomic marginalization. Now is the time for \nmore action on this issue, not less. Emerging civil society groups are \ngrowing stronger throughout many countries in Latin America, and this \ngrowth should be encouraged as it presents important opportunities for \npartnerships and collaboration. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and House on this critical concern in the \ncoming months, and I believe that together we can and will make a \ndifference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5918-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REACH OUT AND READ\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Reach Out \nand Read program. Reach Out and Read is a program that promotes early \nliteracy by educating doctors and parents about the importance of \nreading aloud. Reach Out and Read facilitates reading by giving books \nto children at pediatric check-ups from six months to five years of \nage, with a special focus on children growing up in poverty. Children \nwho are exposed to reading in their first years of life learn to love \nbooks at an early age--a love that often stays with them throughout \ntheir teenage and adult lives. They are also more likely to escape the \nmany problems associated with illiteracy and reading difficulty, \nincluding school absenteeism and dropout, juvenile delinquency, \nsubstance abuse, and teenage pregnancy.\n  Reach Out and Read is active in more than 2,300 hospitals and health \ncare centers in 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto \nRico. Two million children participate annually and 3.2 million new, \ndevelopmentally appropriate books are given to family members.\n  There are 123 Reach Out and Read clinical locations in my State of \nMassachusetts. More than 116,000 children participate in Reach Out and \nRead and more than 200,000 books are distributed annually.\n  Reach Out and Read is unique. Funded both by both the Federal \nGovernment and private donations, it is a program with documented \nresults. In 1998, the National Research Council released the much-\nacclaimed report, ``Preventing Reading Difficulties n Young Children'' \nwhich specifically cites Reach Out and Read as a program that \neffectively encourages young children to read. It is supported by the \nDepartment of Pediatrics at the Boston University School of Medicine \nand is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. We should all \ncontinue to support this very special program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5918-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    PONTIFICAL VISIT OF HIS HOLINESS KAREKIN II, CATHOLICOS OF ALL \n                   ARMENIANS, TO THE WESTERN DIOCESE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the \nPontifical Visit of His Holiness Karekin II, Catholicos of All \nArmenians, to the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church of North \nAmerica during the month of June 2005. The Catholicos will visit the \nWestern Diocese, headquartered in Burbank in my home State of \nCalifornia and travel around California from June 1 through 20. As the \n132nd Catholicos of all Armenians, His Holiness Karekin II is spiritual \nleader to more than 7 million Armenian Apostolic Christians worldwide. \nI would also like to recognize the Western Diocese Primate, His \nEminence Archbishop Hovnan Derderian, for his good works on behalf of \nArmenian-Americans in California and the Western U.S.\n  This momentous occasion marks the second Pontifical visit of the \nCatholicos to the Western Diocese. The visit has been titled ``The \nRenaissance of Faith'' because it marks a source of spiritual \ninspiration and reawakening for Christian Armenians, whose faith is \n1700 years old.\n  The Diocese of the Armenian Church, established 107 years ago in \nWorcester, MA, originally served Armenian churches in the United States \nand Canada. In 1927, the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church of \nNorth America was established by a directive from the Mother See. The \nestablishment of the Western Diocese was an historic occasion, which \nmarked the growth of a strong Armenian community in California and the \nWestern United States.\n  The Western Diocese was originally headquartered in Fresno. In 1957, \nthe headquarters were moved to Los Angeles. In 1994, the headquarters \nwere damaged by the Northridge Earthquake. Later that year, the \nDiocesan Assembly decided to purchase a new Diocesan Headquarters. In \n1997, the Western Diocese officially moved into a multipurpose complex \nlocated in Burbank, CA, which will be the future site of the Mother \nCathedral. This Pontifical visit is even more special because the \nCatholicos will be there in June to bless the foundation stones at the \ngroundbreaking of the new Mother Cathedral.\n  The visit is also appropriately timed to coincide with two important \nanniversaries--the 90th Anniversary of the commemoration of the \nArmenian Genocide and the 1600th Anniversary of the creation of the \nArmenian alphabet. Earlier this year, I joined my Armenian friends in \ncommemorating the 90th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, which was \nthe first genocide of the 20th century.\n  The Armenian alphabet, along with the Armenian language, has \ncontributed immensely to the vibrant continuity of Armenian culture. \nThe Catholicos' visit will highlight these two anniversaries and \nfurther empower Armenians in the Western Diocese to continue their \nlong-fought efforts for justice.\n  I am honored to recognize this historic and joyous visit, which will \nstrengthen ties between Armenia and Armenians in California. I know \nthat His Holiness Karekin II will have a very special visit to \nCalifornia and I wish the Armenian community in California an increased \nsense of purpose and inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5918-4", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5918-S5919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        TRIBUTE TO LOVELAND, COLORADO, POLICE CHIEF TOM WAGONER\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

Having served in \nseveral positions in the Greeley Police Department, Chief Wagoner left \nColorado in 1987 to be the police chief in Tullahoma, TN.\n  Fortunately, it was not long before Chief Wagoner came back to \nColorado to serve as the police chief in my hometown of Loveland in \n1989. The city of Loveland has greatly benefited from his leadership. \nOver the course of his tenure, he made many additions to the \ndepartment, including a mounted patrol unit, a motorcycle unit, a \ncommunity policing program, and a new radio system. Chief Wagoner also \npresided over a move to a new police headquarters in 2002 and has \nensured that the Loveland Police Department has received national \naccreditation since 1992.\n  I thank Chief Wagoner for over 15 years of service to the citizens of \nLoveland. He leaves behind a difficult set of shoes to fill, and he \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5919-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

It is imperative that we \ncontinue to explore the causes and effects of respiratory disease as \nwell as educating the public here and abroad.\n  Since its establishment in 1905, the American Thoracic Society has \ndemonstrated an unyielding determination to reduce the number of deaths \nfrom respiratory disorder and acute-illness. I commend ATS for its \ndedication to the cause.\n  ATS not only directs its attention to the care and treatment of \nrespiratory disease patients, it also places preventative practices at \nthe forefront of its mission. Through extensive scientific research, \nATS has established itself as a leader in the discovery of new \ninformation and knowledge. Furthermore, ATS has developed numerous \neducational programs, as well as several medical journals, to help keep \nboth the medical community and the public up to date on new scientific \ninformation and innovative practices.\n  Finally, ATS has established itself as a leading advocate of \nrespiratory research, paving the way for unprecedented developments in \nthe treatment of respiratory disease. As host of the world's leading \nrespiratory medicine conference, which provides doctors and scientists \nthe opportunity to share their successes with specialists from all over \nthe world, ATS has truly confirmed its status as a leader in the \nmedical community.\n  Over the years, ATS has grown to meet the needs of the changing world \nin which we live, while never losing sight of its basic goals of \nprevention and treatment.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to provide \nfor mental health screening and treatment services, to amend the Public \nHealth Service Act to provide for integration of mental health services \nand mental health treatment outreach teams, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, Senator Collins and I, and in the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Kennedy and Congressman Ros-\nLehtinen, are reintroducing the Positive Aging Act, in an effort to \nimprove the accessibility and quality of mental health services for our \nrapidly growing population of older Americans.\n  We are pleased to be reintroducing this important legislation during \nMental Health and Aging Week.\n  I want to acknowledge and thank our partners from the mental health \nand aging community who have collaborated with us and have been working \ndiligently on these issues for many years, including the American \nAssociation for Geriatric Psychiatry, the American Psychological \nAssociation, the National Association of Social Workers, the American \nNurses Association.\n  Today, advances in medical science are helping us to live longer than \never before. In New York State alone, there are 2\\1/2\\ million citizens \naged 65 or older. And this population will only continue to grow as the \nfirs wave of Baby Boomers turns 65 in less than 10 years.\n  As we look forward to this increased longevity, we must also \nacknowledge the challenges that we face related to the quality of life \nas we age. Chief among these are mental and behavioral health concerns.\n  Although most older adults enjoy good mental health it is estimated \nthat nearly 20 percent of Americans age 55 or older experience a mental \ndisorder. It is anticipated that the number of seniors with mental and \nbehavioral health problems will almost quadruple, from 4 million in \n1970 to 15 million in 2030.\n  In New York State alone, there are an estimated 500,000 older adults \nwith mental health disorders. As the baby boomers age we expect to see \nthe number of seniors in need of mental health services in the State of \nNew York grow to over 750,000.\n  Among the most prevalent mental health concerns older adults \nencounter are anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, and substance \nabuse. These disorders, if left untreated, can have severe physical and \npsychological implications. In fact, older adults have the highest \nrates of suicide in our country and depression is the foremost risk \nfactor.\n  The physical consequences of mental health disorders can be both \nexpensive and debilitating. Depression has a powerful negative impact \non ability to function, resulting in high rates of disability. The \nWorld Health Organization projects that by the year 2020, depression \nwill remain a leading cause of disability, second only to \ncardiovascular disease. Even mild depression lowers immunity and may \ncompromise a person's ability to fight infections and cancers. Research \nindicates that 50-70 percent of all primary care medical visits are \nrelated to psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, and \nstress.\n  Mental disorders do not have to be a part of the aging process \nbecause we have effective treatments for these conditions. But in far \ntoo many instances our seniors go undiagnosed and untreated because of \nthe current divide in our country between health care and mental health \ncare.\n  Too often physicians and other health professionals fail to recognize \nthe signs and symptoms of mental health problems. Even more troubling, \nknowledge about treatment is simply not accessible to many primary care \npractitioners. As a whole, we have\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nfailed to fully integrate mental health screening and treatment into \nour health service systems.\n  These missed opportunities to diagnose and treat mental health \ndisorders are taking a tremendous toll on seniors and increasing the \nburden on their families and our health care system.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Positive Aging Act with my co-\nsponsors Senator Collins and Representatives Kennedy and Ros-Lehtinen.\n  This legislation would amend the Older Americans Act and the Public \nHealth Service Act to strengthen the delivery of mental health services \nto older Americans.\n  Specifically, the Positive Aging Act would fund grants to states to \nprovide screening and treatment for mental health disorders in seniors.\n  It would also fund demonstration projects to provide these screening \nand treatment services to older adults residing in rural areas and in \nnaturally occurring retirement communities, NORC's.\n  This legislation would also authorize demonstration projects to reach \nout to seniors and make much needed collaborative mental health \nservices available in community settings where older adults reside and \nalready receive services such as primary care clinics, senior centers, \nadult day care programs, and assisted living facilities.\n  Today, we are fortunate to have a variety of effective treatments to \naddress the mental health needs of American seniors. I believe that we \nowe it to older adults in this country to do all that we can to ensure \nthat high quality mental health care is both available and accessible.\n  This legislation takes an important step in that direction and I look \nforward to working with you all to enact the Positive Aging Act during \nthe upcoming Older Americans Act and SAMHSA reauthorizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1116\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to deepen the peaceful business and cultural \nengagement of the United States and the People's Republic of China, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that aims to \nredefine and enhance the relationship between the People's Republic of \nChina and the United States of America.\n  At this point in our history we stand at the threshold of a new era \nin American Foreign policy and indeed of world history. For the first \ntime ever an economic and military superpower is about to emerge \nwithout war or catastrophe: Asia's middle kingdom: the People's \nRepublic of China, stands at the precipice of becoming one of the two \nmost influential nations on Earth.\n  I have always held that our foreign policy is best conducted when our \nvalues as a Nation form the basis of our policies. With that in mind, I \nstand before you today to introduce legislation that will deepen the \nscope and breadth of America's relationship with China through the \nreaching out of our Nation's hand in friendship.\n  We introduce this with a bit of humility because history constantly \nshows us that the more things change, the more they stay the same. \nFortunately American history is filled with good ideas to guide us.\n  Back in 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant told Congress that trade \nimbalances with China were threatening the viability of key United \nStates' industries and warned that federal intervention might be needed \nto restore the balance of trade.\n  That is true today and I am both sponsoring and supporting \nlegislation to fairly revalue the Yuan so that U.S. industries and \nworkers enjoy a fair playing field in the global market.\n  But Grant also thought many problems with China could be solved if we \njust better understood Chinese language and culture. He proposed \nsending at least four American students a year to China to study the \nlanguage and culture and who would then act as effective translators \nfor business and government officials.\n  Grant's idea was never acted on and years of unfortunate history \nseparated China from the rest of the world anyway.\n  But China is back and so are the challenges.\n  Those versed in international affairs and trade are fully aware of \nChina's emerging influence. However, our present education system is \nnot equipped to supply the number of skilled professionals required to \nconstructively interact with China. According to the 2000 Census there \nare about 2.2 million Americans that speak Chinese. Of that 2.2 \nmillion, approximately 85-95 percent are Americans of Chinese descent. \nAccording to several studies there is a dearth of knowledge among \ncollege-bound students regarding Chinese cultural pillars like Mao \nZedong in the United States. China, on the other hand, mandates English \ninstruction beginning in--what we would call--the third grade. For \nevery student we send to China to study there, they send 25 to study \nhere.\n\n  If you combine these findings with the fact that well over half of \nthe 500 largest companies are currently invested in China, with many \nmore drawing up plans to do so, it becomes clear to me that the talent \npool for future American-produced leaders with expertise in Chinese \naffairs is woefully inadequate. If you take a look at China's top ten \ntrading partners, seven of those have a trade surplus with China and \nmost importantly, five of those seven have a significant population \nwith deep-seated knowledge of Chinese language and culture. America \nneeds more people with the expertise to transact with China in \ninternational affairs and\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nto increase the number of professionals that will assist both nations \nin growing and balancing our economic interdependency.\n  The future repercussions of our lack of knowledge about Chinese \nculture are immense. The Chinese have just begun to compete with U.S. \nfirms for precious natural resources to feed the exponential growth of \ntheir economy. China is the world's biggest consumer of steel and in \nanother decade will be the biggest consumer of petroleum. Currently, \nChina's middle class is the fastest growing anywhere in the world. Over \n400 of the world's Fortune 500 companies are invested in China's \neconomy, which will soon be the largest consumer market in the world. \nAlready, our trade with Asia is double that with Europe and is expected \nto exceed one trillion dollars annually before 2010. China, soon to be \nthe biggest economic power in Asia, will play a large role in that \ngrowth. Consequently, the one in six U.S. jobs that are currently tied \nto international trade will grow substantially. If the U.S. is to grab \na significant piece of China's burgeoning consumer market, we must \nbegin by engaging China as experts of their culture.\n  The United States-China Cultural Engagement Act of 2005 authorizes \n$1.3 billion over the five years after its enactment. This is a \nsymbolic gesture for the recent birth of China's one billion three \nhundred millionth citizen. One may argue that is too much given other \nimportant--under-funded--national priorities. However, the dividend \nfrom this investment in our future business and government leaders pays \nfor itself a hundred or even a million times over in opportunities for \neconomic growth and in potential foreign crises that will be averted.\n  In this legislation, I propose to significantly enhance our schools \nand academic institutions' ability to teach Chinese language and \nculture from elementary school through advanced degree studies. This \nact will expand student physical exchange programs with China as well \nas create a virtual exchange infrastructure for secondary school \nstudents that study Chinese. Initiatives were included, that offer the \nDepartment of State more flexibility in granting visas to Chinese \nscientists to come here and study at American academic institutions. \nFor American businesses, I seek a substantial increase in Foreign \nCommercial Service officers stationed in China to uncover and \nfacilitate more American export opportunities. For non-corporate \nentrepreneurs, provisions that provide for the expansion of state \nspecific export centers and greater Small Business Administration \noutreach were also included.\n  Engaging China as an ally in international affairs and as a partner \nin building economic prosperity is of the utmost importance to the \nUnited States. Only if we succeed in fostering this relationship can we \nhave a future that is as bright as our past. Education experts, \ncorporate leaders, and even some government officials have talked for \nsometime about the convergence of economic, demographic, and national \nsecurity trends that require our young people to attain a greater level \nof international knowledge and skills to be successful as workers and \ncitizens in our increasingly dynamic American economy.\n  The rise of China comes with a whole set of challenges. But the \nability to talk to and understand each other should not be among them.\n  The United States-China Cultural Engagement Act sets forth a strategy \nfor achieving that level of understanding and cooperation with China, I \nurge my colleagues to look favorably upon this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1118. A bill to amend the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 to reduce \nirrigation subsidies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a measure aimed \nat curbing wasteful spending. In the face of our ever growing Federal \ndeficit, we must prioritize and eliminate programs that can no longer \nbe sustained with limited Federal dollars, or where a more cost-\neffective means of fulfilling those functions can be substituted. The \nmeasure that I introduce today establishes a means test for large \nagribusinesses receiving subsidized water from the Bureau of \nReclamation.\n  The irrigation means test provision is drawn from legislation that I \nhave sponsored in previous Congresses to reduce the amount of Federal \nirrigation subsidies received by large agribusiness interests. I \nbelieve that reforming Federal water pricing policy by reducing \nsubsidies is important as a means to achieve our broader objectives of \nachieving a truly balanced budget. This legislation is also needed to \ncurb fundamental abuses of reclamation law that cost the taxpayer \nmillions of dollars every year.\n  In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed legislation, which \ncame to be known as the Reclamation Act of 1902, to encourage \ndevelopment of family farms throughout the western United States. The \nidea was to provide needed water for areas that were otherwise dry and \ngive small farms, those no larger than 160 acres, a chance, with a \nhelping hand from the Federal Government, to establish themselves. \nAccording to a 1996 General Accounting Office report, since the passage \nof the Reclamation Act, the Federal Government has spent $21.8 billion \nto construct 133 water projects in the west to provide water for \nirrigation. Agribusinesses, and other project beneficiaries, are \nrequired under the law to repay to the Federal Government their \nallocated share of the costs of constructing these projects.\n  As a result of the subsidized financing provided by the Federal \nGovernment, however, some of the beneficiaries of Federal water \nprojects repay considerably less than their full share of these costs. \nAccording to the 1996 GAO report, agribusinesses generally receive the \nlargest amount of federal financial assistance. Since the initiation of \nthe irrigation program in 1902, construction costs associated with \nirrigation have been repaid without interest. The GAO further found, in \nreviewing the Bureau of Reclamation's financial reports, that $16.9 \nbillion, or 78 percent, of the $21.8 billion of Federal investment in \nwater projects is considered to be reimbursable. Of the reimbursable \ncosts, the largest share, $7.1 billion, is allocated to irrigation \ninterests. GAO also found that the Bureau of Reclamation will likely \nshift $3.4 billion of the debt owed by agribusinesses to other users of \nthe water projects for repayment.\n  There are several reasons why large agribusinesses continue to \nreceive such significant subsidies. Under the Reclamation Reform Act of \n1982, Congress acted to expand the size of the farms that could receive \nsubsidized water from 160 acres to 960 acres. The RRA of 1982 expressly \nprohibits farms that exceed 960 acres in size from receiving federally \nsubsidized water. These restrictions were added to the Reclamation law \nto close loopholes through which Federal subsidies were flowing to \nlarge agribusinesses rather than the small family farmers that \nReclamation projects were designed to serve. Agribusinesses were \nexpected to pay full cost for all water received on land in excess of \ntheir 960 acre entitlement.\n  Despite the express mandate of Congress, regulations promulgated \nunder the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 have failed to keep big \nagricultural water users from receiving Federal subsidies. The General \nAccounting Office and the Inspector General of the Department of the \nInterior continue to find that the acreage limits established in law \nare circumvented through the creation of arrangements such as farming \ntrusts. These trusts, which in total acreage well exceed the 960 acre \nlimit, are comprised of smaller units that are not subject to the \nreclamation acreage cap. These smaller units are farmed under a single \nmanagement agreement often through a combination of leasing and \nownership.\n  The Department of the Interior has acknowledged that these trusts \nexist. Interior published a final rulemaking in 1998 to require farm \noperators who provide services to more than 960 nonexempt acres \nwestwide, held by a single trust or legal entity or any combination of \ntrusts and legal entities, to submit RRA forms to the district(s) where \nsuch land is located. Water districts are now required to provide \nspecific information about farm operators to Interior annually. This \ninformation is an important step toward enforcing the legislation that \nI am reintroducing today.\n  A recent report by the Environmental Working Group examined water\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nsubsidies in the Central Valley Project (CVP) of California and it \nprovides further evidence that this legislation is long overdue. \nAccording to EWG, in 2002, the largest 10 percent of the farms in the \narea got 67 percent of the water, for an average subsidy worth up to \n$349,000 each at market rates for replacement water. Twenty-seven large \nfarms received subsidies each worth $1 million or more at market rates. \nYet, the median subsidy for a Central Valley farmer in 2002 was $7,076 \na year, almost 50 times less than the largest 10 percent of farms. One \nfarm in Fresno County received more water by itself than 70 CVP water \nuser districts. Its subsidy alone was worth $4.2 million a year at \nmarket rates.\n  This analysis is significant because the Bureau of Reclamation \nprogram is supposed to help small farmers, not large agribusinesses. \nThe CVP analysis is also important because CVP farmers get about one-\nfifth of all the water used in California, at rates that by any measure \nare far below market value. In 2002, for example, the average price for \nirrigation water from the CVP was less than 2 percent what Los Angeles \nresidents pay for drinking water, one-tenth the estimated cost of \nreplacement water supplies, and about one-eighth what the public pays \nto buy its own water back to restore the San Francisco Bay and Delta. \nMeanwhile, many citizens in living in the CVP do not have access to \nclean, safe drinking water. Unfortunately, this situation is pervasive \nin many other Western communities.\n  My legislation combines various elements of proposals introduced by \nother members of Congress to close loopholes in the 1982 legislation \nand to impose a $500,000 means test. This new approach limits the \namount of subsidized irrigation water delivered to any operation in \nexcess of the 960 acre limit that claimed $500,000 or more in gross \nincome, as reported on its most recent IRS tax form. If the $500,000 \nthreshold were exceeded, an income ratio would be used to determine how \nmuch of the water should be delivered to the user at the full-cost \nrate, and how much at the below-cost rate. For example, if a 961 acre \noperation earned $1 million, a ratio of $500,000, the means-test value, \ndivided by its gross income would determine the full cost rate. Thus \nthe water user would pay the full cost rate on half of their acreage \nand the below-cost rate on the remaining half.\n  This means-testing proposal was featured in the 2000 Green Scissors \nreport. This report is compiled annually by Friends of the Earth and \nTaxpayers for Common Sense and supported by a number of environmental, \nconsumer and taxpayer groups. The premise of the report is that there \nare a number of subsidies and projects that could be cut to both reduce \nthe deficit and benefit the environment. The Green Scissors \nrecommendation on means-testing water subsidies indicates that if a \ntest is successful in reducing subsidy payments to the highest grossing \n10 percent of farms, then the federal government would recover between \n$440 million and $1.1 billion per year, or at least $2.2 billion over 5 \nyears.\n  When countless Federal programs are subjected to various types of \nmeans tests to limit benefits to those who truly need assistance, it \nmakes little sense to continue to allow large business interests to dip \ninto a program intended to help small entities struggling to survive. \nTaxpayers have legitimate concerns when they learn that their hard-\nearned tax dollars are being expended to assist large corporate \ninterests in select regions of the country, particularly in tight \nbudgetary times.\n  I urge Congress to act swiftly to save money for the taxpayers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAMBLISS:\n  S. 1119. A bill to permit an alien to remain eligible for a diversity \nvisa beyond the fiscal year in which the alien applied for the visa, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nfix a problem that some of my colleagues have experienced in serving \ntheir constituents. Immigration case work is one of the top issues that \nmy State offices handle on a regular basis. Occasionally, people who \nare in our country legally and playing by the rules can slip through \nthe cracks as they wait on the immigration process to run its course. \nWith the massive caseload handled by immigration services, there are \nbound to be mistakes, and this legislation allows the agency to remedy \nthose mistakes in the limited situation of the Diversity Visa program.\n  The case of an Atlanta couple, Charles Nyaga and his wife, Doin, came \nto my attention about a year ago. Charles Nyaga, a native of Kenya, \ncame to the U.S. with his family as a student in 1996, and he is \ncurrently pursuing a master's degree in divinity. In 1997, he applied \nfor the fiscal year 1998 Diversity Visa program and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service (INS) selected him. In accordance with the \nDiversity Visa requirements, Nyaga and his wife submitted an \napplication and a fee to adjust their status to legal permanent \nresident.\n  A cover letter on the Diversity Visa application instructed: ``While \nyour application is pending before the interview, please DO NOT make \ninquiry as to the status of your case, since it will result in further \ndelay.'' During the eight months that INS had to review his \napplication, Nyaga accordingly never made inquiry, and he unfortunately \nnever heard back. His valid application simply slipped through the \ncracks. At the end of the fiscal year, Nyaga's application expired, \nalthough a sufficient number of diversity visas remained available.\n  Nyaga and his wife took their case all the way to the 11th Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. In a decision last year, the Court found that the INS \nlacks the authority to act on Nyaga's application after the end of the \nfiscal year, regardless of how meritorious his case is. The court even \nwent so far as to note that a private relief bill is the remedy for \nNyaga in order to overcome the statuary barrier that prohibits the INS \nfrom reviewing a case in a prior fiscal year. The U.S. Supreme Court \ndeclined to take up this case.\n  My legislation would overcome this statutory hurdle for Charles \nNyaga, his wife, and others who are similarly situated. The legislation \nwould give the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) the opportunity to \nreopen cases from previous fiscal years in order to complete their \nprocessing. It is important to understand that this process would only \nbe available to those individuals who have been here since the time \nthey filed their claim. The bill would still give DHS the discretion to \nconduct background checks and weigh any security concerns before \nadjusting an applicant's status.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and with Homeland \nSecurity officials to pass this legislation this year. We must provide \nrelief in these cases. I believe this targeted legislation strikes the \nproper balance to provide thorough processing of Diversity Visa \napplications while not compromising the Department's national security \nmission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. \n        Smith):\n  S. 1120. A bill to reduce hunger in the United States by half by \n2010, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, nearly a decade ago, at the 1996 World \nFood Summit, the United States joined 185 other countries in a \ncommitment to cut the number of undernourished people in the world in \nhalf by 2015. In 2000, as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative, \nthe U.S. government set another, more ambitious goal--to cut U.S. food \ninsecurity in half from the 1995 level by 2010.\n  These are laudable and achievable goals. But our actions as a Nation \nhave not kept pace with our words. Hunger and food insecurity have \nincreased in this country each year since 1999. According to Household \nFood Security in the United States, 2003, the most recent report on \nhunger and food insecurity in the U.S. from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, 36.3 million people--including nearly 13.3 million \nchildren--lived in households that experienced hunger or the risk of \nhunger in 2003. This represents more than one in ten households in the \nUnited States (11.2 percent) and is an increase of 1.4 million, from \n34.9 million in 2002.\n  In his remarks to delegates at the first World Food Congress in 1963, \nPresident John F. Kennedy said, ``We have the means, we have the \ncapacity\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nto eliminate hunger from the face of the earth in our lifetime. We only \nneed the will.''\n  Forty-two years later, we still need the will, especially the \npolitical will.\n  In June 2004, the National Anti-Hunger Organization (NAHO), which is \ncomprised of the 13 national organizations that are working to end \nwidespread hunger in our country, released A Blueprint to End Hunger. \nIt is a roadmap setting forth a strategy for government, schools and \ncommunity organizations, nonprofit groups, businesses, and individuals \nto solve the problem of hunger. The report recommends that Federal food \nprograms continue as the centerpiece of our strategy to end hunger. It \nalso urges us, the Federal Government, to invest in and strengthen the \nnational nutrition safety net and increase outreach and awareness of \nthe importance of preventing hunger and improving nutrition.\n  We know that Federal nutrition programs work. WIC, food stamps, the \nschool breakfast and lunch programs, and other federal nutrition \nprograms are reaching record numbers of Americans today, and making \ntheir lives better. But we're not reaching enough people. There are \nstill too many parents in this country who skip meals because there is \nnot enough money in the family food budget for them and their children \nto eat every night. There are still too many babies and toddlers in \nAmerica who are not getting the nutrition their minds and bodies need \nto develop to their fullest potential. There are too many seniors, and \nchildren, who go to bed hungry. In the richest Nation in the history of \nthe world, that's unacceptable.\n  Today, in an effort to stir the political will and rekindle our \ncommitment to achieve the goal of ending hunger, I am introducing the \nHunger-Free Communities Act of 2005 with Senators Smith, Lugar, and \nLincoln. This bill builds on the recommendations made by NAHO and is \ndesigned to put our nation back on track toward the goal of cutting \ndomestic food insecurity and hunger in half by 2010. It contains a \nsense of the Congress reaffirming our commitment to the 2010 goal and \nestablishing a new goal: the elimination of hunger in the United States \nby 2015. This sense of Congress also urges the preservation of the \nentitlement nature of food programs and the protection of federal \nnutrition programs from funding cuts that reduce benefit levels or the \nnumber of eligible participants.\n  The Hunger-Free Communities Act also increases the resources \navailable to local groups across the country working to eliminate \nhunger in their communities. Each day, thousands of community-based \ngroups and millions of volunteers work on the front lines of the battle \nagainst hunger. This bill establishes an anti-hunger grant program, the \nfirst of its kind, with an emphasis on assessing hunger in individual \ncommunities and promoting cooperation and collaboration among local \nanti-hunger groups. The grant program recognizes the vital role that \ncommunity-based organizations already play in the fight against hunger \nand represents Congress' commitment to the public/private partnership \nnecessary to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, food insecurity and \nhunger in this country.\n  Hunger is not a partisan issue. During the 1960s and 1970s, under \nboth Democratic and Republican Administrations, our country undertook \ninitiatives and put in place programs that substantially reduced the \nnumber of people who struggle to feed their families in our nation. \nUnfortunately, this progress has not been sustained.\n  We now have the opportunity to forge a new bipartisan partnership, \ncommitted to addressing hunger in the United States. Senators Smith, \nDole, Lincoln, and I have created the bipartisan Senate Hunger Caucus \nwith that goal in mind. Progress against hunger is possible, even with \na war abroad and budget deficits at home. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir leadership on the Hunger Caucus and look forward to working with \nthem, and other members of this body, as we consider the Hunger-Free \nCommunities Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) food insecurity and hunger are growing problems in the \n     United States;\n       (2) in 2003, more than 36,000,000 people, 13,000,000 of \n     whom were children, lived in households that were food \n     insecure, representing an increase of 5,200,000 people in \n     just 4 years;\n       (3) over 9,600,000 people lived in households in which at \n     least 1 person experienced hunger;\n       (4)(A) at the 1996 World Food Summit, the United States, \n     along with 185 other countries, pledged to reduce the number \n     of undernourished people by half by 2015;\n       (B) as a result of this pledge, the Department of Health \n     and Human Services adopted the Healthy People 2010 goal to \n     cut food insecurity in half by 2010, and in doing so reduce \n     hunger;\n       (5)(A) the Healthy People 2010 goal measures progress that \n     has been made since the 1996 World Food Summit and urges the \n     Federal Government to reduce food insecurity from the 1995 \n     level of 12 percent to 6 percent;\n       (B) in 1999, food insecurity decreased to 10.1 percent, and \n     hunger decreased to 3 percent, but no progress has been made \n     since 1999;\n       (C) in 2003, food insecurity increased to 11.2 percent and \n     hunger increased to 3.5 percent, so that the United States \n     needs to reduce food insecurity by approximately 5 percentage \n     points in the next 5 years in order to reach the Healthy \n     People 2010 goal;\n       (6) anti-hunger organizations in the United States have \n     encouraged Congress to achieve the commitment of the United \n     States to decrease food insecurity and hunger in half by 2010 \n     and eliminating food insecurity and hunger by 2015;\n       (7) anti-hunger organizations in the United States have \n     identified strategies to cut food insecurity and hunger in \n     half by 2010 and to eliminate food insecurity and hunger by \n     2015;\n       (8)(A) national nutrition programs are among the fastest, \n     most direct ways to efficiently and effectively prevent \n     hunger, reduce food insecurity, and improve nutrition among \n     the populations targeted by a program;\n       (B) the programs are responsible for the absence of \n     widespread hunger and malnutrition among the poorest people, \n     especially children, in the United States;\n       (9)(A) although national nutrition programs are essential \n     in the fight against hunger, the programs fail to reach all \n     of the people eligible and entitled to their services;\n       (B) according to the Department of Agriculture, only \n     approximately 56 percent of food-insecure households receive \n     assistance from at least 1 of the 3 largest national \n     nutrition programs, the food stamp program, the special \n     supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and \n     children (WIC), and the school lunch program;\n       (C) the food stamp program reaches only about 54 percent of \n     the households that are eligible for benefits; and\n       (D) free and reduced price school breakfasts are served to \n     about \\1/2\\ of the low-income children who get free or \n     reduced price lunches, and during the summer months, less \n     than 20 percent of the children who receive free and reduced \n     price school lunches are served meals;\n       (10) in 2001, food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, and \n     emergency shelters helped to feed more than 23,000,000 low-\n     income people;\n       (11) community-based organizations and charities can help--\n       (A) play an important role in preventing and reducing \n     hunger;\n       (B) measure community food security;\n       (C) develop and implement plans for improving food \n     security;\n       (D) educate community leaders about the problems of and \n     solutions to hunger;\n       (E) ensure that local nutrition programs are implemented \n     effectively; and\n       (F) improve the connection of food insecure people to anti-\n     hunger programs;\n       (12) according to the Department of Agriculture, in 2003, \n     hunger was 8 times as prevalent, and food insecurity was \n     nearly 6 times as prevalent, in households with incomes below \n     185 percent of the poverty line as in households with incomes \n     at or above 185 percent of the poverty line; and\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\n       (13) in order to achieve the goal of reducing food \n     insecurity and hunger by \\1/2\\ by 2010, the United States \n     needs to--\n       (A) ensure improved employment and income opportunities, \n     especially for less-skilled workers and single mothers with \n     children; and\n       (B) reduce the strain that rising housing and health care \n     costs place on families with limited or stagnant incomes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out title \n     II $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2011.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, while serving as a Congressmen from \nTexas in the 1980s, Mickey Leland said, ``I cannot get used to hunger \nand desperate poverty in our plentiful land. There is no reason for it, \nthere is no excuse for it, and it is time that we as a nation put an \nend to it.''\n  Over 15 years have passed since Mr. Leland delivered those powerful \nremarks, and we have yet to achieve his goal of ending hunger in \nAmerica. In many respects, we have only slipped backwards. According to \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture, 36.3 million Americans, including \n13.3 million children, experienced hunger or food insecurity in 2003. \nThese figures, startling on their own, have been increasing steadily \nsince 1999. We need to reverse this trend.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pledge my commitment to this cause. \nToday, I am pleased to join Senators Durbin, Smith, and Lugar in \nintroducing the Hunger-Free Communities Act of 2005. This bill \nestablishes a goal of ending hunger in America by 2015. The bill also \nsupports preserving the entitlement framework of the federal food \nprograms. Our federal food programs are vitally important to the \nmillions of working Americans that are trying to make ends meet and the \nmillions of children who need access to nutritious food.\n  In addition, this bill commits our fullest efforts to protecting the \ndiscretionary food program from budget cuts that would prevent these \nprograms from addressing identified need. Lastly, the bill provides \nneeded resources to non-profit organizations that fight to reduce \nhunger every day. The grant programs this bill establishes will promote \nnew partnerships and help build the infrastructure we believe is \nnecessary to root out hunger in every corner of our nation.\n  Almost a year ago, I joined Senators Smith, Durbin and Dole in \nfounding the bipartisan Senate Hunger Caucus to address the growing \nproblem of hunger in America and around the world. The Senate Hunger \nCaucus currently has 34 members and we are working together to raise \nawareness about these issues and help create solutions to the hunger \nproblem.\n  While there are many difficult problems we work to solve in Congress, \nhunger is a problem that has a solution. This bill is an example of our \nbipartisan effort to develop solutions to the hunger problem in \nAmerica. I am proud to work with my colleagues to support ending hunger \nfor the millions of Americans who find themselves without access to one \nof the most basic needs--nutritious food.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1122. A bill to authorize and direct the exchange and conveyance \nof certain National Forest land and other land in southeast Arizona; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain to introduce the Southeast Arizona Land Exchange and \nConservation Act of 2005. This bill, which facilitates an important \nland exchange in Arizona, is the product of months of discussion \nbetween the United States Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, \nState and local officials, community groups, recreational and \nconservation groups, and other stakeholders. It will allow for the \nprotection of some of the most environmentally sensitive lands in \nArizona while providing a much needed economic engine for the people of \nSuperior, AZ and the surrounding communities. An identical companion \nbill is being introduced today in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Renzi.\n  The exchange conveys approximately 3,025 acres of land controlled by \nthe Forest Service to Resolution Copper Company. The acreage to be \ntraded to Resolution Copper will facilitate future exploration, and \npossible development, of what may be one of the largest deposits of \ncopper ore ever discovered in North America. The 3,025 acres are \nintermingled with, or lie next to, private lands already owned by \nResolution Copper, and are located south and\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\neast of Resolution's existing underground Magma copper mine. \nApproximately 75 percent of the 3,025 acre Federal parcel is already \nblanketed by federally authorized mining claims owned by Resolution \nCopper that give Resolution the right to explore and develop mineral \ndeposits on it. Given the intermingled ownership, the public safety \nissues that may be associated with mining activities, and the \nsignificant financial investment Resolution Copper must make to even \ndetermine whether development of a mine is feasible, it makes sense, \nfor Resolution Copper to own the entire mining area.\n  However, we also recognize that there is public resource value \nassociated with the Federal land that would come into private ownership \nand, to the extent we can, we should protect and or replace these \nresources. The Apache Leap Escarpment, a spectacular cliff area \ncomprising approximately 562 acres on the western side of the federal \nparcel, is an area deserving of protection. To protect the surface of \nthis area from mining and development, the bill requires that a \npermanent conservation easement be placed on this area. In addition, \nthe bill sets up a process to determine whether additional or enhanced \npublic access should be provided to Apache Leap and, if so, provides \nthat Resolution Copper will pay up to $250,000 to provide such access.\n  The bill also requires replacement sites for the Oak Flat Campground \nand the climbing area that are located on the Federal parcel that will \nbe traded to Resolution Copper. The process to locate replacement sites \nis already under way, and I am told it is going well. Access to these \npublic areas will not immediately terminate on enactment of this \nlegislation: The bill allows continued public use of the Oak Flat \nCampground for two years after the enactment and it allows for \ncontinued rock climbing use for two years after, and use of the land \nfor the annual ``Boulder Blast'' rock climbing competition for five \nyears after enactment. Replacement sites will be designed and developed \nlargely with funding provided by Resolution Copper.\n  I am also working with Resolution Copper and community groups to \ndetermine whether there may be additional climbing areas within the \nFederal parcel that could continue to be accessible to the public \nwithout compromising public safety or the mining operation. I have \nincluded a placeholder in the bill for such additional climbing \nprovisions if agreed to.\n  In return for conveying the Federal land parcel to Resolution Copper, \nthe Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management will receive six \nparcels of private land, totaling 4,814 acres. These parcels have been \nidentified, and are strongly endorsed for public acquisition, by the \nForest Service, BLM, Arizona Audubon Society, Nature Conservancy, \nSonoran Institute, Arizona Game and Fish Department, and numerous \nothers.\n  The largest of the six parcels is the Seven B Ranch located near \nMammoth. It runs for 6.8 miles along both sides of the lower San Pedro \nRiver--one of the few remaining undammed rivers in the southwestern \nUnited States. The parcel also has: one of the largest, and possibly \noldest, mesquite bosques in Arizona; a high volume spring that flows \nyear round; and potential recovery habitat for several endangered \nspecies, including the southwestern willow flycatcher. It lies on an \ninternationally recognized migratory bird flyway, with roughly half the \nnumber of known breeding bird species in North America passing through \nthe corridor. Public acquisition of this parcel will greatly enhance \nefforts by Federal and State agencies to preserve for future \ngenerations the San Pedro River and its wildlife and bird habitat.\n  A second major parcel is the Appleton Ranch, consisting of 10 private \ninholdings intermingled with the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch, \nadjacent to the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area southeast of \nTucson. This acquisition will facilitate and protect the study of \nsouthwestern grassland ecology and unique aquatic wildlife and habitat.\n  Finally, the Forest Service will acquire four inholdings in the Tonto \nNational Forest that possess valuable riparian and wetland habitat, \nwater resources, historic and cultural resources, and habitat for \nnumerous plant, wildlife and bird species, including the endangered \nArizona hedgehog cactus.\n  Although the focus of this bill is the land exchange between \nResolution Copper and the United States, it also includes provisions \nallowing for the conveyance of Federal lands to the Town of Superior, \nif it so requests. These lands include the town cemetery, lands around \nthe town airport, and a Federal reversionary interest that exists at \nits airport site. These lands are included in the proposed exchange to \nassist the town in providing for its municipal needs and expanding its \neconomic development.\n  Though I have described the many benefits of this exchange, you may \nbe asking why we are legislating this land exchange. Why not use the \nexisting administrative land exchange process? The answer is that this \nexchange can only be accomplished legislatively because the Forest \nService does not have the authority to convey away federal lands in \norder to acquire other lands outside the boundaries of the National \nForest System, no matter how ecologically valuable.\n  Of primary importance to me is that the exchange have procedural \nsafeguards and conditions that ensure it is an equal value exchange \nthat is in the public interest.\n  I will highlight some of the safeguards in this legislation: First, \nit requires that all appraisals of the lands must follow standard \nFederal practice and be performed in accordance with appraisal \nstandards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Justice. All appraisals \nmust also be formally reviewed, and approved, by the Secretary of \nAgriculture. Second, to ensure the Federal Government gets full value \nfor the Federal parcel it is giving up, the Federal parcel will be \nappraised to include the minerals and appraised as if unencumbered by \nthe private mining claims that detract from the fair market value of \nthe land. These are important provisions not required by Federal law. \nThey are especially significant given that over 75 percent of the \nFederal parcel is covered by mining claims owned by Resolution Copper \nand the bulk of the value of the Federal parcel is expected to be the \nminerals. Third, it requires that the Apache Leap conservation easement \nnot be considered in determining the fair market value of the Federal \nland parcel. I believe by following standard appraisal practices and \nincluding these additional safeguards in the valuation process, the \nUnited States, and ultimately the taxpayer, will receive full fair \nmarket value for both the land and the minerals it contains.\n  In summary, with this land exchange we can preserve lands that \nadvance the important public objectives of protecting wildlife habitat, \ncultural resources, the watershed, and aesthetic values, while \ngenerating economic and employment opportunities for State and local \nresidents. I hope we approve the legislation at the earliest possible \ndate. It is a winning scenario for our environment, our economy, and \nour posterity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1125. A bill to reform liability for certain charitable \ncontributions and services; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am introducing the Expanding \nCharitable and Volunteer Opportunities Act of 2005. I am proud of the \ncharitable work that is continuously done throughout this country. \nHowever, individual charitable giving rates among Americans have \nstagnated over the past fifty years. As legislators, we must provide \nincentives for charitable giving and opportunities for low-income \nfamilies to build individual assets, and support faith-based and \nsecular organizations as they provide charitable social services. We \nmust also eliminate unnecessary road blocks that might keep businesses \nand individuals from donating to the needy. I remain committed to \npromoting increased opportunities for the less fortunate to obtain help \nthrough faith-based and community organizations. There are people all \naround the country waiting to give more to charity--they just need a \nlittle push.\n  The Expanding Charitable and Volunteer Opportunities Act provides \nsuch a push. This legislation builds on the Volunteer Protection Act of \n1997 that immunizes individuals who do volunteer work for non-profit \norganizations\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\nor governmental entities from liability for ordinary negligence in the \ncourse of their volunteer work. My bill prevents a business from being \nsubject to civil liability when a piece of equipment has been loaned by \na business entity to a nonprofit organization unless the business has \nengaged in gross negligence or intentional conduct. This provision \npassed the House of Representatives in the 107th Congress as part of \nH.R. 7, and I am hopeful we can do the same here in the Senate in the \n109th.\n  This bill also builds on the success of the Good Samaritan Food \nDonation Act by providing similar liability protections for volunteer \nfirefighter companies. The basic purpose of this provision is to induce \ndonations of surplus firefighting equipment by reducing the threat of \ncivil liability for organizations (most commonly heavy industry) and \nindividuals who wish to make these donations. The bill eliminates civil \nliability barriers to donations of surplus fire fighting equipment by \nraising the liability standard for donors from ``negligence'' to \n``gross negligence.'' By doing this, the legislation saves taxpayer \ndollars by encouraging donations, thereby reducing the taxpayers' \nburden of purchasing expensive equipment for volunteer fire \ndepartments.\n  The Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2005 is \nmodeled after a bill passed by the Texas state legislature in 1997 and \nsigned into law by then-Governor George W. Bush which has resulted in \nmore than $10 million in additional equipment donations from companies \nand other fire departments for volunteer departments which may not be \nas well equipped. Now companies in Texas can donate surplus equipment \nto the Texas Forest Service, which then certifies the equipment and \npasses it on to volunteer fire departments that are in need. The \ndonated equipment must meet all original specifications before it can \nbe sent to volunteer departments. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, \nCalifornia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, South \nCarolina, and Pennsylvania have passed similar legislation at the state \nlevel.\n  Finally, my legislation provides commonsense medical liability \nprotections to physicians who volunteer their time to assist patients \nat community health centers. The Expanding Charitable and Volunteer \nOpportunities Act would extend the medical liability protections of the \nFederal Torts Claim Act (FTCA) to volunteer physicians at community \nhealth centers. These protections are necessary to ensure that the \ncenters can continue to lay an important role in lowering our Nation's \nhealth care costs and meeting the needs for affordable and accessible \nquality healthcare.\n  Community health centers offer an affordable source of quality health \ncare, but we need more of them. The President has proposed a $304 \nmillion increase for community health center programs to create 1,200 \nnew or expanded sites to serve an additional 6.1 million people by next \nyear. In order to meet that goal, the centers must double their \nworkforce by adding double the clinicians by 2006. Hiring this many \ndoctors would be costly, but encouraging more to volunteer would help \nto meet this need. While many physicians are willing to volunteer their \nservices at these centers, they often hesitate due to the high cost of \nmedical liability insurance. As a result, there are too few volunteer \nphysicians to meet our health care needs. Expanding FTCA protection to \nthese physicians cannot come at a more opportune time.\n  The spirit of giving is part of what makes America great. But more \ncan be done to assist the needy. The Expanding Charitable and Volunteer \nOpportunities Act provides added incentives to those who wish to donate \nequipment or time. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1126. A bill to provide that no federal funds may be expended for \nthe payment or reimbursement of a drug that is prescribed to a sex \noffender for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NO FEDERAL FUNDS FOR DRUGS PRESCRIBED TO SEX \n                   OFFENDERS FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEXUAL OR \n                   ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.\n\n       (a) Restriction.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no Federal funds may be expended for the payment or \n     reimbursement, including payment or reimbursement under the \n     programs described in paragraph (2), of a drug that is \n     prescribed to an individual described in paragraph (3) for \n     the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction.\n       (2) Programs described.--The programs described in this \n     paragraph are the medicaid program, the medicare program, the \n     Federal employees health benefits program, the Defense Health \n     Program, the program of medical care furnished by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, health related programs \n     administered by the Indian Health Service, health related \n     programs funded under the Public Health Service Act, and any \n     other Federal health program.\n       (3) Individual described.--An individual described in this \n     paragraph is an individual who has a conviction for sexual \n     abuse, sexual assault, or any other sexual offense.\n       (b) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall apply to drugs \n     dispensed on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Thune, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sununu, \n        Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Gregg, Mr. Lott, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Bingaman, and \n        Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1127. A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to submit to \nCongress all documentation related to the Secretary's recommendations \nfor the 2005 round of defense base closure and realignment; read the \nfirst time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill designed \nto ensure the Department of Defense releases both to the Congress and \nto the Base Realignment and Closure Commission all of the information \nused in generating its recommendations in the current BRAC round.\n  First, I want to thank the bill's sponsors for their support in this \neffort--Senators Thune, Collins, Sununu, Murkowski, Domenici, \nLieberman, Dodd, Gregg, Lott, Johnson, Corzine, and Bingaman. I \nappreciate their recognition of the critical importance of ensuring we \nare given the information it is only right we have with regard to this \nbase closure process.\n  Under the current Base Closing and Realignment statute, the Secretary \nof Defense shall make:\n\n     all information used by the Secretary to prepare the \n     recommendations under this subsection available to Congress, \n     including any committee or member of Congress.\n\n  The Secretary owes this same obligation to the BRAC Commission and to \nthe Comptroller General of the United States.\n  Moreover, the Secretary of Defense is required to produce the data \njustifying their base closing decisions within 7 days--7 days. The 2005 \nBRAC list was released on Friday, May 13. Here we are, nearly two weeks \nlater, and the Department of Defense continues to flout a key \nrequirement of the very BRAC statute that gives it base closure \nauthority in the first place. This amounts to a blatant refusal by the \nPentagon to back up its highly questionable decisions to close a number \nof military facilities that are absolutely irreplaceable and \nindispensable to our national security.\n  Closing bases--or effectively shuttering them through massive \nrealignment--of the magnitude that we are dealing with could only have \nbeen made by ignoring or misapplying BRAC criteria. The Defense \nDepartment's subsequent refusal to release the very data on which such \ndecisions were made effectively shrouds the entire process in secrecy, \ndepriving the bases and communities impacted, as well as the BRAC \nCommission, from gaining access to the very data needed to review the \nPentagon's decisions.\n  What type of data am I talking about? To us a few examples from my \nown office's experience, the Department of the Navy has yet to release \na detailed breakdown of cost of closure assessments, including factors \napplied by the COBRA model if they did not do actual cost estimates. We \nhave yet to see all of the options considered by the Chief of Naval \nOperations or the Vice Chief of Naval Operations to reduce excess \ncapacity in shipyards, including\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nclosure, realignment, workload shifts and private sector capacity. We \nhave still not received a detailed breakdown of cost of operations \nassessment, including shipyard and base costs.\n  These are just a few specific examples of what has not been provided. \nOther general categories would include data on the economic impact on \nexisting communities, the degree to which the Defense Department looked \ninto the ability of Maine's bases to accommodate future mission \ncapabilities, and the impact of costs related to potential \nenvironmental restoration, waste management, environmental compliance \nrestoration, readiness, future mission requirements. There are a number \nof such issues that are included in the base closing statute that \nrequires the Defense Department to consider in making its evaluation \nand making, as well, its original determination, in terms of which \nbases they would recommend for closure or realignment.\n\n  The Defense Department's stall tactics are most acutely felt by those \ncurrently preparing to make presentations before realignment or closure \nof their specific bases. Here we are, on May 25, almost 2 weeks after \nthe release of the base-closing list, and yet this critical data is \nstill being sequestered behind Pentagon walls, and the communities \naffected by these closures are now forced to fly blind as they make \ntheir cases before the base-closing commission.\n  How hamstrung are these advocates, including many of my colleagues in \nthe Senate and in the House of Representatives? Allow me to elaborate.\n  The first base-closing hearings are expected to take place in Salt \nLake City on June 7, less than 2 weeks from now. How are the advocates \nfor Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho or Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service stations in Kansas City and St. Louis supposed to \nprepare for a case, for a hearing in less than 2 weeks with this \ncritical data being withheld?\n  The scheduled base-closing hearings to follow are no less forgiving. \nIn fact, between June 15 and June 30, base-closing commission hearings \nwill be held in the following cities: Fairbanks, AK; Portland, OR; \nRapid City, SD; Dallas, TX; Grand Forks, ND; Clovis, NM; Buffalo, NY; \nCharlotte, NC; and Atlanta, GA.\n  In my case, in the State of Maine, in Portsmouth, NH, for Portsmouth \nNaval Shipyard, for Brunswick Air Force station, for the Defense \nAccounting Service in Limestone, ME, those will be scheduled on July 6 \nin Boston.\n  We are all working feverishly, as many of my colleagues are, along \nwith State governments and all officials, to get our presentations for \nthese most vital and critical hearings in order. Yet given the current \nblackout of backup data, that task is akin to defending one's self in a \ncriminal case without the prosecutor putting forth the supposedly \nincriminating evidence.\n  This Department of Defense has taken foot dragging and obfuscation to \nnew state-of-the-art levels. The bill I am introducing today will make \nclear that this delinquency will result in serious consequences.\n  So the legislation I am introducing is very straightforward and to \nthe point. First, it states that the Department of Defense has 7 days \nfrom the date of the enactment of this law in which to release all of \nits supporting data for its realignment and closure decisions. Second, \nif this 7-day deadline is not met, the entire base-closing process of \n2005 is canceled. Third, even if this deadline is met, all the base-\nclosing statutory deadlines are pushed back by the number of days that \nthe Defense Department delayed in producing this data.\n  This legislation is the full embodiment of fairness and due process. \nIt ensures that those bases in communities attempting to prevent \nclosures or realignment have access to the same facts the Pentagon did, \nand that failure to provide that information will carry appropriate \nconsequences. And it is our last chance to reverse the egregious \ndecisions made in the closing and realignment process.\n  The integrity of the base-closing process and of the decisions that \nare made on individual facilities depends on the accuracy of the data \nused and on the validity of the calculations and comparisons made using \nthis data. Congress and the base-closing commission simply cannot \ndischarge their responsibilities under the base-closing statute without \nthis most vital information.\n  It would be bad enough if it were only the Congress and the \nCommission that were being hindered in carrying out our collective \nduties with regard to the base-closing process. But it is the \ncommunities where these bases are located that are suffering the \ngreatest harm through their inability to find out what the basis of the \nDepartment's decision to close these installations was.\n  These towns and cities that have supported these bases for decades--\nor in some cases, like Kittery, ME, and Portsmouth, NH; Brunswick Air \nStation in Limestone, ME, for centuries--are being harmed through DOD's \ncontinued delay in making this data available. The community groups are \nhandicapped in their efforts to understand the Department's base-\nclosing analysis, assumptions, and conclusions therefore in their \nefforts to provide accurate rebuttal arguments or information to the \nCommission that the Department of Defense may not have considered.\n  So the communities not only have suffered the shock of potentially \nlosing what is in most cases the single most important economic engine \nin their communities, but to add insult to injury, have not been given \nthe full picture of why these installations they rely upon and that \nrelied upon them was among those chosen to close. That cannot be \nallowed to stand.\n  Indeed, I am certain DOD will realize it cannot continue to withhold \nthis information and will ultimately get to the bottom of this. We will \nthen be able to see the weaknesses in the Navy's arguments with respect \nto the facilities in Maine. We will see that the facts indisputably \nprove there is no way to reasonably conclude this Nation should forfeit \nthe long and distinguished history embodied in these facilities in a \ncritical report like Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard or Brunswick \nNaval Air Station that are unequal in their performance.\n  We will also make sure the base-closing commission has the \ninformation with respect to the role that the Defense Accounting \nServices has played in Limestone, ME, the very anchor for the \nconversion of the former Loring Air Force Base closed in one of the \nlast rounds of 1991 that certainly devastated that area and the State \nof Maine when we lost more than 10,000 that led to the outmigration of \nmore than 20,000 in our northern county. It really was devastating to \nalso learn that the Department of Defense decided to select Defense \nAccounting Services not only in Limestone but across this country. It \nwas the very anchor for conversion to help mitigate the loss of this \nmost crucial base up in northern Maine.\n  We will see that the facts undisputedly prove that the Navy ignored \naspects of the base-closing criteria that I happen to believe can only \nlead to a finding that Brunswick Naval Air Station, as the only \nremaining fully operational airfield in the Northeastern United States, \nplays a singular, critical role in this Nation's homeland security and \nhomeland defense posture and must continue to do so in the future. It \nreally was inconceivable to me that the Department of Defense would \nalso recommend closing Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the finest \nshipyard of its kind in the U.S. Navy.\n\n  In fact, the day before the base-closing list was announced on May \n13, the Secretary of the Navy issued a Meritorious Unit Commendation to \nKittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for, in its words, ``superbly and \nconsistently performing its missions,'' establishing benchmarks above \nand beyond both the public and private sector, having established, in \ntheir words, again, ``a phenomenal track record'' when it came to cost \nand quality and schedule and safety.\n  In fact, it had just been awarded the top safety award--the only \nfacility in the Department of Defense and the only facility in the \nNavy, and only the second in the Department of Defense. That is a \nremarkable track record.\n  It also saves money for the taxpayers, and it saves time and money \nfor the Navy. In fact, when it comes to refuelings at Kittery-\nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard, it saves $75 million on average compared to \nthe other yards that do the same work. It saves $20 million when it \ncomes to overhauls\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\ncompared to the other yards that do the same work. It saves 6 months in \ntime in sending the ships back to sea sooner on refuelings compared to \nthe other yards that do the same work. And it saves 3 months in time on \noverhauls compared to other yards that do the same work.\n  So one would argue, and certainly would ask the question, as I did of \nthe Secretary of the Navy, what message does that send to the men and \nwomen of that shipyard when they are the overachievers, doing the best \nwork and told they are No. 1 of its kind in its category, and we are \nsaying, well, we are going to transfer that work elsewhere, to those \nwho have not performed the equivalent result when it comes to time and \nmoney.\n  They are No. 1. But we are sending a message to those who are the \nbest, we tell them the next day, well, you know what. You are doing \nsuch a great job that we have decided to close.\n  When it comes to Brunswick Naval Air Station, it is the only \nremaining active military airfield in the Northeast. The Northeast is \nhome to 18 percent of America's population. It was, obviously, the \nregion that received the most devastating attack on American soil on \nSeptember 11.\n  And now we hear from the Defense Department that we want to realign \nthis base--essentially, it is tantamount to closure--when it is a \nstate-of-the-art facility, well positioned strategically, with \nunincumbered airspace of 63,000 miles--space of which to expand many \ntimes over--well positioned on our coastline for conducting \nsurveillance in the North Atlantic sealane so important to extending \nthe maritime domain awareness of the Coast Guard when it comes to one \nof the greatest threats facing America; that is, the shipments of \nweapons of mass destruction. So it raises a number of questions as to \nwhy these facilities were designated by the Department of Defense for \nclosure.\n  What is even more disturbing is that in order to make the case before \nthe base-closing commission, in an extremely limited period of time \ncompared to the four previous base-closing rounds--which I am \nintimately familiar with, having been part of them in the past; we had \n6 months--in this base-closing round, we have 4 months. It is on an \nexpedited timeframe; therefore, it makes it even more difficult, more \nproblematic, to make your case, when every day is going to count, and \nthe Department of Defense is withholding all of the information upon \nwhich we have to make our case.\n  We are required by law to have that information because in order to \nmake your case, you have to prove that the Department of Defense \ndeviated substantially--deviated substantially--from the criteria in \nthe base-closing statute when it comes to military value, operational \nreadiness, the closing costs, the costs of operations of that \nparticular facility, the economic impacts, so on and so on.\n  Now, it certainly is a mystery to me as to how the Defense Department \ncould have made all these decisions--33 major base closings and another \n29 realignments and many more for adjustments--and yet they cannot \nensure that the information and the data they utilized is forthcoming. \nWell, then, it just raises the question, How did they make these \ndecisions in the first place? Why have they not readily turned over the \ninformation that we require in order to make our case?\n  For the Commission to overturn a decision recommendation by the \nDepartment of Defense, it requires us to make a case that they deviated \nsubstantially from the criteria set forth in the base-closing statute. \nSo it is obvious we need the information because not to have the \ninformation they used inhibits us and prohibits us from making the \ndocumentations that are required under the law.\n  I think it is a fundamental flouting of the law. We have insisted, \nday in and day out, we need this information. We deserve to have this \ninformation. The men and women who work at these military facilities \nwho serve our country deserve to have this information. It is important \nto our national security interests because we need to know the \ninformation upon which this Defense Department predicated its \nassumptions. And it is not enough just to get their conclusions, it is \nnot enough just to get their assumptions, we need all of the empirical \ndata that was used to make those assumptions and conclusions. How did \nthey arrive at those decisions?\n  For example, when you look at the force structure of submarines, the \nnew attack submarines, on which the Portsmouth Naval Yard works, those \ndecisions have to be predicated on 55 attack submarines, 55. That was \nincluded in the base-closing criteria, 2004. The force structure at \nthat time was 55 attack submarines--still is--but the Department of \nDefense is changing their force structure after they already made the \nrecommendations. How can they make a recommendation based on 55 attack \nsubmarines but then decide, well, maybe a year later we can reduce that \nnumber? We have already made the decision.\n  It raises a considerable number of questions about the flawed \ninformation and the flawed process. Yet we have not had an opportunity \nto evaluate it. We have lost a critical 2 weeks in this process and, \nagain, as I said, on a very expedited timeframe in which to make these \ndecisions, to evaluate the information, and to submit our case before \nthe base-closing commission in the scheduled hearings over this next \nmonth.\n  If the Department of Defense does not provide this information in a \ntimely manner, then this round of base closings is fundamentally flawed \nand is designed to close critical military infrastructure at a time \nwhen our Nation faces a changing, unpredictable threat environment, \nand, therefore, it should be brought to an end. If they cannot provide \nthis information in a timely fashion, that is exactly what should \noccur.\n  I believe it does really underscore the integrity and the lack of the \nintegrity in this process because it certainly stands to reason, and \ncertainly it is a fair assumption to make, that the Department of \nDefense should be able to turn over instantaneously all of the \ninformation they used to make these critical decisions. After all, \nthey have had a considerable period of time in which to make these \ndecisions. So, therefore, it should not be very difficult to provide \nthat information. But we continue to get the consistent stonewalling \nand obfuscation that is preventing us from evaluating these decisions \nin order to do what is required under the law to demonstrate how these \ndecisions are faulty and to evaluate the information. We deserve no \nless than that.\n\n  So I thank my colleagues for joining me in this effort to compel the \nDepartment of Defense to stand up and be accountable for this \ndecisionmaking process and to release the data that we deserve that led \nto these decisions with respect to base closings so we understand \nexactly how they arrived at their decisions that are so critical and \ncentral to our national security.\n  I regret we are in this position in the first place. I opposed this \nbase-closing process. It certainly should have been deferred. We should \nhave considered the overseas base closings before we looked at domestic \ninstallations. In fact, that certainly was an issue in the overseas \nbase-closing report that was issued recently. So we do not have an \noverall structure in which to consider the macroplans. That is what \nshould have been done. We should be looking at all these issues in a \ntotality because we are in a very different environment than we were \neven pre-September 11, 2001, and our threat environment has to be \nlooked through an entirely different prism.\n  In fact, as I mentioned on the floor just about a year ago, in \nattempting to defer this process until we had a chance to evaluate \noverseas bases, one of the issues I looked at was the track record of \nthe Department of Defense in terms of ascertaining the future threat \nenvironments. What could they anticipate were future threats? I have to \nsay that I was somewhat shocked by the findings because I evaluated the \nforce structure reports and military threat assessments that were \nrequired to be accompanied with the base-closing rounds in previous \nyears.\n  It was interesting. I decided to discern, exactly when did they \nanticipate a threat of terrorism, asymmetric threats, or threats to our \nhomeland security? And it was a startling and abysmal picture because \nthey had a significantly flawed track record. The first time that a \nthreat to our homeland security was even mentioned was\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nin the Quadrennial Defense Review of 1997. Mr. President, 1997--that \nwas 4 years before September 11. At that time, with the previous base-\nclosing rounds, these base-closing commissions were required to make a \n6-year outlook for the potential threats and anticipated threats--6 \nyears. Now, with this base-closing round, it requires 20 years. But \neven with 6 years out, they could not even discern a threat to our \nhomeland security. They mentioned it in the Quadrennial Defense Review \nof 1997, but it was a fourth-tier concern. And that was 4 years out \nfrom September 11--4 years out from September 11.\n  Nineteen days after September 11, we had another quadrennial defense \nreview issued by the Department of Defense. Al-Qaida wasn't even \nmentioned in that quadrennial defense review. It wasn't even mentioned \n19 days after September 11.\n  So I think that gives you a measure of the understanding that the \nDepartment of Defense has not had an accurate or reliable determination \nof potential threats this country could face--not even 4 years out, not \neven 19 days after September 11--to the degree that al-Qaida was a \nthreat to this country. That is the problem, Mr. President. We do not \nhave an accurate picture.\n  This base-closing round is required to ascertain the threat \nenvironment and projecting 20 years out. Mind you, over the last more \nthan 10 years, all throughout the nineties, when we had the World Trade \nCenter bombing, Khobar Towers, Kenya, and Tanzania, all throughout that \ndecade--and we had the USS Cole in 2000--there was only one time in \nthat decade there was a mention of homeland security in any fashion. I \nthink that is pretty telling.\n  So the fact that the Department of Defense cannot bring forward the \ninformation that validates or invalidates their assumptions and \nconclusions is particularly troubling in this threat environment. I \nregret we are in the situation today of having to beg, plead, and \npersuade to try to get some glimmer into the insights, into the \ndocumentation evaluation they made in reaching these final conclusions. \nMore than anything else, the statute requires those to be making the \ncase before the Base Closing Commission to determine how the Department \nof Defense deviated substantially from the criteria. How are we to \nknow, if they don't depend upon the very department who makes the \ndecision, has the information, and has yet to transmit them forthwith \nto all of the respective delegations and officials who are given the \nopportunity to make the case before the Base Closing Commission?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5936-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5936-S5937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 154--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 21, 2005 AS ``NATIONAL \n                           MAMMOGRAPHY DAY''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bunning, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Isakson, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2005, \n     212,930 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,410 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases, the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas African-American women suffer a 30 percent greater \n     mortality rate from breast cancer than White women and more \n     than a 100 percent greater mortality rate from breast cancer \n     than women from Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian \n     populations;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of more than 97 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 21, 2005, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate programs and activities.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 21, 2005, as ``National Mammography Day.'' I might \nnote that I have submitted a similar resolution each year since 1993, \nand on each occasion the Senate has shown its support for the fight \nagainst breast cancer by approving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For the year 2005, it is estimated that slightly more than \n211,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and slightly more \nthan 40,000 women will die of this disease.\n  In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics \nwere. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have \ncome to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be \noptimistic. The number of deaths from breast cancer is actually stable \nor falling from year to year. Early detection of breast cancer \ncontinues to result in extremely favorable outcomes: 97 percent of \nwomen with localized breast cancer will survive 5 years or longer. New \ndigital techniques make the process of mammography much more rapid and \nprecise than before. Government programs will provide free mammograms \nto those who can't afford them, as well as Medicaid eligibility for \ntreatment if breast cancer is diagnosed. Just a few weeks ago, the \nheadline on the front page of the Washington Post trumpeted a major \nimprovement in survival of patients with early breast cancer following \nuse of modern treatment regimens involving chemotherapy and hormone \ntherapy. Information about treatment of breast cancer with surgery, \nchemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, reflecting enormous \nresearch advances in this disease. So I am feeling quite positive about \nour battle against breast cancer. A diagnosis of breast cancer is not a \ndeath sentence, and I encounter long-term survivors of breast cancer \nnearly daily.\n  In recent times, the newspapers have been filled with discussion over \nwhether the scientific evidence actually supports the conclusion that \nperiodic screening mammography saves lives. It seems that much of this \ncontroversy relates to new interpretations of old studies, and the \nrelatively few recent studies of this matter have not clarified this \nissue. Most sources seem to agree that all of the existing scientific \nstudies have some weaknesses, but it is far from clear whether the very \nlarge and truly unambiguous study needed to settle this matter \ndefinitively can ever be done.\n  So what is a woman to do? I do not claim any expertise in this highly \ntechnical area, so I rely on the experts. The American Cancer Society, \nthe National Cancer Institute, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task \nForce all continue to recommend periodic screening mammography, and I \nendorse the statements of these distinguished bodies.\n  On the other hand, I recognize that some women who examine these \nresearch studies are unconvinced of the need for periodic screening \nmammography. However, even those scientists who do not support periodic \nmammography for all women believe that it is appropriate for some \ngroups of women with particular risk factors. In agreement with these \nexperts, I encourage all women who have doubts about the usefulness of \nscreening mammography in general to discuss with their individual \nphysicians whether this test is appropriate in their specific \nsituations.\n  So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram, or at the very \nleast discuss this option with your own physician.\n  I know that some women don't have annual mammograms because of either \nfear or forgetfulness. It is only human\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\nnature for some women to avoid mammograms because they are afraid of \nwhat they will find. To those who are fearful, I would say that if you \nhave periodic routine mammograms, and the latest one comes out \npositive, even before you have any symptoms or have found a lump on \nself-examination, you have reason to be optimistic, not pessimistic. \nSuch early-detected breast cancers are highly treatable.\n  Then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult it \nis to remember to do something that only comes around once each year. I \nwould suggest that this is where ``National Mammography Day'' comes in. \nOn that day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific \ndate on which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't \nforget: a child's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her \ntaxes are due. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: \npick one of these dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of \nyour child, your wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise \nyourself to get a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself \nand for the others that love you and want you to be part of their lives \nfor as long as possible.\n  And to those women who are reluctant to have a mammogram, I say let \nNational Mammography Day serve as a reminder to discuss this question \neach year with your physician. New scientific studies that are \npublished and new mammography techniques that are developed may affect \nyour decision on this matter from one year to the next. I encourage you \nto keep an open mind and not to feel that a decision at one point in \ntime commits you irrevocably to a particular course of action for the \nindefinite future.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast \ncancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to designate \nOctober 21, 2005, as ``National Mammography Day.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5937-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5937-S5938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 155--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 6 THROUGH \nNOVEMBER 12, 2005, AS ``NATIONAL VETERANS AWARENESS WEEK'' TO EMPHASIZE \nTHE NEED TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REGARDING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF \n                        VETERANS TO THE COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bond, \nMr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Ms. Collins, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Thomas) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 155\n\n       Whereas tens of millions of Americans have served in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States during the past century;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Americans have given their \n     lives while serving in the Armed Forces during the past \n     century;\n       Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of the men and \n     women who served in the Armed Forces have been vital in \n     maintaining the freedoms and way of life enjoyed by the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas the advent of the all-volunteer Armed Forces has \n     resulted in a sharp decline in the number of individuals and \n     families who have had any personal connection with the Armed \n     Forces;\n       Whereas this reduction in familiarity with the Armed Forces \n     has resulted in a marked decrease in the awareness by young \n     people of the nature and importance of the accomplishments of \n     those who have served in the Armed Forces, despite the \n     current educational efforts of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs and the veterans service organizations;\n       Whereas the system of civilian control of the Armed Forces \n     makes it essential that the future leaders of the Nation \n     understand the history of military action and the \n     contributions and sacrifices of those who conduct such \n     actions; and\n       Whereas, on November 9, 2004, President George W. Bush \n     issued a proclamation urging all the people of the United \n     States to observe November 7 through November 13, 2004, as \n     ``National Veterans Awareness Week'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of November 6 through November 12, \n     2005, as ``National Veterans Awareness Week''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate educational activities.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the week that includes \nVeterans' Day, corresponding this year to November 6-12, 2005, be \ndesignated as ``National Veterans Awareness Week''. This marks the \nsixth year in a row that I have submitted such a resolution, which has \nbeen adopted unanimously by the Senate on all previous occasions.\n  The purpose of National Veterans Awareness Week is to serve as a \nfocus for educational programs designed to make students in elementary \nand secondary schools aware of the contributions of veterans and their \nimportance in preserving American peace and prosperity. This goal takes \non particular importance and immediacy this year as we find ourselves \nagain with uniformed men and women in harm's way in foreign lands.\n  Why do we need such an educational effort? In a sense, this action \nhas become necessary because we are victims of our own success with \nregard to the superior performance of our armed forces. The plain fact \nis that there are just fewer people around now who have had any \nconnection with military service. For example, as a result of \ntremendous advances in military technology and the resultant \nproductivity increases, our current armed forces now operate \neffectively with a personnel roster that is one-third less in size than \njust 15 years ago. In addition, the success of the all-volunteer \ncareer-oriented force has led to much lower turnover of personnel in \ntoday's military than in previous eras when conscription was in place. \nFinally, the number of veterans who served during previous conflicts, \nsuch as World War II, when our military was many times larger than \ntoday, is inevitably declining.\n  The net result of these changes is that the percentage of the entire \npopulation that has served in the Armed Forces is dropping rapidly, a \nchange that can be seen in all segments of society. Whereas during \nWorld War II it was extremely uncommon to find a family in America that \ndid not have one of its members on active duty, now there are numerous \nfamilies that include no military veterans at all. Even though the \nIraqi war has been prominently discussed on television and in the \nnewspapers, many of our children are much more preoccupied with the \nusual concerns of young people than with keeping up with the events of \nthe day. As a consequence, many of our youth still have little or no \nconnection with or knowledge about the important historical and ongoing \nrole of men and women who have served in the military. This omission \nseems to have persisted despite ongoing educational efforts by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the veterans service organizations.\n  This lack of understanding about military veterans' important role in \nour society can have potentially serious repercussions. In our country, \ncivilian control of the armed forces is the key tenet of military \ngovernance. A citizenry that is oblivious to the capabilities and \nlimitations of the armed forces, and to its critical role throughout \nour history, can make decisions regarding our military involvement that \nmay have unexpected and unwanted consequences. Even more important, \ngeneral recognition of the importance of those individual character \ntraits that are essential for military success, such as patriotism, \nselflessness, sacrifice, and heroism, is vital to maintaining these key \naspects of citizenship in the armed forces and even throughout the \npopulation at large.\n\n  The failure of our children to understand why a military is \nimportant, why our society continues to depend on it for ultimate \nsurvival, and why a successful military requires integrity and \nsacrifice, will have predictable consequences as these youngsters \nbecome of voting age. Even though military service is a responsibility \nthat is no longer shared by a large segment of the population, as it \nhas been in the past, knowledge of the contributions of those who have \nserved in the Armed Forces is as important as it has ever been. To the \nextent that many of us will not have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry in uniform, we must still remain cognizant of our \nresponsibility as citizens to fulfill the obligations we owe, both \ntangible and intangible, to those who do serve and who do sacrifice on \nour behalf.\n  The importance of this issue was brought home to me several years ago \nby Samuel I. Cashdollar, who was then\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\na 13-year-old seventh grader at Lewes Middle School in Lewes, DE. \nSamuel won the Delaware VFW's Youth Essay Contest that year with a \npowerful presentation titled ``How Should We Honor America's \nVeterans''? Samuel's essay pointed out that we have Nurses' Week, \nSecretaries' Week, and Teachers' Week, to rightly emphasize the \nimportance of these occupations, but the contributions of those in \nuniform tend to be overlooked. We don't want our children growing up to \nthink that Veterans Day has simply become a synonym for a department \nstore sale, and we don't want to become a nation where more high school \nseniors recognize the name Britney Spears than the name Dwight \nEisenhower.\n  National Veterans Awareness Week complements Veterans Day by focusing \non education as well as commemoration, on the contributions of the many \nin addition to the heroism and service of the individual. National \nVeterans Awareness Week also presents an opportunity to remind \nourselves of the contributions and sacrifices of those who have served \nin peacetime as well as in conflict; both groups work unending hours \nand spend long periods away from their families under conditions of \ngreat discomfort so that we all can live in a land of freedom and \nplenty.\n  Last year, my Resolution designating National Veterans Awareness Week \nwas approved in the Senate by unanimous consent. Responding to that \nResolution, President Bush issued a proclamation urging our citizenry \nto observe National Veterans Awareness Week. I ask my colleagues to \ncontinue this trend of support for our veterans by endorsing this \nresolution again this year. Our children and our children's children \nwill need to be well informed about what veterans have accomplished in \norder to make appropriate decisions as they confront the numerous \nworldwide challenges that they are sure to face in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/25/senate-section/article/S5938-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 156--DESIGNATING JUNE 7, 2005, AS ``NATIONAL HUNGER \n  AWARENESS DAY'' AND AUTHORIZING THAT THE SENATE OFFICES OF SENATORS \nGORDON SMITH, BLANCHE L.

Mr. President, as we approach this weekend, I thought \nI would give some thought to what occasions this commemorative holiday \nand what I think about as we approach Memorial Day. I want to recall \nsome of the incidents, the results of war and its consequences.\n  It has been a historic week in the Senate. We averted a showdown that \ncould have permanently damaged this institution and destroyed the \nunique American system of checks and balances that makes our Government \nthe greatest in the history of the world. This was the topic of nonstop \ntelevision coverage and a forest worth of newspaper articles.\n  In short, the story about the Senate's procedure for approving \njudicial nominees totally dominated the news, but there was another \nstory this week, a story that did not receive much attention. It was \nthe story of at least 14 brave American soldiers who died in Iraq since \nSunday. These deaths came as a wave of bombings and suicide attacks \nengulfed Baghdad and other cities.\n  While we go about our business in the Senate, while other Americans \ngo\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\nabout their daily lives, the war in Iraq drags on. It has been a month \nsince the Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari announced his new \ngovernment, and during that time at least 620 people have been killed \nin Iraq, including 58 U.S. troops. During that time, it has been a \npainful recognition for families across America and across my State. \nSadly, the American people have become so numb to these deaths that \nthey are no longer considered major news, and the administration has \nnot helped matters by continuing its questionable policy of banning \nphotographs or video images of the flag-draped coffins of our heroes \nmaking their final trip home.\n  I have to ask a question: Is the purpose of this policy to hide the \nsacrifices of our soldiers and their families? I am hard-pressed to \nthink of any other reason. This is an issue I have discussed on the \nfloor of the Senate before. It stuns me that at the moment of the \nreturn of the remains of a family member, that casket covered in honor \nby the flag of our country is hidden from the public. No photos are \nallowed, no photographs allowed, and no attention paid.\n  As a veteran of an earlier war, I am very conscious of our \nresponsibility to veterans and to those who are fighting the battle for \nall of us, and I wonder why the administration continues its policy of \nbanning photographs or video images of the flag-draped coffins of our \nheroes making their final trip home. It seems as if they want to \nconceal the sacrifices of our soldiers and their families. I am hard \npressed to think of any other reason.\n  As have most of my colleagues, where there has been a loss of life in \nthe State that they represent, we have gone to a funeral or a ceremony \nacknowledging the sacrifice that these individuals have made and the \npain their families undergo. I was at a funeral ceremony at Arlington \nwhen one of our New Jersey soldiers was buried. His family was present, \nmother and father. He was a young man, in his early twenties. I watched \nthe ceremony as the Honor Guard escorted his coffin to the place of \nburial. It was covered with a flag. The Honor Guard was so precise and \nso immaculate in their appearance, so honorable. They took the American \nflag and folded it so gently but ever so precisely until through eight \nescorts and the captain of the Honor Guard, they made the folds so \ncarefully until they got it into a triangle, and the captain of the \nGuard walked over to the man's mother and presented it to her. It was \nsuch a touching ceremony, this recognition of honor, this understanding \nof what this soldier who perished had done for his country.\n  I cannot understand why it is that we are not allowed to photograph \nthese coffins when they come home with the remains, when they come to \nthe Dover Air Force Base in Delaware before they go to the mortuary \nwhere the families have an opportunity to make certain that it is their \nfamily member who is being buried. But there is no identification of \nname, there is no ceremony. No family needs to feel as though its \nprivacy is being invaded.\n  So I question that. I think it would be appropriate on this Memorial \nDay to start off after the Memorial Day recess and say, yes, anyone who \nis returned in a flag-draped coffin is entitled to receive the honor \nand the respect of the country that sent them there, our country. It is \nappropriate.\n  The pain goes on almost every day--reports of car bombings, roadside \nbombs, suicide attacks. They kill soldiers, they kill civilians, they \nkill children, sometimes in the double digits in a single incident, 20, \n30 people. What they are trying to do is crush the spirit of the Iraqis \nwho have been through so much at this point. Our people continue on \nbravely serving their country, serving the orders that they get from \ntheir Nation.\n  Within the last week, military leaders, however, had a change of tune \nwhen the leading general in charge of our operations in Iraq described \nas a sober assessment the situation in Iraq. That is the first that we \nhave heard about that. We have heard continuously that we have enough \ntroops to do the job, that the Iraqis are learning what they have to do \nto take over. It is not true. I was in Iraq approximately a year ago \nand saw how slowly the job of preparing policemen to take over was \ngoing. It was painfully slow. Often the recruits were found to be \nhopelessly untrained for the assignment, without the ability to drive a \ncar, no driver's license, not literate. They were training something \nlike 80 every 6 weeks.\n  So it is going to take a long time at the rate of 80 in 6 weeks to \nget 50,000 policemen trained.\n  According to the assessment that we heard from the commanding \ngeneral, the bottom line was that American troops will probably be \nthere for years to come. For the 140,000 who serve there today, there \nis no quick end in sight.\n  I do not take the floor to debate the wisdom of the war in Iraq or \nthe way it has been prosecuted. Today I speak to honor the more than \n1,600 American soldiers who have given their lives in Iraq and more \nthan 170 who have died in Afghanistan.\n  In front of my office in the Hart Building there are pictures of \nthose fallen heroes identifying them by name as a reminder of what is \ngoing on even as we discuss issues of some critical relevance and some \nnot so important. The most important thing is that we have people who \nare in their young years paying with their lives for the battle in \nwhich we are engaged in the Middle East.\n  Monday is Memorial Day. It is a day when our Nation honors the fallen \nheroes of all of our wars. I hope every American will pause for a \nminute during the day and reflect on the price that is being paid for \nour freedom and on those who have paid that price. The wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan so far have claimed 56 sons of New Jersey, sons who died \npursuing the battle in Afghanistan. Thirty were killed since last \nMemorial Day. Eleven have died this year. The wars have produced \nfunerals and wakes and I have met the grieving families.\n\n  One of the most recent funerals I attended was for PFC Min Soo Choi. \nHere is a picture of the young man. His family came to America from \nKorea 5 years ago, in search of a better life. I have met his parents. \nI saw them this week again.\n  His story struck a chord with me because many years ago my parents \nwere also immigrants, and I also enlisted in the Army as a young man. I \nenlisted when I was 18 years old. Min Soo was killed by a roadside bomb \nin Iraq on February 26. He wasn't even a U.S. citizen, but he loved \nthis country and what it stands for.\n  At Min Soo's funeral I heard about what a unique individual he was. I \nfelt the void that his death had left in the lives of his family and \nfriends, and that is true of every 1 of the 1,600 who have died in this \nwar. Each death leaves an ache that will never heal in the heart of a \nparent or spouse, brother or sister, or a small child. So on this \nMemorial Day I will pause not only to remember our fallen soldiers but \nalso the loved ones they have left behind.\n  Mr. President, I know the hour is late, but I hope you will indulge \nme by allowing me to read into the Congressional Record, where they \nwill be enshrined for all times, the names of the 56 soldiers with New \nJersey connections who have given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan:\n\n       SGT Steven Checo, Elizabeth; Corporal Michael Edward \n     Curtin, Howell; Specialist Benjamin W.
