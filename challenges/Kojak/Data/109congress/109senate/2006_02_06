Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 131, \nS. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that the motion be set aside until 3 \np.m. today. Before the Chair rules, we expect Chairman Specter to begin \nthe debate at 3, and we welcome additional speakers to come down this \nafternoon on the topic of asbestos reform.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will have more to say on the significance \nof this bill in a few minutes. We will be filing the necessary cloture \nmotion prior to adjourning today. Under the order from last week, that \nvote will occur at 6 p.m. tomorrow night. I will be leading a \nbipartisan Senate delegation attending the funeral of Coretta Scott \nKing tomorrow, and we delayed that vote to accommodate the travel of \nthose Senators. So that vote will be at 6 o'clock tomorrow night.\n  For the remainder of the week, we expect to be on the asbestos bill \nand to make progress on consideration of that important piece of \nlegislation by considering relevant amendments. Senators can expect \nvotes each day as we debate and vote on those amendments.\n  We also may have to revisit the Tax Increase Prevention Act, the Tax \nRelief Act, this week once again when we receive the House message on \nthe bill. We passed that bill last week by a vote of 66 to 31. We \ndiscussed a whole range of amendments and voted on the amendments at \nthe end of last week. It is time to get that bill to conference. I hope \nthat we can work together to come to an agreement and arrangement to \nget that bill to conference without much of a delay. I will be talking \nto the Democratic leader as we determine how to expedite that process.\n  I encourage Members to come to the floor this afternoon to discuss \nthe asbestos litigation that we will begin formally on Tuesday, if \nallowed by the motion to proceed. For this piece of legislation, it is \nnow or never. I said months ago we would be considering\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\nthe asbestos litigation or asbestos reform early on, and that time has \nnow come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S698-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHICKAMAUGA LOCK IN TENNESSEE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on another issue, I rise to briefly address \nan issue that is of critical importance to Tennessee, to the region \naround Tennessee, and to economic development.\n  Every year, millions of tons of cargo pass through Chickamauga Lock \nin my home State of Tennessee. This critical structure is the \ncommercial gateway to more than 300 miles of navigable waterways that \nserve 16 States in the region. Workers, small business owners, and \ncommunities all across that region depend on the lock to work smoothly \nevery day, around the clock.\n  But all of this is at risk. All of this is in danger. After 65 years, \nChickamauga Lock needs to be replaced. It is being destroyed by a \nchemical reaction known as ``concrete growth.'' The lock is crumbling \nand engineering experts tell us that it is only a matter of time before \nthe lock fails, and we cannot let that happen.\n  That is why I want to draw attention to the President's request \ntoday, which came out in the budget, to fund continued construction of \nthe new lock. It is the first White House budget proposal to contain \nconstruction funding since Congress authorized that new lock in 2003. I \nthank the President for his attention to this pressing issue.\n  I have held countless conversations with the administration on the \nimportance of constructing the new lock, and I appreciate the President \nand the administration taking this bold action.\n  America's transportation system is the lifeblood of our economy. \nWithout airports and railways and seaports and highways, our products \nwould never have the opportunity to be moved, goods would never be \nexchanged in the global marketplace, and commerce would simply come to \na halt.\n  One of the most overlooked elements of America's transportation \nnetwork is our inland waterway system. Commerce literally flows over \nand through a vast network of more than 12,000 miles of inland and \ncoastal waterways. Water transportation is often the most efficient, \ninexpensive, and environmentally friendly method of shipping cargo over \nlong distances.\n  In 2003, with my support, Congress authorized the construction of a \nnew lock that would meet the region's economic needs. I fought hard to \nprovide the necessary Federal funding to begin work on this project and \nworked closely with the administration to ensure adequate funding is \navailable to get the job done.\n  Today's budget request of $27 million represents a major investment, \nand we are all working together as a team to make it a success.\n  I am tremendously proud of all the hard work that has taken place to \nreserve this vital economic corridor. Moving forward with this \nconstruction is important to our transportation infrastructure, and my \ncolleagues and I have worked hard to make sure that new lock is built.\n  In fact, I particularly thank Congressman Zach Wamp for his \ntremendous leadership in this endeavor.\n  While there is a lot more to be done in replacing that Chickamauga \nLock, it is a major priority to me, and I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues at the local, State, and Federal levels to make this project \na success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S698-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it has been 36 days since 12 coal miners \nperished at the Sago Mine in Upshur County, WV. One died from the \nexplosion that ripped through the underground mine. The other 11 \nsuccumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning.\n  It has been 18 days since two coal miners perished in an underground \nfire at the Aracoma Alma in Logan County, WV. It has been 5 days since \ntwo miners perished in separate mine accidents in Boone County, WV.\n  Sixteen coal miners dead, in four separate accidents, in only 36 \ndays.\n  These deaths have shaken communities across the State of West \nVirginia and alarmed a nation. Three additional coal mine fatalities in \nthe States of Utah and Kentucky in the last 28 days confirm that this \nseries of accidents is national in scope and demands swift action.\n  Mr. President, after years of delay, the Coal Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration at last acknowledges the need to reassess some \ntechnology and regulations but cannot give any definite timetable about \nwhen the action will be taken. I, for one, do not want to see more \ndelay. This Federal Government, which is empowered by our Constitution \nto ``promote the general welfare''--and that applies to our Nation's \ncoalfields as well as anywhere else--must not wait.\n  The West Virginia congressional delegation has introduced legislation \noutlining a series of actions that can be taken immediately to make \nAmerica's coal mines safer. We know, for example, that technology \nexists right now to improve mine rescue communications. We know that \nadditional emergency breathing devices can be stored in the mines. We \ncan do these things today, right now. The Senate could pass the West \nVirginia delegation bill today to implement these requirements in the \nmines.\n  I have asked the Republican and Democratic leadership to schedule \nimmediate action on this matter. The Democratic leadership has pledged \nto do everything it can, and the Republican leadership has been very \npositive in its response. A bipartisan and growing coalition of \nSenators from mining and nonmining States has asked to be added as \ncosponsors to our legislation. They recognize its importance and the \nneed for its immediate passage.\n  I have spoken with the chairman and with the ranking member of the \nSenate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and they fully \nunderstand the urgency driving this legislation. They not only \norganized a committee trip to Sago Mine in January, but they also \ncommitted to reviewing the West Virginia delegation bill within hours \nof its introduction. These Senators are on our side.\n  I am confident they will do all they can do to ensure quick action. I \nam happy to work with all Members of the Senate to expedite passage of \nthis bill. With quick work, I see no reason why this Senate cannot move \nexpeditiously. We should and, in fact, we must. Every day we delay \nincreases the risk for coal miners in the field.\n  While four deadly accidents in the past 36 days occurred in West \nVirginia, any State in the Union with coal mines could be next. Today \nit is my State of West Virginia and the States of Kentucky and Utah \nthat mourn the tragic loss of life in our coal mines. Tomorrow it could \nbe Pennsylvania, Alabama, Indiana, Virginia, Ohio, or Illinois. Who \nknows.\n  I was at the memorial service for the miners who died in the Sago \nmine disaster. I saw their families. I saw their grief. I saw their \npain. I have no desire to see more. The longer we wait to approve this \nlegislation, the more likely it is that additional miners will die. If \nmore miners die, more mines could be closed and for longer periods of \ntime in order to ensure safety. Mine closures not only will put \nfamilies out of work but will also disrupt coal and energy production, \nwith the economic effects rippling across the national economy.\n  We must never forget that a coal miner has the legal right to walk \nout of an unsafe coal mine. A miner cannot be forced to work if he or \nshe feels their life is threatened. Today when coal provides such an \nimportant part of this Nation's energy supply and our Nation is \ndangerously dependent upon foreign oil, we must keep our coal mines \nopen and operating, but first we must make them safe.\n  For the sake of America's coal miners, for the sake of their families \nand their communities, and for the sake of\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nthe energy security of our Nation, I urge that this much-needed \nlegislation be approved as soon as possible. There is a moral \nimperative to act, and we must not delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Specter, Kerry, \nand Clinton be added as cosponsors of S. 2231, the Federal Mine Safety \nand Health Act of 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nWest Virginia for once again giving focus to this issue of national \nproportion and importance. I know he recognizes that those \nextraordinary mine tragedies at Sago struck the heart and soul of all \nAmericans. I had the opportunity to visit with the families from that \ncommunity. I want him to know that as a member of the HELP Committee, \nwhich has some jurisdiction over the measure he introduced, we are \ngoing to work closely with him to ensure, to the greatest extent \npossible, safety for miners.\n  We have seen an example of what has been done in Canada with the 36 \nor 37 miners who were locked in the bowels of a mine for several days \nand they walked out because they had oxygen available. We have seen \nother miners who have been saved in other parts of the world, such as \nAustralia, because they had communications which permitted them to be \nwarned about the dangers of mines.\n  He raises an issue that is of central importance, not just to the \npeople of West Virginia but to all who care about those families who \nmake such a difference not only to their communities but to our country \nand to our energy needs. I thank him and look forward to working with \nhim.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. He is always sensitive to the problems that \noccur in West Virginia. He is always mindful of the coal miners and \ntheir problems, their sorrows.\n  I thank him for being such a steadfast partner with the two West \nVirginia Senators and such a steadfast friend throughout the years to \nour fellow West Virginians. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the present time, the Judiciary \nCommittee is meeting with the Attorney General. I am necessarily absent \nfrom that meeting so I can make comments on the asbestos legislation \nwhich is now pending. I will return.\n  As I understand it, Senators Specter and Leahy and others involved \nwill have a chance to speak. I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 25 minutes, if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S699-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S699-S702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS INJURY RESOLUTION ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the real crisis which confronts us is not \nan asbestos litigation crisis, it is an asbestos-induced disease \ncrisis. Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the \nworkplace. Between 1940 and 1980, there were 27 million workers in this \ncountry who were exposed to asbestos on the job, and nearly 19 million \nof them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time. That \nexposure changed many of their lives. Each year, more than 10,000 of \nthem died from lung cancer and other diseases caused by asbestos. Each \nyear hundreds of thousands of them suffer from lung conditions which \nmake breathing so difficult that they cannot function at all. Even more \nhave become unemployable due to their medical condition, and because of \nthe long latency period of these diseases, all of them live with fear \nof premature death due to asbestos-induced disease. These are the real \nvictims. They deserve to be the first and foremost focus of our \nconcern.\n  As this chart indicates, asbestos mortality will likely peak around \n2015, reflecting the heavy exposures in the 1970s. We are going to see \nthis is not an issue that is going to diminish, in terms of the impact \non the workers, workers' lives, their families, and their communities, \nbut is actually going to increase in terms of those who are going to be \nadversely impacted and affected.\n  All too often the tragedy these workers and their families are \nenduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of \nasbestos litigation. We cannot allow that to happen. The litigation did \nnot create these costs; exposure to asbestos created them. They are the \ncosts of medical care, the lost wages of incapacitated workers, and the \ncost of providing for the families of workers who died years before \ntheir time. Those costs are real. No legislative proposal can make them \ndisappear. All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party \nto another. Any proposal which would shift more of the financial burden \non to the backs of injured workers is unacceptable to me and should be \nunacceptable to every one of us.\n  I have consistently said throughout the long debate on asbestos \nlegislation that I would support a properly designed and adequately \nfunded trust fund bill. That legislation would have to fairly \ncompensate all the victims of asbestos-induced disease in a timely way. \nIt would put more money into the pockets of these injured workers than \nthe current system of reducing transaction costs. This is not such a \nbill.\n  Senators Specter and Leahy have devoted an enormous amount of time \nand effort to this asbestos trust fund legislation. They deserve great \ncredit for their work. But the bill before us contains fundamental \nflaws which make it both unfair and unworkable. It does not provide a \nreliable guarantee of just compensation to the enormous number of \nworkers who are suffering from asbestos-induced disease.\n  The argument that there are serious inadequacies in the way asbestos \ncases are adjudicated today does not mean any legislation is better \nthan the current system. Our first obligation is to do no harm. We \nshould not be supporting legislation that excludes many seriously ill \nvictims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a \nguarantee of adequate funding to make sure injured workers will \nactually receive what the bill promises them. This bill will do harm.\n\n  The problem is that powerful corporate interests responsible for the \nasbestos epidemic have fought throughout this process to escape full \naccountability for the harm they have inflicted and, as a result, the \nfocus has shifted from what these companies should pay victims to what \nthey are willing to pay victims. That is preventing the Senate from \nenacting trust fund legislation that will truly help the workers who \nhave been seriously injured by this industrial plague.\n  The Senate should not be proceeding to this asbestos bill at this \ntime. Despite all the work Senators Specter and Leahy and other \nsupporters have done, S. 852 is simply not ready for floor \nconsideration. There are too many unanswered questions, and the numbers \ndo not add up.\n  This legislation does not provide sufficient funding to keep the \npromises of compensation it makes to those asbestos victims it purports \nto cover. Even if the entire $140 billion the sponsors anticipate \nraising is paid to the fund, it will not be sufficient to fully \ncompensate the projected number of eligible victims, and it is \nextremely unlikely the full amount will ever be paid.\n  The formula in the bill is based on highly questionable estimates of \nthe number of companies that would be required to contribute and how \nmuch each one would pay, contained in a secret list known only to the \nasbestos study group, the key lobbyists for the bill. None of the \nrelevant information has ever been made public. There is reason to \nbelieve far fewer companies would be contributing than the ASG \nprojects. There will also be serious court challenges brought against \nthe new law that are certain to at least significantly delay \nstatutorily mandated payments and could result in the loss of \nsubstantial anticipated revenue.\n  Because of these problems, seriously ill victims are likely to wait \nfor years in legal limbo, unable to proceed in court and unable to \nobtain compensation from the trust fund if this bill passes.\n  The legislation also fails to permit victims to quickly return to the \ncourt system should the trust fund become\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\ninsolvent. Victims are the losers at both ends.\n  These problems are far too complex to be fixed on the Senate floor \nwith a few last-minute amendments. If they could not be resolved in the \n3 years that the many Senators have worked on this bill, they cannot be \ncorrected in a few days. S. 852 is the legislative version of the \nfamous Spruce Goose--an ill-conceived plan too complex and cumbersome \nto ever get off the ground. As designed, it simply will not work. It is \nnot a reliable vehicle for compensating the victims of asbestos \ndisease. It should be sent back to the drawing board.\n  The list of serious flaws of S. 852 is, unfortunately, a long one. I \nwill focus my remarks on several of the most egregious.\n  First, the financial inadequacy. Experts tell us that the asbestos \ntrust fund created by this legislation is seriously underfunded. The \nfunding plan in this bill relies on very substantial borrowing in the \nearly years as the only way to pay the flood of claims. The result will \nbe a huge debt service cost over the life of the trust that could \nreduce the $140 billion intended to pay claims by as much as $30 \nbillion or $40 billion. The amount remaining would be far too little to \npay claims to cover all those who are entitled to compensation under \nthe terms.\n  In addition, there is a strong constitutional argument that the \nexisting bankruptcy trusts cannot be forced to turnover all their \nassets, which will place $7.6 billion of the projected funding in \njeopardy. Many companies are also likely to challenge their obligation \nto finance the asbestos trust. It is not at all clear how much will \nactually be available to pay eligible victims what the legislation \npromises they will receive.\n  CBO's analysis of S. 852 raises serious concerns about the adequacy \nof funding. The report states:\n\n       CBO expects that the value of valid claims likely to be \n     submitted to the fund over the next 50 years could be between \n     $120 and $150 billion, not including possible financing (debt \n     services) costs and administrative expenses. The maximum \n     actual revenues collected under the bill would be around $140 \n     billion, but could be significantly less. Consequently, the \n     fund may have sufficient resources to pay all asbestos claims \n     over the next 50 years, but depending on claim rates, \n     borrowing, and other factors, its resources may be \n     insufficient to pay all such claims.\n\n  There is likely to be a serious shortfall in the early years, when \nnearly 300,000 pending cases will be transferred to trust for payment. \nStudies show the trust will not have the resources to pay those claims \nin a timely manner. Payments to critically ill people may be delayed \nfor years.\n  One way to reduce the enormous financial burden on the fund in the \nearly years would be to leave many of those cases in the tort system, \nespecially cases which were close to resolution. That would be fair to \nthe parties in those cases and it would greatly improve the financial \nviability of the fund. Unfortunately, that proposal has been repeatedly \nrejected by the sponsors of the bill. As a result, there will be a \nserious mismatch between the number of claims the trust fund will face \nwhen its doors open and the payments begin coming into the fund. That \nwill force major borrowing in the first 5 years. The debt service \nresulting from that borrowing will financially cripple the trust.\n  In its report, CBO recognizes the seriousness of this debt-service \nproblem, explaining:\n\n       Because expenses would exceed revenues in many of the early \n     years of the fund's operations, the Administrator would need \n     to borrow funds to make up the shortfall. The interest cost \n     of this borrowing would add significantly to the long-term \n     costs faced by the fund and contributes to the possibility \n     that the fund might become insolvent.\n\n  This is only one of several major financing problems with S. 852 that \nexperts have identified. There are also major questions about the \nprojections of pending and future claims that further cloud the trust \nfund's financial viability.\n  For example, there has been a significant increase in the number of \nmesothelioma cases in recent years. The only known cause of \nmesothelioma is asbestos exposure. This new information suggests that \nthe CBO cost estimate may understate the cost of the mesothelioma \nclaims that the trust fund will incur by more than $15 billion. This is \nby no means the only instance where there is strong evidence to suggest \nthat the number of eligible claimants will substantially exceed CBO \nestimates.\n  If S. 852 is enacted, the United States Government will be making a \ncommitment to compensate hundreds of thousands of seriously ill \nasbestos victims but will not have ensured that adequate dollars are \navailable to honor its commitment. That will precipitate a genuine \nasbestos crisis, and this Congress will bear the responsibility for it.\n  The legislation before us would close the courthouse doors to \nasbestos victims on the day it passes, long before the trust fund will \nbe able to pay their claims. Their cases will be stayed immediately. \nSeriously ill workers will be forced into a legal limbo for up to 2 \nyears. Their need for compensation to cover medical expenses and basic \nfamily necessities will remain, but they will have nowhere to turn for \nrelief.\n  Under the legislation, even exigent health claims currently pending \nin the courts will be automatically be stayed for 9 months as of the \ndate of enactment. An exigent health claim is one in which the victim \nhas been diagnosed ``as being terminally ill from an asbestos-related \nillness and having a life expectancy of less than one year.''\n  By definition, these cases all involve people who have less than a \nyear to live due to mesothelioma or some other disease caused by \nasbestos exposure. Their cases would all be stayed for 9 months. Nine \nmonths is an eternity for someone with less than a year to live. Many \nof them will die without receiving either their day in court or \ncompensation from the trust fund.\n  The stay language is written so broadly that it would even stop all \nforward movement of a case in the court system. A trial about to begin \nwould be halted. An appellate ruling about to be issued would be \nbarred. Even the deposition of a dying witness could not be taken to \npreserve his testimony. The stay would deprive victims of their last \nchance at justice. I cannot believe that the authors of this bill \nintended such a harsh result, but that is what the legislation does.\n  The bill does contain language allowing an ``offer of judgment'' to \nbe made during the period of the stay in the hope of producing a \nsettlement. However, this provision is unlikely to resolve many cases \nbecause it requires the agreement of the defendants. There is no \nincentive for defendants to agree to a settlement when the case has \nbeen stayed. Those who have tried cases know that it is only the \nimminence of judicial action which produces a settlement in most cases. \nDelay is the defendant's best ally; and under this bill, the case is at \nleast delayed for 9 months and may never be allowed to resume if the \nfund becomes operational. If, however, these exigent cases were not \nstayed, and judicial proceedings could continue, there would be far \nmore likelihood of cases settling under the offer of judgment process.\n  I strongly believe that, at a minimum, all exigent cases should be \nexempted from the automatic stay in the legislation. Victims with less \nthan a year to live certainly should be allowed to continue their cases \nin court uninterrupted until the trust fund became operational. Their \nability to recover compensation in the court should not be halted until \nthe trust fund is operational and they are able to receive compensation \nfrom that Fund. It is grossly unfair to leave these dying victims in a \nlegal limbo. For them, the old adage is especially true--justice \ndelayed is justice denied.\n  Under the legislation, defendants would receive a credit against what \nthey must contribute to the trust fund for whatever payments they make \nto these dying victims; so they would not be ``paying twice,'' as some \nhave claimed.\n  Allowing the exigent cases to go forward in the courts without \ninterruption is a matter of simple fairness. Staying the cases of \nvictims who have less than a year to live is bureaucratic insensitivity \nat its worst. Most of these victims will not live to see the doors of \nthe trust fund open.\n  We should not deprive them of their last chance--their only chance--\nto receive some measure of justice before asbestos-induced disease \nsilences them. They should be allowed to receive compensation in their \nfinal months to ease their suffering. They should be allowed\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\nto die knowing that their families are financially provided for. S. 852 \nin its current form takes that last chance away from them.\n  The way the legislation is written, victims will lose out at the back \nend of the process as well, should the trust fund run out of money \nafter several years of operation.\n  If the trust fund does become insolvent, a very real possibility, \nworkers will not have an automatic right to immediately return to the \ncourt system. The process outlined in the current bill could take \nyears. Workers could end up trapped in the trust with reduced benefits \nand long delays in receiving their payments. There needs to be a clear, \nobjective trigger--inability of the trust to pay a certain percentage \nof claims within a set period of time--that will automatically allow \nvictims to pursue their claims in court if the trust runs out of money. \nThe Judiciary Committee's 2003 legislation contained such a provision, \nbut this bill does not. We cannot allow seriously injured workers with \nvalid claims who are not paid in a timely manner by the trust to be \ndenied their day in court. That would be a shameful injustice.\n  The asbestos trust is being presented as an alternative source of \ncompensation for victims suffering from asbestos-induced disease. If \nthat alternative runs out of money and can no longer compensate those \nvictims in a full and timely manner, their right to seek compensation \nthrough the judicial system should be immediately restored with no \nstrings attached. No principle is more basic. Yet, this bill violates \nthat principle.\n  I am particularly upset by the way lung cancer victims are treated in \nthis bill. Under the medical criteria adopted by the Judiciary \nCommittee overwhelmingly 2 years ago, all lung cancer victims who had \nat least 15 years of weighted exposure to asbestos were eligible to \nreceive compensation from the fund. However, that was changed in S. \n852. Under this bill, lung cancer victims who have had very substantial \nexposure to asbestos over long periods of time are denied any \ncompensation unless they can show asbestos scarring on their lungs. The \ncommittee heard expert medical testimony that prolonged asbestos \nexposure dramatically increases the probability that a person will get \nlung cancer even if they do not have scarring on their lungs. Deleting \nthis category will deny compensation to more than forty thousand \nvictims suffering with asbestos-related lung cancers. Under the \nlegislation as now drafted, these victims are losing their right to go \nto court, but are receiving nothing from the fund. How can any of us \nsupport such an unconscionable provision?\n  Since we began considering asbestos legislation, no aspect has \nconcerned me more than the treatment of lung cancer victims. My top \npriority has been to make sure that these severely ill workers receive \njust and fair compensation, and I have not been alone. A number of \nother members have spoken out about the importance of adequately \nproviding for lung cancer victims who have been exposed to substantial \namounts of asbestos over long periods of time.\n  Now we find that these victims, many of whom will have their lives \ncut short because of asbestos-induced disease, will not receive one \npenny in compensation from the trust fund. They are losing their right \nto go to court, but are also being denied any right to compensation \nunder the fund. They are, in essence, being told to suffer in a legally \nimposed silence with no recourse whatsoever.\n  One of the arguments we hear most frequently in favor of creating an \nasbestos trust fund is that in the current system, too much money goes \nto people who are not really sick and too little goes to those who are \nseriously ill. Well, lung cancer victims who have years of exposure to \nasbestos are the ones who are seriously ill. They are the ones this \nlegislation is supposed to be helping. Yet, they are being completely \nexcluded.\n  The committee heard extensive testimony from distinguished medical \nexperts--Dr. Laura Welsh and Dr. Philip Landrigan--that prolonged \nexposure to asbestos can cause lung cancer even if the victim does not \nalso have markers of nonmalignant asbestos disease. They cited numerous \nmedical authorities supporting their position. They even described \ntreating lung cancer victims whose disease was clearly caused by \nasbestos but who had neither pleural thickening or asbestosis.\n  In a situation where people are undeniably severely ill and \nundeniably had 15 or more years of weighted exposure to asbestos, it is \nwrong to completely exclude them from compensation under the trust \nfund. Some of the proponents of S. 852 have attempted to justify \nexcluding them by claiming that smoking probably caused their lung \ncancers. But, the evidence refutes this contention.\n  First, even those lung cancer victims with 15 or more weighted years \nof exposure to asbestos who had never smoked were removed from \neligibility for compensation under the trust fund. So, this is about \nmore than just the relationship between asbestos and smoking.\n  Second, regarding the smoking issue, Dr. Landrigan testified that \nsmokers who have substantial exposure to asbestos have 55 times the \nbackground risk of developing lung cancer, while smokers who were not \nexposed to asbestos have 10 times the background risk of developing \nlung cancer. Clearly, the asbestos exposure makes a huge difference.\n  There is a powerful synergistic effect between asbestos and tobacco \nin the causation of lung cancer. Both are substantial contributing \nfactors to the disease. The smoker with substantial asbestos exposure \nshould receive less compensation from the trust fund than the nonsmoker \nwith lung cancer. That principle appears throughout the bill. But \nsmoking is not a reason to exclude the smoker from all compensation.\n  Asbestos and tobacco are analogous to joint tortfeasors. Each is \npartly responsible and each should pay a proportionate share of the \ncompensation. Without prolonged exposure to asbestos, the smoker would \nhave been far less likely to contract lung cancer. It is a gross \ninjustice to completely exclude these severely ill workers.\n  This bill also tampers with the agreed-upon medical criteria \ncarefully negotiated between representatives of business and labor by \nraising the standard of proof for each disease category. The language \nin S. 852 requires the workers to prove that asbestos was ``a \nsubstantial contributing factor'' to their disease, instead of just ``a \ncontributing factor.''\n  This is a major increase in the burden workers must overcome to \nreceive compensation. It is significantly higher than most states \ncurrently require in a court of law. Rather than having to show that \nasbestos exposure contributed to their illness, they will now have to \naddress the relative impact of asbestos and other potential factors. \nThis change is a serious step in the wrong direction, raising the bar \neven higher on injured workers.\n  Another major shortcoming of this legislation is its failure to \ncompensate the residents of areas that have experienced large-scale \nasbestos contamination. S. 852 simply pretends that this problem does \nnot exist. It fails to compensate the victims of all asbestos-induced \ndiseases, other than mesothelioma, whose exposure was not directly tied \nto their work. There is very substantial scientific evidence showing \nthat the men, women and children who lived in the vicinity of asbestos-\ncontaminated sites, such as mining operations and processing plants, \ncan and do contract asbestos-induced disease.\n  The reason that this legislation needs a special provision to \ncompensate the residents of Libby, MT, is because it does not \ncompensate victims of community contamination generally. The residents \nof Libby are certainly entitled to compensation, but so are the \nresidents who lived near the many processing plants from Massachusetts \nto California that received the lethal ore from the Libby mine. The \ndeadly dust from Libby, MT was spread across America. W.R. Grace \nshipped almost 10 billion pounds of Libby ore to its processing \nfacilities between the 1960s and the mid 1990s. One of the places it \nwas shipped was to the Town of Easthampton, MA, where the operations of \nan expanding plant spread the asbestos to the surrounding environment, \ninto the air and onto the soil. I intend to discuss this problem in \ngreat detail as the debate moves forward.\n  I raise it now as a dramatic example of one of the major injustices \ncaused by the arbitrary exclusion of a large number of asbestos victims \nfrom compensation under the trust fund.\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\n  The red spots on this chart show where these other communities were \ncontaminated. The larger the spot, the more shipments. We can see these \nspots all over the country. Yet these communities are not compensated \nfor it, although one community is; other communities are not.\n  The problem of (community contamination is not limited to the sites \nreceiving ore from Libby. Community asbestos contamination can result \nfrom many different sources. For example, medical experts believe it \nmay result from exposure to asbestos after the collapse of the WorId \nTrade Center. Because of the long latency period, we often do not learn \nabout community asbestos contamination until long after it occurs. \nCertainly these victims of asbestos are entitled to fair treatment as \nwell. They should not be arbitrarily excluded from compensation as if \ntheir suffering is somehow less worthy of recognition than the \nsuffering of other asbestos victims. Yet, that is what S.852 does.\n  This is a bill that shifts more of the financial burden of asbestos-\ninduced disease to injured workers by unfairly and arbitrarily limiting \nthe liability of defendants. It does not establish a fair and reliable \nsystem that will compensate all those who are seriously ill due to \nasbestos. It lacks a dependable funding stream which can ensure that \nall who are entitled to compensation actually receive full and timely \npayment. These are very basic shortcomings.\n  We cannot allow what justice requires to be limited by what the \nwrongdoers are willing to pay. I intend to vote ``no'' and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, today, President Bush made an \nannouncement of something he calls the Global Nuclear Energy \nPartnership. It is part of the President's 2007 budget for the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy. In that budget, at a time when there is not much \nextra money, there is $250 million to deal with the objectives of the \nGlobal Nuclear Energy Partnership.\n  Part of the initiative we have heard about before. It calls for \nadvanced technology for nuclear reactors--reactors from which we can \nproduce clean energy, reactors which are smaller than the reactors that \nwe have today that produce about 20 percent of all the electricity we \nuse in the United States. But I want to call attention to a part of the \nPresident's proposal which we have not heard much about before--at \nleast from him--that is the part about reprocessing and recycling the \nfuel that is used in nuclear reactors. That has been something we \nhaven't been doing in the United States for a long time, except in \nlimited cases, and it is something that requires a great deal of \nattention. My hope is that, while it is a small part of a large budget, \nthe idea of reprocessing and recycling spent fuel from nuclear reactors \nwould have a significant, measured, and careful bipartisan discussion \non the floor of the Senate.\n  Even though it is a small part of the big budget, dealing with the \nissue of reprocessing spent fuel can make a big difference in the \nsolution to a number of large problems.\n  For example, whether we are able to deal with global warming within a \ngeneration, the only technology we have, of which I am aware, which \nwill produce large amounts of carbon-free energy which would permit the \nUnited States and the world to reasonably hope to deal with global \nwarming in this generation is nuclear power.\n  Even though it is 20 percent of our electricity in the United States \ntoday, it produces 70 percent of the carbon-free electricity.\n  Solving the reprocessing and recycling problem which deals with the \nissue of energy independence--and it has been talked a lot about on \nboth sides of the aisle--if we want to be independent of other \ncountries, we have to have ways to produce large amounts of energy in a \nclean way. And other than conservation and efficiency, nuclear power, \nin my judgment, is the only way to do that today.\n  A third area has to do with clean air. We have other forms of energy \nproduction such as coal, a very important form, but coal still produces \nlarge amounts of sulfur and nitrogen pollution. It produces mercury. \nThe idea of recapturing the carbon and the integrated gasification \nprocess of making that coal-produced electricity clean is something we \nstill have a lot of work to do on.\n  Dealing with reprocessing will have a lot to do with solving the \nproblems of proliferation concerns that we have about other countries \ngetting hold of spent fuel and turning it into material that can \nproduce nuclear weapons. We read about it every day in terms of Iran \nand North Korea. It has to do with a balance of payments in the United \nStates.\n  Some country is going to produce these advanced nuclear technology \npowerplants. Russia, for example, might produce 30 or 40 of these. When \nit does, it will have the technology available to sell those \npowerplants to India, China, and other parts of the world where they \nneed large amounts of energy which is clean. The United States will be \nleft behind if we are not a part of that process.\n  I have mentioned all of these issues as if they were American \nissues--global warming, energy independence, clean air, proliferation, \nbalance of payments. These are worldwide issues. By one account, 30 \npercent of pollution in the Los Angeles basin comes from Asia. If India \nand China aren't able to deal with the global warming issue, with the \nclean air issues, and with the proliferation issue, every American will \nbe affected.\n  Today, there are about 430 nuclear reactors in the world being used \nto produce electricity. About 100 are in the United States. We have a \nclassified number--maybe it is about the same--of them which have been \nused in our nuclear Navy since the 1950s. It is not difficult to \nimagine a world with 1,000 nuclear reactors. There are 124 nuclear \nreactors on the drawing board today, or under construction. Until \nrecently, none of those were in the United States. We haven't built one \nnew nuclear powerplant from scratch since the 1970s. It is very odd \nbecause we have a large demand in this country for large amounts of \nlow-cost, clean energy. We invented the technology. We have used it in \nour Navy since the 1950s without a single incident.\n\n  France is now about 80 percent reliant on electricity from nuclear \npowers. And Japan, which suffered under our use of nuclear weapons, has \nused nuclear power to produce electricity.\n  Things though are changing. While nuclear power has some problems, so \ndoes every other alternative for producing the large amounts of energy \nthat we and the world needs.\n  Coal, which I mentioned, produces pollutants, and no one has yet \nproduced a way to deal with all of the carbon that is produced by coal \nto make it the strategy for future.\n  Many environmental groups--I am one of those persons who is hopeful \nabout that--but the idea of recapturing such large amounts of carbon \nand putting it underground is something we haven't able to do yet.\n  Drilling for new oil produces lots of arguments in this body and \nclose votes. Importing oil produces many resolutions and arguments in \nthis body as well.\n  Wind energy is appealing to some, but you would have to cover up the \nwhole State of Massachusetts to produce what one or two nuclear \npowerplants would be able to produce.\n  Today, solar energy is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of what we \nuse in America.\n  So we need nuclear power. In order to have nuclear power, we are \ngoing to have to deal with the problem of where we put the spent fuel \nand what we do about proliferation.\n  I am glad that the President suggested in his budget today the Global \nNuclear Energy Partnership. I am glad he put $250 million in it to \nadvance the idea of processing and recycling.\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n  First, we should move ahead with the advanced technology and loan \nguarantees, the investment tax credits, the risk assurance that was \nenacted in the Energy bill in July.\n  Second, we should move ahead with research and discussion of \nreprocessing and recycling so that we can reduce by 90 percent the \namount of waste that we would have to store at Yucca Mountain, or \nsimilar facilities, and reduce by more than that the heat in that spent \nfuel.\n  And finally, we should discuss an international protocol so that \nwhile other countries such as the United States, Russia, and others \nmight invent the technology for small, new nuclear powerplants, there \nwould be some sort of international protocol that would lease the spent \nfuel, supervise its processing, and supervise its permanent storage so \nthat we and the world in this generation can deal with global warming, \nenergy independence, clean air, and a variety of other issues that deal \nwith our lives.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, if the American people want to know what is \nwrong with Washington, they should take a look at what is being debated \nin the Senate this week--asbestos legislation.\n  I have said on a number of occasions that Lord Acton, whom I studied \nwhen I was in college, is right--power tends to corrupt, and absolute \npower tends to corrupt absolutely. Look what we have on the Senate \nfloor today--asbestos legislation, legislation that, of course, is not \nready to be here, but it is being brought here because of tremendous \npressure by the folks downtown.\n  What do I mean by folks downtown? Washington has been run by the \nlobbyists. The Jack Abramoff scandal is no surprise to people who have \nbeen watching this. The K Street Project and other such things came \nabout as a result of too much concentration of power.\n  Why do I say that this is an example of why we need lobbying reform \nin Washington today? This legislation is on the floor for one reason: \n15 companies that are pushing this legislation. Thousands of companies \noppose it.\n  The 15 companies that support this legislation spent $144.5 million \non lobbying in 2 years.\n  Actually, I am wrong; 13 companies spent $144.5 million in 2 years on \nlobbying.\n  Why is this legislation on the floor today? Why are we not doing \nsomething about education?\n  My friend from Tennessee talked about another very important issue--\nwhether this country should move to nuclear power.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if we had a debate on the Senate floor about \nthat? Or about wind energy? Or about why we don't have tax credits for \nwind, for Sun, for geothermal, and for biomass that last more than 2 or \n3 years?\n  Why we are not taking a look at nuclear energy? That would be good. \nWe could have a debate on this floor about these topics and spend a \ncouple days very profitably.\n  But we are not doing that. Instead we are talking about asbestos \nbecause 13 companies spent $144.5 million in 2 years lobbying to get it \nhere. For the 13 companies, I guess that was money well spent because \nthey are going to save billions if this legislation passes.\n  It would be nice if we spent some time on the Senate floor talking \nabout why this country is going into financial bankruptcy because of \nits spending these last 5 years.\n  Remember, during the last years of the Clinton administration we paid \ndown the debt by $.5 trillion. Not this administration. We are going to \nbe asked in a few days to increase the debt ceiling above $8.2 \ntrillion.\n  As I said, it would be nice if we had a debate on the Senate floor \nabout education.\n  I know my friend, the Presiding Officer, has been working in \nconjunction with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the junior \nSenator from New Mexico, Jeff Bingaman, about why this country is \nfalling behind scientifically in this country. It would be nice if we \nhad a debate on that.\n\n  However, these folks who Senator Alexander and Senator Bingaman are \ntalking to about increased funding for research cannot afford to spend \n$144.5 million in 2 years for lobbyists to get the goods. So we will \nspend time the Senate does not have on this piece of legislation that \nis flawed, flawed, flawed. Later I will explain what is wrong with it.\n  We will spend valuable time on the Senate floor because the lobbyists \nwon. Chalk one up for the lobbyists. Do we need lobbying reform? Yes. \nFor example, we do not even know all the companies involved in this so-\ncalled asbestos study group. ASG would have to disclose their \nmembership under the lobby-reform legislation we have proposed. They \nwould not be able to do it in secret, then pay their money under the \nplan.\n  I bet they are jumping with joy today--some of whom we do not know \nwho they are--because they were able to buy their way into the Senate, \npaying for a bunch of lobbyists.\n  These 13 companies employed 168 lobbyists. It is pretty easy to \nfigure out what is going on.\n  I am going to vote opposing the motion to proceed. Rarely do I do \nthat. It is so important that I do it here. I don't know if we have \nenough votes to stop it from going forward, but for the good of the \nAmerican people, I hope so. If we do not, there are a lot of other ways \nwe can fight this very bad piece of legislation.\n  The Super Bowl was last night. The underdog, Pittsburgh Steelers, \nwon. However, turning from football to lobbying, the lobbyists are not \nunderdogs when they are given $144.5 million to bring a bill to the \nSenate. They are on the winning side. $144.5 million was paid to \nlobbyists by 13 companies. That is why we are here today. That is why \nwe need lobbying reform. With reform we would at least know all the \ncompanies involved in the so-called ASG, asbestos study group. Talk \nabout a blight on legislative standards, bringing this bill to the \nSenate and leaving real problems to someone else another day.\n  This bill is anything but fair. But like a lot of things around here, \nwe still call it the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act. This \nis part of the Orwellian world we live in here, where the Clear Skies \nInitiative pollutes the skies, where the Healthy Forests Initiative \nruins our forests, where the Leave No Child Behind Act leaves children \nbehind, where the Budget Deficit Reduction Act increases the deficit. \nNow, we are going to be asked to deal with the Fairness in Asbestos \nResolution Act, which is anything but fair.\n  It is unfair to victims of asbestos exposure. It is unfair to small \nbusinesses. It is unfair to thousands of businesses in this country. It \nis unfair to the American taxpayer. If this goes through, they likely \nwill have to bail out the trust fund created under the bill. It is \nunfair to organized labor. It is unfair to the insurance industry. It \nis unfair to veterans.\n  As I said, I don't lightly oppose a motion to proceed. I recognize \nthat generally it is the prerogative of the majority leader to set the \nagenda. In this case, however, opposing this motion is absolutely \njustified. This is a terrible piece of legislation to bring before the \nSenate with the state of the legislative calendar that we have. I wish \nthe Government Operations Committee, led by Senators Lieberman and \nCollins, would get Congress some lobbying reform. That is what we need \nto do. That would be more important than this.\n  This bill is not ready for consideration. It is not even a close \ncall. There are so many unanswered questions raised by the current \nbill, too many questions about solvency and adequacy of the trust fund, \ntoo many questions about the impact of this bill on the lives of \ncountless Americans with asbestos-related illnesses. This alone should \ndisqualify this legislation from being on the Senate floor.\n  The Senate could debate this bill for the next 60 legislative days, \nand we still could not fix the structural flaws of this trust fund. The \nonly reasonable approach is to take it back to the Judiciary Committee \nand find a better approach.\n  This bill should also be referred to the Senate Committee on the \nBudget before the Senate debates it. Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg \nhave said it is not ready for the Senate floor. They have written a \nletter to me and to Senator Frist asking for more time to review the \nmassive fiscal impact of this program.\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n  Asbestos companies, it is estimated--and it is not much of an \nestimate but pretty certain--will save over $20 billion with this \nlegislation. Fortune 500 companies will have dramatic reductions in \ntheir asbestos liability. The sad part about this is that companies who \nare responsible for exposing victims to asbestos could see the harmful \neffects coming. Way back in the 1960s, for example, Dow Chemical knew \nthe hazards of asbestos. They had done research and they said \n``asbestos has long been known to be capable of causing asbestosis.'' \nThey did not mention mesothelioma.\n  Three decades before Dow Chemical recognized this, in 1938, a report \nby the U.S. Public Health Service, which DOW received, described how \nasbestos textile factory workers were exposed to asbestos fibers, which \nled to the development of diseases that killed them. In 1951, companies \nwere reporting that exposure to asbestos would kill you. We know from \nreading--pick any book you want--the book titled ``Libby, Montana,'' \nW.R. Grace knew that what they were doing was killing their workers. \nThey knew about it. It is documented.\n  Is it any wonder that some are asking why we are here? When we \nconsider the $144.5 million and 2 years spent for lobbyists, we begin \nto understand why we are here. If these numbers do not add up, and they \ndon't, wouldn't it be well advised to have the Committee on the Budget \ninvolved in crafting this legislation? There is a need for legislation \nthat improves the way victims of asbestos exposure receive \ncompensation, but this is not it.\n  Since this bill was initiated, there have been reforms at the State \nlevel that have been credible and important in advancing the cause of \nthe victims. Our best hope of achieving whatever Federal reforms may be \nappropriate rests with further deliberation at the committee level, not \nin the Senate. I hope my colleagues seriously consider joining me in \nvoting no on the motion to proceed. There are just too many problems \nwith this bill.\n\n  Let me first focus on people whom this is supposed to be all about, \nthe victims of asbestosis and mesothelioma, diseases that come about as \na result of being exposed to asbestos. If you get mesothelioma, you \ndie. Once that disease is diagnosed, no one has ever survived. You die. \nWith asbestosis you might continue to live but likely will have a long, \nslow, advance toward death. Sometimes it kills quicker than others. \nPeople have lived for some time with asbestosis but never mesothelioma. \nThe average life expectancy after discovery is less than a year and a \nhalf. Asbestos is one of the most lethal substances ever used in the \nworkplace, and it was unleashed knowingly on communities all over our \ncountry. More than 27.5 million workers have been exposed to asbestos. \nThey were exposed while they were working with the stuff. However, \ncountless others were exposed because this work was going on in their \nneighborhoods. Asbestos was used in schoolyards. And as we have come to \nlearn, a worker coming home and having his wife wash his clothes \nexposed her and the family to asbestos-related diseases. And these \nspouses have died. Children who hugged their father, after coming home \nfrom work carrying his lunch bucket, have gotten these diseases and \nhave died. Hundreds of thousands are gravely ill as we speak, hundreds \nof thousands of people.\n  The diseases caused by asbestos exposure are painful, debilitating, \nand, as I have indicated, mostly incurable. Every State in America has \nbeen touched by this scourge. In the relatively sparsely populated \nState of Nevada, Margie Urnberg, Carson City, wrote a letter. She lost \nher father, Ronald. Will Glienke's father died of mesothelioma. Kellie \nAppleton-Hultz lost her husband due to asbestos poisoning and is still \ncoping with this as I speak.\n  This problem has affected me on a personal level. My three brothers \nand I had no place to live when high school started, so we lived with \nother families or acquaintances. My older brother, Don, lived in \nHenderson, NV, with the Hansen family, a wonderful family. They took in \nmy brother so he could go to high school. One of the Hansens who played \nfootball with my brother, Don, was named Harold. My brother and Harold \nwere both halfbacks on the football team. Harold went away to college \nand later became a mechanical engineer. He worked for the State of \nNevada all of his life. He hung around the State employee workshop. He \nlearned less than a year ago that he had mesothelioma. He is dead now. \nHe never worked with asbestos, but in the workshop where he spent some \nof his time, they replaced brakes and brake linings containing \nasbestos. Harold Hansen is dead because of this.\n\n  I see in the Chamber the assistant Democratic leader, my friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Illinois. He and I served in the \nHouse of Representatives together. I can remember another man who was \nso helpful to me while I was in the House of Representatives. I had \nbeen a Member of the House for just a short period of time, and this \nman and I were walking down the aisle to vote. He said: You know, I \nlove Nevada. I want to help you get a national park. We did not have a \nnational park in Nevada at the time. He was the subcommittee chair of \nthe then-called Interior Committee of National Parks. His name was \nBruce Vento. Oh, what a great guy he was. I worked out at the same time \nhe did in the House gym for many years.\n  He was probably 6 foot 1 or 2, but really a strong man. He had been \nin Congress for more than 20 years. He practiced law before that. He \nnever worked with his hands except once, when he was a very young man, \naround 20 years old. He worked for a while at summer jobs, like we all \nhad. He obviously was exposed to asbestos. And just like that, he was \ndiagnosed with mesothelioma. He died within 6 months.\n  Bruce Vento--and we have a national park in Nevada now; much of it \ndue to Bruce Vento's advocacy; the Great Basin National Park, a \nwonderful national park; the only one we have in Nevada--dead because \nof mesothelioma.\n  Tomorrow I am going to introduce a resolution designating April 1 of \nthis year as Asbestos Disease Awareness Day. The purpose of this \nresolution is to raise awareness that asbestos exposure is still \nprevalent, that asbestos-related diseases continue to kill many \nAmericans each year, and that more needs to be done to protect \nAmericans from this lethal substance.\n  A truly fair asbestos reform bill should meet the unmet needs of \nasbestos victims. This bill does not. Every major asbestos victims \ngroup opposes this legislation--every one. In an open letter to the \nSenate, dated February 1 of this year, the Committee to Protect \nMesothelioma Victims, the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, the \nAsbestos Victims Organization, the White Lung Association, and the \nWhite Lung Asbestos Information Center wrote that they oppose this \nlegislation. Specifically, they wrote:\n\n       We do not want this proposed government policy forced upon \n     us. We believe the program will fail to treat victims fairly, \n     while benefitting the very companies that caused the problem.\n\n  And that is what has happened here. But we have these companies that \nspent $144.5 million for 2 years to get lobbyists down here to push \nthis bill. I forget the number, about 170 or so lobbyists, as indicated \nin a report by Public Citizen. I will bet they are watching TV right \nnow, in their Gucci shoes, having just piled out of their limousines, \nbragging about what they did: bringing the asbestos bill to the floor. \nThey have a lot of other important things to do, but what are they \ndoing? Because they are good at what they do, we have this bill on the \nSenate floor. Lobbying reform is what we really need.\n  An asbestos bill that faces such widespread opposition from the \nvictims of asbestos disease is obviously the wrong approach to this \nnational problem. The problem seems to be that the so-called FAIR Act--\nremember, that is what this is called in this Orwellian world we live \nin--places the needs of a few large companies with asbestos liability \nabove the needs of those suffering from asbestos-related illnesses. \nThis is the fundamental flaw of this legislation.\n  But to show what these lobbyists have done, we need only look at what \nthey have done to fool the veterans. These big companies, of course, \nare paying veterans to come back to Washington. They have convinced a \nfew of the veterans this legislation is good for them. Not true. But if \nyou have this much money to spend, you can pass it around.\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\n  This asbestos study group is claiming that victims who are veterans \nare not recovering under the present system. Unfortunately, the facts \ndo not support their claim. Many veterans will be completely shut out \nof all means of compensation if this trust fund proposed under this \nlegislation becomes law.\n  These false claims about veterans seem to be another effort to ensure \nthat corporations receive the more than $20 billion bailout they seek \non the backs of veterans. It does not matter because the lobbyists have \ndone their job. They have this bill and they have a few veterans \nstraggling in to talk about what a good thing this is for them.\n  If this asbestos bill wins, the corporations win and the veterans \nlose. Today, veterans can and do use the court system every day to get \nhelp with the health and financial consequences of the diseases they \nhave.\n  Tragically, it is true that many veterans are victims of asbestos \ndisease. Much of it came from Navy ships before the 1970s that \ncontained high levels of asbestos. Thirty percent of the mesothelioma \nvictims are veterans. World War II, as I have indicated, is where most \nof these veterans got exposed to asbestos--World War II. The average \nage of the World War II veteran is about 80. About 1,500 World War II \nveterans are dying every day.\n  This legislation will stop some of them from recovering the \ncompensation they are owed. If they now have pending trial dates or \npending settlements, those will be eviscerated if this legislation \npasses. They immediately have their causes of action stayed and would \nbecome part of the queue of over 600,000 claimants waiting for the \nproposed fund to become operational. Most of them will die before \nrecovering the money owed to them.\n  Veterans receive no priority status or special protection under this \nbill. They will be tossed into an untested and underfunded bureaucracy \nwith all other claimants even though every independent analyst says the \nfund is destined to fail. I repeat, every major asbestos victims \norganization opposes this bill because it is underfunded and unfair to \nall victims, including veterans.\n  Veterans are recovering under the current system but will have a much \nharder time recovering if this bill becomes law.\n\n  Though veterans cannot sue the Government for compensation for \nasbestos poisoning, they have successfully sued manufacturers of \nasbestos products, like other claimants have done. This right will be \nstripped from them under S. 852. Thousands and thousands of veterans \nhave successfully sued asbestos companies. And, frankly, it has been \nshown that veterans who are dying of mesothelioma and these other \nserious cancers generally receive greater compensations through the \ncourts than is provided under S. 852.\n  Under this fund, the awards will be one size fits all. In many cases, \nveterans' asbestos exposure as civilians is far greater than their \nexposure in the military. Lester M. Cable, who lives in Bridgeport, CT, \nis a typical case. He was exposed to asbestos as a boilerman in the \nNavy in 1950 and 1951, and also in civilian life doing home \nconstruction and repair projects working with asbestos-containing \nhousehold appliances and heating systems.\n  He suffers from malignant mesothelioma and has a trial date set for \nthis July as an accelerated living mesothelioma case in the Bridgeport \nSuperior Court. If the proposed asbestos legislation is enacted, his \ncase would be wiped out immediately, forcing him to start all over \nagain under the proposed trust fund. He will not live that long.\n  It is no wonder that asbestos victims oppose a bill that deprives \nthem of their legal rights in the traditional civil justice system and \noffers them instead a trust fund that is inadequate and will likely \nbecome insolvent. Numerous experts have concluded that the cost of the \nprogram will exceed the amount allotted for the trust fund. Mr. \nPresident, $140 billion sounds like a lot of money, but, remember, 27.5 \nmillion American workers have been exposed to asbestos. This does not \ninclude, as I have indicated, people living in the neighborhoods, the \nspouses, children.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the program could \ngenerate at least $10 billion more in claims than the trust fund is \ndesigned for. But even that figure understates the problem because the \nbill does not adequately take into account the trust fund's borrowing \ncosts, further depleting the compensation available to victims. And \nthat is what they are, victims. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that approximately $8 billion would be required in the first \ndecade, an amount that will saddle the fund with a huge debt over the \nlife of the program.\n  Other experts, though, say the bill is on even less solid fiscal \nfooting. For instance, the Bates White economic consulting firm has \nconcluded that the program will cost at least $300 billion, and with \ncertain contingencies could cost as much as $600 billion. The General \nAccounting Office has recently issued a report describing how at least \nfour other Federal trust fund compensation systems that were smaller in \nscope than this had trouble funding the shortfalls.\n  But even if the $140 billion were adequate--and it is not--there is \nno guarantee the fund would raise that amount of revenue. The actual \namount of revenue available to victims depends on the number of \ncompanies that actually contribute. Yet there is no definitive \ninformation available to Senators on the number or identity of the \nparticipating companies. We have talked about that before. Supporters \nof this legislation have asserted that there will be between 8,000 and \n10,000 such companies, but the Congressional Budget Office could \nidentify only 1,700 participants. As a result, less than $140 billion \nwill be available for this fund. If revenues from the private sector \nare insufficient to fully fund the program, the only options for \nmaintaining solvency of the fund will be to reduce compensation to \ninjured victims or supplement the privately raised funds with tax \ndollars.\n  There is a long list of companies that have contacted Senators \nsaying: Please, don't do this. But let me just give an example of a \nfew. These are companies that are really old, some of them more than \n100 years old. For example, there is a company called Okonite. They are \nthe only company that makes wire in the country anymore. They have a \nfew manufacturing plants around the country. The chief executive \nofficer said: We'll go bankrupt. If you pass that legislation, there \nwon't be an American company making wire anymore.\n  Hopeman Brothers, they are ship joiners. They work on big ships. They \ndo finishing work on big ships. They said: We'll drop out. We'll go \nbankrupt.\n  Foster Wheeler is an engineering and construction firm: If you sign \nthis into law, we go out of business. They have asbestos claims. They \ncan handle them. One of the companies said: We budget every year what \nwe are going to spend on asbestos claims. We can handle that. But we \ncannot handle this legislation. We'll go bankrupt.\n  There is a good argument that the Federal Government should \ncontribute to the fund, since a large number of U.S. servicemen were \nexposed to asbestos. But that has not happened here. This bill does not \ntap Federal tax dollars in an honest, straightforward way. But that is \nwhat is going to happen if the trust fund is not sufficient. It \nestablishes a private trust fund that will almost certainly become \ninsolvent. As a practical matter, the Federal Government will be left \nholding the bag when things go wrong. A Federal bailout of a program of \nthis magnitude would have enormous adverse consequences to the Federal \nbudget. But with President Bush holding the records for the highest \ndeficits in the history of the country, maybe we should not be \nconcerned about this.\n  The structural problems with the trust fund relate to one of the \nbill's most fundamental flaws: its lack of transparency. From the \noutset, members of the Judiciary Committee and others asked for full \ndisclosure of the names of companies that will be required to pay into \nthe fund. According to press reports, the major lobbying firms that \nhelped draft the bill possess documents listing the contributing \ncompanies and how much each would be required to pay. But this \ninformation remains unavailable to Senators and, of course, to the \ngeneral public.\n\n  The Senate is entitled to such relevant information before debate \nbegins, but we are not going to get it. There is no reason to waste the \ntime of\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\nthe full Senate debating a bill with so many loose ends and so many \nunanswered questions and, I am frank to admit, a lot of answered \nquestions. The budgetary concerns are reason enough to defeat the \nmotion to proceed.\n  I have been contacted by five courageous members of the majority who \nare going to vote against the motion to proceed because they know this \nis a budget buster. And maybe others will come along. I have only been \ncontacted by five. First, let me say this: Even if the trust funds were \nadequately funded, the system set up here is flawed for a number of \nreasons in compensating the poor, unfortunate individuals who get these \ndiseases. Let me talk about a few of them.\n  The startup provisions provide that as soon as the bill is enacted, \nthe ability of asbestos victims to obtain compensation in the court \nsystem is cut off. It also requires that bankruptcy trusts established \nto pay victims' claims be shut down, even before the fund is \noperational. The bill attempts to provide a mechanism through which \nterminally ill claimants will obtain payments in this interim period, \nbut all other claimants, no matter how serious their illness or \ndisability, would be left without a remedy for an indefinite period of \ntime.\n  Second, the bill is unfair to victims with pending or settled court \ncases. I talked a little bit about that. Rather than permit asbestos \nclaims to continue in court while the fund is being established, the \nbill imposes an immediate 2-year stay on nearly all asbestos cases. \nThis is unfair. Exigent cases are no exception to a stay. They will be \nautomatically stayed for 9 months from the date of enactment. The \nbill's language is so broad that a trial about to begin would be \nstopped, and an appellate ruling about to be handed down would be \nbarred.\n  Third, the sunset process under the legislation leaves too much \nuncertainty for victims. If the fund fails to operate as promised, \ninstead of allowing victims to return to court, S. 852 allows the \nadministrator of the fund to recommend any number of measures to \nsalvage the program. This means that victims may receive even less \ncompensation or become subject to more stringent medical criteria to \nhave their claims successfully approved.\n  Fourth, the bill requires some victims to prove that asbestos was a \nsubstantial contributing factor to their disease--a higher burden than \nvictims must meet in court, where it is sufficient to show that \nasbestos exposure was a contributing factor, no matter how substantial \na factor. The whole concept of a no-fault trust fund is that it is \nnonadversarial, but this higher burden of proof creates the potential \nfor endless litigation and a high number of rejected claims.\n  Finally, I have serious concerns about the manner in which the FAIR \nAct treats lung cancer and silica diseases victims. Under this bill, an \nentire category of lung cancer victims who were exposed to asbestos for \n15 years or more cannot bring a claim. This bill would deny these \nvictims their right to recover damages in court for their exposure and \ndeny them benefits under the fund as well. This is an unacceptable \naffront to the rights of an entire class of asbestos victims.\n  As for the suffering from silica disease, this act limits recovery by \nindividuals who have both asbestos disease and silica-related diseases. \nI know something about silicosis. My dad had it. He worked in the \nmines. I thought all kids' dads coughed the way my dad did, but they \ndidn't. My dad was exposed to what we called at the time quartz silica. \nIt is well known in Nevada, at the Tonopah mining camp, they would only \nhire, as they referred to it at the time, ``foreigners'' because they \nknew if they hired people who were nonforeigners in Tonopah, they would \ndie. It was the worst of any place in the country. It was bad all over \nNevada, so I know something about silica.\n  This legislation prevents someone who has both silica and asbestos \nexposure from going forward with their claim. The only recourse for \nvictims of both diseases will be to seek compensation for their \nasbestos disease from the asbestos fund, but victims of silica-related \ndisease, including those who have asbestos disease, should also have a \nright to seek redress in the courts. They should be able to do it \nbecause of their silica disease, silicosis. This is a particular \nproblem in Nevada where many miners have contracted both silicosis and \nasbestosis.\n  In this and so many other ways, this bill does not meet the needs of \nmy constituents or of the American people in general. I predict the \nbill's sponsors will attempt to answer my concerns and those of other \nSenators, as I have heard, by telling us there is going to be a \nmanagers' amendment to cure all of the problems of the bill. There will \nbe so many problems with this bill that this managers' amendment will \neffectively be a substitute bill. I am reminded of the old English \nproverb--I don't know if it is an old English proverb--don't buy a pig \nin a poke. The sponsors of the bill should make the text of that \nmanagers' amendment available before we vote on the motion to proceed. \nThe Senate should not vote to proceed on this asbestos bill and find \nitself debating a different asbestos bill.\n  Let's move the process along, some have said. We will fix the \nproblems in conference with the House. Boy, we have heard that a lot of \ntimes. Some of us have been around here long enough to know that \ndoesn't work. That gambit should be rejected. If the Senate decides to \ndebate this bill, it should be one where we confront the tough \nquestions now and get them right before the bill leaves the Senate.\n  I am convinced, unfortunately, that we are not ready to face these \ntough questions at this time. The committee-reported bill is too deeply \nflawed. We don't have sufficient information to address these flaws \nthrough the amendment process. We owe asbestos victims and their \nfamilies a better bill and a better process. The only proper course at \nthis time is to defeat the motion to proceed.\n  I would say this: Again, the winners today are the 13 companies that \npaid $144.5 million to take the much needed time of the Senate to \ndebate these issues. But we are going to be wasting time on this very \nflawed piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S706-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to S. 852 is now pending.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I take strong offense to the statements \nmade by the Senator from Nevada. His accusation that lobbyists are \nbuying their way into the Senate is an outrageous violation of rule \nXIX, which provides that no Senator in debate shall directly or \nindirectly, by any form of words, impute to another Senator or to other \nSenators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\n  To say that this bill, which Senator Leahy and I have led for the \nbetter part of the last 3 years, is the result of lobbyists ``buying \ntheir way into the Senate'' is slanderous. That is a violation of rule \nXIX. It may be that the Senator from Nevada is used to slander, is used \nto libel, because that is what he did recently to 33 Senators. \nRegrettably, nobody has challenged him under rule XIX.\n  Rule XIX relates to what is done on the floor of the Senate, but in \nthis day and age of debates outside the Senate, of debates on \ntelevision and radio and in the newspaper, 33 Senators were victimized \nby the Senator from Nevada, who then scribbled out a form apology \nletter which was meaningless in the context of what was done. And to \ntalk about lobbyists buying their way onto the Senate floor is an \noutrageous distortion of what has happened on this bill.\n  The fact is, over the course of the last 2\\1/2\\ years, there have \nbeen 36 meetings held in my office, attended by people who have an \ninterest in this legislation or their representatives. The AFL-CIO was \nthere. Trial lawyers were there. Representatives of the manufacturers \nand representatives of the insurers and anybody else who wanted to come \nin were welcome. I didn't see the Senator from Nevada there once.\n  He has talked about the bill in a rambling, disconnected way, which \nproves\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\nonly one thing, and that is that he doesn't know anything, really, \nabout the bill. He talks about how the Congressional Budget Office has \nissued a report saying that it would cost between $120 and $135 \nbillion. Under certain contingencies, it might go to $150 billion--\nunlikely. The figure really established was $132 billion.\n  He talked about the Bates White report which includes people without \nany exposure. He wasn't in attendance at the hearing we had during \nwhich the CBO came in and filed a supplemental report on the adequacy \nof the $140 billion. That figure is not a concoction of Arlen Specter; \nthat figure was negotiated by Senator Daschle and by Senator Frist \nbecause they concluded that figure was the accurate figure to take care \nof these claims.\n  When the Senator from Nevada talks about all of the other subjects \nwhich could be taken up, he suddenly became interested in LIHEAP, \nimportuning Senators from cold States that LIHEAP should be taken up \ninstead of the asbestos bill. And when he talks about wind power and \nthe debt and every subject virtually under the sun--no real interest in \nLIHEAP until it is a diversion from the asbestos bill. I have been \naround here a while, a little longer than the Senator from Nevada, and \nI never saw so many red herrings at one time. It could fill an entire \naquarium.\n  What he is seeking to do is to obstruct. He has had a lot of practice \nat that. If he is successful in obstructing this bill from going \nforward, it will be a great travesty for the American people, for \nasbestos victims who are now not able to collect because their \ncompanies are bankrupt.\n  Not a word on what the Senator from Nevada had to say about 77 \ncompanies which have gone into bankruptcy. He talks about people with \nmesothelioma, fakes showing some concern while they and their \ndependents are going penniless because there is nobody to pay their \nclaims. He says one size fits all. The great problem is, the Senator \nfrom Nevada doesn't know anything about the bill.\n  There has been a very carefully structured schedule of payments. When \nhe says the veterans are against it, he is wrong. When he says labor is \nagainst it, we have a long list of labor unions. Senator Leahy and I \nsat down with the leaders of the AFL-CIO and are working out the few \nremaining objections they have to the bill. When he talks about the \nmanagers' package, that is acceptance of amendments. We went through \nexhaustive and extensive hearings.\n  In regards to the 36 meetings which have been held in my office, we \nbrought in a distinguished senior Federal judge, Edward R. Becker, who \nhad been the chief judge of the Third Circuit, who accepted my request \nto mediate. Our meetings started in his chambers in August of 2003, \nright after the bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee during \nthe 108th Congress. And we have had, as I said, 36 meetings. I don't \nthink Judge Becker can tell you how many meetings he has held \nindividually because he can't count that high. I certainly can't tell \nyou how many meetings I have had. But I have talked to individual \nSenators repeatedly, probably some 60 or 70 in this body, and when they \nhear what the bill is about, they are interested.\n  The one Senator whom I talked to who had absolutely no interest in \nthe bill was the Senator from Nevada. All he wants to do is to block \nthe bill. When he says this bill is not ready, this bill has been \nsubjected to more analysis and more investigation and more \nconsideration than any legislation I have seen in my 25 years here, and \nI think it is fair to say more analysis and more consideration than any \npiece of legislation that has been considered in the history of the \nU.S. Senate. Let me put it a different way: I challenge the Senator \nfrom Nevada or anybody else to cite a piece of legislation which has \nhad more analysis and more consideration.\n  This bill is more than ready to come to the floor. The difficulty was \nthat when we reported it out last May 26, the business of the Senate \nwas stacked sky high.\n  And try as he might, the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nFrist, could not find time to bring it up. He put it on the agenda as \nthe first legislative consideration of the 109th Congress in the second \nsession. That is why we are here.\n  The arguments--the rambling statements made by the Senator from \nNevada--I should not call them arguments. They don't rise to the level \nof being arguments. He talks about transparency. We know the individual \ncompanies in these various groups. We had to subpoena them to get them, \nbut we have subpoenaed them. We do have the records.\n  When he talks about the lobbyists writing the bill, what an \noutrageous statement to make in the context of what Judge Becker and I \nand Senator Leahy and others have done on this bill. To accuse us of \nbeing the pawns of the lobbyists is beyond slander, beyond insult. It \nis beyond outrage that those words should come from the mouth of the \nleader of the Democrats in this body.\n  When he talks about silicosis, the rights to sue for silicosis are \nmaintained. It is a very rare situation where someone has both \nsilicosis and an asbestos-related problem. But when you go to court and \nyou make a claim under our tort system, you have to prove, in any case, \nwhether you claim it is silica, or whatever the cause is, that there is \nnot some other cause that is the causative factor of the ailment in \nquestion. We had a hearing on silicosis. I am sorry to hear about the \nfamily of the Senator from Nevada who suffered from silicosis. We had a \nvery involved hearing on the matter. Do you know who wasn't there? The \nSenator from Nevada--just as he was AWOL every other time when serious \nissues were under consideration.\n  Mr. President, I would like to stay here longer this afternoon. I \nwill put the full text of a statement in the Record, which is an \nextensive analysis of this bill. Our phenomenal staff has been at work \non this matter for months, led by two very fine lawyers, Seema Singh \nand Harold Kim, and by many on the Judiciary Committee. This statement \nI recommend to my colleagues to read if they want to understand the \nbill.\n  I would not spend too much time reading the Congressional Record on \nwhat the Senator from Nevada has had to say because there is no \nsubstance to anything he has had to say. When the charges are made here \nabout the lobbyists buying their way into the Senate, Senator Leahy is \non the floor and he is the cosponsor of the bill. Senator Kohl and \nSenator Feinstein voted the bill out of committee. I had heard this \nridiculous talk about this being a product of K Street. Well, this \nSenator is not a product of K Street; neither is Senator Leahy, neither \nis Senator Feinstein. As far as Senator Kohl is concerned, he could buy \nand sell K Street himself without any sweat. So to talk about us being \nin the pocket of the lobbyists, I have not been treated like that since \nI came to the Senate. In fact, I have never been treated like that. I \nresent it. I call it a violation of rule XIX.\n  I hope the Senator from Nevada will abandon these tactics. There is \nenough objection and controversy and dissent in this body that we don't \nneed personal attacks. I have to excuse myself, Mr. President, \nbecause----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I thought you were finished.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Again you thought wrong. You are in the habit of \nthinking wrong. I am in mid-sentence, but I am not surprised to be \ninterrupted.\n  We have other business we are taking care of. I have to soon excuse \nmyself to go to the Judiciary Committee hearing, where we are taking up \nthe question of electronic surveillance, where we have been in session \nlistening to the Attorney General since 9:30 this morning.\n  When the Judiciary Committee had taken up this bill, we took it up \nunder very difficult circumstances. We started last year with the \nimmediate job of confirming the Attorney General. The Senate went into \nsession on the 109th Congress on a Tuesday, and we had the Attorney \nGeneral in on Thursday and confirmed him in short order. Then we moved \nthrough the bankruptcy bill and the class action bill. Then we tackled \nthe very tough problem of the filibusters, which had delayed the \nconfirmation of circuit judges. We worked through that problem.\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n  Then in the midst of all that, we had a series of hearings on a wide \nvariety of issues: Miller, the New York Times reporter who was kept, \nand the business about identity theft. We worked through hearings on \nthe tough immigration problem. Then we took up the issue of the \nconfirmation of Chief Justice Roberts, where the staff of the committee \nworked through the month of August; then we took up the question of the \nconfirmation of Justice Alito. We worked through the months of December \nand January. While people were globe trotting around the world, we were \nat work on those matters. And through it all, we have produced a bill \nthat is solid. It is a bill which is designed to compensate thousands \nof victims of asbestos.\n  One thing the Senator from Nevada was right about: Mesothelioma is a \nkiller. But the thing he is wrong about is that his position will allow \nthese people to be killed without compensation, because their companies \nhave gone bankrupt, some 77 of them. We have moved to this trust fund \nafter decades and decades of work. I first saw this issue when Senator \nGary Hart brought Johns Manville into my office in the early 1980s, \n1982 or 1983, and this asbestos problem has defied solution, just \ndefied solution--until Senator Hatch came up with the concept of this \ntrust fund. Then the trust fund was increased in size from about $90 \nbillion to $140 billion.\n  I didn't hear the Senator from Nevada object when the former \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, agreed with Senator Frist that $140 \nbillion was the accurate figure. I didn't hear him object at all. The \nonly time I hear him object is when there is some chance--and it is an \nuphill fight; I am prepared to concede that, but I am used to them. I \nam used to uphill fights. I might even say I enjoy them. But this is \nthe first time this issue has come to the floor of the Senate. It has \nbeen languishing for decades, and I talked to no one who denies the \nbasic fact that there is a problem that ought to be addressed. I think \neven the Senator from Nevada, with his vitriol and slander, implicitly \nconcedes it is a major problem that ought to be addressed.\n  Now, a motion to proceed takes up the issue as to whether you ought \nto consider the bill. If the Senator from Nevada has valid amendments, \nI would like to see them. If he has a better bill, I would like to see \nthat. I would vote for anybody's bill that is better than this one \nbecause we have to address the issue. When he talks about the Budget \nCommittee, there are some technical problems here because the money \ngoes through the Department of Labor, so it is a Federal expenditure, \nbut it is not Government money; it is money contributed by the insurers \nand the manufacturers. There is no impact on the budget.\n  This bill is ironclad to eliminate any possibility of Federal \nfunding. But if you want to use obstructionist tactics and filibuster--\nthe Senator from Nevada is good at that--if you want to use 60 votes to \ntry to kill it on a motion to proceed, so be it. I know what the rules \nare here. But there is no reason not to proceed, and there is every \nreason to proceed. If you want to use the 60-vote technicality to \nsustain a budget point of order, you can do that, too. But there is no \nadverse impact on the Federal budget.\n  I regret I cannot stay and engage in this colloquy. I do have to get \nback to the Judiciary Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my full statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  Mr. President, again, this is S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \nResolution Act of 2005, FAIR Act, the successor to S. 1125 and S. 2290, \nthe FAIR Acts of 2003 and 2004. My colleagues, Senator Frist, Senator \nHatch and Senator Leahy, deserve enormous credit for the drafting of \nthese acts and for the development of this legislation. There is a will \nin the Senate to enact legislation to end the ongoing rash of \nbankruptcies; to prevent the diversion of resources from those who are \ntruly sick; to preserve jobs and pensions; and to solve the worst \nlitigation crisis in the history of the American judicial system. The \nSenate plainly wants a more rational asbestos claims system, and I \nbelieve that this legislation offers a realistic prospect of \naccomplishing that result.\n  This legislation provides substantial assurances of acceptable \ncompensation to asbestos victims and substantial assurances to \nmanufacturers and insurers to resolve, with finality, asbestos claims. \nOver the past three decades, a solution to the asbestos crisis has \neluded Congress and the courts. Some 77 companies have gone bankrupt, \nthousands of individuals who have been exposed to asbestos have deadly \ndiseases--mesothelioma and other such ailments--and are not being \ncompensated or because of the unfairness of the current system, see \nlittle of the awards they do win. A May 10, 2005, report released by \nthe RAND Institute for Civil Justice estimates that nonmalignants make \nup about 90 percent of the litigation and most are unimpaired. \nAccording to RAND, the number of claims continues to rise, with over \n730,000 claims filed already and some 200,000 pending. The number of \nasbestos defendants also has risen sharply, from about 300 in the \n1980s, to more than 8,400 today and most are users of the product, not \nits manufacturers. These companies represent 85 percent of the U.S. \neconomy and nearly every U.S. industry; including automakers, ship \nbuilders, textile mills, retailers, insurers, electric utilities and \nvirtually any company involved in manufacturing or construction in the \nlast 30 years.\n  Asbestos leaves many victims in its wake. First and foremost, the \nsick and their families have suffered and do not receive fair \ncompensation in the tort system. Asbestos victims filing claims receive \nan average of 42 cents for every $1 spent on asbestos litigation. \nToday, 31 cents of every $1 have gone to defense costs, and 27 cents \nhave gone to plaintiffs' attorneys and other related costs.\n  The flawed asbestos litigation system not only hurts the sick and \ntheir chances of receiving fair compensation but also claims other \nvictims. These include employees, retirees and shareholders of affected \ncompanies whose jobs, savings and retirement plans are jeopardized by \nthe tide of asbestos cases. With asbestos litigation affecting so many \ncompanies, this also impacts the overall economy, including jobs, \npensions, stock prices, tax revenues and insurance costs. According to \na 2002 study by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, asbestos bankruptcies \nhave cost nearly 60,000 workers their jobs and $200 million in lost \nwages. Employees' retirement funds have shrunken by 25 percent.\n  In July 2003, the Judiciary Committee voted out S. 1125, a bill with \nnumerous problems, largely along party lines, 10 yeas, 8 nays, 1 pass, \nin an effort to move the legislation. S. 1125 created the basic \nstructure of the legislation, and made huge strides in working out the \nmedical criteria. However, the bill foundered on other issues. In \nAugust, at my request, Judge Edward R. Becker, a Federal judge for 34 \nyears, convened in his chambers in Philadelphia the so-called \nstakeholders; namely, manufacturers, labor, AFL-CIO, insurers and trial \nlawyers--to determine if some common ground could be found. Until the \npreceding May, Judge Becker had been the Chief Judge of the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals and wrote the opinion in the asbestos class \naction suit that was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n  From September 2003 through January 2005, there were some 36 \nstakeholder meetings held in my conference room, with Judge Becker as a \npro-bono mediator, usually attended by 25 to 40 representatives with \nsometimes over 75 people present. I have also met 61 times since \nJanuary 2005 with various officials from the administration, members of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and their staffs, the Senate leadership \nand other Senators all in an effort to move this bill forward. Judge \nBecker and I have sought an equitable bill which took into account, to \nthe maximum extent possible, the concerns of the stakeholders and to \nget their input on drafting of the bill. After analysis and \ndeliberation, we found we could accommodate many of the competing \ninterests.\n  This process commenced with the blessing of then-Chairman Hatch and \nRanking Member Leahy of the Judiciary Committee. This extended process \nallowed the stakeholders an extraordinary ``hearing'' process and \nreally amounted to the longest ``mark-up'' in Senate history although \nnot in the customary framework. We have had the\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\ncooperation of many Senators. Senators Hatch and Leahy have had \nrepresentatives at all the meetings. The majority leader, Senator \nHatch, and Senator Leahy have addressed this ``working group'' at our \nmeetings. Senator Hatch's and Senator Leahy's representatives have been \nactive participants at every meeting, as well as the members of the \nstaffs of Senators Baucus, Biden, Brownback, Burns, Carper, Chafee, \nChambliss, Coburn, Cornyn, Craig, DeWine, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, \nFeinstein, Graham, Grassley, Hagel, Kennedy, Kohl, Kyl, Landrieu, \nLevin, Lincoln, Murray, Ben Nelson, Pryor, Schumer, Sessions, Snowe, \nStabenow, and Voinovich.\n  In 1997, the Supreme Court commented for the first time on the \ngrowing asbestos problem by stating, in the context of holding that \nasbestos litigation was not susceptible to class action treatment:\n\n       The most objectionable aspects of this asbestos litigation \n     can be briefly summarized: dockets in both federal and state \n     courts continue to grow; long delays are routine; trials are \n     too long; the same issues are litigated over and over; \n     transaction costs exceed the victims' recovery by nearly two \n     to one; exhaustion of assets threatens and distorts the \n     process; and future claimants may lose altogether. . . .\n\n  In the ensuing years with asbestos litigation increasingly choking \nthe courts, the Supreme Court has repeatedly called upon Congress to \nact through national legislation:\n  In one case, the Court observed ``the elephantine mass of asbestos \ncases . . . defies customary judicial administration and calls for \nnational legislation.''\n  A concurrence in the same decision found that the asbestos crisis \n``cries out for a legislative solution.''\n  As recently as 2003, the Supreme Court reminded us that it had \n``recognized the danger that no compensation will be available for \nthose with severe injuries caused by asbestos . . . It is only a matter \nof time before inability to pay for real illness comes to pass.''\n  Even though he dissented from the majority holding in that 2003 case, \nJustice Breyer observed: ``Members of this Court have indicated \nthat Congress should enact legislation to help resolve the asbestos \nproblem. Congress has not responded.''\n\n  The FAIR Act of 2005 is a response to the Supreme Court's many calls \nfor national legislation to fix a broken asbestos litigation system. It \nis the product of these extensive negotiations among the key \nstakeholders. Throughout this process, the stakeholders reached \nimportant compromises that are now embodied in S. 852. The Judiciary \nCommittee also spent a month marking up the bill last May during which \ntime the committee accepted 75 amendments from both Republican and \nDemocratic members. After extensive deliberation, the committee \nreported the bill favorably on May 26, 2005 on a strong bipartisan vote \nof 13-5.\n  The concept of a trust fund is an outstanding idea. Senator Hatch \ndeserves great credit for moving the legislation in the direction of a \ntrust fund with a schedule of payments analogous to workers' \ncompensation so the cases would not have to go through the litigation \nprocess. Under this proposal, the Federal Government would establish a \nnational trust fund privately financed by asbestos defendant companies \nand insurers. No taxpayer money would be involved. Asbestos victims \nwould simply submit their claims to the fund. Claimants would be fairly \ncompensated if they meet medical criteria for asbestos induced \nillnesses and show past asbestos exposure. The trust fund would \nguarantee compensation for impaired victims.\n  Through a series of meetings with Judge Becker, we have wrestled with \nand have been able to solve a number of very complex issues. The size \nof the trust fund was always a principal issue of dispute, starting at \n$108 billion. The manufacturers/insurers raised their offer to $140 \nbillion. In October 2004, Majority Leader Frist and then-Democratic \nLeader Daschle agreed to $140 billion. When Senator Frist and Senator \nDaschle, in an adversarial context, agreed to the adequacy of the $140 \nbillion figure, it is difficult to exceed it even though the AFL-CIO \ndid not contemporaneously agree.\n  It is not possible to say definitely what figure would be adequate \nbecause it depends on the uncertainty of how many claims will be filed. \nThere is support for the adequacy of the $140 billion figure from \nreputable projections, including the Congressional Budget Office cost \nestimate.\n  Since this bill was discharged from this committee in May, new \nreports analyzing the bill have been published--such as the CBO report \nand the Bates White report. In late August 2005, the non-partisan \nCongressional Budget Office issued its analysis of the bill. In its \nreport, the CBO predicted that asbestos claims and award values could \nfall anywhere between $120 to $150 billion, and as a middle of the road \nassessment, concluded that the fund would likely payout $132 billion \nover the life of the fund. It was reassuring to see CBO project $132 \nbillion as adequate to pay the claims in a contest where there are so \nmany variables that do not lend themselves to precise projections or \npredictions. Even in the range of that uncertainty, the CBO has \nestimated that claims could be as low as $120 billion and no higher \nthan $150 billion so that our legislation with $140 billion is \nreasonable and realistically calculated to cover the claims, especially \nin the context with the provisions for review of medical criteria and \naward values to reduce expenditures or increase contributions in the \ntrust fund.\n\n  In September 2005, the analysis by the Bates White firm concluded the \nproposed fund would face claims of between $301 billion and $561 \nbillion, projecting that claimants with lung and other cancers, would \ninundate the fund. A hearing on this issue was held by the Judiciary \nCommittee on November 17, 2005. During the hearing we heard testimony \non both sides of the issue. The Bates White study proved to be fatally \nflawed for reasons detailed at that hearing. Thus, in December 2005, \nCBO confirmed its original cost estimate, reaffirming that $140 billion \nwould be sufficient to cover claims filed for compensation under the \ntrust fund.\n  The real safety valve, if the fund is unable to pay claims, is for \nthe injured to have the ability to go back to court if the system is \nnot operational and able to pay exigent health claims within 9 months \nafter enactment, and all other valid claims within 24 months of \nenactment. Upon reversion to the tort system, the bill provides that \nclaimants may file suits either in Federal Court or State Court in the \nState in which the plaintiff resides or State courts where the asbestos \nexposure took place. Forum shopping has been eliminated.\n  The claimants object to any hiatus between access to the courts and \nan operating system; but the reality is that court delays are \ncustomarily longer than the delay structured in this system. The \ndefendants and insurers object saying it is too short a time frame, but \nthey have the power to expedite the process by promptly paying their \nassessments. Leaders of the Manville Trust and the RAND Institute study \nprovide a solid factual basis that the volume of claims can be \nefficiently administered by the fund administrator using a technique \ndeveloped by the Manville Trust and other similar claims facilities \nthat have processed asbestos claims for many years. The Manville Trust \nhas processed as many as 150,000 claims per year. The number of exigent \nclaims anticipated in the first 9 months of the fund is vastly smaller \nand even the total number of claims anticipated in the first 24 months \nis significantly less that which the Manville Trust has handled in a \ncomparable period. Additionally, the bill provides the administrator \nwith the option to contract out the exigent claims to a claims facility \nfor expedited processing under the standards of the fund on a voluntary \nbasis. The short time frame will prod the system to become operative at \nan early date. The bill sends the claims back to the fund as soon as it \nis certified operational with a credit for any payment of the scheduled \namount.\n  Similarly, the defendants seek a commitment that the legislation will \nbar return to the courts for at least 7\\1/2\\ years. It is hard to see \nhow the substantial fund would be expended in a lesser period. Here \nagain, the legislation gives the defendant substantial assurances that \nthe system will last at least 7\\1/2\\ years. If it collapses, the \nclaimants should not bear the burden, but should reclaim their \nconstitutional right to a jury trial. However, sunset\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\ncannot take place before there is an extensive and rigorous ``program \nreview.'' This would give the administrator an opportunity to refashion \nthe program to compensate for any major shortcomings.\n  The claimants sought $60 billion in startup contributions within 5 \nyears and the defendants countered with a maximum of $40 billion. The \nfund's borrowing power should enable it to borrow at least the balance \nof $20 billion because of the defendants continuing substantial \nfinancial commitments. Here again, the bill meets the standard of \nsubstantial assurances that $60 billion will be in hand within the \nfirst 5 years.\n\n  A key issue for the claimant has been that of workers' compensation \nsubrogation. This issue is important because the value of an award to \nthe claimant depends on whether the claimant may have to pay a \nsubstantial amount of it to others. While the precise picture is \ndifferent from State to State, in general, workers' compensation laws \ngive employers, and their insurance carriers, subrogation rights \nagainst third-party tortfeasors and a lien on the injured employee's \nrecovery from a third-part tortfeasor. This is a big issue because \nworkers' compensation covers the employees' medical costs.\n  We closely examined and considered including a proposal that would \nhave called for a so-called workers' compensation ``holiday.'' Such a \nproposal would have provided for a ``holiday'' from worker's \ncompensation payments during the period of receipt of payments from \ntrust fund except to the extent that the compensation would exceed \nthem, with a waiver of past and future subrogation. However, as each \nState has different workers' compensation laws, we concluded that such \na proposal could go beyond the practice in a number of States, leaving \nsome claimants with a significantly reduced award.\n  Furthermore, claimants assert, with a substantial basis that the \naward values in the bill were designed with the understanding that \nthere would be no liens or rights of subrogation against the claimants \nbased on workers' compensation awards and health insurance payments.\n  Therefore, after substantial analysis, we have determined that to be \nfair to victims, claimants should be allowed to retain both their fund \nawards and workers' compensation payments. It is important that the \nbill must extinguish any liens or rights of subrogation that other \nparties might assert against the claimants based on workers' \ncompensation awards and health insurance payments.\n  Another key issue for the claimants has been the legislation's \ntreatment of asbestos disease claims under the Federal Employers' \nLiability Act, FELA, the workers' compensation system for rail workers. \nEarlier versions of the bill would have preempted FELA claims for \nasbestos-related diseases, limiting victim's recovery to compensation \nunder a national asbestos trust fund. Rail labor asserts that such an \napproach is unfair to rail workers, since for all other workers, the \nbill maintains workers' compensation rights. Alternative approaches to \ndealing with the FELA issue have been proposed, including providing for \na supplemental payment, in addition to awards under the bill, to \nprovide compensation to rail workers for work-related asbestos \ndiseases. The AFL-CIO's affiliates which represent workers in the rail \nindustry have been engaged in discussions with industry on this issue, \nand a fair resolution has been reached. The bill provides for a \nprincipled compromise that would allow for a special adjustment for \nrailroad workers so that the compensation award would be structured in \na manner that would allow for corollary benefits--similar benefits for \nworkers under FELA and workers compensation. It also clarifies that \nthis legislation intends to deal solely with asbestos claims and does \nnot in any manner impact FELA.\n  In these marathon discussions, plus four committee hearings on the \nissue in 2005, we understand the deep concerns expressed by the \nstakeholder representatives on more concessions for their clients. On \nthe state of the 20-year record, this choice is not between this bill \nand one which would give their clients more concessions. The choice is \nbetween this bill and the continuation of the present chaotic system \nwhich leaves uncompensated thousands of victims suffering from deadly \ndiseases and litigation driving more companies into bankruptcy.\n  We considered at length the manufacturers/insurers objections to \nmedical screening, but concluded such a provision was necessary as an \noffset to the reduced role of claimant's attorney. With the previous \npotential of a substantial contingent fee, claimants' attorneys \nidentified those damaged by exposure to asbestos. Absent that \nmotivation, with the attorneys' fees capped at 5 percent, it is \nreasonable to have routine examinations for people who would not be \nexpected to go for such checkups on their own; so as a matter of basic \nfairness, such screening is provided. By establishing a program with \nrigorous standards, as we have done in this bill, unmeritorious claims \ncan be avoided with the fair determination of those entitled to \ncompensation under the statutory standard.\n  The legislation has closely examined the issues of so-called \n``leakage'' in the fund and has provided that all asbestos claims \npending on the date of enactment, except for non-consolidated cases \nactually on trial, and except cases subject to a verdict or final order \nor final judgment, will be brought into the asbestos trust fund. \nFurthermore, only written settlement agreements, executed prior to date \nof enactment, between a defendant and a specifically identifiable \nplaintiff will be preserved outside of the fund; the settlement \nagreement must contain an express obligation by the settling defendant \nto make a future monetary payment to the individual plaintiff, but \ngives the plaintiff 30 days to fulfill all conditions of the settlement \nagreement.\n  We have also included in the legislation language designed to ensure \nprompt judicial review of a variety of regulatory actions and to ensure \nthat any constitutional uncertainties with regard to the legislation \nare resolved as quickly as possible. Specifically, it provides that any \naction challenging the constitutionality of any provision of the act \nmust be brought in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia. The bill also authorizes direct appeal to the Supreme Court \non an expedited basis. An action under this section is to be filed \nwithin 60 days after the date of enactment or 60 days after the final \naction of the administrator or the commission giving rise to the \naction, whichever is later. The District Court and Supreme Court are \nrequired to expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of \nthe action and appeal.\n  Claimants also expressed the need for assurances on the manufacturers \npayment into the fund. Therefore, S. 852 requires enhanced \n``transparency'' of the payments by the defendants and insurers into \nthe fund. The proposal provides that 20 days after the end of such 60-\nday period, the administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a \nlist of such submissions, including the name of such persons or \nultimate parents and the likely tier to which such persons or \naffiliated groups may be assigned. After publication of such list, any \nperson may submit to the administrator information on the identity of \nany other person that may have obligations under the fund. In addition, \nthere are enhanced notice and disclosure requirements included in the \nlegislation. It also provides that within 60 days after the date of \nenactment, any person who, acting in good faith, has knowledge that \nsuch person or such person's affiliated group would result in placement \nin the top tiers, shall submit to the administrator either the name of \nsuch person or such person's ultimate parent; and the likely tier to \nwhich such person or affiliated group may be assigned under this act.\n\n  As I have mentioned previously, this legislation deals with a number \nof very complex issues, one of them being that of ``mixed-dust.'' We \nheld a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on this issue on February 2, \n2005. The manufacturers fear that many asbestos claims will be \n``repackaged'' as silica claims in the tort system. Evidence adduced at \nthe hearing reflects that this has been happening in a number of \njurisdictions. If a claim is due to asbestos exposure at all, the \nprogram should be the exclusive means of compensation. The stakeholders \nagree that this is an asbestos bill, designed to dispose of all \nasbestos claims but that workers with\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\ngenuine silica exposure disease ought to be able to pursue their claims \nin the tort system. The problem is that with those claims where the \npoint of demarcation is unclear. Silica/asbestos defendants are worried \nthat they will find themselves in court with the burden of proving that \nthe plaintiffs injury is due to asbestos rather than silica. S. 852 \nmakes clear that pure silica claims are not preempted, but claims \ninvolving asbestos disease are preempted. A claimant must provide \nrigorous medical evidence establishing by a preponderance of evidence \nthat their functional impairment was caused by exposure to silica, and \nasbestos exposure was not a significant contributing factor. Although \nthis does impose the burden on the claimant, this is no different than \nthe burden the plaintiff or any party advancing a position has in \nproducing medical evidence in any case that the physician will state \nthat a disease was caused by some condition or exposure or that it was \nnot caused by some condition or exposure. In addition, the testimony \ngiven at the February hearing on the issue established that asbestos \nand silica are easily distinguishable on x ray and that asbestos and \nsilica rarely are found in the same patient.\n  Another very complicated issue I have addressed in my legislation, at \nthe request of the claimants, is that of providing for award \nadjustments for exceptional mesothelioma cases based on age and the \nnumber of dependents of the claimant. For example, a mesothelioma \nvictim who is 40 years old with two children will be able to get an \nupwards adjustment in his award amount as compared to a 80 years \nmesothelioma victim with no dependents. The impact of such adjustments \nto the fund will remain revenue-neutral.\n  There has been a strong concern that this bill should not become a \n``smokers'' bill rather than an asbestos bill--that thousands of \nsmokers will claim to be in the level VII compensation tier in order to \nget money even if asbestos had nothing to do with their disease. After \nlong discussions with the various sides, it has been decided to remove \nlevel VII cases from the fund, cases which had the potential to bring \ndown the entire fund.\n  There has also been a concern with the legitimacy of the level VI \ncompensation tier. We requested that the Institute of Medicine, IOM, \ncommence a study to assess the medical evidence so as to determine \nwhether colorectal, laryngeal, esophageal, pharyngeal or stomach cancer \ncan be caused by asbestos exposure. The IOM will conclude its study of \nlevel VI causation by April 2006. With a 270-day stay on exigent cases \nand 2-year stay of all other cases, this has the practical impact of \nthe IOM study results being conclusive on inclusion or exclusion of \nlevel VI prior to any claim being filed.\n\n  Therefore, the bill retains the level VI tier pending the IOM study \nconclusions but continues to provide extensive safeguards to the fund \nagainst those individuals with these diseases making claims against the \nAsbestos Trust Fund. Any level VI claim must be based on findings by a \nboard-certified pathologist accompanied by evidence of a bilateral \nasbestos-related nonmalignant disease; evidence of 15 or more weighted \nyears of substantial occupations exposure to asbestos; and supporting \nmedical documentation establishing asbestos exposure as a contributing \nfactor in causing the cancer in question. The claim must also be \nreferred to a physicians panel for a determination that it is more \nprobable than not that asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing \nfactor in causing the other cancer in question. Further, the bill \nmandates that the physicians panel review the claimants smoking history \nas opposed to ``claimant may request.''\n  The FAIR Act is a complicated bill, but one that is both integrated \nand comprehensive and reflective of a remarkable will to enact \nlegislation. If this bill is rejected, I do not see the agenda of this \nSenate Judiciary Committee revisiting the issue. I cannot conceive of a \nmore strenuous effort being directed to this subject that has been done \nover the past 2\\1/2\\ years. This is the last best chance.\n  I remain confident that during debate on the Senate floor, we can \nforge and enact a bill that is fair to the claimants and to business \nand that will put an end once and for all to this nightmare chapter in \nAmerican legal, economic and social history. If we can summon the \nlegislative will in a bipartisan spirit, it can be done. Anything less \nwould preserve the injustices of a system that even the highest Court \nof this country has called upon the Congress to fix.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure the record reflects that \nI have the highest regard for Pat Leahy and Arlen Specter. If I in any \nway embarrassed them or hurt their feelings, I am sorry I did that. \nCertainly, it was nothing I said that indicated they did anything that \nwas unbecoming regarding this legislation. That is how I feel. But that \ndoesn't take away from the fact that I think it is outrageous that \nthese 13 companies spent $144.5 million lobbying this legislation. I \nwill not get away from that.\n  We need lobby reform in this country. We need to start on that right \nnow. I want to make sure the record reflects this also. The week before \nlast, my communications center put out a piece of mail I didn't see. It \nwent out--and that is not much of an excuse, but it is true. The minute \nI learned about it, I wrote a letter. It was as close as anything I \ncould do from my heart. What I did in not reading that letter before it \nwent out from my office is wrong. I take full blame for that. But \nanything in that letter--I mean, to show you, Mr. President, there was \na derogatory statement about my friend from Nevada, Senator Ensign. As \neveryone knows here, I would never say anything negative about him. We \nmay disagree on legislation, but I would never say anything in a \nnegative way about him. He was one of the 33 mentioned in that letter. \nSo I apologized to him and to all 32 others. I meant that. It was wrong \nwhat I did, but I have said that.\n  I am sorry my friend from Pennsylvania raised that. I did the best I \ncould in resolving that as an issue, putting that to each of those \nSenators, saying I am sorry. I received phone calls from a number of \nSenators and I have had personal meetings with them. They accepted my \napology.\n  Also, we should not do things on a personal basis here, and I didn't \ndo that. I complained bitterly about this legislation. I cannot stand \nthis legislation, and contrary to what my friend from Pennsylvania \nsays, I pretty well understand it. Maybe I don't understand it as well \nas he does, but I understand it. Everything I said about this \nlegislation in my remarks is meant by me. I meant every word I said.\n  For the Senator to disparage me because I didn't attend the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, I am not a member of the committee. If I spent my \ntime, or the Presiding Officer did, going to committees we don't belong \non, it would make for a very difficult scene around here.\n  I disagree with my friend, the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, \non this legislation. I think it is misguided legislation. But he did it \nand I have talked to him personally about how I think it is bad. He \ntold me where he thinks it is good. We disagree. I asked the assistant \nDemocratic leader, Senator Durbin, to be the floor manager on this \nbecause he and I and the vast majority of the Democrats oppose this \nlegislation.\n  I am sorry the Senator from Pennsylvania thought my remarks were \nrambling and disconnected. I guess it is up to the people who watch \nthis--not my friend from Pennsylvania--to determine whether it is \nrambling and disconnected. If the Senator thinks I was in some way \ndisparaging him, I certainly didn't mean it. I am disparaging this \nlegislation. I think it is bad legislation, and I think the people it \nhurts more than anybody else are the victims.\n  The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania said I have no interest \nin this legislation. Why would I be here if I have no interest in the \nlegislation? I have an interest. It is different than his. He says I \nfake concern about this. I am sorry he feels that way. I am concerned \nabout this legislation.\n  For the reasons I have enumerated in my opening statement, I think \nthis is a bad piece of legislation that is not good for the American \npeople.\n  The bankrupt companies--of course, I am concerned these companies \nwent bankrupt. For example, U.S. Gypsum is\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\nout of bankruptcy. It has made a settlement. It has settled with all \nthe claimants for under $1 billion. But it is interesting. They have \nsaid, coming out of bankruptcy and their settlement, if this \nlegislation passes, they will have to contribute $3 billion to this \nfund. I would rather U.S. Gypsum contributed money to any trust fund \nthan all these many companies I talked about, three of whom have been \nin business for many years and have said they are going to go into \nbankruptcy.\n  I believe, as far as saying some unions favor this legislation, there \nare a few--very few, such as the United Auto Workers. I have a letter, \nwhich I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record, from the AFL-\nCIO. They oppose this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to outline the AFL-CIO's \n     concerns about the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act \n     of 2005 (S. 852), legislation that will have a direct impact \n     on millions of workers exposed to asbestos.\n       On May 24, 2005 we wrote to Senators to express our view \n     that S. 852 contained important deficiencies that would deny \n     fair and timely compensation to tens of thousands of asbestos \n     victims. With the bill headed to the floor, perhaps as early \n     as next week, I am writing to restate these objections with \n     the hope that they will be addressed before the Senate \n     completes action on the bill. Though several AFL-CIO \n     affiliates have recently expressed support for the bill, a \n     majority continue to feel that unless these issues are \n     satisfactorily resolved, the asbestos trust fund will fall \n     short of its promise to fairly compensate the victims of this \n     devastating disease.\n       First, we remain deeply dismayed about the bill's start-up \n     provisions, where the interests of defendants who are \n     responsible for the disease crisis have become paramount and \n     the needs of victims have become a secondary consideration. \n     Addressing the so-called ``leakage'' to the tort system has \n     become more important than ensuring just compensation for \n     those who are sick.\n       As currently amended, S. 852 places the burdens and risks \n     of the fund's start-up squarely on the shoulders of those who \n     are sick. If S. 852 becomes law, by any realistic estimate it \n     will take more than a year--and very possibly several years--\n     to put in place the procedures, and retain and train the \n     personnel necessary to properly administer not only the new \n     claims procedure, but also the complex mechanism established \n     under the bill for assessing and collecting contributions \n     from defendants and insurers. As recent experience has amply \n     demonstrated, the infrastructure necessary to properly \n     operate a major new program of this magnitude simply cannot \n     be created overnight. Under S. 852, however, the ability of \n     asbestos victims to obtain compensation through the current \n     system is cut off immediately upon enactment. Not only are \n     provisions eliminating access to the courts for asbestos \n     victims effective as soon as the bill becomes law, the bill \n     also provides for immediate shutdown of the so-called \n     ``524(g)'' bankruptcy trusts established by companies like \n     Halliburton and Johns Manville to pay asbestos claims--trusts \n     that are currently providing compensation to tens of \n     thousands of asbestos victims per year, using funds \n     specifically set aside in bankruptcy proceedings expressly \n     for the purpose of paying asbestos claims.\n       The bill attempts to provide a mechanism through which \n     terminally ill claimants will be able to obtain payments \n     during the period before the new fund is fully operational, \n     but all other claimants, no matter how serious their illness \n     or disability, can be left without a remedy for an indefinite \n     period of time. If the fund is still not operational after 24 \n     months, the bill ostensibly gives those claimants the right \n     to pursue their claims in court. But that right is in fact \n     illusory, since if and when the fund does become operational \n     the right to proceed in court will again be extinguished, \n     making it impractical for claimants to pursue that option. \n     And because the bankruptcy trusts are eliminated as of \n     enactment, that remedy will remain unavailable. Thus, the \n     practical effect of the bill will be to leave non-exigent \n     claimants with nowhere to go to obtain compensation for their \n     illness until such time as the fund is able to process their \n     claims, no matter how long that takes. Using CBO estimates, \n     by 2008 the number of sick claimants in this situation could \n     number more than 110,000.\n       In our view, it is unfair to leave victims with serious \n     illnesses without any remedy in this manner. The uncertainty \n     associated with the start-up of the fund should be borne by \n     those responsible for the asbestos disease crisis--the \n     defendant companies--not asbestos disease victims. At a \n     minimum, the bill should permit the asbestos bankruptcy \n     trusts to remain in place to pay all impaired claimants who \n     qualify under those trusts, until the national trust fund is \n     fully operational.\n       Second, S. 852 unfairly restricts the legal rights of \n     victims with silica disease. It establishes medical criteria \n     for lawsuits by individuals who have both asbestos-related \n     disease and silica-related disease, which will bar many of \n     them from seeking compensation for their silica-related \n     injury. The only recourse for victims of both diseases will \n     be to seek compensation for their asbestos disease from the \n     asbestos fund--which in most cases will be limited to $25,000 \n     for Level II ``mixed disease.'' This legislation should not \n     be a tort reform bill for silica disease. All victims with \n     silica-related disease, including those who also have \n     asbestos disease, should have the right to seek redress in \n     the courts for their silica injury, with any damages limited \n     to the injury attributable to their silica exposure.\n       Third, the sunset provisions of the bill are also \n     problematic and unclear. While the bill provides for a return \n     to the tort system in the event the trust fund has \n     insufficient funds, as drafted the bill does not provide for \n     an orderly process for anticipating and working to correct \n     identified problems before reaching the point where the fund \n     would be forced to shut down. In addition, in the event of \n     reversion, some claimants would be barred from returning to \n     court due to problems with provisions on post-sunset statute \n     of limitations and language limiting the legal venue where \n     claims may be brought. A provision added at mark-up that \n     relieves insurers of their guaranteed funding obligation \n     creates another major problem. This provision undermines the \n     funding formula, borrowing authority, and sunset \n     determination and may leave the fund with a shortfall it \n     cannot make up.\n       Fourth, the bill completely cancels legal and otherwise \n     binding settlements unless (a) they are signed by the \n     individual plaintiff and the ``settling defendant'' before \n     the enactment date and\n       (b) within 30 days after enactment, all parties complete \n     all required performance, except making payments. Because \n     nothing requires the ``settling defendant'' to sign the \n     agreement or to complete performance, this permits defendants \n     to void their commitments. These settlements are legal \n     commitments by defendants to provide compensation, in \n     exchange for which plaintiffs have given up their legal \n     rights. There is no justification for enabling defendants to \n     abrogate those agreements, cancel payments to victims, many \n     of whom have been waiting for years, and require the \n     claimants to go back to square one and start a whole new \n     process in the fund.\n       Fifth, we remain deeply concerned about the bill's overly \n     broad definition of an asbestos claim. S. 852 is intended to \n     provide an alternative remedy for personal injury claims \n     related to asbestos, and preempts these claims from being \n     pursued in the tort system. But rather than limit the bill's \n     application to such claims, the bill defines asbestos claim \n     very broadly, to include virtually any civil action that is \n     directly or indirectly related to the health effects of \n     exposure to asbestos, and then includes a list of the \n     specific types of claims that are excluded. This overly broad \n     definition of asbestos claim will have the unintended effect \n     of preempting many civil actions related to asbestos that \n     have nothing to do with personal injury claims. The \n     definition of asbestos claim should be clear and limited to \n     personal injury claims, which is the only type of claim for \n     which the Fund will be providing compensation.\n       Sixth, while we support limits on attorneys fees, we \n     believe that the hard 5 percent cap for all claims may not be \n     sufficient for claimants with complex cases to obtain \n     adequate legal representation, and that a different type of \n     cap/fee limitation is needed for the Level I claims that do \n     not have a monetary award. The AFL-CIO believes that the fee \n     limitation should be applied to claims involving monetary \n     awards and that the Administrator should be given the \n     discretion to increase the attorneys' fee limit if experience \n     shows that it is impeding the ability of claimants to secure \n     compensation under the Act.\n       In addition to these long-standing issues, in the past \n     several months new important information about potential \n     claims and costs has become available from the Manville Trust \n     and others that suggests that future mesothelioma cases, as \n     well as the number of pending claims, maybe significantly \n     higher than previously estimated. The Congressional Budget \n     Office should conduct a full review of this new information \n     so the Senate can have the most up-to-date cost analysis as \n     it considers this legislation.\n       Throughout the legislative process, our goal has been to \n     arrive at a bill that provides fair and timely compensation \n     to victims through an efficient and workable process. We \n     acknowledge that important improvements to S. 852 have been \n     made, but more needs to be done before the bill can fulfill \n     its promise to provide fair and timely compensation to the \n     victims of asbestos disease.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John J. Sweeney,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the final point I would like to say, through \nthe Chair to the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, is I didn't mention \nLIHEAP in my statement. I didn't mention it at all, although it is \nsomething we need to take up, but for reasons I was discussing with \nSenator Frist, I decided not to do that.\n  The other issues I meant to bring up but I didn't mention LIHEAP. \nThat\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\ndidn't come from my mouth. LIHEAP is something we are obligated to do \nand do it as soon as we can. There has been a commitment made by the \nmajority leader and me to a Senator from the majority that we would do \nsomething about that. But I didn't mention LIHEAP.\n  I know the Senator spent a lot of time on this. One of his friends, a \nclassmate--I don't know what the relationship is, but it goes back many \ndecades--Judge Becker, they spent a lot of time on this. I know this \nlegislation means a lot to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  But just because this legislation means a lot to him doesn't mean I \nhave to support it.\n  As much as I think of the Senator from Pennsylvania, which is a lot--\nI have had admiration for him and told him on many occasions. I am one \nof the few people who read his book, and I enjoyed reading his book. If \nI hurt the Senator's feelings--maybe that is the wrong word--I \napologize.\n  Certainly, the Senator from Vermont and I know each other very well. \nI would never, ever intentionally do anything to embarrass or hurt his \nfeelings. I say, through the Chair to my friend from Vermont, I don't \nlike this legislation. It is bad, and I am going to do everything I can \nto stop this bill from going through. If I can't do it, then I am a big \nguy, and I understand a lot of times you don't win around here. But \nthat doesn't take away my obligation of doing the very best I can to \ntalk about this legislation. I am going to continue doing that. I don't \nlike this legislation for the reasons set forth.\n  A final thing I would like to say is that I have given these \nestimates as to what is wrong with the bill from a dollar perspective. \nThere are parts that I have read. I think I am right, and I think time \nwill prove, without question, that $140 billion is wrong, no matter if \nSenator Frist or Senator Daschle, or whoever, agreed to this amount. \nWhere the number came from, I don't know, but it certainly is not \nenough. Looking back a couple years ago when Senator Daschle was \ninvolved in this issue, maybe he at that time thought it was the right \namount. I have disagreed, and I disagree now.\n  Again, so the record is clear, I don't mean to violate rule XIX, but \nI am going to continue pushing for reform. When legislation such as \nthis requires 13 companies to spend $144.5 million on lobbying \nactivities, that is too much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, very briefly, my feelings are not hurt. \nMy feelings are an irrelevancy. If they were relevant, they still have \nnot been hurt. My concern is for the feelings of the people who have \nbeen victimized by asbestos and have no one from which to collect.\n  I don't make any point about having done a lot of work on this bill. \nI don't do piecework around here. I do work on a lot of bills. I do not \npersonalize it at all. My thrust is strictly on the merits, on a way to \nfairly compensate victims, on a way to stop more companies from going \ninto bankruptcy, on a way to stop the hemorrhaging of job losses, and a \nway to stimulate the economy. I make the submission of this bill \nstrictly on the merits.\n  I compliment Senator Leahy on what he has done on this bill, as well \nas his staff, in coming together and structuring the bill, again, in \nmeeting after meeting and in discussion after discussion. What we asked \nour colleagues to do is to take a look at the merits. Don't be \nconcerned about the work that we put into it, don't be concerned about \nour feelings; be concerned about the problem and about our suggested \nsolution and about our openness to make changes. If anybody has \namendments, we will consider them. If somebody has a better bill, we \nwill consider that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, both the distinguished senior Senator from \nPennsylvania and I have been tied up much of today in a matter \ninvolving wiretapping of Americans and other issues. We will be going \nback to that. I know the Senator from Pennsylvania is returning to the \ncommittee.\n  I am going to ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois be \nable to have the floor for up to 30 minutes following me.\n  Before I make that request, if I may have the attention of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania or the Senator from Tennessee, I am going to \nmake the request that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin--we are all \nat the same hearing--that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, who \nhas a position different to that of mine and the Senator from \nPennsylvania, that he be recognized for up to 30 minutes once I \ncomplete my comments, unless, of course, either of the leaders object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a statement to make following the \nremarks of Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that after the \ndistinguished Republican leader, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there has been some question about--and I \nthink I am fortunate--comments suggesting motivation of veterans who \nsupport this legislation. A lot of veterans support this legislation. A \nlot of veterans have been badly damaged by exposure to asbestos, and \nthey have no way of seeking compensation except in this legislation.\n  A lot of labor unions feel the same way. These are not the so-called \nK Street lobbyists, these are not special interests; these are people \nwho care about those they represent, the veterans they represent, the \nworkers they represent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these letters of recommendations be \nprinted in the Record, and I will name them:\n  A letter from the Military Order of the Purple Heart, another signed \nby the Air Force Sergeant Association, American Ex-Prisoners of War, \nBlinded American Veterans Foundation, Blinded Veterans Association, \nFleet Reserve Association, Jewish War Veterans of the USA, Marine Corps \nLeague--my son is a former marine--Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, National Association of Black Veterans, Noncommissioned \nOfficers Association, National Association of Uniformed Services, \nNational Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, Retired \nEnlisted Association, Veterans of the Vietnam War, Inc., Veterans of \nForeign Wars of the United States, Women in Military Service for \nAmerica, Memorial Foundation, Inc., the U.S. Submarine Veterans, Inc., \nLockwood Internet Base, U.S. Submarine Veterans of World War II, U.S. \nSubmarine Veterans Base Rhode Island, U.S. Submarine Veterans World War \nII Thames River Chapter, U.S. Submarine Veterans World War II Central \nConnecticut Chapter, the UAW, the Heat & Frost Insulators & Asbestos \nWorkers International, the International Union of Painters and Allied \nTrades, the Governors of Alaska, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, \nMissouri, Montana, Ohio, Utah, and Vermont, and the National Federation \nof Independent Business, NFIB. Those are among some of those.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            International Union of\n\n\n                                   Painters and Allied Trades,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 17, 2005.\n     Re: S. 852, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act \n         of 2005 (FAIR Act)''\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: I write you today in \n     regard to S. 852, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2005 (FAlR Act)''. On behalf of 140,000 \n     families represented by the International Union of Painters \n     and Allied Trades, IUPAT, I would like to express our strong \n     support for S. 852 in its current form and your continued \n     efforts toward a bipartisan bill that will ensure true, just \n     and fair compensation to current and future victims of \n     asbestos exposure.\n       We appreciate all efforts to incorporate a number of key \n     provisions and safeguards that have been advocated on behalf \n     of workers who have been harmed by exposure to asbestos and \n     who have been adversely affecred by a current asbestos \n     compensation system that is slow, costly, unfair and \n     arbitrary. However, the IUPAT remains concerned\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\n     about potentially hostile amendments that may be offered on \n     the Senate or House floor that would effectively undermine \n     key provisions of the bill dealing with funding, medical \n     criteria, awards, and other issues. We will continue to urge \n     you, along with other Senate and House members, to reject any \n     such amendments. Should any amendments be adopted that would \n     undercut the progress made on this complex issue the IUPAT \n     will have no other choice but to withdraw our support for the \n     bill.\n       We feel the trust fund model is the best solution for \n     addressing the asbestos comopensation crisis workers and \n     business currently face. After years of numerous stakeholder \n     meetings, we are confident that our members' and all affected \n     workers' interests are best protected by key provisions in \n     your legislation as presently drafted. Of particular interest \n     to us are provisions contained within your legislation that \n     ensures fair compensation to asbestos victims with \n     mesothelioma, lung cancer, or those victims who have \n     impairment from asbesotosis or asbestos exposure that \n     includes objective medical evidence or markers of asbestos \n     exposure that includes CT scan review; no delay for victims' \n     access to the tort system in state or federal court if the \n     trust fund becomes insolvent; protection for victims from \n     insurance subrogation; a ban of asbestos in the United \n     States; a medical screening program for high risk workers; \n     and enforcement provisions to prevent needless exposure to \n     asbestos by uninformed and unsuspecting workers.\n       It is our hope that the International Union of Painters and \n     Allied Trades' support for S. 852, along with other labor \n     organizations, businesses, employer associations, and \n     victims' groups, will allow this bipartisan bill to receive \n     strong backing in the Senate on final passage and will \n     therefore assure that the Senate passed bill with the \n     aforementioned key provisions is accepted and passed by the \n     House of Representatives.\n       Thank you for your continued efforts in dealing with this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely and fraternally,\n                                                James A. Williams,\n     General President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  October 7, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid: On \n     July 18, the National Governors' Association approved a \n     revised policy on Asbestos Litigation Reform. This policy \n     calls for legislative action to address this continuing \n     problem affecting states in a variety of ways.\n       America faces a crisis from asbestos litigation that \n     continues to take its toll on the sick, their families, and \n     our economy. Today there are hundreds of thousands of \n     asbestos claims in the courts with tens of thousands of new \n     claims filed each year. This is a unique legal situation that \n     requires congressional action to alleviate this logjam of \n     cases.\n       In addition to those who have become sick from asbestos \n     exposure, the impact of the claims also hurts employees, \n     retirees, shareholders, and customers of defendant companies, \n     whose jobs and savings are jeopardized or lost. Our national \n     economy also is hurt in the areas of jobs, pensions, stock \n     prices, tax revenues, and insurance costs. We believe that \n     this is truly a national crisis. Without a solution, more \n     companies will be forced into bankruptcy, delaying and \n     reducing resources available to pay those who are now sick or \n     may become sick in the future.\n       We believe that it is time for Congress to respond to the \n     Supreme Court's repeated calls for a legislation solution to \n     this crisis. Congressional enactment of legislation is \n     imperative to ensure that those ill from exposure to \n     asbestos-containing products and their facilities are fairly \n     compensated and that defendant companies are financially \n     secure so that they can pay present and future claims.\n       We understand S. 852, the ``Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution Act of 2005,'' was voted out of the Judiciary \n     Committee with a bipartisan 13-5 majority and is ready for \n     action on the Senate floor. We urge you to schedule debate on \n     this critical legislation as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governor Frank H.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business, I am writing \n     to express our support for S. 852, ``The Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005.'' The FAIR Act will \n     help protect innocent small-business owners from the asbestos \n     litigation crisis that now threatens their business.\n       Asbestos lawsuits against small businesses are on the rise. \n     After years of suing large corporations for multi-million \n     dollar damage awards, ``traditional'' asbestos manufacturers \n     and defendants are mostly bankrupt. As a result, asbestos \n     litigation now targets companies far removed from any \n     potential wrongdoing, including small businesses. This \n     relatively untapped pool of defendants is an attractive \n     target for trial lawyers since small-business owners and \n     their insurers can be forced to pay millions of dollars in \n     damages. Horrifying for a small-business owner is the \n     prospect that they can be hauled into court without having \n     any relationship to asbestos or the plaintiff. Many small \n     businesses are forced to settle because they don't have the \n     money or time to be away from their businesses. Not only do \n     they face the stigma of having to settle, and the loss of \n     time and money, but they will likely also experience higher \n     insurance rates.\n       By creating an alternative compensation system to resolve \n     asbestos claims, S. 852 will fix a badly broken system that \n     is not working and, in the process, compensate victims \n     faster. In addition to lawsuit relief, the legislation \n     relieves small businesses with either low or no asbestos \n     liability from having to pay into the compensation fund. No \n     business that meets the Small Business Administration \n     description of a small business can be required to pay a \n     penny into the fund. Nor will any small business that has \n     carried less than $1 million in asbestos expenditures before \n     December 31, 2002 have to pay into the fund.\n       This legislation will help prevent small businesses from \n     having to spend the time and money to defend themselves in \n     asbestos lawsuits. It takes a significant step towards fixing \n     part of our litigation crisis that hurts business, big and \n     small, and ultimately keeps the victim from receiving \n     compensation.\n       Thank you for your support of small business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n     Public Policy and Political.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Military Order of the\n\n\n                                                 Purple Heart,\n\n                               Springfield, VA, December 13, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of The Military Order of the \n     Purple Heart (MOPH), I ask you to join our organization and \n     roughly a dozen other national veteran service organizations \n     and support passage of S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act.\n       Years after serving in the military, many veterans are now \n     discovering they suffer from terrible diseases related to the \n     asbestos they were exposed to during their time in the U.S. \n     military. The government used asbestos materials in a number \n     of facilities and crafts, affecting the health of the men and \n     women serving before and after the Second World War.\n       The FAIR Act offers sick veterans a way to receive the \n     compensation they deserve. Right now, it is difficult for \n     veterans to turn to the courts for help with their asbestos-\n     related medical costs. Veterans are barred by law from suing \n     their employer (the federal government) for compensation. But \n     by taking asbestos claims out of the court system, the FAIR \n     Act will ensure veterans will have a speedy and just avenue \n     for receiving compensation.\n       Senator Bill Frist, with bipartisan support; recently \n     asserted that he will make the FAIR Act a top priority for \n     the Senate in January. He clearly understands that the FAIR \n     Act is the only viable solution for sick veterans. Passage of \n     this bill would provide immediate and ample aid to veterans \n     as well as other victims of asbestos exposure.\n       Please vote yes on the FAIR Act and help relieve the \n     suffering and financial burden of our veterans.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 James D. Randles,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 31, 2006.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: Veterans across the country who are \n     afflicted with asbestos-related diseases would at last get \n     compensation and relief under the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \n     Resolution (FAIR) Act. But according to a number recent media \n     reports, you have labelled the FAIR Act as a bill that caters \n     to special interests and have informed Majority Leader Frist \n     in writing that you will oppose this critical legislation. In \n     all frankness, your words and actions are extremely \n     disappointing to veterans across this nation--surely you do \n     not consider sick veterans to be a ``special interest''?\n       The FAIR Act will provide proper compensation to sick men \n     and women who volunteered to fight for our country--\n     compensation they simply can't get under the current system. \n     The military used asbestos throughout its facilities, bases, \n     and ships during and after World War II, and countless \n     veterans were exposed to this deadly material. But because \n     the U.S. government has asserted sovereign immunity, these \n     sick veterans are unble to seek compensation from the \n     government through the courts.\n       The FAIR Act's victims' trust fund would open a door for \n     veterans that has been closed for years.\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\n       We are disappointed that you are trying to keep that door \n     closed and stop veterans from receiving the compensation they \n     deserve. Sick veterans--and indeed, all victims--deserve \n     better than political gamesmanship on this critical issue. We \n     urge you not to stand in the way of full Senate consideration \n     of this vital legislation.\n       The FAIR Act is more than overdue. The Senate has been \n     debating these reforms for years. Sick victims, including \n     sick veterans, shouldn't be forced to wait for help any \n     longer.\n           Sincerely,\n       Air Force Sergeant Association.\n       American Ex-Prisoners of War\n       Blinded American Veterans Foundation.\n       Blinded Veterans Association.\n       Fleet Reserve Association.\n       Jewish War Veterans of the USA.\n       Marine Corps League.\n       Military Officers Association of America.\n       Military Order of the Purple Heart.\n       National Association of Black Veterans.\n       Non Commissioned Officers Association.\n       National Association of Uniformed Services.\n       National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs\n       Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n       Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.\n       Tbe Retired Enlisted Association.\n       Veterans of the Vietnam War, Inc.\n       Veterans of Foreign Wars of the US.\n       Women in Military Service for America.\n       Memorial Foundation, Inc.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans, Inc.\n       U.S. Submarine Veteran, Inc Lockwood Internet Base.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans of World War II.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans Base Rhode Island.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans World War II Thames River Chapter.\n       U.S. Submarine Veterans World War II Central Connecticut \n     Chapter.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: Next week the Senate is scheduled to take up \n     the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005 \n     (S. 852), sponsored by Senators Specter and Leahy. The UAW \n     strongly supports this legislation. We urge you to support \n     this critically important legislation, and to support cloture \n     both on the motion to proceed and on the bill itself.\n       The UAW supports S. 852 because we are firmly convinced it \n     would be far superior to the current tort system in \n     compensating the victims of asbestos-related diseases. Under \n     the existing tort system, many victims receive little or no \n     compensation because those responsible for the asbestos \n     exposure are bankrupt, immune from liability or can't be \n     identified. Even when victims do receive some award, the \n     litigation takes far too long, and the amounts are highly \n     unpredictable. Far too much money is wasted on attorney fees \n     and other litigation costs, or dispersed to individuals who \n     are not impaired.\n       The Specter-Leahy bill would solve these problems by \n     establishing a $140 billion federal trust fund to compensate \n     the victims of asbestos-related diseases through a stream-\n     lined, no-fault administrative system. This system will \n     provide much speedier compensation to victims according to a \n     predictable schedule of payments for specified disease levels \n     that focuses compensation on those who have the most serious \n     impairments. It will also guarantee that victims can receive \n     adequate compensation, regardless of whether those \n     responsible for the asbestos exposure are bankrupt or \n     otherwise immune from liability.\n       The UAW strongly supports the provision in the Specter-\n     Leahy bill that does not permit any subrogation against \n     worker compensation or health care payments received by \n     asbestos victims. We believe this provision is essential to \n     ensure that victims receive adequate compensation, and do not \n     have their awards largely offset by other payments. We \n     strongly urge you to oppose any amendment that would \n     undermine victims' compensation by allowing subrogation.\n       The UAW also urges you to reject any other amendments that \n     would reduce or restrict eligibility for compensation for the \n     victims of asbestos-related diseases. This includes any \n     amendments that would strike medical monitoring or eliminate \n     Level VI awards. \n       The UAW supports the provisions in S. 852 that require \n     broad sections of the business and insurance industries to \n     make contributions to finance the $140 billion federal trust \n     fund. We believe this broad-based, predictable financing \n     mechanism is vastly preferable to the current tort system, \n     which has already driven many companies into bankruptcy, and \n     is threatening the economic health of other companies that \n     used products containing asbestos, including the major auto \n     manufacturers. Continuation of the existing tort system will \n     inevitably lead to more bankruptcies, resulting in more lost \n     jobs and wage and benefit cut backs for workers and retirees. \n     However, to ensure that the financing mechanism in S. 852 \n     remains equitable and workable, the UAW believes it is \n     essential that the Senate reject any amendments that would \n     severely narrow or cap the financing base and jeopardize the \n     guarantee that $140 billion will be made available to \n     compensate asbestos victims.\n       The UAW recognizes that a number of specific concerns have \n     been raised by other labor organizations about various \n     provisions in S. 852. We are continuing to work for \n     improvements in the legislation, and are hopeful that \n     Senators Specter and Leahy will largely address these \n     concerns in a manager's amendment.\n       However, the UAW does not agree with those who have taken \n     exception to the 5 percent cap on attorney fees for monetary \n     claimants. This cap ensures that asbestos victims will be \n     adequately compensated, and not see their awards severely \n     reduced by exorbitant attorney fees. This cap will not impede \n     the ability of claimants to get adequate legal \n     representation. Because S. 852 establishes a non-adversarial, \n     no-fault administrative system, the difficulties and costs \n     involved in bringing asbestos claims will be greatly reduced. \n     Indeed, much of the work can be done by paralegals. We also \n     believe that labor unions and other groups can help provide \n     free or lower cost representation for asbestos victims by \n     hiring staff attorneys and other professionals to process the \n     claims under the no-fault administrative system. Through such \n     mechanisms, asbestos victims can receive competent \n     representation with little or no attorney fees being deducted \n     from their awards.\n       Finally, the UAW recognizes that questions have been raised \n     about the projections for asbestos claims and the solvency of \n     the trust fund. We would note that most stakeholders agreed \n     to $140 billion in financing early last year. Although all of \n     the projections are subject to some element of uncertainty, \n     the UAW believes that the $140 billion in financing is \n     sufficient to enable the trust fund to compensate asbestos \n     victims for a lengthy period of time. It is also important to \n     remember that S. 852 provides for reversion of asbestos \n     claims to the tort system in the event the federal trust fund \n     should ever have insufficient funds to pay all claims. While \n     we hope these reversion provisions will never be triggered, \n     they do provide assurance that victims will always have some \n     recourse for seeking compensation.\n       It is easy for critics to point out shortcomings in S. 852. \n     The UAW submits, however, that it is abundantly clear the \n     asbestos compensation system established by the Specter-Leahy \n     bill would be far preferable to the existing tort system. It \n     would do a much better job of providing prompt, equitable \n     compensation to asbestos victims. And it would finance this \n     compensation through a rationale system that does not lead to \n     bankruptcies that threaten the jobs, wages and benefits of \n     thousands of workers. \n       For all of these reasons, the UAW strongly supports the \n     FAIR Act, S. 852. We urge you to vote for this legislation, \n     and to support efforts to invoke cloture on the motion to \n     proceed and on the bill itself.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this vital issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Association of Heat & Frost Insulators & \n           Asbestos Workers,\n                                     Lanham, MD, February 6, 2006.\n       Dear Senator, We strongly support the courageous and bi-\n     partisan work of Senator Arlen Specter (R.) and Senator \n     Patrick Leahy (D.), co-sponsors of the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution (FAIR) Act of 2005 (S. 852) which comes to \n     the Senate Floor this week.\n       We support the Bill as presently drafted. We ask that you \n     support the Bill as well.\n       Our U.S. Supreme Court has held that federal legislation is \n     necessary to solve the asbestos compensation crisis--and we \n     agree. Currently, only 42 cents of every dollar spent in this \n     broken system goes to victims, their widows and kids.\n       I recently wrote our membership across the country to \n     advise them of our support for this Bi1l, and to urge them to \n     contact you in support of S. 852. I advised our membership \n     that this Bill is not perfect. But nothing ever is when \n     problems of this magnitude are addressed.\n       We believe S. 852 offers the best hope of providing fair \n     and equitable compensation on a national basis for those who \n     have suffered, or will suffer from the devastating effects of \n     asbestos exposure in decades to come.\n       We urge you to reject amendments of special interest groups \n     on either side of the issue that would change the core \n     provisions of the Bill.\n       Such amendments can only be hostile to the interests of \n     fundamental fairness and equity. We have promised our \n     membership that we would fight vigorously to oppose any \n     change that would make this Bill unfair or inequitable.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  James A.

These two courageous Senators have worked \n     tirelessly during the last three years--to craft changes to \n     the Bill after listening to reasonable suggestions from \n     Labor, Business and Insurance negotiators.\n       Special interest groups on both sides of the issue have \n     tried to derail their good work. But Senators Specter and \n     Leahy have stood tall in search of an equitable legislative \n     solution.\n       This office has actively participated in the negotiating \n     process of this Bill over the last three years: Your \n     International has been actively involved in extended and \n     complicated negotiations to bring about this legislative \n     solution. Our U.S. Supreme Court has held that legislation is \n     necessary to solve the asbestos compensation crisis--and we \n     agree.\n       Let us begin by stating that this Bill is not perfect. \n     Nothing ever is. For the last 10-20 years the current \n     asbestos compensation system has produced inequitable and \n     unfair results. Tens of billions of dollars have gone to \n     people who are not sick. This is wrong. The current system is \n     broken, notwithstanding what special interest groups may \n     claim. We believe this Bill offers the best hope of providing \n     equitable compensation while expediting the compensation and \n     review process on a national basis, regardless of where you \n     live, or who your attorney might be.\n       Over 300,000 pending or current asbestos claims cry out for \n     a fair legislative solution from Congress: Currently it is \n     estimated that there are more than 300,000 pending asbestos-\n     related claims. In a recent study by RAND, it was determined \n     that only $0.42 (42 cents) of every dollar spent on \n     litigation is awarded to the actual victims, their widows and \n     kids. A majority of the funds is paid to transaction costs, \n     including lawyers' fees for corporations and claimants.\n       $140,000,000,000 ($140 Billion) trust fund for victims of \n     asbestos induced mesothelioma, lung cancer aud asbestosis \n     under a no-fault system with set awards based on severity of \n     disease: This Bill would establish a $140 billion Trust Fund \n     to compensate victims who are truly sick from asbestos \n     exposure under a no-fault compensation system administered by \n     the Department of Labor. Objective medical criteria that will \n     rule in asbestos induced disease, and will rule out disease \n     not caused by asbestos exposure has been negotiated and \n     approved by us and medical experts we have retained. This \n     legislation will offer the following expedited settlements: \n       Mesothehoma: $1,100,000 per case: Lung Cancer with \n     Asbestosis, $600,000-975,000 per case, Lung Cancer with \n     Asbestos Pleural Markers, $300,000-725,000 per case, \n     Disabling Asbestosis (not cancerous), $850,000 per case, \n     Asbestosis with Some Impairment, $100,000-400,000 per case.\n       Attorneys' fees have been limited to 5 percent under the \n     legislation. It is to be expected that lawyers who have \n     received tens of millions of dollars in asbestos fees might \n     voice some objection to the Bill. Insurance companies who \n     will have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars into the \n     Trust are likewise objecting to this courageous attempt by \n     Senators Specter and Leahy to solve the asbestos compensation \n     crisis.\n       The Pipefitters, Painters and United Auto Workers have \n     joined with us: The leadership of the Plumbers and \n     Pipefitters (the UA), the Painters (IUPAT) and the United \n     Auto Workers (UAW), have joined with us in supporting this \n     Asbestos Bill, S. 852. We believe the leadership of other \n     trade unions will come to join us in the weeks ahead in \n     support of this Bill.\n       Funding: We are aware of those who, in good faith, question \n     whether $140,000,000,000 ($140 Billion) will be sufficient to \n     fund the Trust to compensate all American victims of asbestos \n     induced cancer and asbestosis.We share their good faith \n     concern.\n       But there have been too many bankruptcies as a result of \n     the current asbestos litigation crisis. If funding mandated \n     under the Bill proves insufficient, the Bill provides that \n     individuals may return to the court system and pursue a \n     lawsuit in their State or Federal Court before a jury of \n     their peers. This was a hard fought and fair compromise.\n       Let me close by saying that this International Union \n     remains deeply committed to supporting a meaningful, \n     comprehensive solution to our national asbestos litigation \n     crisis. Be assured if we become aware of changes or \n     amendments to this Bill that will be to the detriment of \n     workers and their families, we will fight them, and will not \n     hesitate to change our position if needed.\n       We urge you to contact your Senators to gain their full \n     support for this legislation. Attached is a complete listing \n     of Senators and their contact information for your \n     convenience.\n           Fraternally yours,\n     James A. Grogan,\n                                                General President.\n     Terry Lynch,\n                                               Political Director.\n     James P. McCourt,\n                                      General Secretary-Treasurer.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter, who \nis chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein, and others \nin urging my colleagues to move to this bipartisan bill.\n  Speaking of asbestos-related diseases, it is time for us to solve \nthis dire situation. Victims have been waiting long enough for a \ncomprehensive national solution. We have looked at this. The Senator \nfrom Nevada spoke of those who have suffered from silicosis. If we are \ngoing to talk about families, my grandfather, Patrick J. Leahy, a \nstonecutter in Barre, VT, died of silicosis of the lungs long before I \nwas born. I never got to know my grandfather. My other grandfather, \nPietro Zambon, immigrated to this country from Italy. He died of the \nsame disease. We are not neglectful in that. We are well aware of it. \nWe have designed this bill in such a way that those victims are not \nshut out.\n  This legislation is a product of years of difficult, conscientious \nnegotiation. Built on what was done last Congress under former Chairman \nOrrin Hatch, we have crafted a fair and efficient plan that is going to \nensure adequate compensation of thousands of victims of exposure, but \nit also gives due consideration to the businesses that should and will \nprovide that compensation.\n  Asbestos has wreaked havoc on the lives of many, but it has also \noverwhelmed our Nation's court systems as it tries to compensate them.\n  We can talk about who gives and who doesn't. The fact of the matter \nis, the victims are the ones we should be most concerned about, and \nmany of the victims--thousands of the victims in this country will get \nnothing unless this bill passes.\n  Senator Specter rightly calls this one of the most complex issues we \nhave ever tackled. Look around the Chamber of the Senate. Of those who \nare here, I have been here the longest. Actually, only six Members of \nthe current Senate have been here longer than I. I have not seen in \nthat 31 years anything more complex.\n  Does that mean this is the bill I would have written? No. And it is \nnot the bill Senator Specter would have written. It is a bill, though, \nthat had to bring enough people together to pass. It should not \nsurprise anyone to hear the interested groups, including labor, some of \nthe businesses contributing to the trust fund, and their insurers, and \nthe trial bar are each less than pleased with one part or the other. \nBut that is the essence of legislative compromise, something I have \nlearned in three decades.\n  We have kept the ultimate goal of fair compensation to the victims as \nthe lodestar of our efforts. We have all had to make compromises on a \nvariety of subsidiary issues to get this far, but we have achieved a \nsignificant and needed step toward a more efficient and more equitable \nmethod to compensate these victims. Right now, the fact is that only 42 \ncents out of every dollar spent on the burgeoning dockets of litigation \nin this area actually goes to the victims. That is a national disgrace. \nWe can and must do better for all involved in this crisis. America can \ndo better.\n\n  These victims need our help, and they need it now. This is, after \nall, one of the most lethal substances ever to be widely used in the \nworkplace. Between 1940, when I was born, and 1980, more than 27.5 \nmillion workers were exposed to asbestos, and nearly 19 million of them \nhad high levels of exposure over long periods of time. We know of some \npeople who suffer from this illness because they washed the clothes of \ntheir loved ones who worked in these areas. They have been ravaged.\n  The economic harm caused by this, and the resulting bankruptcies, are \na different kind of tragedy for everybody--for the workers and \nretirees, for shareholders, but also for the families who built these \ncompanies. In my home State of Vermont, the Rutland Fire and Clay \nCompany is among the more than 70 companies that have declared \nbankruptcy due to asbestos liabilities. Do you think those victims are \ngoing to recover anything without this legislation?\n  The late Chief Justice Rehnquist declared the elephantine mass of \ncases cries out for a legislative solution. In additional opinions \nwritten by Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court has repeatedly called on \nCongress to act because ``a nationwide administrative claims processing \nregime would provide the most secure, fair, and efficient means of \ncompensating victims.''\n  I agree. Our committee chairman agrees. The Judiciary Committee \nmembers on both sides of the aisle agree, and we hope others in the \nSenate will agree.\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\n  I am worried when I hear veterans being criticized for supporting \nthis. They are brave. They are concerned that they have been badly \ninjured, and they know this legislation will help them. Why shouldn't \nthey support it? These brave veterans know they are not going to get \nany help otherwise.\n  Does business support it? The 600,000 members of the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses do, as well as hundreds of larger \ncompanies which are going to have to contribute.\n  Senator Specter has spoken of this, but think what we do in our bill. \nIt is a distinct improvement over previous bills. We provide higher \ncompensation awards for victims, with $1.1 million awards for victims \nof mesothelioma, $300,000 to $1.1 million to lung cancer victims, \n$200,000 for victims of other cancers caused by asbestos, $100,000 to \n$85,000 for asbestosis, and $25,000 for what we call mixed-disease \ncases, as well as medical monitoring and all the things he spoke of.\n  I am going to speak further on this as we go on. I suspect there will \nbe more talk on it. But I hope Senators will allow this bill to go \nforward, will allow us to have a vote on it. As the Senator from \nPennsylvania noted, we have other major things going on. I have been \ninvolved in that all day. I must admit, though, to the distinguished \nmajority leader, if the Chair will permit me to note, I may have other \nthings going on. We have other things going on in our family at this \nmoment. I hope we are about to enlarge our family at this moment.\n  With that, I hope neither of our leaders will mind, but the senior \nSenator from Vermont is going to go home and hopefully sometime in the \nnext few hours be together with the latest member of the Jackson and \nLeahy family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, to my distinguished colleague, I know \nthings will go well as a new member of the family is about to enter. It \nis a very special time in all of our lives when that happens.\n  I did want to come to the floor to give some perspective to what we \nhave really seen play out over the last hour and a half with regard to \naddressing an issue that is important to the American people in ways \nthey probably do not fully realize. It is the importance of taking up \nand addressing with full debate and amendment on the floor of this body \nthe issue of reforming an asbestos system which is out of control. We \nhave victims of cancer, victims of mesothelioma, victims of asbestosis, \nwho are not being fairly compensated, who are struggling for that last \nbreath before justice and fairness is carried out. That is because of a \nsystem which is broken, a system which has called out for fixing, not \njust in this Congress or the last Congress or the Congress before that \nbut really over the last 15 years.\n  There has been some question on the floor today of why leadership has \nelected to bring this bill to the floor as the first major piece of \nlegislation that really was not unfinished business before our last \nrecess, and the reason is for these victims.\n  Yes, this bill is a jobs issue. It was stated earlier that over \n150,000 people have lost their jobs because of this broken system; that \nover 77 companies have gone bankrupt, which means, yes, loss of those \njobs but also loss of pensions for all the other employees of those \ncompanies. But I have to say that in part because I have had that \nopportunity to take care of mesothelioma patients as a physician and to \noperate on mesothelioma patients. It is a tough operation because you \nknow you cannot cure mesothelioma, you can only treat it and make \nsomeone's life better. The sad thing is, although those victims deserve \nto be compensated and compensated in a timely way--nobody argues that--\njustice is not being realized today.\n\n  It is worth stepping back. We had a wonderful exchange, I believe, \nthrough the Democratic leader--who is opposed to allowing that bill to \ncome to the floor to be fully debated and amended to address this \nsignificant, critical problem facing people today and one which will \nface them in the future--and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \njoined by the ranking member, the Democratic ranking member, who \nbelieve strongly there is time to address this bill and address it now. \nIf we do not address it now--and it is important for our colleagues to \nunderstand--it will not be addressed in this Congress. This is a fairly \nshort period running up to the elections, and we have a lot of work to \ndo. It is either now or never.\n  I say there is a long history to this. It was 15 years ago that Chief \nJustice Rehnquist at the time first called attention to the asbestos \nlitigation crisis. It is a crisis, as I will spell out in a few \nmoments. Today, 15 years later, we are on the cusp. After working a \nbill through committee, passing it out of committee in a bipartisan \nway--strongly supported by the Republican chairman of that committee \nand the Democratic ranking member--it is now time to consider it on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. We are on the cusp of a fair and a just and a \nbipartisan solution.\n  Because of partisan election year politics, it may be, from what we \nheard from the Democratic leader, that an effort under the Democratic \nleadership is underway--we are hearing that this bill may be blocked. \nRemember, what we are debating now is just bringing that bill to the \nfloor, this motion to proceed. What that does is put off relief. It \nputs off to sometime in the future, if we do not even allow that bill \nto come to the floor, it puts off relief for thousands and thousands of \nthose victims who deserve just treatment and fair treatment and \ntreatment for their cancer and treatment for their mesothelioma and \ntreatment for their asbestosis. And we are not going to do it.\n  We are going to bring it to the floor, we are going to debate it, \nopen it to amendment, and fix what people do not like in the bill. But \nto think we have Democrats today who want to object to even bringing it \nto the floor--to me, that is wrong. It is something we cannot let \nhappen.\n  The asbestos crisis is real. Nearly $74 billion has been lost on the \ninefficient and disastrous asbestos litigation system, with the trial \nlawyers, of that $74 billion, pocketing almost $30 billion. That is $74 \nbillion that should be going to the victims in a timely way, but about \n42 cents out of every dollar doesn't get to the victim, it gets to the \ntrial lawyers. It gets to the system itself. And that is what is fixed \nin this bill.\n  The costs have already bankrupted 77 companies, destroyed 150,000 \nAmerican jobs, and caused workers to lose over $200 million in wages. \nVictims with real injuries are left with no recourse, spending years \nawaiting a trial without getting the justice they deserve.\n  As I said, it was 15 years ago that Chief Justice Rehnquist first \ndrew attention to the problem. In 1991, he warned that courts are \n``ill-equipped'' to effectively address the asbestos situation which \nhas reached--and again I quote, using his words--``critical dimensions \nand is getting worse.''\n  The Chief Justice at the time--again, this is 1991--went on to say, \nand I use his words:\n\n       We have . . . a crisis for many Americans. However, the \n     worst is yet to come. . . . it [is] inevitable that, unless \n     Congress acts to formulate a national solution, with the \n     present rate of dissipation of the funds of defendant \n     producers . . . all resources for payment of these claims \n     will be exhausted in a few years. That will leave many \n     thousands of severely damaged Americans with no recourse at \n     all.\n\n  Those are the former Chief Justice's words.\n  After that initial report, in three separate opinions the Supreme \nCourt called on Congress to address the asbestos litigation crisis. \nJustice Ginsburg specifically called on Congress to create a national \ntrust fund. Her words:\n\n       The argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.\n\n  In 1998, Congressman Hyde was the first Member in Congress to \nintroduce a bill with that recommendation.\n  Many trust fund bills were subsequently introduced in both Chambers, \nbut it was not until Senator Orrin Hatch decided to work on the issue \nthat the Senate really began to debate in earnest the merits of a trust \nfund bill. In 2003, then-Chairman Hatch held six hearings on the \nproposal in the Judiciary Committee, and in July of that year, 2003, \nChairman Hatch passed his trust fund bill out of Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\n  The next year, in 2004, I brought that bill to the floor, fought for \na vote. Unfortunately, because of partisan and I guess it was election \nyear politics at the time, the bill was filibustered by the Democrats. \nIt was blocked by the Democrats.\n  After that failed cloture vote, 11 sitting Democrats wrote me and \nexpressed their desire to keep working on the bill, to keep working on \nan asbestos trust fund to provide necessary relief to victims and \nbusinesses. As has been mentioned earlier, I worked closely with \nSenator Daschle's office to try to construct a compromise at the \nleadership level. But, again because of partisan, election year \npolitics, negotiations stalled.\n  Over the course of the following year, Chairman Specter took it upon \nhimself to keep that momentum going. We heard a lot of that outlined a \nfew moments ago on the floor of the Senate. He held 36 separate \nmeetings with stakeholders on the topic--the business community, the \nunions, the trial lawyers, the insurance companies; meeting after \nmeeting. He held a total of six hearings on the matter.\n  In May of 2005, the Judiciary Committee voted out, in a bipartisan \nway--the vote was 13 to 5--the bipartisan FAIR Act, the bill we are \nconsidering today.\n  They were finally able to hammer out--it was bipartisan, drawing upon \nboth sides of the aisle--a fair solution to the crisis.\n  In that July letter of 2004 which was written to me by the 11 \nDemocrats, they summed it up best:\n\n       With each passing day, more and more victims face serious \n     illness and even death, and more and more workers and \n     companies face the threat of bankruptcy.\n       While creating a national asbestos trust fund is \n     unquestionably an extraordinarily complex undertaking, too \n     much progress has been made to let this issue go unaddressed \n     in this Congress.\n\n  That was July of 2004. They were right then, and they are right now. \nThat is why several months ago I told both sides of the aisle that the \nleadership was going to bring this bill to the floor at this point in \ntime. It is time for us to act. If we don't seize this opportunity, it \nis simply not going to happen. The asbestos litigation crisis is \ncrippling our economy and it is endangering our fellow citizens who \nsuffer from asbestosis, mesothelioma, and cancer.\n  It comes back to the victims themselves, with real injuries today, \nwho are offered almost no recourse, spending years awaiting a trial \nwithout getting the justice they deserve. It has been 15 years since \nChief Justice Rehnquist sounded the alarms. Congress has invested 7 \nyears working through the trust fund solution. Resolution of the \nasbestos crisis is simply overdue. A vote against cloture to proceed to \naddress asbestos reform is a vote against solving this problem.\n  As mentioned earlier today, there will be the opportunity to vote at \n6 o'clock tomorrow night on this issue. The timing of that is \ndetermined by schedules of people. We should have everyone back for \nthat vote. That vote is not going to be on passage of the bill; it is \nnot going to be on amendments to the bill; it is simply going to be a \nclear-cut vote among our colleagues as to whether we consider it \nimportant to look at fairness and justice for the victims who today are \nsuffering. It is a motion to proceed.\n  Months ago, we said we were going to address it. The time has come, \nand if we don't act now, this issue will have to be put on the back \nburner. Thousands of victims will continue to be left without the \nmedical treatment they need and the justice they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S718-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S718-S720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I hope cloture will \nbe invoked and we will then be able to begin debate on this important \nunderlying legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is a bill, S. \n852, the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005. This bill \nhas been a long time in coming. I was first elected to the U.S. House \nof Representatives over 20 years ago. In the first year that I served, \nI was approached, in 1983, 23 years ago, by a representative of Johns \nManville, one of the largest asbestos manufacturers in America. This \nperson said he wanted to talk to me about the asbestos issue 23 years \nago. He knew then that his company was in trouble, maybe headed for \nbankruptcy, and he wanted to know if there was another way to approach \nit.\n  He could not have imagined the reach of asbestos poisoning and \ncontamination in America. I don't know the number of potential victims \nof asbestos poisoning and contamination. I am sure it reaches into the \nhundreds of thousands, maybe into the millions. But there is one thing \nI do know for sure: not a single victim of asbestos that I have ever \nheard of or met voluntary exposed themselves to this dangerous and \ntoxic mineral.\n  We know some people who were almost innocent in their lifestyle, with \nvery little, if any, exposure to asbestos, turned out to be some of its \nmost painful victims. People with mesothelioma contracted because a \nwife did her husband's work clothes with the laundry each week, shaking \nout his dirty work clothes, and asbestos fiber flew into the air, \ninvisible to her eyes. She breathed it in, and a timebomb started \nticking. That kind of situation was repeated over and over again--for \nthe millions of men and women who were workers in the shipbuilding \nindustry during World War II and since; for others who worked in \noccupations that you never thought would lead to asbestos exposure; \npeople who bought plants and plant fertilizers, not realizing that the \nvermiculite included in the plants bought at the grocery store was \ntainted with asbestos and endangered them; people who worked on putting \nbrake linings into cars; putting insulation in homes; putting shingles \non houses; people putting flooring tiles on the floor, never realizing \nthat as they were cutting these products and working with them, they \nwere exposing themselves to something very deadly.\n  It turns out the people who made these products knew a long time ago \nthat asbestos was dangerous. Maybe as far back as 85 years ago, they \nhad the first evidence that people working around asbestos were getting \nsick and dying. What did they do? They covered it up because it was bad \nnews. It hurt the bottom line. That coverup went on for decades.\n  Now we know a lot more about asbestos. Some of the companies that \nmade the most money with asbestos products have gone out of business \nbecause they have been sued by their customers and their workers. The \nargument has been made that the ordinary court system of America can't \nhandle this; there will be too many claimants. So the proposal in this \nbill is to set up a trust fund, a $140 billion trust fund. Where did \nthat figure come from? Senator Specter of Pennsylvania said earlier \nthat it was a figure that was brought up by former Senator Daschle of \nSouth Dakota several years ago, and Senator Frist. I don't know where \nit came from. I don't know the circumstances under which it was \nsuggested. But today it has become absolutely a doctrine of faith that \n$140\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nbillion is all we are going to need to pay off all the victims of \nasbestos.\n  When we asked during the course of the committee consideration, let's \nfigure out how many people are sick, how much we are going to pay them, \nand what it is really going to cost, we got the runaround. We couldn't \nget the information that led to this calculation of $140 billion for \nthe trust fund. So the starting point of this legislation is fatally \nflawed.\n  Then comes the second point. Who is going to pay the money into the \ntrust fund? Nominally it will be existing trust funds from asbestos-\ntype companies, other companies across America with some exposure \nbecause they have been involved in the use of asbestos, and their \ninsurance companies. So the idea was they would pay into the trust fund \nand then escape all liability in court.\n  But we have asked, who are these companies? What are their names? How \nmuch will they pay in? Once again, there has been a refusal to provide \nthis most basic information. A $140 billion trust fund, a figure no one \ncan basically explain, coming from thousands of businesses across \nAmerica which no one can name, does that give you peace of mind? If you \nare someone who thinks maybe in the distant future someone in your \nfamily may need to turn to this trust fund to be paid, is that a good \nstarting point? I don't think it is.\n  Then comes the question about victims. I will concede there have been \nnumerous hearings on this bill. We have brought in people from all \nwalks of life but very few victims. That is what troubles me. I have \nmet with some of them. I have met with men and women who are literally \ndying from exposure to asbestos. It is a sad and painful death. Some \nsay it is one of the most painful ways to die, mesothelioma, \nasbestosis.\n  I know in my family, my father died of lung cancer. I stood next to \nhis bedside. I was a high school student at the time. I watched this \npoor man suffocate because of his addiction to tobacco. I can only \nimagine that asbestos deaths are similar, a painful experience for the \nvictim and a tragic experience for the families.\n  Look at the amount of money that is being provided. Some of it sounds \nabsolutely grandiose. One million for a mesothelioma victim. \nMesothelioma victims, no one even questions, are victims of asbestos \nexposure. And their diagnosis is almost always--maybe always--a fatal \none. So they were people who would recover in court once this diagnosis \nis made.\n  The amount of $1 million for a mesothelioma victim may sound like a \nlarge amount of money until you take a look at the medical bills and \ntake a look at the lost wages and consider that some of these \nmesothelioma victims are fathers of children, two and three children, \nand their entire life's worth from this asbestos tragedy is translated \ninto $1 million.\n  And over the course of debating this bill, medical treatment of \nmesothelioma has changed. There was a time when it was flatout a death \nsentence. There was no place to turn. Then people started trying \nradical surgeries and treatments to buy a few more months of life. \nWell, they do; they live a little longer. But, sadly, it costs a ton of \nmoney and a million dollars is gone.\n  What do you think about a victim, a mesothelioma victim--let's not \nquibble about whether it is asbestos or a serious victim--what do you \nthink about a mesothelioma victim who has been working 2 years, first \nrealizing they had exposure, wondering if they were sick and \ndiscovering they had mesothelioma, now they are pushing forward in \ncourt, and they have spent time, and they are ready, the trial is about \nto begin, and this law passes?\n  Except in the most extreme cases where we carve out an exception, for \nmost of them it means they start over. For asbestosis, in particular, \nthey start over. It means that all the work that was put in by the \nfamily, the doctors, the lawyers, to get them ready for their day in \ncourt to make their appeal for just compensation is wasted.\n  I know that lawyers are not a favored class when it comes to this \nlegislation. In fact, if you can imagine, this trust fund says to the \nvictims: if you want legal representation, go right ahead, but you \ncannot pay more than 5 percent of whatever you recover to the lawyer.\n  I made a living as a lawyer, and I can tell you there were many times \nI cut my fee because I felt sorry for my clients, and I think a lot of \nlawyers do the same thing. But 5 percent is a virtual guarantee that \nfew victims under the trust fund will ever have an attorney at their \nside or somebody who will tell them what their real rights would be. \nThat is unfortunate. Workers' compensation, which has been on the books \nfor decades across America, provides a reduced standard, a predictable \npercentage for a lawyers fee. It doesn't go for the moon, and it should \nnot. These are hurt workers, injured workers. They could have done the \nsame thing here, but they did not.\n  So you look at this from the perspective of workers, you find there \nare two or three unions supporting this bill. If I am not mistaken, it \nis the Sheet Metal Union, the Asbestos Union, and the United Auto \nWorkers Union that are the three main unions supporting the bill. You \nmight understand the asbestos and the sheet metal workers. Why the \nUnited Auto Workers? It has a lot to do with the fact that many work \nfor automobile companies that are struggling to survive. I bet you a \nnickel--though they have never told me as much--that when they sit down \nwith the GMs and the Fords of the world, these corporate executives \nsay: take your pick, we can either pay these victims of asbestos or we \ncan pay your pensions.\n  I hope it has not come to that. I hope that what it comes to is an \nunderstanding that we can do the right thing; we can provide an avenue \nfor compensation for victims of asbestos exposure and do it in a \nsensible way. The States of Texas and Illinois have already moved in \nthis direction. In Illinois, we have what is called the plural \nregistry. It means that if you have been exposed to asbestos, you can \nsign up--you don't have to file a lawsuit, unless you are sick, but you \ncan sign up and protect your right to bring a lawsuit some day if you \nbecome sick. Maybe, God willing, that will never happen. But if, God \nforbid, it does, you have protected your right to file a lawsuit. I \nthink that is sensible. In Texas, they have established medical \ncriteria for what brings you to court. Once in court, how can you \nrecover? They worked it out within the State of Texas between the trial \nbar, the attorneys who represent victims, and the legislators and the \nbusinesses and insurance companies. They reached an agreement that \ndoesn't create a trust fund, that doesn't say to a person we are \nslamming the courthouse door but an agreement that gives them their day \nin court under circumstances and laws that have been agreed to by \nbusiness and labor and the lawyers and the victims.\n  Why isn't this bill modeled after that? That seems more sensible. \nRather than putting our future in a trust fund with an amount we cannot \neven rationalize, that assesses companies that we cannot even name, \nclosing off the possibility of going through a court suit to protect \nyour right in court, I think there is a much more sensible way to \napproach this. I hope that when it is all said and done, all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate will have the same experience I have had--sit \ndown with these families, the families of victims, and understand that \nis what this is all about. We spent so little time talking about the \nvictims during the course of preparing this bill. I hope, during the \ncourse of this debate we will think about it long and hard.\n  Earlier this afternoon, my colleague, Senator Reid of Nevada, spoke \non the floor about one of our mutual friends, Bruce Vento of Minnesota. \nHe was a Congressman from St. Paul. He worked in the shipbuilding \nindustry when he was a young man. He went on to have a good public \nlife, being elected to Congress and rising to a position of leadership. \nI used to see him down at the House gym. He was very conscious of his \nhealth. He worked out regularly. He was in good health and was proud of \nit. Then lightning struck. Those fibers that he ingested in his lungs \ndecades ago created the mesothelioma which spread quickly through his \nbody and took his life. I met with his wife. We talked about Bruce and \nwhat his last days were like.\n  That is a reminder to me that what we are talking about in this bill \nis not just about formulas and companies, and contributions, and trust \nfunds, we are talking about real people and real\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\nlives. I sincerely hope that at the end of the day, after my colleagues \nhave taken a close look, they will say this bill should not pass, that \nit is not fair, it is unfair to so many people. It is more important \nfor us to step back now and decide what is reasonable. Follow many \nState examples, such as Texas and Illinois, that have found ways to \ndeal with this issue in a humane, sensible way, to bring it under \ncontrol. I think we can do that.\n  I don't take anything away from Senator Specter or Senator Leahy, the \nranking member, who support it. They put in many hours in preparation. \nBut I have to tell them at the end of the day, despite all their best \nefforts, there are fatal flaws in this bill which I hope will lead to \nits defeat.\n  I will vote against the motion to proceed.

Mr. President, I rise late in the afternoon, early \nevening, in remembrance of a great patriotic leader, a person who I \nthink was America's greatest leader of the 20th century and one of \nhistory's alltime adherence advocates and leaders for freedom, \nindividual freedom, liberty, and the advancement of security for free \nand just societies. The gentleman I am talking about would have been 95 \nyears old today, and that is Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  I would hope, actually, on future birthdays, the date of the birth of \nRonald Wilson Reagan, some Senator will stand in this Chamber and \nremind Americans and remember Ronald Reagan, his words, his ideas, and \nhis inspiration.\n  Ronald Reagan was one who motivated me to get involved in organized \npolitics, and there are literally tens of thousands of others. There \nare certain people, though, if one looks through history, whose words \nare ones you can use; they are just enduring principles. I think of \nThomas Jefferson, John Locke, George Washington, James Madison, \nBenjamin Franklin, Mark Twain--all those great quotes from Mark Twain--\neven Will Rogers. But in our day, the person for inspiration, to help \nus decide how to meet the challenges of our day, was Ronald Reagan.\n  President Reagan did leave the White House 17 years ago. For some \nyoung people, this seems like a long time ago.\n  President Reagan's words and deeds are still so applicable today.\n  He left our world 2 years ago, but we are still living in the wake of \nthe Reagan era. It was Ronald Reagan, let's remember, along with \nMargaret Thatcher and Pope John Paul II, who fundamentally changed all \nthe dynamics of the Cold War, to bury communism and advance human \nliberty. While many in those days accepted the perpetual menace of \ncommunism and the perpetual servitude of millions of men and women \nlocked behind the Iron Curtain, Ronald Reagan did not. His philosophy \ntoward the Cold War was radically different from the elite sages of the \nestablishment. As Governor of California and then also as President, he \noffered very clear and refreshing ideas. He was asked one time:\n\n       Mr. Reagan, what is your strategy on the Cold War?\n\n  He declared:\n\n       About the Cold War, my view is that we win and they lose.\n\n  He came into office as President. In his inaugural address in 1981, \nhe called for an era of national renewal, and this was something very \nimportant after the years of malaise that we had in the late 1970s. \nThat is exactly what his 8-year Presidency turned out to be--an era of \nnational renewal for security, for opportunity, and for foundational \nvalues. The Reagan revolution reversed the high unemployment, high \ninflation, economic policies of the 1970s and unleashed the greatest \neconomic boom in American history.\n  His policies proved that low taxes are good for the taxpayers, and \nthey are also good for the economy, with more investment and more jobs \nand, for those who care about it, generating more revenue for the \nGovernment. After his tax cuts started to impact the economy in 1983, \nthe wheels of American commerce started to move again. We saw an \nexplosion of job creation, innovation, and investment.\n  In foreign affairs, President Reagan scrapped the policy of \ncoexistence. He made the advancement of freedom, not containment, into \nthe foundational principle of America's foreign policy. He rebuilt \nAmerica's military strength. He started and initiated the Strategic \nDefense Initiative which put unprecedented strains on the Soviet \neconomy and their ability to finance their military.\n  He refused to be cowed into silence when talking about our enemy or \nthe evils of communism. He called the Soviet Union an evil empire. Oh, \nthey criticized him, but, indeed, that was an accurate description. He \nwas a vocal, tireless champion for freedom. He went to Brandenburg Gate \nin 1987 and boldly said, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' He was \ncriticized, but 2 years later, the Berlin Wall was gone, and 2 years \nafter, the Soviet Union itself was gone, discarded into the ``ash heap \nof history,'' as Ronald Reagan prophesied during the depths of the Cold \nWar.\n  Today, because of Ronald Reagan, there are literally hundreds of \nmillions of people who were once locked behind the Iron Curtain living \nin countries we now know as free countries--Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, \nformer East Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, \nRomania, Bulgaria, and added countries such as Ukraine and Georgia, \nwhich are now tasting that sweet nectar of liberty as opposed to being \nbehind the Iron Curtain. It is because Ronald Reagan provided us with a \nperseverance--he persevered, our allies persevered, particularly in \nWestern Europe, and freedom has prevailed.\n  Five years after he left office in 1994, we were all crushed to learn \nabout Ronald Reagan being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He \nconcluded his farewell address and letter to the American people by \nwriting:\n\n       Now I begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset \n     of my life. I know that for America there will always be a \n     bright new dawn ahead.\n\n  As always, Ronald Reagan was right. Despite new and numerous \nchallenges, this blessed country, America, has stood strong for \nfreedom, extending the blessings of liberty and prosperity to a whole \nnew generation of Americans and sharing those blessings with even more \npeople who live here in this world.\n  When Ronald Reagan passed away on June 5, 2004, I know you, Mr. \nPresident--and I see Senator Hatch from Utah here--and all of America \ngrieved and mourned. He was my political hero. But I also felt \ngrateful, grateful for our country, for America, that we and, indeed, \nthe world were blessed to have had Ronald Reagan's commonsense \nleadership and unwavering commitment to the ideals of freedom \nthroughout the world.\n  Today, on what would have been his 95th birthday, I reflect on \neverything Ronald Reagan accomplished during his extraordinary life. If \nyou want to measure a person's greatness and what he or she did in \ntheir life, you kind of determine it by the number of people who were \npositively impacted by their efforts, their deeds, and their life--in \nRonald Reagan's case, as I said, the hundreds of millions of people in \nCentral and Eastern Europe who were liberated from the tyranny of \ncommunism, but we also have Americans, now over 300 million strong, who \nhave been enriched by the peace and prosperity that resulted from \nRonald Reagan's courageous commitment to foundational ideals.\n  There are many such as myself--and really too many to count--who were \ninspired by meeting Ronald Reagan in person, who were touched by his \ngreat character and integrity, his unfailing optimism and patriotism, \nhis genuine good will and sense of humor, and his words that applied \nthe philosophy of our Founders, whether it is George\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\nWashington in his peace-through-strength approach or James Madison in \nunderstanding our representative democracy or the spirit of this \ncountry as written by Thomas Jefferson in our Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  Everyone remembers meeting Ronald Reagan. I met him first when I was \nin high school. We moved out to California when my father became head \ncoach of the L.A. Rams. Ronald Reagan that year was elected Governor \nand used to come to practices. One thing I really remember about Ronald \nReagan is that he didn't just talk about ideals and principles; as \nGovernor and as President, he put them into action. He realized we are \nall put here on Earth to do something, and we cheat ourselves or others \nif we do not advocate and advance those ideas.\n  President Reagan gave my father in the 1980s a plaque which bore his \nfamous quote: ``If not us, who? If not now, when?'' My father kept that \nplaque on his desk. When my father passed away, my mother gave it to \nme, saying I should have it. I had it on my mantel as Governor of \nVirginia in the capitol designed by Thomas Jefferson. I keep that \nplaque, ``If not us, who? If not now, when?'' on my mantel in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Ronald Reagan was a man of action. He was one who produced many great \nquotes over the years. In fact, a whole industry has sprung up around \nthem. I share with my colleagues and American people my very favorites:\n\n       No weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as \n     the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a \n     weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.\n\n  Here is another great quote which is the essence of my philosophy:\n\n       Every dollar the government does not take from us, every \n     decision the government does not make for us will make our \n     economy stronger, our lives more abundant, and our future \n     more free.\n\n  He also understood our country:\n\n       In America, our origins matter less than our destination, \n     and that is what democracy is all about.\n\n  Today, we face challenges. We have a war on terror. I believe our \nmission in this present war on terror can find us constructive examples \nfrom President Reagan's administration. We are making progress in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. In the coming years, there will be both breakthroughs \nand setbacks in both countries as we lead this generational struggle \nagainst the forces of Islamic terrorism and fascism. But let's remember \nRonald Reagan. The Cold War lasted for nearly 50 years, and he \npersevered. Let's keep and remember Ronald Reagan's legacy of strong \nleadership as a guiding example to ourselves as we adapt and protect \nAmerica in this war on terror.\n  In the area of our economy, we want to make sure the United States is \nthe world capital of innovation, a land of opportunity for all, and is \nmore competitive. If we do so, we need to keep Ronald Reagan in mind as \nwe choose our country's economic policies.\n  I mentioned earlier Ronald Reagan's tax cuts in the 1980s and the \npositive impact that had for jobs, investment, and economic progress in \nour country. When I came to the Senate in 2001, this country was \nactually in the midst of an economic slowdown. Over the next 3 years, \nwe passed three rounds of tax cuts, and as a result we have an economic \ngrowth in this country which is very good, with rising income, more \njobs, more investment, and record home ownership. We have even had \nrecord tax revenue for the Government because more people are working, \ninvesting, and creating more jobs.\n  However, Americans are going to be hit with tax increases in the next \n2 years if we do not prevent tax increases, which would put a damper on \nour economy, create less investment, make our country less competitive \nand, in fact, have fewer jobs for the men and women of our country.\n  President Reagan showed us how tax relief can revitalize and recharge \nthe American economy. Let's not hurt American jobs and American people \nand competitiveness by raising taxes. We should take action this year \nto prevent tax increases, and the Federal Government actually ought to \nbe looking to reduce taxes to make our country more competitive for \ninvestment, jobs, and opportunity.\n  People are concerned, as I am, about fiscal accountability. Again, \nlet's look to Ronald Reagan for guidance. I point out that in President \nReagan's farewell address to the American people as President, he said \nthat he was ``still sounding off about those things I didn't get \naccomplished while I was President. First, I'm out there stumping to \nhelp future Presidents--Republican or Democrat--get those tools they \nneed to bring the budget under control. And those tools are a line-item \nveto and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.''\n  Today, the bloated cost of Government has become indefensible. We \nneed to bring fiscal accountability to Washington. The Federal \nGovernment needs to spend smarter and learn to do more with less. And \nthat starts, in my view, with reviving a pair of ideas Ronald Reagan \nshared in his farewell address: the line-item veto and the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  When I was Governor, I had the power of the line-item veto. Forty-six \nGovernors have that power. Let me tell you, it is useful. It is a way \nof knocking out wasteful, undesirable expenditures and policies. You \ndon't have to use it too much after you use it a few times, and the \nmessage is understood.\n  I want the President to have the same power I had as Governor, and \nso, together with Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, we have introduced a \nconstitutional amendment to provide the President the line-item veto so \nthat the President and the Congress can be held accountable for \nnonessential Government spending.\n  I will also be proposing a constitutional amendment that will require \nthe President and the Congress to balance the budget every year. That \nis important because if deficits continue, we will end up with higher \ninterest rates. Higher interest rates result in fewer and fewer \nAmericans, especially young people, able to afford their own home. \nOwning one's own home is the American dream. It is also a question of \nfairness and opportunity. So to prevent interest rates from rising, we \ndo need the institutional mechanism to get this deficit under control \nand we need to wrestle it down with a change of the Constitution.\n  Taken together, I believe lower taxes on the taxpayers, coupled with \nboth the line-item veto and a balanced budget amendment, will restore \nfiscal accountability and common sense to Washington, and be a fitting \ncapstone to the Reagan legacy.\n  Ronald Reagan is no longer with us in body, but he is surely with us \nin spirit. On his 95th birthday, my thoughts are with him and his \nfamily, particularly his wonderful bride and wife Nancy, who exhibited \nsuch grace and dignity as First Lady and later in caring for her \nhusband during his very long goodbye.\n  My thoughts are also on America, this land Ronald Reagan loved so \nmuch and led so well, a land that has been continually blessed by God \nwith great patriots such as President Reagan, who possessed strong \ncharacter, integrity, and commitment to enduring values and principles.\n  I am going to close with this observation by President Reagan, which \nI believe is still true.\n\n       We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say \n     we're in a time where there are no heroes, they just don't \n     know where to look.\n\n  There are heroes all across this country. There are heroes serving \nthis country on ships. They are serving us in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, President Reagan: Happy birthday. Your dream lives on. \nIt warms the hearts and it cheers the spirit of freedom-loving people \nthroughout the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished friend, the \nSenator from Virginia, for the remarks he just finished with regard to \nPresident Reagan and Mrs. Reagan. It is very fitting and appropriate \nthe distinguished Senator speak here today because he reminds me a lot \nof Ronald Reagan--in the philosophy he has, the guts he has, the \nability to move people in so many other ways. I have to say, I believe \nI was one of the few, maybe the only person Ronald Reagan ever \npreprimary endorsed. It was a great thrill for me.\n  In 1980, I went to multiple States as one of his two major surrogates \nwho spoke for him all over the country. I will never forget the Reagan \ncampaign team did not want him to go to the first--what they call \ncattle show--in New Hampshire. So they asked me to\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\ngo in his place and appear with the other seven or eight Presidential \ncandidates. My date for that evening was none other than Nancy Reagan. \nShe was so beautiful--she was such a beautiful person. It was such an \nhonor to be able to speak for the President, for the then Governor \nReagan. He meant so much to me and I am grateful that the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia has spoken for all of us on this subject. I hope \nand pray Mrs. Reagan has everything that will make life worthwhile, \neven though Ronald Reagan is now gone.\n  We love both of them. We revere the memories we have of both of them. \nOf course, we look forward to continuing to meet with Mrs. Reagan as \ntime goes on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S722-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week the President of the United \nStates came to us with an ambitious domestic policy agenda for the next \nyear. There were many noble goals outlined in that speech. But in my \nopinion, one of the most important and most necessary is his proposal \nto expand health savings accounts, or HSAs.\n  There is not a single person in this institution who fails to \nrecognize the ever-growing problem of health care expenses for ordinary \nAmericans. For at least a decade now, this debate has been front and \ncenter in American politics. The American people are fed up and are \ntelling us they want solutions to this crisis.\n  In the last 30 years we have seen true revolutions in the way \nconsumers do business in this country. Informed American consumers are \nincreasingly involved in a direct way in making decisions on issues \nthat affect their lives and that of their families. As an individual:\n  It is easier to invest today.\n  And it is easier to bank today.\n  There is more choice in education. And there are more opportunities \nin the workplace.\n  But almost uniquely in the American economy, our health care system \nis becoming more expensive and more difficult for individuals to make \npersonal choices regarding their care. Because of the current structure \nof insurance plans, most consumers do not have the information they \nneed with regard to the cost or the quality of health care that they \nreceive. Information is readily available to make a value-driven \ndecision on purchasing a television or a cell phone, but when it comes \nto health care, the consumer has little basis on which to make a \nrational quality and cost-based decision. What separates our \nincreasingly complex and expensive health care system from other \nsectors of our economy that have become more user-friendly in the last \n30 years is a lack of adequate information and a lack of direct \nconsumer decision making.\n  I think that health savings accounts provide an incredible \nopportunity for real progress toward health care reform.\n  Health savings accounts were established in the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003. These accounts allow Americans to save tax-\nfree dollars to pay for their everyday health care expenses on their \nown terms. At the same time, these accounts are coupled with high-\ndeductible comprehensive insurance policies to cover larger medical \nbills and also provide specific coverage for preventive care.\n  This makes sense. HSAs allow individuals to save tax free for \neveryday medical expenses, while preserving insurance for major health \ncare needs. With HSAs, individuals have unprecedented choice in their \nhealth care and are still protected from the high costs of serious \nillness. The result is predictable. Insurance becomes less expensive if \nit is used only for major medical expenses, and consumers make value-\nbased choices in their routine medical care.\n  And, as we all know, the high cost of health insurance is the real \nproblem that we face in providing health care coverage to all \nAmericans. The current low-deductible plans so common in the workplace \nare increasingly costly for businesses and result in lower wages for \nworkers and reduced employment. More and more small businesses are \nopting not to offer a health care insurance benefit at all. For the \nunemployed and/or the uninsured, health insurance premiums are far too \nexpensive.\n  Health savings accounts are proving themselves to be one important \npart of the solution to our health care crisis. Americans certainly \nthink so. Since January 2004, over 3 million Americans have enrolled in \nHSAs.\n  As innovative and popular as HSAs are proving to be, however, they \nare far from perfect. By improving and expanding them, health savings \naccounts could be even more effective in helping us reach our \nobjectives.\n  I believe we need to create more incentives for employers to offer \nthese plans and for individuals to enroll in them. Incentives can be \ndesigned to assure adequate coverage and enrollment of those with \nchronic illnesses.\n  The President has made it clear that we need to make these plans \nfairer and available to a larger number of Americans. Individuals that \npurchase HSAs on their own should have the same tax advantages as those \nwith employer-sponsored insurance. To achieve this, premiums for HSA-\ncompatible insurance policies should be deductible from income taxes \nand an income tax credit provided to offset payroll taxes paid on \npremiums for HSA policies. All taxes on out of pocket spending through \nHSAs should be eliminated. HSA insurance policies should be portable \nbetween employers and across State lines. To allow for better \nindividual healthcare decisions, information on price and quality of \nhealthcare must be transparent and readily available. Acceleration of \nthe implementation of an integrated health information technology \nsystem will be critical to these efforts. The President's budget \noutlines several proposals designed to improve HSAs and to make them \nmore attractive to employers and employees. The employer community also \nhas developed a set of proposals designed to improve HSAs. The Senate \nshould give serious consideration to all good ideas to make health \nsavings accounts work better.\n\n  These are important goals.\n  Health savings accounts are a good thing for our citizens, and they \nare a good thing for the economy.\n  HSAs will make health insurance less expensive in the long run, which \nis the best thing we can do to tackle the problem of the uninsured in \nthis country.\n  They will make the health care sector of our economy more user-\nfriendly and more efficient.\n  They will give workers more choice and more flexibility in their \nchoice of plans and in deciding where they want to work.\n  In short, they would help to bring our health care system into the \nnew economy.\n  In 1980, most people in this country had rabbit ears on their \ntelevisions and a choice of three channels.\n  Today, we have the internet. We have cell phones. We have ATMs on \nevery block.\n  Yet, in some ways, our system of employer-provided health care is a \ndinosaur. It dates back to a policy decision made to assist employers \nduring World War II and it is not aging well. There are too many \nAmericans without employer-provided health insurance, and those with it \nare routinely frustrated with the level of customer service.\n  The Bush administration estimates that under current law, the number \nof Americans with HSAs will grow to 14 million by 2010. By improving \nthe program, however, we could see this number go as high as 21 \nmillion.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I am deeply interested in \nworking with my colleagues to help improve HSAs in the coming months \nand years. The President's proposal represents a unique opportunity to \nmake health care in this country more equitable, more affordable, and \nmore cost-effective.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in these \nefforts.\n  I believe we would all be better off if we would do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S722-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S722-S723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    First Lieutenant Garrison Avery\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

He was deployed to Iraq in October 2005. Lieutenant Avery \nwill be remembered as a loyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, \nhonor, and love of country. Thousands of brave Americans like \nLieutenant Avery are currently serving in Iraq.\n  Lieutenant Avery is survived by his wife, Kayla; parents, Susan and \nGary Avery; brothers, Clinton and Johnathan; and sister, Elizabeth.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the House of \nRepresentatives has passed S. 1932, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, \nDRA. This is a relatively modest deficit-reduction bill that represents \njust one-fourth of 1 percent of what Congress would otherwise spend \nduring the next 5 years.\n  It has been 8 years since Congress last passed legislation to reduce \nmandatory spending. The kinds of Medicaid changes made in the \nconference report are a fraction of what Governors across the country--\nRepublican and Democrat--asked Congress for to help State governments \nkeep their Medicaid programs afloat for the millions of people who rely \non Medicaid. Beneficiaries and taxpayers both deserve to get the \nhighest value for every dollar that is spent on Medicaid, Medicare, and \nother safety-net programs.\n  It is especially rewarding to have included in this overall package a \nbill I first authored in 1999. The Family Opportunity Act, which I have \npushed for year after year with Senator Kennedy, was inspired by an \nIowa family struggling to access health care services for a disabled \nchild. Melissa Arnold, the mother, didn't give up, and today's \nlegislative victory is a tribute to her kind of determination. The \nmeasure will let States create options for families that have children \nwith multiple medical needs to buy into Medicaid while continuing to \nwork. It is a pro-work initiative because it lets parents work without \nlosing their children's health coverage. It is pro-family because it \nencourages parents to work and build a better life for their children, \nrather than being forced to impoverish themselves to access health \ncare. And it is pro-taxpayer because it means more parents continue to \nearn money, pay taxes and pay their own way for Medicaid coverage for \ntheir children.\n  In addition to this expansion of the Medicaid program, the \ncomprehensive legislation includes $400 million in child-support \npayments that will go directly to welfare families, along with grants \nto promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood, $100 million \nto improve the handling of court cases involving foster care, a $200 \nmillion increase for a Safe and Stable Families program to help keep \ntroubled families together and support adoption, and $1 billion to help \nparents pay for child care when they leave welfare and join the \nworkforce.\n  On Medicaid, some partisan critics and their allies will probably \ncontinue to distort the bill's intent and effect. I am repeating this--\nthe provisions on benefit flexibility and cost sharing are clear and \nunambiguous. The Congressional Budget Office and the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services agree. The conferees agreed to language \nthat clearly provides early periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment \nas a guaranteed benefit to all children on Medicaid. The conferees also \nagreed to language that clearly exempts individuals with incomes of \nless than 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Limit from any increased \ncost-sharing. I fought hard for these provisions and I will take \nappropriate actions to prevent any misreading of them to occur down the \nroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S723-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S723-S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT AND WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

This legislation extends Medicaid \neligibility to families with a severely disabled child that are faced \nwith either staying poor in order to continue to qualify for Medicaid \nor, worse, relinquishing a child to the State so that the child can \nreceive the services that the child needs.\n  The introduction of the Family Opportunity Act was motivated by the \ncircumstances of individual families, the Melissa Arnold Family and the \nDylan Lee Family. I offer my heartfelt thanks to these families for \nsharing their struggles with me and for being the inspiration for this \nlegislation.\n  I pay special tribute to my partner in this endeavor, Senator Edward \nKennedy, who is a tireless champion on behalf of children and those \nwith disabilities. During the many years we worked side by side on this \nbill, Senator Kennedy was most ably assisted by Connie Garner, of his \nstaff.\n  On my own staff, I would like to single out the efforts of Hope \nCooper who worked for many years on the Family Opportunity Act and \nwhose knowledge and compassion were invaluable assets in developing the \nbill.\n  I also appreciate the work done by policy leads, Leah Kegler, Becky \nShipp; health policy director, Mark Hayes; deputy staff director, Ted \nTotman, and staff director for the Finance Committee, Kolan Davis.\n  I am grateful for the work done by Jeanne De Sa and Eric Rollins at \nthe Congressional Budget Office and Ruth Ernst at the Office of \nLegislative Counsel, especially for their patience in analyzing and \ndrafting the many different versions of the legislation.\n  Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families, TANF, has been a long and very difficult process, \nspanning three Congresses. Everyone who has worked on this \nreauthorization has been guided by a fundamental principle: helping \nthose in deep and persistent poverty achieve the economic self \nsufficiency needed to overcome that poverty. We may disagree on some of \nthe best ways to overcome poverty, but everyone who devoted their labor \nto this program did so out of the best of intentions.\n  I particularly thank my friend and partner on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Max Baucus, for his work on this program over the \npast 5 years. We didn't always agree, but we kept working together \nuntil we finally got to a compromise that satisfied us both. I hope at \nsome point we can revisit some of the common themes we developed \ntogether in the PRIDE bill.\n  I thank Senator Baucus's staff who worked on this issue over the past \n5 years, Doug Steiger, Kate Kahan, and Liz Fowler. They are passionate, \nknowledgeable, and care deeply about low-income programs and the \nindividuals who rely upon them.\n  Other Members and their staff who contributed to the policy and the \nprocess include, the initial ``Tripartisan'' members: Senator John \nBreaux and his staff, Sara Triagle and Michelle Easton; Senator Orrin \nHatch and his staff, Becky Shipp; Senator Jay Rockefeller and his \nstaff, Barbara Pryor; Senator Olympia Snowe and her staff, Carolyn \nHolmes; Senator James Jeffords and his staff, Justin King; Senator \nBlanche Lincoln and her staff, Elizabeth MacDonald and Mike Anzick.\n  Other critical Members and staff include: Majority Leader Bill Frist \nand\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\nhis staff, Eric Ueland and Libby Jarvis; Minority Leader Tom Daschle, \nand his staff, Joan Huffer; Senator Rick Santorum and his staff, Randy \nBrandt; Senator Christopher Dodd and his staff, Grace Reef; and Megan \nHauck, who contributed as a advisor to Senator Don Nickles, as well as \nworking at the Department of Health and Human Services Office of \nLegislation and the White House.\n  Throughout much of the process, Members and staff were indebted to \nthe expertise of the Director of the Office of Family Assistance at the \nAdministration of Children and Families, Andrew Bush and the Assistant \nSecretary for Human Service Policy in the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary for Planning and Evaluation, Don Winstead.\n  The Congress simply could not do our work, were it not for the \nincredibly talented and hardworking individuals serving in the \ncongressional support agencies. We owe a substantial debt of gratitude \nfor the work done by Gene Falk, Melinda Gish, and Carmen Soloman Fears \nat the Congressional Research Service; Shelia Dacey at the \nCongressional Budget Office; and Ruth Ernst at the Office of the \nLegislative Council.\n  As ranking member and then chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nI was well served by policy leads, Hope Cooper and Becky Shipp; health \npolicy director, Mark Hayes; deputy staff director, Ted Totman; and \nstaff director for the Finance Committee, Kolan Davis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S724-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WENDY WASSERSTEIN\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on Monday, January 30, our \ncountry lost, all too prematurely, Wendy Wasserstein, a daughter of New \nYork and one of our Nation's great playwrights and essayists.\n  Wendy Wasserstein grew up in Brooklyn and Manhattan and was educated \nat Mount Holyoke College, the City College of New York, and Yale \nUniversity School of Drama. She is best known for her 1989 Pulitzer \nPrize and Tony Award-winning play, ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and Tony-\nnominated play, ``The Sisters Rosensweig''. She wrote most recently, \n``Third'', a play that opened in October at Lincoln Center for the \nPerforming Arts. Her first novel, ``Elements of Style'', will be coming \nout in April.\n  Throughout Wendy Wasserstein's career, she wrote with wit and an \nacute sensitivity to the challenges facing women negotiating the social \nchanges of the last 40 years. She had the courage to dig deeply into \nher own experiences to write thoughtfully and compassionately about \nwomen, New York, and her Jewish roots.\n  Wendy Wasserstein is best known for her work in the theater and \nliterary world, but she cared deeply about progressive politics, \nadvocacy for the arts, and worked to create richer opportunities for \nwomen in the theater. Having grown up attending theater and ballet \nperformances on a weekly basis with her family, she also believed that \nall children should have the opportunity to be exposed to the arts. She \ngave back to the city that shaped her as an artist by making the \ntheater accessible to New York's inner-city students through a program \nshe instigated which is now called Open Doors. Through this program, \nshe mentored students at the Young Women's Leadership School, a college \nprep public school in Harlem. She wrote of the program, ``* * * if a \ncity is fortunate enough to house an entire theater district, shouldn't \naccess to the stage life within it be what makes coming of age in New \nYork different from any other American city?''\n  On a personal level, she was described by her friend, New York Times \neditorial page editor Gail Collins, as: ``* * * a charter member of the \ncompany of nice women, a river of accommodating humanity that flows \nthrough Manhattan just as it flows through Des Moines and Oneonta, \nN.Y., organizing library fund-raisers, running day care centers, \nordering prescriptions for elderly parents, buying all the birthday \npresents and giving career counseling to the nephew of a very remote \nacquaintance who is trying to decide between making it big on Broadway \nand dentistry.''\n  We can only imagine what future gifts to the theater, journalism, \nliterature and her community Wendy Wasserstein might have made. I am \ngrateful for having known her, and I extend my condolences to her young \ndaughter Lucy Jane and to the entire Wasserstein family. We have lost \nsomeone who loved New York with a big, big heart, and New York and our \nNation loved her back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S724-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S724-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S724-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S724-S725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007--PM 36\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non the Budget; and Appropriations.\n  America's economy is growing at a healthy pace, and more Americans \nare working than ever. In the face of a series of challenges, including \nmost recently devastating natural disasters, Americans have stood firm, \nand America's economy has demonstrated its strength and resilience time \nand again.\n  My Administration has focused the Nation's resources on our highest \npriority: protecting our citizens and our homeland. Working with \nCongress, we have given our men and women on the frontlines in the War \non Terror the funding they need to defeat the enemy and detect, \ndisrupt, and dismantle terrorist plots and operations. We continue to \nhelp emerging democracies in Afghanistan and Iraq stand on their own. \nAs the Afghan and Iraqi peoples assume greater responsibility for their \nown security and for defeating the terrorists, our troops will come \nhome with the honor they have earned.\n  My Administration has responded to major economic challenges by \nfollowing this vital principle: The American economy grows when people \nare allowed to keep more of what they earn, to save and spend as they \nsee fit. The results are clear.\n  Since May 2003, when I signed into law major tax relief, America has \nadded more than four and a half million new jobs. Productivity is high, \ndisposable income is up, household wealth is at record levels, consumer \nconfidence has climbed, small businesses are expanding, and more \nAmericans own their homes than at any time in our Nation's history.\n  Our economy is the envy of the industrialized world. To build and \nmaintain our competitive edge, my Administration has a broad agenda to \npromote America's long-term economic strength. We are opening new \nmarkets to American-made goods and services through trade agreements. \nWe are proposing reforms to prevent needless litigation and burdensome \nregulations. Through major reforms of our public schools, we are \npreparing our children to compete and succeed in the global economy. \nAnd my Budget includes an American Competitiveness Initiative that \ntargets funding to advance technology, better prepare American children \nin math and science, develop and train a high-tech workforce, and \nfurther strengthen the environment for private-sector innovation and \nentrepreneurship.\n  In our efforts to keep our economy strong and competitive, we will \nresist calls to raise taxes on America's workers, families, and \nbusinesses. Unless we act to make tax relief permanent, income tax \nrates eventually will rise, the marriage penalty will climb, the child\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\ntax credit will be cut, savers and investors will be hit with higher \ntaxes, and the death tax will come back to life.\n  With a growing economy, tax receipts are on the rise, helping to \nbring down the deficit in 2005. To stay on track to meet my goal of \ncutting the deficit in half by 2009, we must maintain our pro-growth \npolicies and insist on spending restraint.\n  Last year, I proposed to hold overall discretionary spending growth \nbelow the rate of inflation--and Congress delivered on that goal. Last \nyear, I proposed that we focus our resources on defense and homeland \nsecurity and cut elsewhere--and Congress delivered on that goal. And \nalso last year, my Budget proposed major cuts in or eliminations of 154 \nprograms that were not getting results and not fulfilling essential \npriorities. Thanks to the work of Congress, we delivered savings to the \ntaxpayer of $6.5 billion on 89 of my Administration's recommendations.\n  The 2007 Budget builds on these efforts. Again, I am proposing to \nhold overall discretionary spending below the rate of inflation and to \ncut spending in non-security discretionary programs below 2006 levels. \nMy Administration has identified 141 programs that should be terminated \nor significantly reduced in size. To help bring greater accountability \nand transparency to the budget process, my Budget proposes reforms so \nthat firm spending limits are put in place, and public funds are used \nfor the best purposes with the broadest benefits.\n  The 2007 Budget also continues our efforts to improve performance and \nmake sure the taxpayers get the most for their money. My Administration \nexpects to be held accountable for significantly improving the way the \nGovernment works. In every program, and in every agency, we are \nmeasuring success not by good intentions or by dollars spent, but \nrather by results achieved.\n  In the long term, the biggest challenge to our Nation's fiscal health \ncomes from unsustainable growth in entitlement spending. Entitlement \nprograms such as Social Security and Medicare are growing faster than \nour ability to pay for them, faster than the economy, faster than the \nrate of inflation, and faster than the population. As more baby boomers \nretire and collect their benefits, our deficits are projected to grow. \nThere will be fewer people paying into the system, and more retirees \ncollecting benefits. These unfunded liabilities will put an increasing \nburden on our children and our grandchildren. We do not need to cut \nthese programs, but we do need to slow their growth. We can solve this \nproblem and still meet our Nation's commitment to the elderly, \ndisabled, and poor.\n  Acting on my recommendations, both houses of Congress have taken an \nimportant first step, passing legislation that would produce $40 \nbillion in savings from mandatory programs and entitlement reforms---\nthe first such savings in nearly a decade. My Budget builds on this \nprogress by proposing $65 billion more in savings in entitlement \nprograms.\n  My Budget also includes proposals to address the longer-term \nchallenge arising from unsustainable growth in Medicare, while ensuring \nmodern health care for our seniors. In addition, I will continue to \ncall on Congress to enact comprehensive reform of Social Security for \nfuture generations, so that we return the system to firm financial \nfooting, protect the benefits of today's retirees and near-retirees, \nprovide the opportunity for today's young workers to build a secure \nnest egg they can call their own, and assure our children and \ngrandchildren a retirement benefit that is as good as is available \ntoday.\n  As this Budget shows, we have set clear priorities that meet the most \npressing needs of the American people while addressing the long-term \nchallenges that lie ahead. The 2007 Budget will ensure that future \ngenerations of Americans have the opportunity to live in a Nation that \nis more prosperous and more secure. With this Budget, we are protecting \nour highest ideals and building a brighter future for all.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, February 6, 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S725-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on February 3, 2006, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 4519.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to providing the states with authority to \n     regulate the flow and importation of solid waste from outside \n     the country; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 43\n\n       Whereas, For the past seven years, the amount of solid \n     waste coming into Michigan for disposal has increased from \n     5.6 million cubic yards to over 15 million cubic yards each \n     year. Carefully planned landfill space, intended to be used \n     for solid waste generated in Michigan, is being quickly \n     filled by waste from other states and Canada. Michigan has \n     enacted several laws to control the solid waste stream coming \n     into the state in an attempt to protect our environment, \n     water, and public health; and\n       Whereas, The United States Supreme Court limited the \n     state's ability to further restrict out-of-state waste when \n     it ruled in Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. Michigan \n     Department of Natural Resources that the states do not have \n     authority to regulate or ban the importation of solid waste. \n     The court further ruled that Congress can provide states with \n     such authority by enacting appropriate legislation; and\n       Whereas, United States Representative Mike Rogers has \n     introduced legislation, H.R. 593, to allow Michigan and other \n     states to control the flow of solid waste coming from other \n     countries into their states. Specifically, H.R. 593 would \n     allow Michigan to enact legislation banning or restricting \n     the disposal of Canadian waste in Michigan landfills. \n     Although supported by members of Congress on both sides of \n     the aisle, bills on this topic introduced in prior \n     congressional sessions did not pass the House of \n     Representatives; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact H.R. 593 to provide the states \n     with authority to regulate the flow and importation of solid \n     waste from outside the country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n                                   \n       POM-255.

The Great Lakes have for thousands of \n     years supported native communities' culture and way of life; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Great Lakes fuel Michigan's tourism and \n     recreation industry. Recreational fishing alone adds $1.4 \n     billion annually to the state's economy; and\n       Whereas, The state of Michigan has historically been a \n     leader in protecting the Great Lakes, including efforts to \n     regulate ballast water discharges that could harbor invasive \n     species and to eliminate the disposal of dangerous \n     contaminants in the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Despite Michigan's efforts, the Great Lakes are \n     ailing from a multitude of stressors, including aquatic \n     invasive species, toxic contamination of river and lake \n     sediments, partially or inadequately treated sewage \n     discharges, pollution from nonpoint sources, and coastal \n     habitat loss. Combined, these stressors will have long-\n     lasting effects on the Great Lakes, Michigan's economy, and \n     our way of life; and\n       Whereas, There has been an unprecedented collaborative \n     effort on the part of 1,500 people representing federal, \n     state, and local governments, Native American tribes, \n     nongovernmental entities, and private citizens\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\n     to develop an Action Plan to Restore and Protect the Great \n     Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Implementation of the Action Plan can restore the \n     ecology of the Great Lakes and avert impending environmental \n     threats to the region; and\n       Whereas, A recent report by the federal Great Lakes \n     Interagency Task Force has, at the eleventh hour, attempted \n     to change the rules that the Regional Collaboration operated \n     under by recommending that the strategy be constrained by \n     current budget projections; and\n       Whereas, The action plan previously developed through the \n     Regional Collaboration includes recommendations that call on \n     the states and federal government to take substantial new \n     steps jointly in the restoration and protection of the Great \n     Lakes; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we urge the Great Lakes Regional \n     Collaboration and the United States Congress to take prompt \n     action to finalize, endorse, implement, and invest in the \n     Action Plan to Restore and Protect the Great Lakes; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That we urge the United States Congress to adopt \n     legislation to implement and fully invest in the Action Plan; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That we intend for the state of Michigan to \n     continue its proud tradition of Great Lakes stewardship and \n     fulfill its commitment to restoring the Great Lakes by taking \n     substantial steps and, whenever practical, match federal \n     funding to implement the Action Plan to Restore and Protect \n     the Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, the Great Lakes Commission, the Great Lakes \n     Legislative Caucus, the International Joint Commission, the \n     Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the Michigan Office of the \n     Great Lakes, the Michigan Department of Environmental \n     Quality, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-256.

Combined, these stressors will have long-\n     lasting effects on the Great Lakes, Michigan's economy, and \n     our way of life; and\n       Whereas, There has been an unprecedented collaborative \n     effort on the part of 1,500 people representing federal, \n     state, and local governments, Native American tribes, \n     nongovernmental entities, and private citizens to develop an \n     Action Plan to Restore and Protect the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Implementation of the Action Plan can restore the \n     ecology of the Great Lakes and avert impending environmental \n     threats to the region; and\n       Whereas, A recent report by the federal Great Lakes \n     Interagency Task Force has, at the eleventh hour, attempted \n     to change the rules that the Regional Collaboration operated \n     under by recommending that the strategy be constrained by \n     current budget projections; and\n       Whereas, The action plan previously developed through the \n     Regional Collaboration includes recommendations that call on \n     the states and federal government to take substantial new \n     steps jointly in the restoration and protection of the Great \n     Lakes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     Great Lakes Regional Collaboration and the United States \n     Congress to take prompt action to finalize, endorse, \n     implement, and invest in the Action Plan to Restore and \n     Protect the Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the United States Congress to adopt \n     legislation to implement and fully invest in the Action Plan; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That we intend for the state of Michigan to \n     continue its proud tradition of Great Lakes stewardship and \n     fulfill its commitment to restoring the Great Lakes by taking \n     substantial steps and, whenever practical, match federal \n     funding to implement the Action Plan to Restore and Protect \n     the Great Lakes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, the Great Lakes Commission, the Great Lakes \n     Legislative Caucus, the International Joint Commission, the \n     Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the Michigan Office of the \n     Great Lakes, the Michigan Department of Environmental \n     Quality, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-257. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of Ohio \n     relative to reforming the Medicaid program to ensure the \n     program's solvency for future generations; to the Committee \n     on Finance.\n\n                      Concurrent Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, The Ohio Medicaid program plays a vital role in \n     preserving the health and safety of disabled and working low-\n     income Ohioans, providing essential health care services for \n     nearly one in every six Ohioans, including one of every three \n     Ohio births, and funds 70 per cent of all nursing home care \n     provided in Ohio; and\n       Whereas, Ohio's Medicaid program is growing at a rate of \n     almost twice that of state revenues despite efforts to \n     contain escalating program costs: since 2001, the program's \n     case load has increased 34 per cent; and\n       Whereas, Currently, Ohio Medicaid program expenditures \n     represent 38 per cent of expenditures from the state's \n     General Revenue Fund; and\n       Whereas, Remarkably, 72 per cent of Ohio's Medicaid \n     spending is directed toward the provision of long-term care \n     for elderly and disabled Ohioans--who comprise only 25 per \n     cent of the program's caseload of over 1.7 million Ohioans; \n     and\n       Whereas, To increase the efficiency of the Medicaid \n     program, Ohio has instituted care management programs for \n     certain populations, including those with chronic disease, \n     and has implemented long-term care reform measures; and\n       Whereas, The Ohio Medicaid program provides invaluable \n     assistance to the mentally retarded and developmentally \n     disabled (MR/DD) community. In an effort to maintain this \n     support, the program is seeking to develop strategies that \n     allow the state to continue to use local funds to finance MR/\n     DD services; and\n       Whereas, The overall strength of Ohio's Medicaid program is \n     predicated on the existing financial partnership between the \n     state and federal government; however, should caps on \n     reimbursement rates or cuts in federal funding be imposed, \n     the partnership may be negatively impacted; and\n       Whereas, The federal government and state Medicaid programs \n     must increase collaboration to manage health care benefits \n     and their costs; in Ohio, services for ``dually eligible'' \n     Medicaid recipients--those who are eligible to receive \n     benefits from both Medicaid and Medicare--constitute \n     approximately 44 per cent of Ohio's total Medicaid costs, \n     while the dually eligible population comprises a mere 10 per \n     cent of Ohio's Medicaid recipients; and\n       Whereas, The federal government could provide the Ohio \n     Medicaid program with access to its Medicare payment \n     information, which would help Ohio increase the effectiveness \n     of its Enhanced Care Management project and provide more \n     effective care to Ohio's aged, blind, and disabled Medicaid \n     recipients; and\n       Whereas, Medicaid recipients have benefited greatly from \n     Ohio's commitment to expand significantly its capacity to \n     provide Medicaid services by providing care through home and \n     community-based services waiver programs; and\n       Whereas, Despite Medicaid recipients' preference for home \n     and community-based care and the cost-effectiveness of home \n     and community-based services, federal regulations require the \n     provision of services in an institutional setting, while home \n     and community-based services may be provided only under \n     restricted waiver programs; and\n       Whereas, If the federal government eliminated the \n     institutional bias in long-term care system design and \n     allowed states to detach Medicaid waivers from the nursing \n     home level of care, all Medicaid recipients nationwide would \n     benefit from the ability to choose their care setting; and\n       Whereas, Private financing for both institutional and \n     community-based long-term care services should be encouraged \n     to mitigate the Ohio Medicaid program's existing role as a \n     purchaser of long-term care services; and\n       Whereas, If reinstated by the United States Congress, the \n     Long Term Care Insurance Partnership would also greatly \n     reduce the American public's reliance on publicly funded \n     long-term care services and support; and\n       Whereas, With regard to nursing home care, Ohio is pursuing \n     regulatory reform initiatives and recently applied to the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for \n     consideration of a nursing facility survey pilot program to \n     allow the Ohio Department of Health to focus on facilities \n     that provide substandard care, thereby improving \n     facility residents' health and the overall quality of care \n     delivered in Ohio; and\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\n       Whereas, Partnership with CMS in the Medicare/Medicaid data \n     matching project empowered Ohio to more aggressively pursue \n     fraud and abuse among providers that charge both programs for \n     services; and\n       Whereas, The Ohio Medicaid program would benefit greatly \n     from federal Medicaid policies that honor any approved state \n     Medicaid plan amendments (rather than requiring the \n     interpretation of policy on a case-by-case basis); and\n       Whereas, Federal regulations governing findings for \n     recovery adversely impact the Ohio Medicaid program: the \n     regulations require the state to reimburse the federal \n     government for the service in question within 60 days--\n     regardless of whether the program has recovered the costs \n     itself posing the potential for significant cash flow \n     disruptions within the program; and\n       Whereas, The State of Ohio believes that under the Medicare \n     Modernization Act, the United States Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services has sufficient flexibility to work with states \n     to implement the changes made by the Act and that there \n     exists the need to exercise that authority to mitigate the \n     fiscal impact of Medicare Part D in Ohio, as the \n     implementation of Medicare Part D under the Act will likely \n     have a negative fiscal impact on Ohio's Medicaid program, \n     requiring the program to increase spending for its pharmacy \n     program; and\n       Whereas, The Ohio Medicaid program has enacted measures to \n     more efficiently manage pharmacy benefit costs, but if the \n     program were authorized to determine which drugs are included \n     in the program formulary in a manner similar to that provided \n     under Medicare Part D, the program could manage costs even \n     more effectively; and\n       Whereas, Ohio encourages continued federal support and \n     investment in new technologies that improve the state's \n     ability to manage the Medicaid program and control program \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, In an ongoing effort to encourage behavior changes \n     in Medicaid recipients and to prompt recipients to manage \n     their own benefits, the Ohio Medicaid program seeks \n     authority, on behalf of all state Medicaid programs, to \n     charge Medicaid recipients enforceable copayments for \n     services: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the 126th General \n     Assembly of the State of Ohio, acting on behalf of the \n     citizens of Ohio, strongly urge the Congress of the United \n     States and the United States Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to respond to the specific concerns delineated in \n     this resolution by reforming the Medicaid program to increase \n     Ohio's authority to design Medicaid coverage and services and \n     ensure the program's solvency for future generations; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, to the Speaker and the Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     President Pro Tempore and the Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, to the members of the Ohio Congressional delegation, \n     to the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n     and to the news media of Ohio.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-258. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to \n     changing the coastal line by which the state receives tax and \n     mineral revenue from three miles to twelve miles to be \n     consistent with the states of Texas and Mississippi as it \n     relates to the receipt of federal tax and mineral revenue; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 41\n\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana receives a portion of taxes \n     collected by the United States government on oil extracted in \n     the Gulf of Mexico within three miles from the coast of \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the states of Texas and Mississippi receive a \n     portion of taxes collected by the U.S. government on oil \n     extracted in the Gulf of Mexico within twelve miles from \n     their respective coast lines; and\n       Whereas, fairness and equity dictate that Louisiana should \n     be treated in the same manner as Texas and Mississippi as it \n     relates to the receipt of federal tax and mineral revenue: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     request the Congress of the United States to change the \n     coastal line by which the state receives tax and mineral \n     revenue from three miles to twelve miles to be consistent \n     with Texas and Mississippi as it relates to the receipt of \n     federal mineral revenue; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the Congress of the United States. \n                                  ____\n\n       POM-259. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to supporting policies that protect and encourage \n     the cultural autonomy of the people of Macedonia; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 165\n\n       Whereas, In 1991, 95 percent of the voters of Macedonia \n     voted for independence from Yugoslavia; and\n       Whereas, In 1993, the Republic of Macedonia became a member \n     of the United Nations; and\n       Whereas, In 1994, the United States of America recognized \n     the Republic of Macedonia as a sovereign state, and the \n     Republic of Macedonia was recently cited and honored by \n     President Bush and the United States Department of State for \n     its support in the war with Iraq; and\n       Whereas, There is a large contingency of Macedonians living \n     throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, Macedonians began to immigrate to Michigan in the \n     late 1800s and continue to relocate and flourish here with a \n     strong community ethic; and\n       Whereas, There are more than 60,000 Macedonians now living \n     throughout Michigan; and\n       Whereas, The first, second, third, and fourth generation \n     Macedonians living in Michigan are a positive force \n     contributing to the economic, cultural, and educational basis \n     of this state; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to support policies that protect and encourage the \n     cultural autonomy of the people of Macedonia, including the \n     rights of Macedonians living throughout the Balkans to speak \n     their language, to attend schools and churches offered in \n     their language, to practice their customs, to be able to call \n     themselves Macedonians, and to be granted all the civil and \n     human rights required by international law; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be presented to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives, the President of the United \n     States Senate, and the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-260. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania relative to amending the provision of law \n     requiring applicants for hunting and fishing licenses to \n     provide their Social Security numbers or other identifying \n     numbers by exempting applicants age 16 and under; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 529\n\n       Whereas, Statutory requirements that applications for \n     recreational licenses must include individuals' Social \n     Security numbers or other identifying numbers were enacted by \n     the Congress of the United States in 1997 as part of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-33, 111 Stat. \n     251); and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania implemented this \n     Federal mandate through the act of December 16, 1997 \n     (P.L.549, No.58), entitled ``An act amending Title 23 \n     (Domestic Relations) of the Pennsy1vania Consolidated \n     Statutes, further providing for alimony, for information to \n     consumer reporting agency, for cooperation of government and \n     nongovernment agencies and for general administration of \n     support matters; providing for duties of Title IV-D attorney; \n     further providing for order of support, for mandatory \n     inclusion of child medical support, for commencement of \n     support actions or proceedings, for expedited procedure, for \n     paternity, for attachment of income, for costs and fees, for \n     continuing jurisdiction over support orders, for duty to \n     report and for denial or suspension of licenses;

making repeals; and making editorial changes''; \n     and \n       Whereas, Criminal identity theft and threats to the \n     personal and financial privacy and security of Pennsylvanians \n     are on the rise; and\n       Whereas, Procedures for the collection of Social Security \n     numbers now in use by licensing agents of the Pennsylvania \n     Game Commission and the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission \n     necessitate the collection and storage of vital information \n     in a manner which may jeopardize confidentiality of those \n     numbers; and \n       Whereas, Criticism of the procedures used to gather and \n     safeguard Social Security numbers of applicants has grown \n     steadily, in some cases resulting in applicants simply \n     forgoing the purchase of a license rather than submitting \n     vital personal data to the archaic system now in use by both \n     commissions; and \n       Whereas, The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania strongly supports \n     all effective mechanisms to encourage payment of child \n     support obligations; and \n       Whereas, Requiring applicants for hunting and fishing \n     licenses who are age 16 and under to provide their Social \n     Security numbers or other identifying numbers does not \n     enhance effective enforcement of child support obligations \n     inasmuch as these applicants are highly unlikely to be in \n     arrears on child support payments; and \n\n[[Page S728]]\n\n       Whereas, It is unlikely that the Congress of the United \n     States intended to require applicants for hunting and fishing \n     licenses age 16 and under to be included in this requirement;

A bill to establish an Indian youth telemental health \ndemonstration project; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich would deal in a small but, I hope, meaningful way, with the \ncrisis of youth suicide in Indian Country. On the reservations of the \nNorthern Great Plains, the rate of Indian youth suicide is 10 times \nhigher than it is anywhere else in the country. This needless loss of \nyoung boys and girls whose whole lives lay ahead of them is a very \nserious problem.\n  I am pleased that last year, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee held \ntwo hearings on the tragic issue of teen suicide and the urgent need \nfor prevention, intervention and treatment services. We heard the \ntestimony of youth and family members, representatives of the Indian \nHealth Service and other agencies of the Department of Health and Human \nServices, and Indian professionals who work with young people. We \ncontinue to sift through their recommendations to find possible \nsolutions that could be proposed in legislation.\n  I believe it is urgent that solutions be put forward now to deal with \nthis troubling problem. Following the Committee's second hearing on \nIndian youth suicide last summer, several more Indian young people \nattempted suicide on the Standing Rock Reservation in North and South \nDakota. Thankfully, their lives were spared and their attempts not \ncompleted. But time is running out for addressing this tragic issue.\n  When the Indian Affairs Committee marked up legislation to amend and \nreauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act last October, I \noffered, with Senators Conrad and Smith, an amendment which had three \ncomponents, all of which were presented as ideas at the Committee's \nhearing in Washington, DC, on June 15, 2005, on Indian youth suicide. I \nam very pleased that my amendment was unanimously adopted.\n\n  The legislation which I introduce today parallels one part of that \namendment to the Indian health reauthorization bill, and would \nauthorize the Indian Youth Telemental Health Demonstration Project. The \nSecretary of Health and Human Services would award grants under this 4-\nyear demonstration project to five Indian Tribes and Tribal \nOrganizations that have telehealth capabilities. Grantees would provide \nservices through telemental health for such purposes as counseling of \nIndian youth for suicide prevention, intervention and treatment; \nproviding medical advice and other assistance to frontline tribal \nhealth providers; training for tribal community members, elected \nofficials, tribal educators and health workers and others who work with \nIndian youth; developing culturally-sensitive materials on suicide \nprevention and intervention; and data collection and reporting.\n  My proposal has been revised since it was adopted as an amendment to \nthe Indian health reauthorization bill in response to Administration \nconcerns about expanding new health care programs or services to Native \nAmericans living in urban areas. I will leave the Federal Government's \nobligation to provide health care to urban Indians--most of whom are in \nurban areas because they or their parents or relatives were relocated \nfrom their reservations or Alaska Native communities under federal \npolicy--to be discussed another day.\n  Many Indian reservations and Native villages in Alaska are in remote \nlocations and quite isolated, and experience much more limited access \nto mental health services than in our nation's cities. The testimony \nreceived by the Indian Affairs Committee showed that it is particularly \nin these communities that there is a crisis among the youth. \nAccordingly, the bill I propose today is intended to provide services \nfor counseling, medical advice and training and educational materials \nunder this new demonstration project to Indian youth living on \nreservations and in Native villages.\n  I thank my colleagues who have joined me in this initiative and who \nhave added thoughtful insights for ways to address this crisis that \ndeprives many tribal communities of one of the richest resources, our \nyouth. I look forward to continuing our efforts and developing a more \ncomprehensive legislative proposal on this sensitive and very important \nissue. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill as introduced be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2245\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote greater use of information technology in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program under chapter 89 of title \n5, United States Code, to increase efficiency and reduce costs; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, the American people are facing two, major \nhealth care crises--lack of health insurance and the soaring costs of \nmedical care. Nearly 46 million Americans are uninsured, and the number \none reason is because they can't afford it. Even those with health \ninsurance are struggling to pay their medical bills. Family incomes \ncan't keep up with rising health costs--health premiums alone have \nincreased 73 percent over the past 5 years, while wages have only risen \n15 percent. Unfortunately, we can't fix either of these crises without \naddressing the other. As health care costs rise, more employers will \ndrop coverage for their employees. As the number of uninsured rise, the \ncost of their care is subsidized by those individuals that have \ninsurance. It's a vicious cycle, and the longer we wait to act, the \nmore difficult it will be to successfully intervene.\n  There are many drivers of health care costs, but perhaps the easiest \none to tackle is the wasteful, administrative costs associated with \nhealth care. Health care is one of the least efficient industries in \nAmerica. Processing a single transaction in health care can cost as \nmuch as $25, whereas banks and brokerages spend less than a penny per \ntransaction. Indeed, administrative costs account for 31 percent of \ntotal health care spending, or roughly $465 billion each and every \nyear.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill that would help to reduce health care \nadministrative costs in the Nation's largest employer-sponsored health \ninsurance program, the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. FEHBP \nserves over 8 million Federal Government employees, retirees, and their \nfamilies, who can choose from over 200 health plan options. The FEHBP \nEfficiency Act of 2006 would require all health plans participating in \nFEHBP to develop systems for hospitals and doctors to submit their \nbills electronically within 4 years.\n  Ken Thorpe, a health economist at Emory University, has reported that \nif all FEHBP participating health plans switched to electronic systems \nfor submission of bills, the program could save up to 2 percent of the \n$31 billion in\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\ntotal premiums, or over $600 million every year. That is a tremendous \namount of savings--money that could be used to expand FEHBP benefits, \nincrease the number of eligible employees, or lower premiums for FEHBP \nbeneficiaries. Using its tremendous purchasing power, the Federal \nGovernment could help spur the health care industry to move to a \ncompletely paperless system for processing transactions in all \ngovernment health programs as well as the private sector.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to increase efficiency \nand reduce costs. Every American should have access to affordable \nhealth care, and this bill is one step towards making that a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/06/senate-section/article/S731-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
