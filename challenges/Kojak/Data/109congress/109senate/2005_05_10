Mr. President, last week, I had the opportunity to travel \nthroughout the Middle East. My stops included Israel, the West Bank, \nJordan, Lebanon, and Egypt. It was a fascinating and illuminating trip \nfor me.\n  We saw firsthand many of the challenges facing that region. I came \naway with a much greater appreciation for the remarkable developments \nwe have witnessed in that part of the world in recent months: The \nelections in the Palestinian Authority, the Cedar revolution in \nLebanon, and the significant reforms taking place in Egypt. Progress \nand democracy are on the march.\n  Our first stop was in Jerusalem where we had the chance to explore \nthe rich history of the old city, the heart of three of the world's \nmajor religions. We visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the \nTemple Mount, the Western Wall. We had the opportunity to witness the \nsite that is familiar to anyone who travels to that wonderful city of \nfaiths. People were practicing their beliefs side by side, ways that in \nmany ways are very different. That gives real confidence for the future \nwhen you experience it. I was truly overwhelmed, once again, by the old \ncity's holiness and sense of history.\n  We met with several Israeli political leaders. Senator Lieberman and \nI met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Much of our discussion focused \non that roadmap. The Prime Minister discussed with us his courageous \ndecision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. We discussed all of the \ncontentious issues, issues such as those surrounding settlements. We \ndiscussed the importance of coordinating the withdrawal from the Gaza \nStrip with the Palestinians in order to ensure stability in the Gaza \nStrip and to ensure security in the Gaza Strip after the withdrawal. A \nlot of attention was placed on the withdrawal out of the Gaza Strip \nwherever we moved throughout the Middle East.\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nI believe the Prime Minister's Gaza disengagement plan is a bold step. \nIt is a historic step.\n  The success of his plan, however, will ultimately depend on the \nPalestinians' ability to stop terrorist acts, to strengthen democratic \ninstitutions, to provide security and to deliver tangible benefits to \nthe Palestinian people. The Palestinian people have great expectations. \nIt will be up to their government to deliver tangible benefits to open \ntheir world to something that is concrete but more importantly, to hope \nfor the future.\n  We also met with former Cabinet member Natan Sharansky; Knesset \nspeaker Reuven Rivlin, and foreign affairs and defense committee \nchairman Yuval Steinitz. All three of these individuals were opposed to \nthe withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. They are all gravely concerned \nabout the militarization of the Sinai and weapons smuggling from the \nsouth up into Gaza. It was important to hear their views on these \ncritical matters. I share their concern.\n  The withdrawal plan is understandably controversial and difficult for \nmany families living in the Gaza Strip. I also believe withdrawal is a \ncrucial step toward securing a lasting peace in that part of the world.\n  Our discussion confirmed my belief that the withdrawal must be \ncoordinated with the Palestinian Authority so that the Palestinian \nAuthority can prevent attacks against Israel and make tangible progress \ntoward the roadmap.\n  Right now, there is an opening for huge progress. Both sides have the \nopportunity to build the trust that will be necessary for negotiations \non what we all know will be the most controversial issues. Both sides \nhave to fulfill their obligations.\n  To begin, Palestinians must dismantle the terrorist groups and stop \nall terrorist attacks against Israel. For the Israelis, it is critical \nto halt settlement activity and expansion. Much more will need to be \ndone as we move along the roadmap.\n  In our conversation with Prime Minister Sharon, we also discussed our \nmutual concern about Iran's nuclear ambitions. We agree that a nuclear-\narmed Iran poses a threat to Israel, the region, to Europe, and to the \nUnited States. In my view, the United States must support the work of \nour European allies to end diplomatically Iran's nuclear ambitions. \nFailing that, we must take the issue directly to the United Nations \nSecurity Council for action.\n  A final meeting was with Finance Minister and former Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu. He is working hard to ease the tax burden in order \nto stimulate his country's economy. He has made remarkable progress. \nHis plan is gaining success. The Israeli economy right now is growing. \nThe economic output, in fact, is growing at a robust annual rate of 4 \npercent. If he is able to make further reforms, I believe we can expect \ncontinued and possibly even better growth in the future.\n  As a physician, at most of these stops I take a few hours off to go \nto a hospital or a clinic where I have a little picture or window of \nthe realities of what is going on in the country. I meet with doctors, \nnurses, and patients and ask them questions very directly. I went to \nthe Hadassah Hospital, where I had not been, in Jerusalem. It is a \nlarge tertiary care hospital supported by a number of individuals in \nthe United States. We toured the trauma unit, unique anywhere in the \nworld in that it has seen more suicide attack victims than any trauma \nunit. In fact, they were telling me that there have been 32 suicide \nattacks in the last 3 years. Each of these suicide attacks--really, \nnever thought about a decade ago there at the hospital--involved on \naverage about 80 injured people; each one, on average, killing about 10 \nindividuals. From an observer's standpoint, it points to the reality of \nwhat has gone on in that part of the world over the last 4 years.\n\n  We also talked a lot about the potential for biological attack as \nwell as chemical attack and their preparedness from the hospital \nfacility standpoint.\n  All in all, my trip to Jerusalem confirmed my confidence in the \nstrength of our very special relationship with Israel and the need for \ncontinued American support for this vital friend and ally. Israel \nstands for what America stands for. Ultimately, it is up to the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians to meet face to face and make the \ndifficult decisions that will lead to peace.\n  My meetings with Israel's leaders reinforce my belief they are \nwilling to take the difficult steps. I will continue to do what I can \nto support them in their efforts.\n  In closing, tomorrow I will speak very briefly on my trip to the West \nBank. I do believe peace can be achieved. I look forward to sharing \nwith my colleagues some of the observations and the lessons I have \nlearned in my interactions with the people in the Middle East.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4798-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of \nPresident Bush's first judicial nominations, a group of 11 highly \nqualified men and women nominated to the U.S. courts of appeals.\n  As I said in the East Room at the White House on May 9, 2001: I hope \nthe Senate will at least treat these nominees fairly. Many of our \nDemocratic colleagues instead chose to follow their minority leader's \norder issued days after President Bush took office, to use ``whatever \nmeans necessary'' to defeat judicial nominees the minority does not \nlike.\n  While the previous 3 Presidents saw their first 11 appeals court \nnominees confirmed in an average of just 81 days, today, 1,461 days \nlater, 3 of those original nominees have not even received a vote, let \nalone been confirmed. Three have withdrawn.\n  In 2003, the minority opened a new front in the confirmation conflict \nby using filibusters to defeat majority-supported judicial nominees. \nThis morning I will briefly address the top 10 most ridiculous judicial \nfilibuster defenses. Time permits only brief treatment, but it was \ndifficult to limit the list to 10.\n  No. 10 is the claim that these filibusters are part of Senate \ntradition. Calling something a filibuster, even if you repeat it over \nand over, does not make it so. These filibusters block confirmation of \nmajority-supported judicial nominations by defeating votes to invoke \ncloture or end debate. Either these filibusters happened before or they \ndid not.\n  Let me take the evidence offered by filibuster proponents at face \nvalue. Let me refer to these two charts. These two charts list some \nrepresentative examples of what Democrats repeatedly claim is \nfilibuster precedence. The Senate confirmed each of these \nnominations. As ridiculous as it sounds, filibuster proponents claim, \nwith a straight face, by the way, that confirming these past \nnominations justifies refusing to confirm nominations today.\n\n  Some examples are more ridiculous than others. Stephen Breyer is on \nthe Democrats' list of filibusters, suggesting that the Senate treated \nhis nomination the way Democrats are treating President Bush's \nnominations today. The two situations could not be more different. Even \nthough President Carter nominated now-Justice Breyer but then attorney \nBreyer, law professor Breyer, in November 1980, after losing his bid \nfor reelection--that is when he nominated him--and after Democrats lost \ncontrol of the Senate, we voted to end debate and overwhelmingly \nconfirmed Stephen Breyer just 26 days after his nomination. And I had a \nlot to do with that. The suggestion that confirming the Breyer \nnomination for the party losing its majority now justifies \nfilibustering nominations for the party keeping its majority is, well, \njust plain ridiculous.\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\n  No. 9 on the list of the most ridiculous filibuster defenses is that \nthey are necessary, they say, to prevent one-party rule from stacking \nthe Federal bench. Now, if you win elections, you say the country has \nchosen its leadership. If you lose, you complain about one-party rule. \nWhen your party controls the White House, the President appoints \njudges. When the other party controls the White House, the President \nstacks the bench--at least that seems to be the attitude.\n  Our Democratic colleagues say we should be guided by how the \nDemocratic Senate handled Franklin Roosevelt's attempt to pack the \nSupreme Court. It is true that FDR's legislative proposal to create new \nSupreme Court seats failed, and without a filibuster, I might add. But \nas it turned out, packing the Supreme Court required only filling the \nexisting seats. President Roosevelt packed the Court all right, by \nappointing no less than eight Justices in 6 years--more than any \nPresident, except George Washington himself.\n  This chart is an answer to FDR's court packing without a filibuster. \nNow, let me just make some points. As the chart shows, during the 75th, \n76th, and 77th Congresses, when President Roosevelt made those \nnominations, Democrats outnumbered Republicans by an average of 70 \nDemocrats to 20 Republicans. Now, that is one-party rule. Yet the \nSenate confirmed those Supreme Court nominees in an average of just 13 \ndays, one of them on the very day it was made and six of them without \neven a rollcall vote. That is not because filibustering judicial \nnominations was difficult. In fact, our cloture rule did not then apply \nto nominations. A single Member of that tiny, beleaguered Republican \nminority could have filibustered these nominations and attempted to \nstop President Roosevelt from packing the Supreme Court--just a single \nMember could have.\n  The most important number on this chart is the number right at the \nbottom: the number of filibusters against President Roosevelt's \nnominees--zero.\n  No. 8 on this list is the claim that without the filibuster the \nSenate would be a patsy, nothing but a rubberstamp for the President's \njudicial nominations. To paraphrase a great Supreme Court Justice: If \nsimply stating this argument does not suffice to refute it, our debate \nabout these issues has achieved terminal silliness. Being on the losing \nside does not make one a rubberstamp.\n  For all of these centuries of democratic government, have we seen \nonly winners and rubberstamps? Was the famous tag line for ABC's Wide \nWorld of Sports ``the thrill of victory and the agony of \nrubberstamping''? Democrats did not start filibustering judicial \nnominations until the 108th Congress. Imagine the history books \ndescribing the previous 107 Senates as the great rubberstamp Senates. \nDid Democrats rubberstamp the Supreme Court nomination of Clarence \nThomas in 1991 since they did not use the filibuster? That conflict \nlasting several months and concluding with that 52-to-48 confirmation \nvote did not look like a rubberstamp to me.\n  Some modify this ridiculous argument by saying this applies when one \nparty controls both the White House and the Senate. They make the \nstunning observation that Senators of the President's party are likely \nto vote for his nominees. The assistant minority leader, Senator \nDurbin, recently said, for example, that Republican Senators are \nnothing but ``lapdogs'' for President Bush.\n  Pointing at others can be dangerous because you have a few fingers \npointing back at yourself. Counting both unanimous consent or rollcall \nvotes, more than 37,500 votes were cast here on the Senate floor on \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominations. Only 11 of them, just a \nteeny, tiny, three one-hundredths of 1 percent, were ``no'' votes from \nDemocrats--only 11 of 37,500. Were they just rubberstamping lapdogs in \nsupporting President Clinton?\n  The Constitution assigns the same roles to the President and the \nSenate no matter which party the American people put in charge of which \nend of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  In the 1960s, the Democrats were in charge, yet Minority Leader \nEverett Dirksen refused to filibuster judicial nominees of Presidents \nKennedy or Johnson. Was he just a rubberstamp?\n\n  In the 1970s, the Democrats were in charge, yet Minority Leader \nHoward Baker refused to filibuster President Carter's judicial \nnominees. Was he just a rubberstamp?\n  In the 1980s, the Republicans were in charge, yet Minority Leader \nRobert Byrd did not filibuster President Reagan's judicial nominees. \nWas he just a rubberstamp?\n  And a decade ago, the Democrats were again in charge, yet Minority \nLeader Bob Dole refused to filibuster President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. Was he a rubberstamp?\n  To avoid being a rubberstamp, one need only fight the good fight, win \nor lose.\n  No. 7 on the list of most ridiculous judicial filibuster defenses is \nthat these filibusters are necessary to preserve our system of checks \nand balances. That is an argument we have heard from the other side.\n  Mr. President, any civics textbook explains that what we call \n``checks and balances'' regulates the relationship between the branches \nof Government. The Senate's role of advice and consent checks the \nPresident's power to appoint judges, and we exercise that check when we \nvote on his judicial nominations.\n  The filibuster is about the relationship between the majority and \nminority in the Senate, not about the relationship between the Senate \nand the President. It actually interferes with being a check on the \nPresident's power by preventing the Senate from exercising its role of \nadvice and consent at all.\n  Former Majority Leader Mike Mansfield once explained that by \nfilibustering judicial nominations, individual Senators presume what he \ncalled ``great personal privilege at the expense of the \nresponsibilities of the Senate as a whole, and at the expense of the \nconstitutional structure of the federal government.''\n  In September 1999, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, \nexpressed the same view when he said:\n\n       It is true that some Senators have voiced concerns about \n     these nominations. But that should not prevent a roll call \n     vote which gives every Senator the opportunity to vote \n     ``yes'' or ``no.''\n\n  Those were the words of our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy: Give every Senator the opportunity to vote yes or no.\n  That was then; this is now.\n  In case anyone needs further clarification on this point, I ask \nunanimous consent that the definition of ``checks and balances'' from \ntwo sources, ``congressforkids.net'' and ``socialstudieshelp.com,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Definition of checks and balances from \n     www.congressforkids.org.\n       ``By creating three branches of government, the delegates \n     built a `check and balance' system into the Constitution.''\n       Definition of checks and balances from \n     www.socialstudieshelp.com.\n       ``In this system the government was to be divided into \n     three branches of government, each branch having particular \n     powers. Not only does each branch of the government have \n     particular powers, each branch has certain powers of the \n     other branches.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. No. 6 on the list is that these filibusters are necessary \nto prevent appointment of extremists.\n  What our Democratic colleagues call ``extreme'' the American Bar \nAssociation calls ``qualified.'' In fact, all three of the appeals \ncourt nominees chosen 4 years ago who have been denied confirmation \nreceived the ABA's highest ``well qualified'' rating. Now, that was the \ngold standard under the Democrats when Clinton was President. The same \nDemocrats who once called the ABA rating the gold standard for \nevaluating judicial nominees now disregard it and call these people \nextreme.\n  Did 76 percent of Californians vote to keep an extremist on their \nsupreme court when they voted to retain Justice Janice Rogers Brown, an \nAfrican-American woman, a sharecroppers' daughter, who fought her way \nall the way up to the Supreme Court of California?\n  Did 84 percent of all Texans and every major newspaper in the State \nsupport an extremist when they reelected Justice Priscilla Owen to the \nTexas Supreme Court--84 percent?\n  The Associated Press reported last Friday that the minority leader \nreserves the right to filibuster what he\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\ncalls ``extreme'' Supreme Court nominees. Now, that is quite an escape \nhatch, if you will, since the minority already defines any nominee it \ndoes not like as ``extreme.'' This is simply a repackaged status quo \nmasquerading as reform.\n  If Senators want to dismiss as an extremist any judicial nominee who \ndoes not think exactly as they do, that certainly is their right. That \nis, however, a reason for voting against a confirmation, not for \nrefusing to vote at all. As our former colleague, Tom Daschle, said:\n\n       I find it simply baffling that a Senator would vote against \n     even voting on a judicial nominee.\n\n  No. 5 on this list of most ridiculous judicial filibuster defenses is \nthe claim that these filibusters are about free speech and debate. If \nSenators cannot filibuster judicial nominations, some say, the Senate \nwill cease to exist, and we will be literally unable to represent our \nconstituents.\n  The same men who founded this Republic designed this Senate without \nthe ability to filibuster anything at all. A simple majority could \nproceed to vote on something after sufficient debate. Among those first \nSenators were Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, who later served on the \nSupreme Court, as well as Charles Carroll of Maryland and Richard Henry \nLee of Virginia, who had signed the Declaration of Independence. When \nthey ran for office, did they know that they would be unable to \nrepresent their States because they would be unable to filibuster?\n  These filibusters are about defeating judicial nominations, not \ndebating them. The minority rejects every proposal for debating and \nvoting on nominations it targets for defeat.\n  In April 2003, my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, asked him, \nthe minority leader, how many hours Democrats would need to debate a \nparticular nomination. Now, just take a look at chart 4. His response \nspoke volumes:\n\n       [T]here is not a number [of hours] in the universe that \n     would be sufficient.\n\n  Let me just refer to chart 5.\n  Later that year, he said:\n\n       We would not agree to a time agreement . . . of any \n     duration.\n\n  Let me go to chart 6. Just 2 weeks ago, the minority leader summed up \nwhat really has been the Democrats' position all along:\n\n       This has never been about the length of the debate.\n\n  He is right about that. This has always been about defeating \nnominations, not debating them. If our Democratic colleagues want to \ndebate, then let us debate. The majority leader said we will give 100 \nhours for each of these nominees. Let's debate them. Let us do what \nDemocrats once said was the purpose of debating judicial nominations. \nAs my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, put it in January 1998:\n\n       [L]et these names come up, let us have debate, let us vote.\n\n  No. 4 on the list is that returning to Senate tradition regarding \nfloor votes on judicial nominations would amount to breaking the rules \nto change the rules. As any consultant worth even a little salt will \ntell you, that is a catchy little phrase. The problem is that neither \nof its catchy little parts is true.\n  The constitutional option, which would change judicial confirmation \nprocedure through the Senate voting to affirm a parliamentary ruling, \nwould neither break nor change Senate rules. While the constitutional \noption has not been used to break our rules, it has been used to break \nfilibusters.\n  On January 4, 1995, the Senator from West Virginia, the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Byrd, described how, in 1977, when he was majority leader, \nhe used this procedure to break a filibuster on a natural gas bill. \nNow, I have genuine affection and great respect for the Senator from \nWest Virginia, and he knows that. But let me just refer to chart 7. \nSince I would not want to describe his repeated use of the \nconstitutional option in a pejorative way, let me use his own words. \nHere is what he said back in 1995, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia:\n\n       I have seen filibusters. I have helped to break them. There \n     are few Senators in this body who were here [in 1977] when I \n     broke the filibuster on the natural gas bill. . . . I asked \n     Mr. Mondale, the Vice President, to go please sit in the \n     chair; I wanted to make some points of order and create some \n     new precedents that would break these filibusters. And the \n     filibuster was broken--back, neck, legs, and arms. . . . So I \n     know something about filibusters. I helped to set a great \n     many of the precedents that are on the books here.\n\n  Well, he certainly did. I was here. And using the constitutional \noption today to return to Senate tradition regarding judicial \nnominations would simply use the precedents the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia put on the books.\n  No. 3 on the list of most ridiculous judicial filibuster defenses is \nthat the constitutional option is unprecedented, or should we call it \nthe Byrd option. In 1977, 1979, and 1987, the then majority leader, \nSenator Byrd, secured a favorable parliamentary ruling through a point \nof order and a majority of Senators voted to affirm it. He did this \neven when the result he sought was inconsistent with the text of our \nwritten rules.\n  In 1980, he used a version of the same procedure to limit nomination-\nrelated filibusters. Majority Leader Byrd made a motion for the Senate \nto vote to go into executive session and proceed to consider a specific \nnomination. At the time, the first step was not debatable but the \nsecond step was debatable. A majority of Senators voted to overturn a \nparliamentary ruling disallowing the procedural change Majority Leader \nByrd wanted.\n  Let me refer to chart 8. Seven of these Senators serve with us today, \nand their names appear on this chart. They can explain for themselves \nhow voting against restricting nomination-related filibusters today is \nconsistent with voting to restrict them in 1980. As you can see, they \nare illustrious colleagues.\n  No. 2 on the list is that preventing judicial filibusters will doom \nlegislative filibusters. As you know, there are two calendars in the \nSenate. One is the legislative calendar. I would fight to my death to \nkeep the filibuster alive on the legislative calendar to protect the \nminority. But then there is the executive calendar, which is partly the \nPresident's in the sense that he has the power of appointment and \nnomination and sends these people up here and expects advice and \nconsent from the Senate. Advice we give. Consent we have not given in \nthe case of these nominees who have been filibustered, or so-called \nfilibustered.\n  No. 2 on the list is that preventing judicial filibusters, they \nclaim, will doom legislative filibusters. That's pure bunk. Our own \nSenate history shows how ridiculous this argument really is. \nFilibusters became possible by dropping the rule allowing a simple \nmajority to proceed to a vote. The legislative filibuster developed, \nthe judicial filibuster did not. What we must today limit by rule or \nruling we once limited by principle or self-restraint--for 214 years, \nthat is. The filibuster is an inappropriate obstacle to the President's \njudicial appointment power but an appropriate tool for exercising our \nown legislative power. I cannot fathom how returning to our tradition \nregarding judicial nominations will somehow threaten our tradition \nregarding legislation. The only threat to the legislative filibuster \nand the only votes to abolish have come from the other side of the \naisle. In 1995, 19 Senators, all Democrats, voted against tabling an \namendment to our cloture rule that would prohibit all filibusters of \nlegislation as well as nominations. As this chart shows, nine of those \nSenators still serve with us and their names are right here on this \nchart.\n  I voted then against the Democrats' proposal to eliminate the \nlegislative filibuster, and I oppose eliminating it today. The majority \nleader, Senator Frist, also voted against the Democrats' proposal to \neliminate the legislative filibuster. In fact, that was his first vote \nas a new Member of this body. I joined him in recommitting ourselves to \nprotecting the legislative filibuster. I urge my friends on the other \nside, the Democrats, to follow the example of our colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer, who recently said that she has changed her \nposition, that she no longer wants to eliminate the legislative \nfilibuster.\n  In 1995, USA Today condemned the filibuster as ``a pedestrian tool of \npartisans and gridlock meisters.''\n  The New York Times said the filibuster is ``the tool of the sore \nloser.'' I hope these papers will reconsider their position and support \nthe legislative filibuster.\n  The No. 1 most ridiculous judicial filibuster defense is that those \nwanting\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\nto filibuster Republican nominees today opposed filibustering \nDemocratic nominees only a few years ago. In a letter dated February 4, \n1998, for example, the leftwing urged confirmation of Margaret Morrow \nto the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. They \nurged us to ``bring the nomination to the Senate, ensure that it \nreceived prompt, full and fair consideration, and that a final vote on \nher nomination is scheduled as soon as possible.'' Groups signing this \nletter included the Alliance for Justice, Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights, and People for the American Way. As we all know, these \nleftwing groups today lead the grassroots campaign behind these \nfilibusters that would deny this same treatment to President Bush's \nnominees. Their position has changed as the party controlling the White \nHouse has changed.\n  Let me make it easy for the ``hypocrite patrol'' to check out my \nposition on the Morrow nomination. In the February 11, 1998, \nCongressional Record, on page S640, three pages before that letter from \nthe leftwing groups appears, I opened the debate on the Morrow \nnomination by strongly urging my fellow Senators to support it. We did, \nand she is, today, a sitting Federal judge, as I believe she should be. \nThe same Democrats who today call for filibusters called for up-or-down \nvotes when a Democrat was in the White House.\n  Let me refer to chart 10 here. I will just give some illustrations. \nIn 1999, my dear friend from California, Senator Feinstein, a person I \nhave great love and respect for, a Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, said of the Senate:\n\n       It is our job to confirm these judges. If we don't like \n     them, we can vote against them.\n\n  She said:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up, vote them \n     down.\n\n  Let me go to chart 11. Another committee member, Senator Schumer, \nproperly said in March 2000:\n\n       The President nominates and we are charged with voting on \n     the nominees.\n\n  He was right.\n  Let me refer to chart 12. I have already quoted the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer once, but in 2000 she said that filibustering \njudicial nominees:\n\n     . . . would be such a twisting of what cloture really means \n     in these cases. It has never been done before for a judge, as \n     far as we know--ever.\n\n  I appreciate what another member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nKohl, said in 1997:\n\n       Let's breathe life back into the confirmation process. \n     Let's vote on the nominees who have already been approved by \n     the Judiciary Committee.\n\n  Well, let me go to chart 14. The Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, \nwho fought so strongly against the legislative filibuster in 1995, \nsaid, 5 years later, about the judicial filibuster:\n\n       If they want to vote against them, let them vote against \n     them. But at least have a vote.\n\n  The same view comes from three former Judiciary Committee chairmen, \nmembers of the Democratic leadership. Let me refer to chart No. 15. A \nformer committee chairman, Senator Biden, said in 1977 that every \njudicial nominee is entitled:\n\n       To have a shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on \n     the floor.\n\n  Former chairman, Senator Edward Kennedy, said in 1998:\n\n       If Senators don't like them, vote against them. But give \n     them a vote.\n\n  And my immediate predecessor as chairman, Senator Leahy, said a year \nlater, judicial nominees are:\n\n     entitled to a vote, aye or nay.\n\n  Now, the assistant minority leader, Senator Durbin, had urged the \nsame thing in September 1998:\n\n       Vote the person up or down.\n\n  Vote the person up or down.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the minority leader, Senator Reid, expressed \nin March 2000 the standard that I hope we can reestablish:\n\n       Once they get out of committee, bring them down here and \n     vote up or down on them.\n\n  The majority leader, Senator Frist, recently proposed a plan to \naccomplish precisely this result. But the minority leader dismissed it \nas--I want to quote this accurately now--\n\n       A big fat wet kiss to the far right.\n\n  I never thought voting on judicial nominations was a far-right thing \nto do.\n  These statements speak for themselves. Do you see a pattern here? The \nmessage at one time seems to be let us debate and let us vote. That \nshould be the standard, no matter which party controls the White House \nor the Senate.\n  Mr. President, as I close, let me summarize these 10 top most \nridiculous judicial filibusters in this way. Blocking confirmation of \nmajority-supported judicial nominations by defeating cloture votes is \nunprecedented. In the words of the current Judiciary Committee \nchairman, Senator Specter:\n\n       What Democrats are doing here is really seeking a \n     constitutional revolution.\n\n  We must turn back that revolution. No matter which party controls the \nWhite House or Senate, we should return to our tradition of giving \njudicial nominations reaching the Senate floor an up-or-down vote. \nFull, fair, and vigorous debate is one of the hallmarks of this body, \nand it should drive how we evaluate a President's judicial nominations.\n  Honoring the Constitution's separation of power, however, requires \nthat our check on the President's appointment power not highjack that \npower altogether. This means debate must be a means to an end rather \nthan an end in itself. Senators are free to vote against the nominees \nthey feel extreme, but they should not be free to prevent other \nSenators from expressing a contrary view or advising and consenting. In \nthis body, we govern ourselves with parliamentary rulings as well as by \nunwritten rules. The procedure of a majority of Senators voting to \nsustain a parliamentary ruling has been used repeatedly to change \nSenate procedure without changing Senate rules, even to limit \nnomination-related filibusters.\n  I have tried to deal with the substance of our filibuster proponents' \narguments, albeit with some humor and maybe a touch of sarcasm. A few \ndays ago, as the Salt Lake Tribune reported, the minority leader was in \nmy State:\n\n     . . . stopping just short of calling Utah Senator Orrin Hatch \n     a hypocrite.\n\n  That is at least how the newspaper described it. That is not what I \nconsider to be a substantive argument. Perhaps those who dismiss their \nopponents as liars, losers, or lap dogs have nothing else to offer in \nthis debate. Yet debate we must, and then we must vote.\n  Mr. President, how much remaining time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just make this point. We confirmed, in 6 years of \nRepublican control of the Senate, 377 judges for President Clinton. \nThat was five less than the all-time confirmation champion Ronald \nReagan. All of these people who are up have well-qualified ratings from \nthe ABA, all had a bipartisan majority to support them. What is wrong \nwith giving them an up-or-down vote and retaining 214 years of Senate \ntradition? What is wrong with that? I think it is wrong to try and blow \nup that tradition the way it is being done.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Chair advise as to how much time remains on \nthis side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One-half hour remains on the \nSenator's side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4801-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4801-S4805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RULES OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As the Senate convenes this week, we stand on the edge of dramatic \nchange. Change is usually a good thing, but the change that the other \nside is trying to invoke is not a good thing. We all know it. Most \nAmericans know it. Most Democrats know it. Most Republicans\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nknow it. Even most Senators on the other side know it. Yet they are \ntorn because of a small group way out of the mainstream. The same \npeople who believe their message, which may come from the heavens, \ndictates to them what is right for everybody else seem to be in \ncontrol. It is a crucial time for America. The age-old checks and \nbalances that are at the center of this Republic, at the center of our \nConstitution, are hanging at the precipice.\n  It is the Senate where the Founding Fathers established a repository \nof checks and balances. It is not like the House of Representatives \nwhere the majority leader or the Speaker can snap his fingers and get \nwhat he wants. Here we work many times by unanimous consent where you \nneed all 100 Senators to go along. In some instances, we work where 67 \nvotes are needed, in some with 60, and in most with 51. But the reason \nwe don't always work by majority rule is very simple. On important \nissues, the Founding Fathers wanted--and they were correct in my \njudgment--that the slimmest majority should not always govern. When it \ncomes to vital issues, that is what they wanted.\n  The Senate is not a majoritarian body. My good friend from Utah \nspoke. He represents about two million people in Utah. I represent 19 \nmillion in New York State. We have the same vote. You could have 51 \nvotes for a judge on this floor that represents 21 percent of the \nAmerican people. So the bottom line is very simple. This has not always \nbeen a 50.1 to 49.9 body. It has been a body that has had to work by \nits rules and by the Founding Fathers' intent. Even when you are in the \nmajority, you have to reach out and meet not all, not most, but some of \nthe concerns of the minority.\n  I understand why my colleague from Utah would get up and make such \nridiculous arguments. He is torn. He knows this is wrong. Most of the \nMembers on the other side of the aisle know it is wrong. Some have had \nthe guts--a handful--to say no. Some have had the strength to resist \nthe calls of that extreme group or groups. Some are true believers. But \nsome, and my guess is my friend from Utah is one of those, know it is \nwrong but decide: I am going along anyway.\n  When my friend from Utah lists the 10 most ridiculous arguments \nagainst keeping the filibuster and says checks and balances is a \nridiculous argument, please. I care a great deal about my friend from \nUtah. He is a fine man. We are friends. We have worked together on many \nthings. But he has more respect for the Constitution than to say checks \nand balances is a ridiculous argument. He knows darn well that a 51-to-\n49 vote does away with certain kinds of checks and balances.\n  When my friend from Utah talks about no extremists, it seems to me \nthe very same people who are calling the shots are the people who said \nthat judges are worse than terrorists. That seems pretty extreme to me. \nThat is the type of person importuning my friend from Utah.\n  Another one said: Judges, in their black robes, are like the Ku Klux \nKlan in their white robes. These are officials of the American \nGovernment, most of whom now are Republicans. Sixty percent of the \ncourt of appeals are Republican appointees. Seven of the nine Supreme \nCourt members are Republican appointees.\n\n  When my friend from Utah doesn't think those statements are extreme \nand listens to the solution that people who make those statements \nprescribe, what else can one conclude than that he is sort of tying \nhimself in a pretzel to try and make an argument that he must know in \nhis heart is wrong.\n  Unprecedented? Well, it was my good friend from Utah who played a \nleading role in blocking a large number of the Clinton judges. He will \nsay it wasn't by filibuster. The American people are a lot smarter than \nthat. Whether it is by not bringing them up for a vote in committee or \nby requiring that they get 60 votes to choke off debate on the floor, \nthe effect is the same. The President, the incumbent, is denied his \nchoice. By the way, that is how our Senate has functioned.\n  The President, when he gets 51.5 percent, as George Bush did, or even \nwhen he gets over 65 percent, as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1936, \nshouldn't always get his way with every single judge.\n  He says that this will not doom the legislative filibuster, that that \nis an absurd argument. A year ago, if we would have heard that the \nRepublican majority was considering having the Vice President sit in \nthe chair and rule by fiat his own interpretation of the Constitution, \ncoming out of nowhere because the Constitution doesn't mention any of \nthis, certainly a narrow reading wouldn't allow us to address this \nissue from the Constitution, and he says that we will rule by fiat from \nthe Chair and there should be no more filibusters of judges, even \nthough that has been allowed for 200 years, even though it was done in \n2000 by our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle for Ms. \nBerzon and Mr. Paez, and then he is saying, well, it is absurd that we \ndo it for other things. I say this: Allow them to do it for judges \ntoday, they will do it for Social Security tomorrow. The same exact \nprocedure could be used to block filibusters of legislation and of \nevery single other thing that comes before this body. There is no \ndifference. The Constitution doesn't mention the word ``filibuster.''\n  I don't know where it is divined in the heads of some of my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle: It says it is for judges, \nbut not for legislation. That is an activist reading of the \nConstitution if you ever heard one.\n  The bottom line is simple: We are appealing to those Members of the \nother side of the aisle who, unlike my friend from Utah, have thus far \nresisted the entreaties of the hard, hard, hard right, who have \nresisted the entreaties of the narrow few who are way out there and say \nto them: Have strength, have courage.\n  The basic makeup of our Senate is at stake. The checks and balances \nthat Americans prize are at stake. The idea of bipartisanship, where \nyou have to come together and can't just ram everything through because \nyou have a narrow majority, is at stake. The very things we treasure \nand love about this grand Republic are at stake.\n  I, for one, am saddened by what is happening. I, for one, am \nsurprised at what is happening. I, for one, hope and pray that it will \nnot come to this. But I assure my colleagues, at least speaking for \nthis Senator from New York, I will do everything I can to prevent the \nnuclear option from being invoked not for the sake of myself or my \nparty but for the sake of this great Republic and its traditions.\n  I yield the remaining time to my colleague from Illinois, our great \nwhip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 19 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might make an inquiry of my colleague from New \nJersey, if he is going to seek recognition, I want to be sure and leave \nenough time for him to speak.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I believe 10 minutes, maybe a little bit \nless.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Chair would advise me when there are 10 minutes \nremaining, I will yield the remaining time to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Let me first thank my colleague from New York for his excellent \nstatement. Senator Schumer and I serve on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. It is a committee where judges are initially considered. It \nis a tough assignment. When I came to the Senate from the House, I knew \nI would be voting on legislation, but more so in the Senate, you vote \non people. That is a tougher call because it isn't in black and white. \nIt isn't a matter of compromising, taking half of this and a quarter of \nthe other. It is a question of making a judgment about a person. I find \nthat a little more difficult--a lot more difficult, to be honest--and \nwhen it comes to judges, even more complicated because you aren't just \nputting a person in a temporary position. You are saying: Based on your \nlife to this point, we are prepared to put you on the Federal bench for \nthe rest of your natural life and trust your judgment that you will do \nthe right thing by the Constitution and the American people.\n\n  Overwhelmingly, we find whether the President is a Democrat or \nRepublican, the Senate says: Fine, we approve. The nominee is a good \nperson. We will go forward.\n  What has happened here is interesting. We have, so far with President \nBush in the White House, considered on\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\nthe floor of the Senate 218 nominees by President Bush for the Federal \njudiciary. The President has that power. The Senate has the power to \nadvise--that is, review and consider--and consent, if it chooses. Out \nof the 218 names sent by President Bush to the floor of the Senate, we \nhave approved 208 of those names. So we are at a point now where we \nhave 10 out of those 218 who have not been approved. More than 95 \npercent of the President's nominees have been approved.\n  You would say to yourself: This President is doing well. Whether he \nsends us conservatives of one stripe or the other, the Senate has \napproved them. We have sent them to the bench to lifetime appointments.\n  The President, after his reelection, comes to the Congress and says: \nThat is not good enough. I want them all. I want every single one of \nthem. I don't believe I should be held to the standard that every other \nPresident has been held to.\n  What is that standard? It is not just a simple majority vote. The \nSenate is a different place. It was created by the Constitution as a \ndifferent institution. States large and small have the same number of \nSenators. States large and small send Senators to the Chamber, men and \nwomen who have the authority under our rules to demand an extraordinary \nvote.\n  People on the outside say: When I go to the city council meeting, it \nis a majority vote. When I go to the garden club, it is a majority \nvote. Why isn't it a majority vote in the Senate?\n  Because the Senate is a different place. When the Founding Fathers \nwrote the Constitution, they said the Senate, more than any institution \nin the Government of America, will be a place that respects and \nrecognizes the rights of a minority.\n  For those who follow classic movies, Jimmy Stewart in ``Mr. Smith \nGoes to Washington,'' one Senator, idealistic and determined, took to \nthe floor of the Senate and started a speech and, frankly, finally \ncrumbled because he was so tired and had to end his speech. But he \ndemonstrated the reality of the Senate, that one Senator, regardless of \nwhere they are from, a State large or small, regardless if they are the \nonly Senator who holds that point of view, can stand up and argue that \npoint of view. That was built into our Constitution, certainly into the \ntradition of the Senate. That is why 10 of President Bush's nominees \nhave not been approved because, in this situation, they couldn't find \n60 Senators who would stand up and say: Stop the debate, vote on that \nnominee. That is the rule of the Senate.\n  President Bush has said: I want to change it, to change the rules of \nthe Senate in the middle of the game. I want to go after this whole \nconcept of the power of the Senate, the power of checks and balances, I \nwant more power in the White House, I want more power in the \nPresidency. That is not new. Presidents throughout history have always \nsaid they wanted more power than they had. Usually, the Congress stood \nup to them and said no.\n\n  The Constitution is more important than any single President. Thomas \nJefferson, when he was elected to his second term, came to the Senate \nand said: I want the power to remove those Federalist judges from the \nSupreme Court; They disagree with my political philosophy; I want to \nget rid of them.\n  His own party said: No, President Jefferson. As important as you are, \nas much as we agree with you, the Constitution and traditions of the \nSenate are more important. And they voted him down.\n  President Roosevelt, one of our greatest Presidents, in the beginning \nof his second term, with the power of the national mandate behind him, \nsaid to the Senate: Do something about that damnable Supreme Court that \nwon't approve my New Deal. Allow me to put more Justices on the Court \nuntil I can have my way politically.\n  His political body in this Senate said: Mr. President, we are \nDemocrats, we respect you, we voted for you, we are for the New Deal, \nbut you are wrong. You cannot come to us and ask for more Presidential \npower at the expense of the Constitution, at the expense of Senate \ntraditions and values. They turned him down.\n  Look what happens today. President Bush, fresh from a victory of 51.5 \npercent in this election, comes to this body and says: I want more \npower in the Presidency.\n  What does he hear from his own party in the Senate? Sadly, it is: \nWhatever you want, Mr. President.\n  Mickey Edwards, a former Congressman from Oklahoma, who was quoted in \nthe Washington Post this morning, gets it right. He said what amazes \nhim about this debate is that Congress isn't standing up for its own \nconstitutional responsibilities and rights.

Mr. President, let me tell you, I listen to the talk \nshows, and I hear people say that until these judicial nominees were \nchallenged with extended debate or filibuster, it never happened \nbefore. I will also submit for the Record, for the third time, this \nchart which shows on 11 or 12 different occasions when a filibuster was \ninvoked on judicial nominees throughout history, including Supreme \nCourt Justices. This is not new, not novel. It is certainly not earth \nshattering. It has happened before.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   History of Filibusters and Judges\n\n       Prior to the start of the George W. Bush administration in \n     2001, the following 11 judicial nominations needed 60 (or \n     more) votes--cloture--in order to end a filibuster:\n       1881: Stanley Matthew to be a Supreme Court Justice\n       1968: Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \n     (cloture required 2/3 of those voting)\n       1971: William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court Justice \n     (cloture required 2/3 of those voting)\n       1980: Stephen Breyer to be a Judge on the First Circuit \n     Court of Appeals\n       1984: J. Harvie Wilkinson to be a Judge on the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals\n       1986: Sidney Fitzwater to be a Judge for the Northern \n     District of Texas\n       1986: William Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the Supreme \n     Court\n       1992: Edward Earl Carnes, Jr. to be a Judge on the Eleventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals\n       1994: H. Lee Sarokin to be a Judge on the Third Circuit \n     Court of Appeals\n       1999: Brian Theadore Stewart to be a Judge for the District \n     of Utah\n       2000: Richard Paez to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court \n     of Appeals\n       2000: Marsha Berzon to be a Judge on the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals\n       Because of a filibuster, cloture was filed on the following \n     two judicial nominations, but was later withdrawn:\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\n       1986: Daniel Manion to be a Judge on the Seventh Circuit \n     Court of Appeals Senator Biden told then Majority Leader Bob \n     Dole that ``he was ready to call off an expected filibuster \n     and vote immediately on Manion's nomination.''--Congressional \n     Quarterly Almanac, 1986.\n       1994: Rosemary Barkett to be a Judge on the Eleventh \n     Circuit Court of Appeals ``. . . lacking the votes to sustain \n     a filibuster, Republicans agreed to proceed to a confirmation \n     vote after Democrats agreed to a daylong debate on the \n     nomination.''--Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1994.\n       Following are comments by Republicans during the filibuster \n     on the Paez and Berzon nominations in 2000, confirming that \n     there was, in fact, a filibuster:\n       ``. . . it is no secret that I have been the person who has \n     filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge \n     Paez.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 9, 2000\n       ``So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that \n     we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of \n     the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional \n     role.''--Senator Bob Smith, March 7, 2000\n       ``Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, \n     after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could \n     still delay a final vote on the nomination.''--Senator Orrin \n     Hatch, March 9, 2000, when a Senator offered a motion to \n     indefinitely postpone the Paez nomination after cloture had \n     been invoked\n       In 2000, during consideration of the Paez nomination, the \n     following Senator was among those who voted to continue the \n     filibuster:\n       Senator Bill Frist--Vote #37, 106th Congress, Second \n     Session, March 8, 2000.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me tell you something else that \ntroubles me. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Almost 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So I will be notified in 2 minutes.\n  There is something more at stake here that is even more important \nthan the power of the President and the tradition of the Senate, and \nthat is the independence of the judiciary. You cannot turn on the \ntelevision or radio without hearing from some special interest group \ncriticizing the Federal judiciary. I have been critical of individual \ndecisions. I can point to some, including one that was made in the \nState of Florida in 2000. But to come to the floor and say let's get \nrid of the people making the decisions, take the power of Congress and \ncontrol the judiciary, that is a mistake. An independent, fair, and \nbalanced judiciary is critical for America.\n  When I hear Members of Congress and special interest groups saying \nthey want to use this nuclear option, the power of Congress, to take \ncontrol of the Federal judiciary, I am concerned. That is a power grab \nfar beyond violating the traditions and rules of the Senate. It says \nthey are going to try to show control and exert authority over a branch \nof the Government which has always been independent.\n  I will submit a transcript of a program on May 1 from ``This Week \nWith George Stephanopolous.'' It is an interview with Pat Robertson.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [ABC News Transcripts, May 1, 2005]\n\n                  This Week With George Stephanopoulos\n\n\n                        pat robertson interview\n\n       President George W. Bush, United States: ``Role of religion \n     in our society, I view religion as a personal matter. I think \n     a person ought to be judged on how he or she lives his life, \n     lives her life, and that's how I've tried to live my life \n     through example. Faith plays an important part in my life \n     individually, but I don't ascribe a person's opposing my \n     nominations to an issue of faith.''\n       George Stephanopoulos, ABC News: (Off Camera) That was \n     President Bush in his prime time press conference Thursday \n     night talking about religion and public life and now for more \n     on this I'm joined from Virginia Beach by reverend Pat \n     Robertson. Good morning reverend Robertson.\n       Pat Robertson, Chairman, Christian Broadcasting Network: \n     Good morning, George.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) You know, the president \n     seemed to be putting some distance between himself and people \n     like you, allies like you who have cast this battle over \n     judges in more religious terms. Do you now accept the \n     president's belief that those who want to preserve the \n     filibuster for judges are not fighting against people of \n     faith?\n       Pat Robertson: George, I've never said that. I've said some \n     things about the judges, but I think this filibuster thing \n     strictly is an attempt to please the People for the American \n     Way and the ultra left. I think the Democrats are catering to \n     them, but, you know, in the entire history of the United \n     States of America, there has never been a judge who has been \n     refused a.vote when there was a majority of Senators willing \n     to vote for his confirmation, never in history. This \n     filibuster in the last two years is unprecedented in our \n     history.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) But, sir, you have \n     described this in pretty, this whole battle in pretty \n     apocalyptic terms. You've said that Liberals are engaged in \n     an all-out assault on Christianity, that Democrats will \n     appoint judges who don't share our Christian values and will \n     dismantle Christian culture, and that the out-of-control \n     judiciary, and this was in your last book ``Courting \n     Disaster'' is the most serious threat America has faced in \n     nearly 400 years of history, more serious than al Qaeda, more \n     serious than Nazi Germany and Japan, more serious than the \n     Civil War?\n       Pat Robertson: George, I really be1ieve that. I think they \n     are destroying the fabric that hold our nation together. \n     There is an assault on marriage. There's an assault on human \n     sexuality, as Judge Scalia said, they've taken sides in the \n     culture war and on top of that if we have a democracy, the \n     democratic processes should be that we can elect \n     representatives who will share our point of view and vote \n     those things into law.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) But, sir, let me just \n     stop you there. How can you say that these judges are a more \n     serious threat than Islamic terrorists who slammed into the \n     World Trade Center?\n       Pat Robertson: It depends on how you look at culture. If \n     you look over the course of a hundred years, I think the \n     gradual erosion of the consensus that's held our country \n     together is probably more serious than a few bearded \n     terrorists who fly into buildings. I think we're going to \n     control al Qaeda. I think we're going to get Osama bin Laden. \n     We won in Afghanistan. We won in Iraq, and we can contain \n     that. But if there's an erosion at home, you know, Thomas \n     Jefferson warned about a tyranny of an oligarchy and if we \n     surrender our democracy to the tyranny of an oligarchy, we've \n     made a terrible mistake.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) You know, President \n     Bush at that press conference also said that he believes \n     you're equally American whether you're Christan, Muslim, or \n     Jew, and I wonder if you fully accept that, because in the \n     past, you've said that you believe that only Christians and \n     Jews are qualified to serve in the government. Is that still \n     your belief?\n       Pat Robertson: Well, you know, Thomas Jefferson, who was \n     the author of the Declaration of Independence said he \n     wouldn't have any atheists in his cabinet because atheists \n     wouldn't swear an oath to God. That was Jefferson and we have \n     never had any Muslims in the cabinet. I didn't say serve in \n     government. I said in my cabinet if I were elected president, \n     and I think a president has a right to take people who share \n     his point of view, and I would think that would be . . .\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) Well, wait a second. \n     Let me just stop you there. `Cause in your book ``The New \n     World Order'' you wrote, `` `How dare you maintain that those \n     who believe in the Judeo-Christian values are better \n     qualified to govern America than Hindus or Muslims.' My \n     simple answer is, `yes, they are.' '' Does that mean no Hindu \n     and Muslim judges?\n       Pat Robertson: Right now, I think people who feel that \n     there should be a jihad against America, read what the \n     Islamic people say. They divide the world into two spheres, \n     Dar al Islam Dar al Harb. The Dar al Islam are those who've \n     submitted to Islam, Dar al Harb are those who are in the land \n     of war and they have said in the Koran there's a war against \n     all the infidels. So do you want somebody like that sitting \n     as a judge? I wouldn't.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) So I take it then the \n     answer to the question is that you believe that only \n     Christians and Jews are qualified to serve in the Federal \n     judiciary?\n       Pat Robertson: Um, I'm not sure I'd make such a broad, \n     sweeping statement, but I just feel that those who share the \n     philosophy of the founders of this nation, who assent to the \n     principles of the Declaration of Independence, who assent to \n     the principles that underlie the constitution, such people \n     are the ones that should be judges, and the thing that I'm \n     opposed to about judges is the thought that this is a living \n     document that can be manipulated at the will of five out \n     of nine judge, nonelected judges. It's the tyranny of an \n     oligarchy that I'm concerned about.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) You said also that you \n     believe Democrats appoint judges who ``don't share our \n     Christian values'' and will ``dismantle Christian culture.'' \n     So do you believe that Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, \n     who were appointed by President Clinton, are trying to \n     dismantle Christian culture?\n       Pat Robertson: Justice Ginsburg served as a general counsel \n     for the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU. That was \n     founded, as you probably know, by about three members of the \n     Communist Internationale. Their leader, Baldwin, said that he \n     wanted to be a Communist and wanted to make this . . .\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) So she's a Communist?\n       Pat Robertson: He was. He said, it's in my book. I mean, he \n     said it. He made a declaration. He said I want to make \n     America a workers' state, breed Communists.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) But I was asking about \n     Justice Ginsburg. And you now seem to be trying to equate her \n     with these Communists.\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\n       Pat Robertson: Well, she was the general counsel for this \n     organization whose purpose right now is to rid religion from \n     the public square. That's they are announced. We've had \n     Nadine Strasser down here to our university in a debate. \n     She's a very pleasant lady but that's what she said was her \n     avowed goal, to take all religion from the public square. \n     That's their initiative and Justice Ginsburg served as their \n     general counsel, \n     so . . .\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) Let's turn to some \n     broader issues. You spoke at the beginning of the year on \n     ``The 700 Club'' and said that you had been praying and God \n     had given you some predictions about President Bush's second \n     term. Let me show you that.\n       Pat Robertson: What I heard was that Bush is now positioned \n     to have victory after victory. He'll have Social Security \n     reform passed, that he'll have tax reform passed, that he'll \n     have conservative judges on the courts.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) So that's what you \n     heard on January 3rd. Do you think you might have \n     misinterpreted?\n       Pat Robertson: No, I think he's got a winning hand on \n     Social Security, George, despite what Nancy Pelosi says. The \n     Social Security, as you know is going into deficit in 2018. \n     It's not 2042 or '52. What they've been doing is taking a \n     surplus of the money that we all pay into Social Security and \n     they've used it to fund the Federal deficit and there is no \n     trust fund. That's an illusion and it's going into deficit. \n     There won't be any more excess for the Federal Government in \n     2018. We're hitting into a crisis mode and I think the \n     president as far as younger workers concerned, he has a \n     winning hand, and I think the Democrats are holding on to \n     something that Franklin Delano Roosevelt did in the '30s and \n     they look like a bunch of mossbacks. It is time they, they, \n     they, they get some new ideas. You said it right when you \n     were interviewing her.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) You know reverend \n     Robertson, the God you describe is taking a very active \n     direct role in our lives. One of the earlier clips we showed, \n     said, you had Him saying I am removing justices from the \n     supreme court and I'm just wondering why does a God who is so \n     involved in our daily life, so directly involved allow \n     something like a tsunami to kill several hundred thousand \n     people in Asia?\n       Pat Robertson: I don't think He reverses the laws of \n     nature. The reason for that tsunami was the shifting of \n     tectonic plates in the Indian Ocean. I don't think He changes \n     the magma in volcanoes and I don't think He changes the wind \n     currents to bring about hurricanes, so I don't attribute that \n     to God or His lack or otherwise but in terms of human affairs \n     I do think he answers prayer and I think there have been \n     literally millions of people praying for a change in the \n     supreme court. The people of faith in this country feel \n     they're on a tyranny and they see their liberties taken away \n     from them and they've been beseeching God, fasting and \n     praying for years, so I think he hears and answers their \n     prayers.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) You know, let's look \n     ahead to 2008. The jockeying has already begun and of all the \n     candidates looking for the nomination on the Republican side, \n     which one do you believe is best positioned to get the \n     support of religious conservatives like you?\n       Pat Robertson: You know, it's really hard to pick a winner \n     right now. There's an outstanding Senator from Kansas who I \n     think would be looking for it. He certainly represents the . \n     . .\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) Sam Brownback?\n       Pat Robertson: Brownback, he's a super guy. I think George \n     Allen from Virginia was a distinguished governor, he's a \n     distinguished senator and head of the senatorial campaign \n     committee and won some significant victories. He is a very \n     attractive guy and would make a tremendous president. So \n     there are a couple. I don't know who else is out there \n     jockeying, I'm sure Karl Rove has a candidate that he hasn't \n     told us about.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) You didn't mention Bill \n     Frist. I'm surprised about that.\n       Pat Robertson: Uh, Bill is a wonderfully compassionate \n     human being. He is a humanitarian. He goes on medical \n     missions. He is a delightful person. I just don't see him as \n     a future president. And I think he said he didn't want to run \n     for president. Maybe I'm putting words in his mouth.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) I think he's looking at \n     it. Let me ask you one other question on that and then I'll \n     let you go.\n       Pat Robertson: Okay.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) If the party chooses a \n     moderate like John McCain or Rudy Giuliani, do you think \n     religious conservatives will split off and form a third party \n     movement?\n       Pat Robertson: I don't think so. Rudy is a very good friend \n     of mine and I think he did a super job running the City of \n     New York and I think he'd make a good president. I like him a \n     lot, although he doesn't share all of my particular points of \n     view on social issues. He's a very dedicated Catholic and he \n     is a great guy. McCain I'd vote against under any \n     circumstance.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) Reverend Robertson, \n     thank you very much.\n       Pat Robertson: Okay, thank you.\n       George Stephanopoulos: (Off Camera) The roundtable is next. \n     George will, Terry Moran, and Linda Douglass weigh in on the \n     president's first 100 days, and in ``The Funnies'' it's \n     Laura's turn.\n       Laura Bush, First Lady: I was a librarian who spent 12 \n     hours a day in the library, yet somehow I met George.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a strident voice among some in \nthis country who came out and said he believed that the real threat to \nAmerica was not terrorism but men and women wearing judicial robes. He \nthought that was a much greater threat. That gives you an idea of the \nextreme rhetoric. We cannot let this happen. Whether the Democrats are \nin control or out of control, whether Republicans control today or \ntomorrow is secondary. We all swear to uphold the Constitution.\n  I will yield the floor to my colleague from New Jersey at this point. \nI hope those following this debate will consider the constitutional \nissues at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I also believe we must defend the \nindependence of the judiciary, and I think the comments of both the \nSenator from Illinois and the Senator from New York regarding this \nsubject are ones that need to be understood and need to be brought \nforward on the floor as we consider the potential for what I believe is \nchanging the basic nature of how our courts are put together and their \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4805-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4805-S4806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GENOCIDE IN DARFUR\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this morning I rise to speak about the \ntragedy and human crisis--yes, the genocide--in Darfur, Sudan, and the \nfailure of our Nation to do everything we can do to stop the killing \nand save the lives of the well over 2 million people who are displaced \nin Darfur. Just a few weeks ago on the Senate floor, we passed the \nDarfur Accountability Act offered by Senator Brownback and myself, an \namendment to the supplemental appropriations bill which we will be \nvoting on, and I will be supporting today, or in the next several days \nas it comes out of conference.\n  The Darfur Accountability Act provided the tools and sets out the \npolicies needed to confront this grave humanitarian crisis that exists \nin the Sudan. It also had broad bipartisan support and 30 cosponsors \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  It passed by unanimous consent on the floor of the Senate. Yet, \ninexplicably, the amendment was stripped from the bill in conference--\nall of it, including support for African Union forces, the call for a \nmilitary no-fly zone, the extension of the arms embargo to the \nGovernment of Sudan, and the authority to freeze the assets and deny \nvisas to those responsible for genocide and crimes against humanity. \nEven the Senate's statement that the atrocities in Sudan are genocide \nwas removed.\n  Mr. President, I find it hard to comprehend how these policies, which \nhold the possibility of saving thousands, if not hundreds of thousands \nof lives, could be opposed by the House, the administration, or \nwhoever. Sadly, the people of Darfur will be paying for the \nindifference and, in turn, we will be ignoring the values of the \nAmerican people who hold us accountable for calling genocide what it is \nand pushing to stop it.\n  The contrast between our words and deeds seems to grow almost by the \nhour. Just today, in Georgia, President Bush stated:\n\n       We are living in historic times when freedom is advancing, \n     from the Black Sea to the Caspian, and to the Persian Gulf \n     and beyond.\n\n  I guess that is not happening in the Sudan. At the same time we are \nchallenging autocrats around the world, it seems we are seeking \naccommodation with what I consider a barbarous government in Sudan.\n  At the same time we are saying we are standing with those who stand \nfor freedom, we are turning our backs on the human rights of the people \nof Darfur. It is not enough to say that because the Sudanese Government \nshows some signs of cooperation on some fronts, this justifies our \nturning our backs on that Government's criminal attacks on their own \npeople. It sounds almost like a speech I heard over the weekend. How \ncan we ignore our own values when it comes to Africa? Is not every \nhuman life of equal worth?\n  One of this generation's great moral voices, Elie Wiesel, understood \nthat\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nour values are universal. Speaking on Darfur last year, he asked:\n\n       How can a citizen of a free country not pay attention? How \n     can anyone, anywhere, not feel outraged? How can a person, \n     whether religious or secular, not be moved by compassion? And \n     above all, how can anyone who remembers remain silent?\n\n  Mr. President, I just returned from the region. Unfortunately, the \nGovernment of Sudan denied me the visa that I needed to visit the camps \ninside Sudan. Instead, I went to Chad, where there are about 200,000 \ndisplaced refugees from Darfur.\n\n  What do the Sudanese have to hide? Why would they prevent a U.S. \nSenator from visiting. In the camp I visited in Chad, I received \nreports of continued attacks on civilians, as well as a growing fear of \nan imminent humanitarian crisis afflicting the 2 million displaced \nDarfurians. But it is when monitors are denied access, when there are \nno reports, that the atrocities are always the most grave and can \ncontinue.\n  We need transparency. This is not about one Senator. The Sudanese \nhave obstructed access by African Union monitors. Human rights \nadvocates and journalists have been denied entry. Humanitarian \norganizations have been harassed and, when they actually get there, \nsome have actually been killed.\n  We need to shine a light on this problem. I visited some of the \nvictims last week in eastern Chad. Here is a picture of some of the \nfolks in one of the camps. Hundreds of these men and women desperately \nwant to go home. They were in Chad because of the brutal violence in \ntheir own country, brought on by the Sudanese Government. They were \nchased from their villages. None of them felt safe to return. None of \nthem would return.\n  This sentiment matches what we hear in Darfur, where we were last \nfall. Hundreds of thousands of civilians were in these IDP camps, \napproaching 2 million. Meanwhile, the Darfur refugees in Chad are \nbarely getting by. I can tell you that the conditions are difficult. \nU.N. agencies and humanitarian organizations are doing everything they \ncan, a heroic job of getting assistance to these camps. But I have to \ntell you, there is a serious shortfall between a quality of life that \nis just sustainable and reality. The terrain in eastern Chad is dry, \ninfertile and, frankly, the environment is bleak. It barely supports \nthe Chadians who live in the area. There is not enough water and \ncertainly limited amounts of food. It needs to change.\n  That is why we need to speak out and we have to be forceful. That is \nwhy one of the provisions in the Darfur Accountability Act I think is \nmost important, and that is the appointment of a special envoy.\n  Mr. President, stopping genocide is a moral challenge that requires \ncourage and resources. But it also requires attention every day--real \ndiplomatic engagement to make sure we are moving the ball forward in \nthis process. In Chad, I met with President Deby and also with members \nof the joint commission--Chadians engaged in diplomatic negotiations \nbetween the Government of Sudan and the Darfur rebels. We met with the \nrebels themselves. People want peace. We met with people in the African \nUnion in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n  Bringing these players together--not to mention the parties in the \nnorth-south agreement in Sudan, the EU, NATO, and U.N. Security Council \nmembers--is a full time job. It needs the attention of an individual to \nmake sure that those negotiations don't go adrift. We need that \nattention now. It is critical. The Darfur Accountability Act asked for \nthis, encouraged this, and it is not happening. It is not sufficient \nenough to have a one-time trip by the Deputy Secretary of State to \nSudan to think that we are paying enough attention or putting on enough \npressure. In fact, we don't have an ambassador in the Sudan. We don't \nhave an official representative to the African Union. We need to be \npaying attention. That is why Senator Brownback and myself offered the \namendment to the supplemental. That is why we have asked for additional \nfunding, some of which was included in the supplemental, and I am \ngrateful for the fact that Senators DeWine and Brownback, Durbin, \nLeahy, and Obama were able to provide $50 million more for the African \nUnion. But some of the humanitarian assistance was pulled back for \nreasons allocated to other difficult places that also demand need.\n  It is essential if we are going to stop this killing, stop the \ngenocide, that we react now, that we pay attention, that we do the \nthings that will allow the African Union's deployment to be \nsuccessful--only 2,200 people in an area the size of France. We need to \nhave a minimum of 6,000, maybe as many as 10,000. That mission needs to \nbe financed. The supplemental was where we could do much of this. Some \nof that we stepped back from.\n  Our values as a nation and our national security require us to speak \nup and confront these problems.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time in morning business has \nnow expired.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Presiding Officer. I hope my colleagues will \nconsider this legislation when we bring it back to the floor. It needs \nto be fought for.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4806-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 1268, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1268), making emergency supplemental appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, to establish and \n     rapidly implement regulations for State driver's license and \n     identification document security standards, to prevent \n     terrorists from abusing the asylum laws of the United States, \n     to unify terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility and \n     removal, to ensure expeditious construction of the San Diego \n     border fence, and for other purposes, having met, after full \n     and free conference, have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of May 3, 2005.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate now has under consideration \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 1268, the fiscal year 2005 \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. This bill was requested by \nthe President to carry forward the spending and accounts of the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of State, and other agencies and \ndepartments of the Government through the remainder of this fiscal year \nwhich will end on September 30.\n  The bill was passed in the Senate on April 21, and we began \nconference discussions with our colleagues from the other body on April \n27. A bipartisan majority of the conferees reconciled differences \nbetween the two bills and reached agreement on the provisions of a \nconference report on Tuesday, May 3.\n  The House approved the conference report on May 5 by a rollcall vote \nof 368 to 58. The conference agreement provides a total of $82.041 \nbillion, slightly less than the President's request of $82.042 billion. \nAlmost $76 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations is provided \nto the Department of Defense to cover the costs of continuing the \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Title II of the conference agreement provides $4.128 billion for \ninternational programs and assistance for reconstruction and the war on \nterror. Title III provides $1.184 billion for domestic programs in the \nwar on terror. And title IV provides $907 million in relief for the \nIndian Ocean tsunami disaster.\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\n  Finally, division B of the conference agreement carries the House-\npassed REAL ID Act and other provisions relating to immigration issues.\n\n  This conference agreement embodies a genuine compromise between the \ntwo bodies on legislation that is of utmost importance to our troops \nwho are deployed in the war on terror and for our allies around the \nworld. It is supported by the administration, and I hope the bill, as \nreflected in the conference report, will receive bipartisan support in \nthe Senate.\n  We are pleased to have the benefit of comments by other members of \nthe committee or Senate to explain specific provisions of this \nconference agreement. We are prepared to try to respond to any \nquestions that any Senators may have about the provisions of the \nconference report, and we will be hopeful, however, that the Senate \nwill proceed with some dispatch to the approval of the conference \nreport because it is an urgent supplemental appropriations conference \nreport. The funds provided in this conference report are urgently \nneeded by our forces in the field and by our State Department for \naccounts that have been depleted in connection with programs \nadministered by that Department.\n  The administration is urging that we act quickly, and I hope we will \nnot unnecessarily prolong consideration of the conference agreement in \nthe Senate but respond enthusiastically with the challenge from the \nadministration to act with dispatch on this conference report.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, if I may have one more \nmoment of indulgence from the Senator from California, on behalf of the \nmajority leader, I ask unanimous consent that there be 3 hours and 15 \nminutes of debate under the control of the ranking member and 1\\1/2\\ \nhours of debate under the control of the chairman; provided further \nthat following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to \na vote on adoption of the conference report, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee had indicated that I would be able to speak as \nin morning business, that he would not object. My concern is, with the \ntime, if I will, in fact, have the time to complete my remarks.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator \nspeaking as in morning business.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I do not want her to talk forever.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, it will not be forever.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How long does the Senator expect to talk?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Probably a half hour.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection, and I have no objection with that \nbeing done in spite of the agreement we have reached on the time for \ndebate of the supplemental.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Mississippi? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for his graciousness. I am pleased to serve on \nthat committee. He has been nothing but fair always. That is very much \nappreciated. I would like to indicate my support for the supplemental \nappropriations. I do have concerns about the inclusion of the REAL ID \nAct in this bill, largely because it is the Judiciary Committee that is \nthe committee of jurisdiction, and this very complicated act has not \nhad the opportunity of a hearing or discussions or markup by members of \nthat committee. That having been said, it is my intent to vote for the \nemergency supplemental.\n  I wish to speak during the remainder of my time on the so-called \nnuclear option and the majority leader's intention to remove the \nability of the minority party to filibuster judicial nominations.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, I speak today as a member of the Judiciary Committee \nfor the past 12 years. In this capacity, I have worked with Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle and on nominations from both Democratic \nand Republican Presidents. In all, I voted to confirm 573 judges and \nhave voted no on the Senate floor on 5 and voted against cloture on 11.\n  I evaluate each candidate on a case-by-case basis and thoroughly \nexamine their writings, opinions, statements, temperament, and \ncharacter. The fact that Federal judges are lifetime appointments \nweighs heavily. They do not come and go with an administration, as do \nCabinet appointments. Rather, they cannot be removed from the bench \nexcept in extremely rare circumstances. In fact, in our Government's \nover 200-year history, only 11 Federal judges have been impeached, and \nof those, only 2 since 1936.\n  Over the years, we have had heated debates and strong disagreements \nover judicial nominees; however, that debate is what ensures the Senate \nconfirms the best qualified candidates.\n  I am deeply troubled when our legitimate differences over an \nindividual's qualifications to be given a lifetime appointment to the \nFederal bench become reduced to inflammatory rhetoric. I am even more \nconcerned when rhetoric turns into open discussion about breaking \nSenate rules and turning the Senate into a body where might makes \nright.\n  I am here today because some Members on the other side of the aisle \nhave decided that despite a constitution that is renowned worldwide and \nused as a model for emergent democracies, despite a confirmation rate \nof 95 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees, and despite the \nother pressing priorities that the American people want us to address, \nthat the time has come to unravel our Government's fundamental \nprinciple of checks and balances. The majority has decided the time has \ncome to unravel the Senate's traditional role of debate and that the \ntime has come to break the rules and discard Senate precedent.\n  I am very concerned about this strategy. It is important to remember \nthat once done, once broken, it will be hard to limit and hard to \nreverse. In fact, just last month, Senator Coleman stated on CNN:\n\n       The President has a right to make appointments. They are \n     not to be filibustered. They deserve an up-or-down vote. \n     That's true for any kind of appointee, whether it's Under \n     Secretary of State or a judge.\n\n  And this is exactly my point. First, the rules would be broken with \nregard to judicial nominees, then it is executive branch nominees, then \nit is legislation, and then the Senate has no rules at all and simply \nbecomes a replication of the House of Representatives.\n  Every Thursday morning, I have a constituent breakfast, and at that \nbreakfast I describe the difference between the House and the Senate \nbased on something George Washington once said, that the House moves \nrapidly, is controlled totally by the party in power, and is akin to a \ncup of coffee. You drink your coffee out of the cup, but if it is too \nhot, you pour it into the saucer to cool it. And that is the Senate, \nthe greatest so-called deliberative body on Earth, a place that fosters \ndebate, often unlimited, and is basically based on the fact that no \nlegislation is better than bad legislation. So the Senate by design was \ncreated to be a very different house than is the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The strategy of a nuclear option will turn the Senate into a body \nthat could have its rules broken or changed at any time by a majority \nof Senators unhappy with any position taken by the minority. As I said, \nthis is not the Senate envisioned by our Founding Fathers, and it is \nnot the Senate in which I have been proud to serve for the past 12 \nyears.\n  I think it is important to take a look at history, as others have \ndone, to understand the context of where this debate is rooted. The \nFounding Fathers and our early Pilgrims were escaping a tyrannical \ngovernment where the average man, the common man, often did not have a \nvoice and was often left without any say in its laws that governed him \nand his family. In response, these men specifically embedded language \nin the Constitution to provide checks and balances so that inherent in\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\nour Government's design would be conflict and compromise, and it is \nprecisely these checks and balances that have served to guarantee our \nfreedoms for over 200 years.\n  When you read the Federalist Papers, discussions at the \nConstitutional Convention, and about the experience of America's first \nPresident, it is clear the Senate was never intended to be a \nrubberstamp. While it is often difficult to discern the original intent \nof a constitutional provision, the records of the Convention address \nthe role of the Senate in the selection of Federal judges with unusual \nclarity.\n  Both the text of the appointments clause of the Constitution and the \ndebates over its adoption strongly suggest that the Senate was expected \nto play an active and independent role in determining who should sit on \nthe Nation's judiciary.\n  Throughout its deliberations, the Convention contemplated that the \nNational Legislature in some form or another would play a substantial \nrole in the selection of Federal judges. As a matter of fact, on May \n29, 1787, the Convention began its work on the Constitution by taking \nup the Virginia plan, which provided:\n\n       That a National Judiciary be established . . . to be chosen \n     by the National Legislature.\n\n  Under this plan, the President was to have no role at all. One week \nlater, James Madison modified the proposal so that the power of \nappointing judges would be given exclusively to the Senate rather than \nto the legislature as a whole. This motion was adopted without any \nobjection. So the Senate had the entire authority.\n  Then less than 2 weeks before the Convention's work was done, for the \nfirst time the committee's draft provided that the President should \nhave a role in the selection of judges.\n  However, giving the President the power to nominate judges was not \nseen as ousting the Senate from a central role. Governor Morris of \nPennsylvania paraphrased the new provision as one giving the Senate the \npower to appoint judges nominated to them by the President. In other \nwords, it was considered the Senate was the nomination body and the \nPresident simply recommended judges to the Senate.\n  The Convention, having repeatedly and decisively rejected the idea \nthat the President should have the exclusive power to select judges, \ncould not possibly have intended to reduce the Senate to a rubber \nstamp, but rather it created a strong Senate role to protect the \nindependence of the judiciary. In fact, Alexander Hamilton, considered \nthe strongest defender of Presidential power, emphasized that the \nPresident would be required to have his choice for the bench submitted \nto an independent body for debate, a decision, and a vote, not simply \nan affirmation. He clarified the necessary involvement of the Senate in \nFederalist No. 77 by writing:\n\n     . . . if by influencing the President be meant restraining \n     him, this is precisely what must have been intended.\n\n  Here is the emergence of a check, a balance, a leveling impact on the \npower of appointment, which is not to be unbridled.\n  In 1776, John Adams also wrote on the specific need for an \nindependent judiciary and checks and balances. He said:\n\n       The dignity and stability of government in all its \n     branches, the morals of the people and every blessing of \n     society, depends so much upon an upright and skillful \n     administration of justice, that the judicial power ought to \n     be distinct from both the legislative and executive, and \n     independent upon both, that so it may be a check upon both, \n     as both should be checked upon that . . . [The judges'] minds \n     should not be distracted with jarring interests; they should \n     not be dependent upon any man or body of men.\n\n  So it is clear, when examining the creation of our Constitution, that \nthe Federal judiciary was specifically designed to be an independent, \nnonpartisan third branch, and the Senate was meant to play an active \nrole in the selection process.\n  In addition, the experience of President Washington in appointing \njudges illustrates that from the outset the Senate took an active role \nin evaluating judicial nominees. In 1795, President George Washington \nnominated John Rutledge to be Chief Justice. Soon after his nomination, \nRutledge assailed the newly negotiated and popular Jay Treaty with \nBritain. Even as Rutledge functioned as Acting Chief Justice, the \nSenate debated his nomination for 5 months, and in December 1795 the \nbody rejected him 14 to 10, illustrating from the first administration \nthat the Senate has always enjoyed a strong prerogative to confirm or \nreject nominees.\n  Now, use of procedural delays throughout history has prevented \nnominees from receiving an up-or-down vote. The claim that it is \nunprecedented to filibuster judicial nominations is simply untrue. In \n1881, Republicans held a majority of seats in the Senate but were \nunable to end a filibuster to preclude a floor vote on President \nRutherford B. Hayes's nomination of Senator Stanley Matthews to the \nSupreme Court. Matthews was renominated by incoming President James \nGarfield, and after a bitter debate in the Senate, was confirmed by a \nvote of 24 to 23. This has been described as the first recorded \ninstance in which the filibuster was clearly and unambiguously deployed \nto defeat a judicial nomination.\n  Then, as has been stated on the Senate floor, there was the 1968 GOP-\nled filibuster against President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination of Abe \nFortas to be Chief Justice of the United States. At the time, a page 1 \nWashington Post story declared: ``Fortas Debate Opens With a \nFilibuster.''\n  The article read:\n\n       A full-dress Republican-led filibuster broke out in the \n     Senate yesterday against a motion to call up the nomination \n     of Justice Abe Fortas for Chief Justice.\n\n  So here are two specific examples of Republican-led filibusters \nagainst judicial appointments.\n  Last Congress, the Congressional Research Service reported that \nfilibusters and cloture votes have been required to end debate on \nnumerous judicial appointments. CRS reported that since 1980, cloture \nmotions have been filed on 14 court of appeals and district court \nnominations. We all know a cloture vote is another kind of filibuster. \nIt is the kind of filibuster where one does not have to stand up on the \nfloor, but it takes the same 60 votes to close off debate. Moreover, \ncloture petitions were necessary in 2000 to obtain votes on the \nnominations of both Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit \nafter Republican opponents repeatedly delayed action on them, for over \n4 years in the case of Paez.\n  In fact, at the time, Republican Senator Bob Smith openly declared he \nwas leading a filibuster against Richard Paez and he described Senator \nSessions as a member of his filibuster coalition.\n\n  In addition to using the filibuster and other procedural delays, \nRepublicans have publicly pronounced the importance of these rules and \ntheir own desire to delay or block the confirmation of judges. As \nrecently as 1996, Senator Lott stated:\n\n       The reason for the lack of action on the backlog of Clinton \n     nominations was his steadily ringing office phone saying ``No \n     more Clinton Federal judges.''\n\n  In 1996, Senator Craig said:\n\n       There is a general feeling . . . that no more nominations \n     should move. I think you'll see a progressive shutdown.\n\n  In 1994, Senator Hatch stated that the filibuster is ``one of the few \ntools that the minority has to protect itself and those the minority \nrepresents.''\n  How soon they forget. Recent Republican practices using anonymous \nholds allowing a single Senator, not 41, to prevent a hearing or a vote \non a judicial nominee, in effect, has created a filibuster of one. All \ntold, during the last administration, more than 60 judicial nominees \nsuffered this fate. This practice was recently commented on in the \nChicago Tribune which said:\n\n       In addition, there are lots of congressional practices that \n     defy majority rule. Under President Clinton, when Republicans \n     controlled the Senate, they didn't have to use the filibuster \n     to bottle up judicial nominations. The Judiciary Committee \n     simply refused to send them to the floor for a vote.\n\n  That is true. I know. I was there. Remembering this history is \nimportant, not to point fingers or justify a tit-for-tat policy; \ninstead, it is important to recall that Senate rules have been used \nthroughout our history by both parties to implement a strong Senate \nrole and ensure that Presidents do not attempt to weaken the \nindependence of the judiciary.\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\n  The history is not new, and these examples have been cited by my \ncolleagues in other contexts, and therefore, those on the other side \nhave responded to the history. I believe it is important to address the \ndifferences that the other side is trying to draw.\n  Some have argued that the nomination by President Hayes of Senator \nMatthews of Ohio was not a filibuster because there was no cloture \nvote. This is true, however, a procedural delay denying a nominee \nconfirmation to a court still has the result blocking a nomination. \nTrying to make a distinction about the procedures used to deny a \nnominee confirmation is a distinction without a difference.\n  As for the nomination of Abe Fortas--colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have made various arguments including: that's only one \nisolated example; it was a Supreme Court, not a Circuit Court nominee; \nor Fortas' nomination was withdrawn after a failed cloture vote showed \nhe did not have majority support and therefore its not the same \nsituation.\n  Miguel Estrada and Carolyn Kuhl both withdrew their nominations after \nfailed cloture votes, however both were used as examples of filibusters \nby Democrats.\n  Our colleagues have argued that the delays to the nominations of \nRichard Paez and Marsha Bershon do not count because in the end they \nwere confirmed. This ignores that it took over four years to confirm \nboth nominees. In addition, if a party attempts to filibuster a \nnomination, or legislation, and it is eventually passed that does not \nmean it is not a filibuster. It simply means that the filibuster or \nrefusal to grant cloture cannot be sustained. That has happened to both \nparties in a variety of situations. However, failure does not undo the \neffort.\n  Finally, as to the other Clinton Administration nominees--the \nresponse given is that their nominations weren't defeated by a cloture \nvote on the floor. In essence the argument is because different \nprocedural rules were used to defeat a nomination, it doesn't count. On \nits face, this argument doesn't hold water. To the nominee whether \ntheir confirmation failed because of a ``hold'' in Committee, or a \nfailed cloture vote, the result is the same--they are not sitting on \nthe bench.\n  Dozens of Clinton's nominees were ``pocket filibustered'' by as \nlittle as one Senator who, in secret, prevented the nominees from \nreceiving a hearing in Committee, or a mark-up, or a floor vote. One \nSenator without debate or reason has stopped many Clinton nominees.\n  The question I have is whether the public interest is better served \nby one hidden filibuster without explanation, or 41 Senators debating \npublicly and refusing publicly to confirm the nominee. Clearly, it is \nthe later.\n  I would like to go over a few nominees from the last administration \nwho have been filibustered by Republicans, and filibustered \nsuccessfully on many occasions by as little a number as one Republican; \nfilibustered in a way that it was secret; filibustered in a way that \nthe individual never received a hearing or a markup in Judiciary or a \nvote on the Senate floor. Then I would like an answer to the question, \nwhich is better, a filibuster by 40 Members on the floor openly \ndeclared, publicly debating, discussing an individual's past speeches, \nan individual's temperament, character, opinions, or a filibuster in \nsecret when one does not know who or why?\n  I begin with Clarence Sundram. Clarence Sundram was the chairman of \nthe New York Commission for the Mentally Disabled. He was nominated on \nSeptember 29, 1995. He had hearings on July 31, 1996, and June 25, \n1997. There was no committee vote. There was no floor vote. His \nnomination was simply killed in committee by a filibuster of one or \ntwo, or the chairman's decision not to bring the nomination to the \nfloor. He was supported by both home State Senators Moynihan and \nD'Amato. On seven occasions, Senator Leahy spoke on the Senate floor \nurging that a vote be taken on Sundram, but no vote was ever taken.\n  James A. Beaty, Jr., was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit on December 22, 1995, and renominated on January 7, \n1997. He did not receive a hearing and was not voted on in committee. \nHis nomination languished for more than 1,000 days, almost 3 years \nwithout any action being taken. He was nominated by President Clinton \nto be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nNorth Carolina. He was finally confirmed by the Senate in 1994.\n  Before that, he spent 13 years as a judge in the North Carolina \nSuperior Court. He was blocked by Senator Helms. On November 21, 1998, \nNational Journal reported that Senator Helms wanted President Clinton \nto name to the Fourth Circuit one of the Senator's proteges, Terrence \nW. Boyle, whose nomination to that bench was killed when the Democrats \nruled the Senate and George Bush was President, but the Clinton White \nHouse refused and Senator Helms made it clear that President Clinton \nwould not get Beaty confirmed until he nominated Boyle.\n  Then Senator Helms supported Beaty when he was nominated for his \ncurrent position as a U.S. district court judge. But this shows how \nthings worked, where one person could deny a nomination.\n  Then there is Helene White from the State of Michigan. She was \nnominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on January \n7, 1997, and renominated on January 26, 1999, and renominated for a \nthird time on January 3, 2001. She did not receive a hearing or a \ncommittee vote during the pendency of her nomination. She had waited \nfor a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for 4 years, longer than any \nother judicial nominee in history, according to the Associated Press. \nShe had been a judge on the Michigan Court of Appeals. She served as a \nWayne County circuit judge for nearly 10 years. She sat on the Common \nPleas Court for the city of Detroit and served on the board of \ndirectors of the Michigan legal services. President Clinton thanked her \nfor hanging in there through an ordeal that no one should have to \nendure. It is my understanding Senator Levin, one of the Michigan \nSenators, supported her. Senator Abraham waited 2 years before turning \nin his blue slip, and after turning in the blue slip did not endorse \nMs. White. That, again, is how things worked. One person--not 41 people \non the floor debating but 1 person--in secret holding up a nominee. \nThat is just as much a filibuster, and even more effective a \nfilibuster.\n  Jorge Rangel was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit on July 24, 1997. He did not receive a hearing or a vote in \ncommittee. He was a partner in Rangel & Chriss, a Corpus Christi law \nfirm, and specialized in personal injury, libel, and general media \nlitigation. He was presiding judge of the 347th District Court in \nNueces County from October of 1983 to June of 1985, and a former \nassistant professor of law at the University of Houston. He was \noriginally recommended to the White House by Senator Bob Krueger, but \nremoved his name from consideration because, according to a July 25, \n1997 Dallas Morning News article, he was then a member of the American \nBar Association Panel that reviews federal court nominees, which made \nhim ineligible. He was subsequently nominated after he was no longer on \nthe ABA panel, at which time, Texas Monthly has reported, he was \nblocked by his two home state Senators. So, two persons there.\n  Barry Goode was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit in 1998, renominated January 26, 1999, and renominated a third \ntime on January 3, 2001, just before President Clinton left office--\nthree tries. He waited for 2\\1/2\\ years without a hearing or a vote in \ncommittee. He was a partner at the time at the San Francisco law firm \nof McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen. He had practiced law since 1974. \nHe was an adjunct professor of environmental law at the University of \nSan Francisco and served 2 years as special assistant to Senator Adlai \nE. Stevenson III. The ABA rated him as qualified. He was supported by \nboth myself and Senator Boxer. The reason for the block was an \nanonymous Republican who, to this day, is not known. Senator Leahy \nspoke at least eight times on the Senate floor, urging that Goode's \nnomination be considered, but a filibuster of one, hidden, in secret, \nnobody knowing who it was, essentially killed this nomination.\n  Legrome Davis was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania on July 30, 1998, and renominated on \nJanuary 26, 1999. He did not receive a hearing or a vote\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nfrom the Judiciary Committee during the nearly 2\\1/2\\ years his \nnomination was pending. President Bush renominated Davis to the same \ncourt at Senator Specter's request on January 23, 2002, and he was \nfinally confirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate on April 18, 2002. \nBut the point was he was stopped for nearly 2\\1/2\\ years by an unknown \nindividual.\n  Lynnette Norton was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania on April 29, 1998, and renominated on \nJanuary 26, 1999. She did not receive a hearing or a vote in committee \nduring the more than 2\\1/2\\ years her nomination was pending. She died \nsuddenly in March 2002 of a cerebral aneurysm. It is my understanding \nSenator Specter supported Norton. Senator Santorum, I believe, did not \nreturn the blue slip. According to a November 18, 1999 article in the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer, a hold was placed on Ms. Norton's nomination.\n  H. Alston Johnson was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit on April 22, 1999, and renominated on January 4, 2001. \nDespite waiting over a year and a half, he did not receive a hearing or \na vote in committee. His nomination was withdrawn by President Bush on \nMarch 19, 2001. He was supported by both home State Senators, Senators \nBreaux and Landrieu. According to articles in the Baton Rouge Advocate \non July 10, 2000, and January 8, 2001, it is my understanding an \nindividual Senator blocked his nomination from proceeding, even though \nboth Republicans and Democrats appeared willing to confirm him.\n  James E. Duffy, Jr. was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit on June 17, 1999, and renominated on January 3, 2001. \nHe did not receive a hearing or vote in committee. He is from Honolulu, \nhad been a litigator for his entire legal career, been a partner in the \nHonolulu law firm of Fujiyama, Duffy, and Fujiyama since 1975. He was \nformer president of both the Hawaii State Bar and the Hawaii Trial \nLawyers Association. He would have been the first active Hawaii member \nof the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 15 years, despite rules that \nat least 1 judge must sit in each of the States within the Ninth \nCircuit. He was unanimously rated as well qualified. He was supported \nby both Hawaii Senators. There has been no explanation forthcoming of \nwho blocked his progress. Again, a secret hold, one person. Two home \nState Senators supporting this individual and the individual does not \ngo forward. That is as much a filibuster as anything going on on the \nfloor at this time.\n\n  Elena Kagan was nominated to the U.S. District Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia on June 17, 1999. She did not receive a vote \nor a hearing in committee. She is currently the dean of Harvard Law \nSchool. She was a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, former \ndomestic adviser to President Bill Clinton when she was nominated. She \nwas special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee during the \nconfirmation hearings of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She served as Associate \nCounsel to the President from 1995 to 1996, and Deputy Assistant to the \nPresident for Domestic Policy, and Deputy Director of the Domestic \nPolicy Council from 1997 to 1999. Prior to that she was professor of \nlaw at the University of Chicago, tenured. She worked at the \nWashington, DC, law firm of Williams and Connolly, and she clerked for \nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. A substantial majority of \nthe ABA rated her qualified. A minority rated her well qualified. It is \nmy understanding three Senators argued that the DC Circuit did not need \nany more judges, an argument that had been used to delay the \nconfirmation of Judge Merrick Garland between 1995 and 1997.\n  See, this was another thing that was happening during that time. Let \nme just say it like it was. Vacancies on the DC Circuit--a critical and \nimportant circuit because it reviews all of the administrative \nappeals--were purposely kept open, preventing President Clinton from \nfilling that circuit, to have more openings for the next President. \nHere three Senators kept this very qualified and very distinguished \nnominee from receiving a vote or a hearing on the committee. Again, a \nsecret, hidden filibuster.\n  And, nevertheless, Senate Republicans supported the nomination by \nPresident Bush of Miguel Estrada to the same circuit court in 2002.\n  James Wynn was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit on August 5, 1999, and renominated on January 3, 2001. As you \ncan see, President Clinton made one last try before he left office. He \ndid not receive a hearing or a vote in committee. President Bush \nwithdrew Judge Wynn's nomination on March 19, 2001. He was a judge on \nthe North Carolina Court of Appeals and had previously served on the \nNorth Carolina Supreme Court. When nominated, he was a Navy reservist \nin the JAG corps of the U.S. Navy with the rank of captain. He served \nas the ABA's first African-American chair of the Appellate Judges \nConference whose membership includes over 600 Federal and State \nappellate judges. He was on the board of governors of the American \nJudicature Society and was a vice president of the North Carolina Bar \nAssociation. He was an executive board member of the Uniform State Laws \nCommission and a drafter of the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act, \nUniform Tort Apportionment Act, and proposed Genetic Discrimination \nAct. He was rated qualified by the ABA screening committee. Senator \nEdwards supported him. The Associated Press, on December 29, 2000, \nreported that Senator Helms blocked Judge Wynn. One person blocks a \ndistinguished jurist, a filibuster of one, and not a word said.\n  Kathleen McCree-Lewis was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Sixth Circuit Court on September 16, 1999, and renominated on \nJanuary 3, 2001. She did not receive a hearing or a vote in committee \nduring the more than a year her nomination was pending. She was a \ndistinguished appellate attorney with Dykema Gossett, one of the \nlargest law firms in Michigan. She had been active in the Michigan bar \nfrom 1996 to 1999. She chaired the rules advisory committee of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. From 1992 to 1995, she \ncochaired the appellate practice committee of the ABA section of \nlitigation. From 1987 to 1998, she was editor of the Sixth Circuit \nsection of the Appellate Practice Journal and is a life member of the \nSixth Circuit Judicial Conference. She was president of the American \nAcademy of Appellate Lawyers. She would have been the first African-\nAmerican woman to serve on the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. She \nwas rated by the ABA as well qualified. On March 21, 2001, the Detroit \nFree Press reported that she was blocked by one of her home State \nSenators, namely Senator Abraham. Let me quote the Detroit Free Press. \nMcCree-Lewis never ``got a hearing in the Senate, thanks to Abraham's \nepic obstructionism.''\n  Now on January 8, 2001, the Detroit Free Press reported:\n\n       The Senate has been obscenely obstructionist in blocking \n     President Bill Clinton's judicial nominations. Former Senator \n     Spencer Abraham did nothing to help shepherd Michigan Court \n     of Appeals Judge Helene White and Detroit attorney Kathleen \n     McCree Lewis through the system.\n\n  Again, filibuster of one, in secret, with no floor debate.\n  Enrique Moreno was nominated to the U.S. District Court of Appeals \nfor the Fifth Circuit on September 16, 1999, and renominated January 3, \n2001.\n  He did not receive a hearing or a vote in committee. At the time of \nhis nomination, Moreno had a longstanding and diverse legal practice in \nEl Paso, working on both civil and criminal law. In the civil area, he \nrepresented both plaintiffs and defendants, representing both large \nbusiness clients and also individuals, advocating their civil rights. \nIn a survey of State judges, he was rated as one of the top trial \nattorneys in El Paso. A native of Chihuahua, he came to El Paso as a \nsmall child, son of a retired carpenter and a seamstress.\n  The ABA committee unanimously rated him as well qualified.\n  In November of 2000, Texas Monthly reported that he was blocked by \nboth home State Senators, again without a hearing or a vote in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Allen Snyder was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC \nCircuit on September 22, 1999. He did receive a committee hearing on \nMay 10, 2000. His nomination, though, was not voted on by the \ncommittee.\n  At the time of his nomination, he was a longtime partner and chairman\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\nof litigation practice at the DC law firm Hogan & Hartson. At Hogan & \nHartson, he represented Netscape Communications Corporation in the \nlandmark Microsoft antitrust case.\n  He was a former law clerk to Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The ABA \nunanimously rated him well qualified. He served as chair of the \nCommittee on Admissions and Grievances of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia, as secretary and executive committee member \nof the Board of Governors of the District of Columbia Bar, and on the \nboard of the Washington Council of Lawyers. It is my understanding his \nnomination was blocked by two Judiciary Committee Senators. No reason \nwas given.\n  Kent Markus was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit on February 9, 2000. He did not receive a hearing or a vote in \ncommittee. He was the director of the Dave Thomas Center for Adoption \nLaw and visiting professor at Capital University Law School at the time \nof his nomination. He served in numerous high-level legal positions \nwithin the Department of Justice, including counselor to the Attorney \nGeneral, Deputy Chief of Staff for the Office of the Attorney General, \nand Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative \nAffairs.\n  He also served as first assistant attorney general and chief of staff \nfor the Ohio Attorney General's Office.\n  His nomination was supported by 14 past presidents of the Ohio State \nBar Association, including Democrats, Republicans, and Independents; \nmore than 80 Ohio law school deans; prominent Ohio Republicans; the \nNational District Attorneys Association; and the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police.\n  The ABA unanimously rated him as qualified.\n  Both Senators DeWine and Voinovich returned blue slips. He was \nblocked by one Senator--a filibuster of one, all hidden, all quiet.\n  Bonnie Campbell was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit on March 2, 2000, and renominated on January 3, 2001. \nHer hearing was on May 25, 2000. The nomination was never voted on by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  She served for 4 years as Iowa's Attorney General. She is the only \nwoman to have held that office in her State, and she wrote what became \na model statute on antistalking for States around the country.\n  She was selected by President Clinton in 1995 to head the Justice \nDepartment's newly created Violence Against Women Office. She emerged \nas a national leader for her work to bring victims' rights reforms to \nthe country's criminal justice system.\n  In 1997, Time magazine named her one of the 25 most influential \npeople in America. Praising her for bringing ``rock-solid credibility'' \nto her job, Time called Campbell the ``force behind a grass-roots shift \nin the way Americans view the victims--and perhaps more important, the \nperpetrators--of crimes against women.''\n  She oversaw a $1.6 billion program to provide resources to \ncommunities for training judges, prosecutors, and police. She was \nchosen to serve on the President's Interagency Council on Women, \nchaired by former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. She also headed \nthe Justice Department's Working Group on Trafficking.\n  According to a statement given by Senator Leahy to the Judiciary \nCommittee on January 22, 2004, she was blocked by a secret Republican \nhold from ever getting committee or Senate consideration. Apparently, \njust one Senator. She had a hearing, as I said, but she never had a \nvote.\n  Roger Gregory was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit on June 30, 2000, and was renominated on January 3, \n2001. He was a recess appointee of President Clinton at the end of the \n106th Congress. He did not receive a hearing or a vote.\n  On March 19, 2001, President Bush withdrew his nomination. He was \nsubsequently renominated by President Bush on May 9, 2001, and \nconfirmed July 20, 2001, by a 93-to-1 vote.\n  According to former Senator Chuck Robb, on October 3, 2000:\n\n       Despite the well-documented need for another judge on this \n     court, and despite Mr. Gregory's stellar qualifications, the \n     Judiciary Committee has stubbornly refused to even grant Mr. \n     Gregory the courtesy of a hearing.\n\n  I know Senator Warner supported this judge.\n  Again, this just goes to show that we are having a major flap because \n41 people feel strongly, are willing to come to the floor, and willing \nto debate a nominee, and all of a sudden the world is going to come to \nan end, when for years and years and years one or two or three Members \nof the Senate could prevent a hearing or a markup in the Judiciary \nCommittee or an individual even being brought to the floor.\n  Which would the public prefer? I would hope it would be a discussion \non the floor of the Senate. I would hope it would be laying out the \ncase against the individual, as has been done with every one of the \nten--only ten; in all of President Bush's terms, only ten--when in \nPresident Clinton's term there were 60, and one or two, in secret, kept \nthat individual from being brought to the floor of the Senate and voted \non.\n\n  Well, let me continue. John Bingler was nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on July 21, \n1995, and renominated on July 31, 1997. He did not receive a hearing or \na vote either time he was nominated.\n  After waiting more than 2 years without any action on his nomination, \nhe withdrew on February 12, 1998.\n  Since 1971, he has practiced law with the Pittsburgh firm of Thorp, \nReed & Armstrong. He served for 6 years as chair of the firm's \nlitigation department.\n  From 1970 to 1971, he was the public safety director for the city of \nPittsburgh. He served for 3 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nPittsburgh where he prosecuted Federal criminal cases, and for 2 years \nhe was an attorney for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of \nJustice. He served a 3-year tour of duty in the U.S. Navy. He was rated \nunanimously as well qualified by the ABA.\n  On October 16, 1997, the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette reported that one of \nthe two home State Senators held up his nomination for 2 years, \nallowing neither a hearing nor a vote, and I do not believe it was the \nchairman of the committee.\n  Bruce Greer was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Florida on August 1, 1995. He did not receive a hearing and \nhe was never voted on by the committee. His nomination was withdrawn on \nMay 13, 1996. At the time of his nomination, he was the president of \nthe Miami law firm of Greer, Homer & Bonner, where he has a civil \nlitigation practice.\n  Senator Bob Graham supported him. Senator Connie Mack's position is \nnot known. It is my understanding the Wall Street Journal published a \nlengthy editorial on July 17, 1996, that made no direct allegations \nagainst Greer, but made a case for guilt by association implying that, \nbecause Mr. Greer represented unsavory defendants, he was soft on \ncrime.\n  The Columbia Journalism Review reported that the day after the \neditorial appeared, the chairman came to the floor to denounce judges \nwho are soft on crime and, shortly afterward, Mr. Greer received word \nthat he would not be receiving a hearing. So Bruce Greer was denied \neven a hearing to see if the allegations were true.\n  That is what has happened, ladies and gentlemen.\n  Leland Shurin was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Missouri on April 4, 1995. He did not receive a \nhearing and was never voted on in committee. His nomination was \nwithdrawn at his request, because of inaction, on September 5, 1995.\n  He was an executive committee member and partner at the law firm of \nMcDowell, Rice & Smith, in Kansas City, where he maintained a general \npractice doing plaintiff and defense litigation. He was very active in \nthe community.\n  He was rated as qualified by the ABA committee. He told the Kansas \nCity Star:\n\n       I had the sense that my confirmation is being delayed. No \n     one could give me a clear date when anything could be done. \n     I've sat around for two years. I can't keep doing it.\n\n  One has to come to grips with whether this was a fair process, \nwhether this was even as fair as what is happening today. I believe no \nway, no how was this a fair process. I have been one who has believed \nthat the blue slip should be done away with, that there should be no \nanonymous holds, and that every\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nappointee should be given a hearing and a vote in the committee. That \ndoes not mean that we should change the rules of the Senate to prevent, \nin extreme cases, the ability of the minority to register a strong \npoint of view, when the minority of one has historically been allowed \nto register a strong point of view secretly and, in fact, kill a \nnominee.\n  Sue Ellen Myerscough was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of Illinois on October 11, 1995. She did not receive a \nhearing or a vote in committee. She was an Illinois State circuit court \njudge. She was an associate circuit court judge. She worked in law \nfirms in Springfield. She formerly clerked for U.S. District Judge \nHarold Baker. A substantial majority of the ABA committee rated her as \nwell qualified, while a minority rated her as qualified.\n  She was supported by both Senator Paul Simon and Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun at the time. In 1997, Senator Dick Durbin stated in the \nState Journal-Register that he believed ``Judge Myerscough was caught \nup in a Federal stall.''\n  On September 27, 1996, the State Journal-Register reported that \nSenator Simon said he believed the reason was a matter of partisanship, \nnot because of any controversy or problems with her qualifications. \nSenator Simon said he escorted Myerscough for individual meetings with \nSenator Hatch and other members of the panel but had ``not had a single \nmember of the committee tell me he or she couldn't vote for her.''\n  This is what has happened. So I have a hard time understanding why we \nare where we are today.\n  Charles Stack was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit on October 27, 1995. He received a hearing before the \ncommittee on February 28, 1996, but did not receive a vote in \ncommittee.\n  According to the May 11, 1996, Miami Herald, he came under intense \nattack from then-Presidential candidate Bob Dole, and he withdrew his \nnomination on May 13, 1996.\n  Cheryl Wattley, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Texas on December 12, 1995, did not receive a hearing or \nvote in committee. The Dallas Morning News reported in 1996 that she \nwas supported by both home State Senators. Again, no reason--probably \nfilibustered because one or two or three didn't like her for one reason \nor another.\n  Michael Schattman, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Texas, December 19, 1995, and renominated on March \n21, 1997, did not receive a hearing, was not voted on in committee. His \nnomination at his request was withdrawn on July 1998 after 2\\1/2\\ years \nof inaction by the committee. This man was a Texas State district court \njudge in Fort Worth. He had previously been a county court judge. And \nto add insult to injury, because of the lengthy delay in the nomination \nprocess, the February 11, 1998 edition of the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer \nreported that he lost his State court judgeship. He was unanimously \nrated as qualified. Again, this is the hidden filibuster of this body.\n  J. Rich Leonard, was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit, on December 22, 1995, did not receive a hearing or a \nvote in committee. Subsequently, he was nominated to the District Court \nfor the Eastern District of North Carolina on March 24, 1999. Again, he \ndid not receive a hearing or a vote. In total, this gentleman waited \nover 2.5 years before the committee for the two nominations without \never receiving a hearing or a vote. He was a judge on the U.S. \nBankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina at the time \nof his nomination by President Clinton. He was rated as well qualified. \nAgain, my information is that one Senator blocked both of his \nnominations.\n  I see there are others waiting. I will be brief. But let me list some \nof the others.\n  Robert Freedberg was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania, April 23, 1998. He never received a \nhearing. He was a judge on Northampton County's Court of Common Pleas. \nHe is a former prosecutor. The January 28, 1999 Allentown Morning Call \nreported that he was blocked by one Senator.\n  Robert Raymar, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit, did not receive a hearing. His nomination expired at the end \nof the session. Former deputy attorney general for the State of New \nJersey, member of the New Jersey Executive Commission on Ethical \nStandards. He was rated as qualified. He was supported by both State \nSenators. One person filibustered this individual in committee. He \ndidn't receive a hearing or a vote.\n  James Lyons, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth \nCircuit, did not receive a hearing or a vote, and withdrew after it \nbecame clear he would not receive a hearing or a vote. He was a \nlongtime senior trial partner at the Denver law firm of Rothberger, \nJohnson & Lyons, special advisor to the President of the United States \nand the Secretary of State for economic initiatives in Ireland and \nNorthern Ireland. He couldn't get a hearing. He was adjudged well \nqualified by the ABA.\n  I don't see where anybody is concerned about these injustices, and \nthat is what they were--real injustices.\n  John Snodgrass was nominated to the U.S. District Court, Northern \nDistrict of Alabama, September 22, 1994, renominated January 11, 1995. \nHe did not receive a hearing or a committee vote. His nomination was \nwithdrawn on September 5, 1995.\n  Anabelle Rodriguez was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Puerto Rico, January 26, 1996, renominated March 21, 1997. \nA committee hearing was held on October 1 of 1998, but a vote was never \nheld on her nomination during the nearly 3 years her nomination was \npending. What were the reasons for this block? On October 8, 1998, the \nAssociated Press reported that her supporters said she was opposed by \nPuerto Rico's prostatehood Governor and congressional representative \nbecause she is a backer of the island's current status as a U.S. \ncommonwealth, and there was apparently some overwhelming bipartisan \nopposition.\n  Why not vote? If what is being said now has been true and par for the \ncourse, why not vote?\n  Lynne Lasry was nominated for the Southern District of California but \ndid not receive a hearing or a vote. After one year of inaction, the \nnomination was withdrawn in 1998.\n  James Klein was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia, January 27, 1998, renominated March 25, 1999, and did not \nreceive a hearing or committee vote during the 3 years that he was \npending.\n  Patricia Coan was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Colorado, May 27, 1999. She did not receive a hearing or \ncommittee vote in the year and a half that her nomination was pending. \nThe May 21, 2000 Denver Post reported that one Senator blocked her \nnomination.\n  Dolly Gee was nominated to the District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California, May 22, 1999. She did not receive a hearing or \ncommittee vote in the year and a half that her nomination was pending.\n  Fred Woocher was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California, received a hearing on November 10, 1999, but \nwas not voted on by the committee despite waiting for a year after his \nhearing.\n  Steven Bell was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Ohio but did not receive a hearing or vote in committee for \nmore than a year that his nomination was pending.\n  Rhonda Fields was nominated to District Court for the District of \nColumbia on November 17, 1999, no hearing, no vote.\n  Robert Cindrich was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Third \nCircuit, February 9, 2000, no hearing, no vote.\n  David Fineman was nominated to the U.S. District for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania on March 9, 2000, no hearing, no vote.\n\n  Linda Riegle was nominated to the U.S. District for the District of \nNevada on April 25, 2000, no hearing, no vote in committee.\n  Ricardo Morado was nominated to the U.S. District for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas on May 11, 2000, no hearing, no vote.\n  Stephen Orlofsky was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Third \nCircuit, May 25, 2000, no hearing, no vote.\n  Gary Sebelius was nominated to the U.S. District for the District of \nKansas on June 6, 2000, no hearing, no vote.\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\n  Kenneth Simon was nominated to the U.S. District for the Northern \nDistrict of Alabama on June 6, 2000, no hearing, no vote.\n  John S.W. Lim was nominated to the U.S. District for the District of \nHawaii on June 8, 2000, no hearing, no vote.\n  And there are those, you might say, that came under the Thurmond \nrule. There is sort of an informal practice that in the last few months \nof a President's tenure, the hearings do not go forward. Again, that is \nnot a rule; it is a practice.\n  Christine Arguello, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Tenth \nCircuit, on July 27, 2000.\n  Andre Davis, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, \non October 6, 2000.\n  Elizabeth Gibson, nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Fourth \nCircuit, on October 26, 2000.\n  David Cercone, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania on July 27, 2000.\n  Harry Litman, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania on July 27, 2000.\n  Valerie Couch, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Oklahoma on September 7, 2000.\n  Marian Johnston, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of California on September 7, 2000.\n  Steve Achelpohl, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Nebraska on September 12, 2000.\n  Richard Anderson nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Montana on September 13, 2000.\n  Stephen Lieberman, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania on September 14, 2000.\n  And, Melvin Hall, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Oklahoma on October 3, 2000.\n  What I have tried to show today is that there is a certain amount of \nhypocrisy in what is going on today. The opposition cannot have any \nconcern about one Clinton nominee or dozens of Clinton nominees who \nreceived no hearing, no markup, no floor vote, but suddenly they are \nupset because 41 of us in public, eight of us in committee, vote no and \nbelieve that our views are strong enough and substantive enough to \nwarrant a debate on the floor of the Senate in the true tradition of \nthe Senate. And bingo, we are going to have a change in the rules to \nprevent that from happening. Nobody is talking about changing the rules \nso one person can't filibuster; one person can't, on a pique or because \nthey don't like the individual, condemn that individual.\n  I can tell you, because I have been on this committee for 12 years, I \nhave had people call me and say: Look, I have three children. I have to \nknow what is going to happen to me. I try to get information, can't get \nthat information.\n  I ask the majority of this body, is that fair? Do you not feel \naggrieved? Or is that OK because it was a different President of a \ndifferent party? I don't think so. I think what is sauce for the goose \nis sauce for the gander. I pointed out two uses of filibusters for \njudicial appointments by Republicans, one in 1881 and one in 1968.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am curious to know when the Senator \nplans to complete her remarks. At the beginning of her remarks, she \nassured the Senate that she would take about 30 minutes. We are on the \nconference report on the supplemental appropriations bill which is an \nurgent supplemental bill. We have about 4 hours divided among Senators \non both sides to complete debate. I don't want to push the Senate into \nthe evening hours, if we are going to have a prolonged discussion of \nthis issue when we thought it was going to be 30 minutes. It is almost \nan hour now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the Senator's forbearance. He is a true \ngentleman. Out of respect for him and for the institution, I will \nconclude my remarks.\n  During the reorganization of the Senate in 2000, Senators Daschle and \nLeahy worked to make the nominations process more fair and public. This \nrefining forced Senators opposed to a nomination to be held accountable \nfor their positions. They could not hide behind a cloak of secrecy. \nThis step also wiped out many of the procedural hurdles that have been \nused to defeat nominations. So many of the tools used by Republicans in \nthe past, and referred to as a way to draw distinctions with a public \ncloture vote are no longer available. This historical record is \nimportant, yet it is too often lost in our debates.\n  I also believe it is useful to examine the current state of judicial \nnominations, and what has actually occurred in this body during \nPresident Bush's tenure: 208 judges confirmed out of 218; 95 percent of \nPresident Bush's judges have been confirmed; the Senate has confirmed \n35 circuit court nominees; recently, the Judiciary Committee reported \nout 2 District Court and 1 Circuit Court nominees; today, there are \nonly 4 judicial nominations on the Senate calendar waiting for a vote; \nand there are only 45 total vacancies, both district and circuit \ncourts, and 29 do not have nominations submitted.\n\n  What do these numbers mean? There are more judges today sitting on \nthe federal bench than in any previous presidency. The Senate has \nconfirmed more judges for President Bush than in President Reagan's \nfirst term, his father's only term, or President Clinton's second term.\n  The Senate confirmed more circuit court judicial nominees than in \nReagan's or Clinton's first term. When Democrats were in the majority \nin 2001, there were 110 vacancies and by the end of the 108th Congress \nand President Bush's first term, the number had plummeted to 27--the \nlowest level of vacancies since the Reagan era.\n  Of the 8 nominees reported out of committee this year, four have \nalready been confirmed. One, Thomas Griffith, is waiting a vote, and \nthe remaining three are controversial nominees who were defeated last \nCongress: William Myers, Priscilla Owen, and Janice Rogers Brown.\n  In addition, President Bush has sent the Senate but one new judicial \nnomination this year. Brian Sandoval of Nevada is the only new judicial \nnomination sent to the Senate in the first five months of this year. He \nhas bipartisan support from his home State Senators and appears to be a \nconsensus nominee.\n  Again, what do these numbers mean? They mean there is no crisis on \nthe federal bench that justifies the so-called nuclear option as some \nof my Republican colleagues contend.\n  To me, the record I just described and the reasons for opposing these \nlimited number of nominees doesn't lead to the conclusion that the \nSenate should be discussing breaking our own institutional rules and \nunraveling the checks and balances established by our Constitution.\n  Some have described this debate as a strategy to change the rules. \nChanging the rules is not only unacceptable, but in this case it is \ninaccurate as well. The nuclear option is a strategy to break the \nrules. This isn't just my assessment; it's the conclusion drawn by the \nSenate Parliamentarian and the Congressional Research Service.\n  Last week, press reports reiterated that Senator Reid had been \nassured by the Parliamentarian that if the Republicans go through with \nthis strategy they would ``have to overrule him, because what they are \ndoing is wrong.''\n  The Congressional Research Service concluded in a recent report that \nto employ these tactics the Senate would have to ``overturn previous \nprecedent.'' ``Proceedings of this kind, it is argued, would both break \nold precedent and establish new Senate precedents. Eventually such a \nplan might even result in changes in Senate rules, while circumventing \nthe procedures prescribed by Senate rules.''\n  So, shortly, the Senate will likely be faced with a preemptive strike \nto break the rules. The term preemptive strike seems appropriate when \nthere are only three controversial judges waiting for a vote--judges \nwho were previously defeated last Congress and have drawn strong \nopposition.\n  This is a move to wipe out 200 years of precedent when this Senate \nhas only been in session for just over 4 months, when this President \nhas had over 200 judges confirmed, and when the Judiciary Committee \nreported favorably a controversial circuit court judge who was not \nvoted on last Congress, but was renominated. This appears to me to be \nan escalation that is unwarranted in the reality of what has actually \noccurred and is happening in this session.\n  I find it ironic that while our country fights abroad to establish \ndemocracy,\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nto promote checks and balances, and institute wide representation of \nall people in government; here at home our leadership is attempting to \nerode those very protections in our own government. What kind of \nmessage are we sending? ``Do as I say, not as I do''?\n  This debate over judicial nominees is a debate about privacy, women's \nrights, civil rights, clean environment, access to healthcare and \neducation; retirement security--we may not all agree, but the beauty of \nour country is the freedom to disagree, to debate, and to require \ncompromise because no one party has the corner on the market of good \nideas and solutions--and no party has the corner on the market of \npolitical power.\n  Democrats held the House majority for over 50 years, and now \nRepublicans have been in the majority for over a decade. Democrats held \nthe White House for eight years, now the Republicans will have occupied \nthe White House for eight years. Neither party will always be right \nwhen it comes to the best policies for our country, and neither party \nwill always be in power.\n  There are many urgent problems the Senate needs to be focused on and \nAmericans' want us to focus on: the war in Iraq; protecting our \nhomeland; addressing the high cost of prescription drugs; alleviating \nrising gas prices; ensuring our social security system is stable and \nworking; and reducing the federal deficit.\n  I am troubled that instead today we are spending much of our time on \npolitical posturing gone too far--on a strategy to unravel our \nconstitutional checks and balances.\n  Cold War commentator Walter Lippman once said, ``In making the great \nexperiment of governing people by consent rather than by coercion, it \nis not sufficient that the party in power should have a majority. It is \njust as necessary that the party in power should never outrage the \nminority.'' And today, we are outraged.\n  I would hope that the majority would not choose to unravel that \nfoundation over a small handful of nominees. I would hope we would \ncontinue to honor the tradition of our democracy. I would hope the \nPresident will urge others in his party to walk away from this nuclear \nstrategy. And I know if the shoe was on the other foot, I would not \nadvocate breaking Senate rules and precedent.\n\n  Regardless of how this debate continues to unfold, I remain committed \nto evaluating each candidate on a case by case basis, and I will \ncontinue to ensure that judicial nominees are treated fairly and even-\nhandedly, but I will not fail to raise concerns or objections when \nthere are legitimate issues that need to be discussed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, before I make my remarks on the \nsupplemental appropriations conference report, I commend my friend and \ncolleague from California. As we have come to expect, her presentation \nwas thorough, comprehensive, factually and historically accurate. Much \nin the debate that has occurred around the so-called nuclear option has \nbeen heated. It has been rhetorical. It has been filled with opinion. \nIt has been, unfortunately, often devoid of either historical or \nfactual content. I personally appreciate greatly the Senator from \nCalifornia putting into the Record these very carefully created remarks \nbased on facts. I hope no matter what happens with this debate--and \nobviously, I hope the Senate comes to its senses and realizes that we \nowe an obligation to the Constitution and the country--historians will \nbe able to look back and read the very impressive statement of the \nSenator from California and know what the facts were. I personally \nexpress my appreciation to her.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from New York yield for a question?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized at 2:15 for 15 minutes to discuss the supplemental. Senator \nByrd is the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. If he is \nhere and wishes to speak at that time, I will yield the floor to him. \nIn the absence of that, I ask consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to address the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations conference report. When the vote occurs, it \nis likely to be, if not unanimous, very close to being unanimous. And \nwhy? Because this conference report contains the funding that is needed \nby our brave troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It contains funding to \nprovide necessary resources to equip our troops and to do the military \nconstruction that is necessary. I will vote for this conference \nreport. But I want to record some serious reservations about this \nprocess. First, the emergency supplemental appropriations process is \ndestined to be just that. It is a way to fund unforeseen emergencies \noutside of the usual budgetary process.\n\n  Unfortunately, once again, we are funding the cost of the military in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, as well as a legitimate emergency, \nsuch as the tsunami relief provisions in the bill, through an \nemergency. I am privileged to sit on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, which is responsible for presenting the authorization for \nthe budget for the Department of Defense, and during several of our \nhearings over the last several months, I, among a number of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, have asked our civilian and \nmilitary leadership from the Department of Defense how they explain the \nfact that once again the costs for Iraq and Afghanistan are not in the \nbudget; they are in the emergency supplemental.\n  Many of these costs perhaps were genuine emergencies, but many others \nare not. I would not argue with many of the decisions made because I am \nwell aware of the importance of recapitalizing our equipment, building \nback up our stores of arms that have been decreased through necessary \naction. But a good budgeting process would take all of that into \naccount. Having this supplemental, unfortunately, with the big title \n``emergency'' over it appears to be an effort to rush things through to \navoid congressional oversight and scrutiny. Obviously, a bill that is \ngoing to provide funding for the young men and women wearing the \nuniform of our country, in harm's way every single hour of every day, \nis going to command broad bipartisan and public support, as it should. \nBut that doesn't, in my opinion, in any way mitigate against what \nshould be the necessity of an orderly process, an appropriations \nprocess subject to the give and take of opinion and fact, and argument \nand reason and evidence, and then the presentation of a budget that \nincludes the expenses that are necessary for our military.\n  I regret deeply that we are, once again, seeing an emergency bill \nbeing pushed through the Senate, as it was pushed through the House \nlast week, when instead we should be having an orderly process looking \nat these matters within the budget and making decisions based on that \nprocess.\n  During the Armed Services Committee hearing on this supplemental \nrequest, a number of my colleagues asked why projects that ordinarily \nare included in the regular Department of Defense budget were being \nshifted to the supplemental. I really was quite taken aback when the \nmilitary leadership said they didn't know, that they were just told \nthey should put it out for the supplemental. The civilian leadership \npresent at the hearing could not offer a much better explanation. So it \nis regrettable that we are making these important, literally life-and-\ndeath decisions once again in an emergency supplemental as opposed to \nthe regular budget.\n  Also, it is regrettable that the administration is not providing a \nproper accounting of how funds are being spent in Iraq. According to \nrecent reports, Government auditors found that American officials \nrushed to start small building projects in a large area of Iraq during \n2003 and 2004. They did not keep the required records that would tell \nus how they spent $89.4 million in cash. They cannot account for at \nleast $7.2 million more. This is a very serious question. If we are \nappropriating this money and we are sending it for both military and \nreconstruction purposes to Iraq, we have a right to expect that records \nwill be kept so we can determine whether it is being spent in the \nappropriate manner.\n  We have also heard that millions of dollars of Iraqi reconstruction \nfunds that have been appropriated have also\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\nnot been spent. A large reason for that is security. But why come back \nfor more money when we cannot spend the money we have already \nappropriated? It is heartbreaking to me that there is so little \noversight from this Congress with respect to this administration. There \nare no rigorous hearings being held to determine whether we are \nspending money correctly, how it is being spent, where all of the cash \nis going. The first time I flew into Iraq, I flew from Kuwait to \nBaghdad on a C-130. The back of it was loaded with cash--dollars. They \nwere being taken into Baghdad to be spent for God knows what, and there \nis no accountability.\n  It is remarkable that this Congress, at this important moment in \nAmerican history, is not exercising its constitutional oversight \nresponsibilities. During the Second World War, Harry Truman, a \nDemocratic President, with a Democratic Congress, held hearings about \nwhere money was going in World War II. In the 1960s, Senator Fulbright, \nwith a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress, held hearings \nabout our policies and actions in Vietnam. We have a Republican \nPresident, a Republican Congress--hear no evil, see no evil, speak to \nevil; we don't want to know. Questions are not asked--at least \npublicly. People have no idea where this money is going, who is getting \nit, and how it is being spent. These emergency supplementals have even \nless oversight than the typical budget, which in this Congress is \npractically nothing.\n\n  So while we continue to spend billions and billions of American \ntaxpayer dollars, we don't see the requisite accountability occurring \nin this body to determine whether we are spending them appropriately.\n  I am also deeply concerned that on an emergency supplemental to fund \nour troops and fund the relief disaster in southeast Asia because of \nthe tsunami, we are being asked to vote on something called ``REAL \nID.'' It is a provision meant to, in the supporters' argument, make our \ncountry safer. How do we know? We haven't had hearings about it in the \nSenate. We have not even had debate about it in the Senate. I joined \nwith Senator Feinstein to try to prevent immigration proposals from \nbeing tacked onto the supplemental. But we all know why that happened--\nbecause the administration backed up the House Republican leadership to \ngive them an opportunity to put the so-called REAL ID on a must-pass \npiece of legislation; namely, legislation to fund our troops. So \nwithout debate, without committee hearings, without process, we have \nthe so-called REAL ID in this emergency supplemental.\n  I am outraged that the Republican leadership, first in the House and \nnow, unfortunately, in the Senate, would put this seriously flawed act \ninto this emergency supplemental bill for our troops in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Emergency legislation designed to provide our troops the \nresources they need to fight terrorism on the front lines is not the \nplace for broad, sweeping immigration reform. That is what REAL ID is. \nThere may be parts of it that we could agree on if we ever had a chance \nto debate it. Other parts go too far and don't fulfill the purpose of \nmaking our country more secure.\n  I am in total agreement with those who argue that we need to address \nour immigration challenges, and we are still not doing what we should \nto fulfill the demands of homeland security. I think they go hand-in-\nhand. If we cannot secure our borders, we cannot secure our homeland. \nEverybody knows we are not securing our borders. Who are we kidding? We \nneed a much tougher, smarter look at these issues. But instead we are \ntaking a piece of legislation passed by the House, jammed into \nsupplemental emergency appropriations for our troops, and we are going \nto up-end the way we do driver's licenses throughout our country, and \nwe are going to claim we have now made America safer.\n  I think that is a false claim. I regret deeply that we are rushing to \npass this emergency bill with this so-called REAL ID in it. We need to \nreform our immigration laws. We need to make our borders more secure. \nBut we need a debate about how we are going to do that. Isn't it \nsomewhat interesting to everyone in this Chamber that the richest, \nsmartest country with the best technology in the world cannot secure \nits borders? Why would that be? Well, part of the reason is because \nthere are many people, particularly to our south, who are desperate for \na better chance. They literally risk their lives to come here. Part of \nit is because we have a lot of employers who want to employ them. So \nthey know if they get here, they will have a job. We are not having a \npublic national debate about this because, if we were, we would have to \npoint fingers at these employers who pick up illegal immigrants every \nsingle day on street corners throughout America, or who sign them up to \nwork in dangerous factories with very little health and safety \nregulation.\n  So come on, let's not kid ourselves. We have a serious security and \nimmigration problem. But we are not addressing it by jamming this \nprovision about driver's licenses into our emergency appropriations. We \nneed to make our borders more secure. I have introduced legislation 3 \nyears in a row to have a northern border coordinator. I met with both \nSecretary Ridge and Secretary Chertoff. We don't know who is in charge \nof the northern border. Trying to figure out who is responsible for the \nnorthern border is like playing ``Where is Waldo.'' we cannot figure \nthat out. We are not taking simple steps to rationalize our bureaucracy \nin Washington, to find out what our holes are and how they can be \nplugged, what policies would work if we were actually serious about \nimproving security.\n  The REAL ID Act also gives total control to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to waive legal requirements that stand in the way of \nconstructing barriers and roads along the border. The only check is \nlimited judicial review. This is quite a tremendous grant of authority \nto one person in our Government. I am sure there are some reasons why \nwe would want to expedite a process to try to have better security \nalong our borders. But to give this unchecked responsibility to the \nSecretary, with limited judicial review--that is a slippery slope, my \nfriends. We are sliding further and further toward absolute power and \nthe removal of our checks and balances.\n  We also have to figure out how we are going to deal with the changes \nin asylum rules that are in REAL ID. I am very proud of the fact that \nour country has always welcomed asylum-seekers and refugees. There is a \ncity in New York, Utica, which is known as one of the most welcoming \nplaces for refugees in the entire country. I am so proud of the people \nof Utica. They have taken in Bosnians, Kosovars, Somalians, all kinds \nof refugees--people who could not stay in their home country and were \ndesperate for some place of refuge. Under these new rules, we will see \nwhether America remains the place of welcome, whether we fulfill our \nobligations to our fellow men and women.\n  I hope that the failure of having a process with respect to REAL ID, \nthe continuing use of the supplemental appropriations route for funding \nour troops, which avoids the budget process, will at some point come to \nan end because the majority will no longer tolerate it. This is not \ngood for any of us--to have these kinds of processes that really turn \nour constitutional system upside down.\n  In the meantime, we need to send a message that we are able to have \nnational debates about sensitive issues, to debate judicial nominations \non the floor, using the rules that have really stood the test of time \nand been good for the Senate and our country. We don't always win, but \nthe Senate was devised to protect minority rights. I represent a State \nof 19 million people. The Presiding Officer represents a much smaller \nState. He and I are equal. That is the whole idea behind the setup of \nthe Senate.\n\n  Finally, let's be sure that we do not piecemeal reform immigration--I \nuse the word ``reform'' advisedly--that we have the kind of debate and \ncomprehensive reform that is so needed. I bet every one of the offices \nof my colleagues is faced with what my office confronts every single \nday. We do lots of casework. There are a lot of people who came here \nlegally. They cannot get their relatives into this country. They cannot \nreunite their families. I want to have a reform that really provides \nbenefits for legal immigrants.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can deal with these issues in a better way \nthat really reflects the best of the Senate going forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe, by unanimous consent, I am to \nbe recognized at 2:15 for 15 minutes.\n  I allocate 2\\1/2\\ minutes of that time to the Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, although I will vote for this conference \nreport, I feel obliged to alert my colleagues to a serious flaw. This \nbill does not provide enough international food aid. And if emerging \nreports are correct, I fear we are about to enter a spring and summer \nof agony in some of the poorest parts of the world.\n  This situation troubles me a great deal. Here we are, the strongest \nnation on Earth, and we are rightfully appropriating funds to maintain \nthat strength. But with enormous strength comes a moral obligation to \nrespond appropriately to pain and suffering. This bill fails to respond \nappropriately.\n  When the supplemental was first considered in this body, Senator \nDeWine and I and others offered an amendment to provide a total of $470 \nmillion for PL-480 food aid. That may sound like a lot to some, but it \ntotaled merely six-tenths of 1 percent of the total spending in the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, $346 million of our amendment was intended to meet the \nU.S. share of world-wide food emergency needs as already identified by \nthe U.S. Government. Another $12 million was slated to restore Food for \nPeace resources diverted to address the tsunami. Finally, $112 million \nwas intended to restore food aid development projects that the United \nStates has already pledged to other countries this year.\n  It troubles me, and it should trouble everyone here, that we may not \nbe able to deliver on those pledges. What a disturbing message that \nsends to the rest of the world. It says that while we may talk a good \ngame on food aid, you cannot be too sure just where we stand when the \ngoing gets tough.\n  The numbers in our amendment were not pulled out of thin air. They \nwere the result of close analysis of the world situation. In light of \nnew reports from Ethiopia, I worry that even the amounts included in \nour original amendment may have been, in fact, too conservative.\n  Sadly, the conference reduced the food aid total to $240 million, a \nlevel that is well below a split with the level proposed by the \nadministration and adopted by the House.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an alert I received from several faith-\nbased organizations about the situation in Ethiopia be printed into the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Flash Alert From JRP Members\n\n\n                   Addis Ababa, Ethiopia--April 2005\n\n       The three Churches and two Church-related agencies \n     (Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Ethiopian Catholic Church, \n     Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, Catholic Relief \n     Services and Lutheran World Federation) who make up the \n     ecumenical Joint Relief Partnership feel compelled to bring \n     to the public's attention a situation that if not immediately \n     addressed in a forceful manner will bring about widespread \n     disaster resulting in untold suffering and death for a number \n     of people--a number that is rapidly approaching the 8-10 \n     million mark of Ethiopian people at risk in 2005.\n       This humanitarian situation has thus far received little \n     international attention for a variety of reasons, which in \n     addition to the reluctance of the Ethiopian Government to \n     advertise it are the following: Severe drought conditions. \n     The late start-up of the Ethiopian government's national \n     Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) which is meant to \n     provide multi-year support to over 5 million chronically food \n     insecure people. The lack of adequate resources to provide \n     food and non-food assistance to 3.1 million acute food \n     insecure people.\n       Drought Conditions: The current reality is that the early \n     belg rains (February/March) have failed in many areas, \n     including East and West Hararghe and Arsi zones of Oromiya, \n     parts of Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP) \n     and parts of Tigray. The situation is severe, with many \n     pocket areas showing high levels of global acute and severe \n     acute malnutrition in children under 5. As an example, \n     reports from the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness \n     Commission (DPPC) indicate that large numbers of severely \n     malnourished children are entering one hospital in East \n     Hararghe from three woredas seriously affected by \n     malnutrition.\n       There are rising and alarming levels of distress migration \n     in certain areas, water is particularly scarce in some areas \n     and cereal prices are high.\n       Delays in Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP): This is a \n     program designed to overcome people's dependence on food \n     assistance. While this is an important step, continued robust \n     response to emergency conditions is critical to ensure the \n     success of more developmentally oriented programs. \n     Unfortunately, this program, which was meant to begin in \n     January 2005, didn't start until late March in most areas of \n     the country and, in some areas, still has not begun. Without \n     going into details of why this foul-up occurred, the fact is \n     that people targeted under the PSNP have, in most cases, not \n     yet received the planned assistance and there are now \n     deteriorating health conditions, especially in women and \n     children. Many of the chronically food insecure now face \n     acute conditions, themselves.\n       Poor Resourcing of 2005 Appeal: Current figures indicate \n     that 66% of food needs are pledged and only 10% of non-food \n     needs. It must be noted, however, that this includes an un-\n     guaranteed WFP pledge. With the number of people requiring \n     assistance continually increasing, the level of resources \n     required is certain to increase significantly. While 66% \n     sounds promising, it should be noted that, using current \n     assessments going on, this figure may not adequately \n     represent the real need.\n       Among the reasons for the low level of resources are: Donor \n     attention being focused on other emergencies (Darfur and \n     tsunami), greater emphasis being placed within the country on \n     PSNP rather than ongoing emergency needs, pressure to \n     demonstrate that the country is moving away from annual \n     Emergency Appeals, misleading recent WFP/FAO crop assessment \n     suggesting a 25% increase in yield over last year, and \n     traditional food donors having their own constraints.\n       Unless commitments o food and non-food items are made \n     immediately, the JRP will not be able to pre-position food in \n     the most severely affected areas prior to the rainy season \n     which starts in June because of poor road conditions at that \n     time. This will lead to further setbacks and great loss of \n     life.\n       It is with the above in mind, that the JRP is appealing to \n     its traditional Partners to bring this situation to the \n     world's attention and to act as promptly as possible.\n       With every best wish, we remain, the JRP Members:\n     Ethiopian Orthodox Church,\n     Ethiopian Catholic Church,\n     Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus,\n     Catholic Relief Services,\n     Lutheran World Federation.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. This situation is not going to go away. I have grave fears \nthat images coming out of places such as Ethiopia in the coming months \nmay reveal a tragedy unfolding before our very eyes. And what is most \ntroubling is that this may be a tragedy that we could have helped \navoid.\n  I will soon be sending a letter to the President encouraging him to \nconsider other emergency authorities to address this dire situation. \nSpecifically, we will ask him to utilize the Bill Emerson Humanitarian \nTrust to address this pain and suffering. I urge all my colleagues to \njoin us in sending this message to the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Wisconsin. I\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\nagree with all he has described. I think this is a really important \nissue and increased food aid is critically important. So I appreciate \nhim being here.\n  I will speak for a moment about this $82 billion supplemental bill. \nMost of it is to restore accounts in the U.S. Army and other military \ninstallations or military organizations because that money was not in \nthe budget. We had asked last year that it be put in the appropriations \nprocess so that it could be considered. We know that we are going to \nspend money in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the administration, year after \nyear, does not put any money in for these accounts and then comes back \nwith an emergency request later.\n  It is a fiction that is being created. We know this is costing money \nevery single month. I guess the reason to do it on an emergency basis \nis so that nobody has to pay for it. This is $82 billion not paid for, \njust emergency, stack it on top of the debt and say to the troops: Go \nto Iraq, serve your country, do your duty and, by the way, when you \ncome back we will have the debt waiting for you, so you have served in \nIraq and you can also come back and pay for the cost of that. That does \nnot make any sense to me.\n  We had a small provision on the issue of government spending when \nthis bill was before the Senate, and I want to talk about it for a \nmoment. It dealt with the appointment of an independent counsel in 1995 \nthat was to investigate the allegation that a Cabinet official lied \nabout payments he had made to his mistress. So an independent counsel \nwas formed 10 years ago. That independent counsel was to investigate \nMr. Cisneros, a man who I may have met in 1993 or 1994 and have not \nseen since. In any event, an independent counsel was appointed to \ninvestigate whether he lied about payments he had made to a mistress. \nTen years ago, that independent counsel started working and spending \nmoney. In 1999, Mr. Cisneros, the subject of the investigation, pleaded \nguilty to a misdemeanor. In 2001, 2 years later, the President pardoned \nhim. So 10 years ago the independent counsel was formed, 6 years ago \nthe subject of the investigation pleaded guilty, and 4 years ago the \nsubject of the investigation was pardoned by the President.\n  This independent counsel is still in business and still spending \nmoney. In the last 6 months, the independent counsel has spent nearly \n$1.3 million. I offered an amendment, that the Senate passed, which \nsays, tell them to finish by June and shut down. In fact, 2 years ago, \nthe three-judge panel which supervises this independent counsel told \nhim to wrap it up, and get it done. This independent counsel has now \nspent $21 million over 10 years, and so we offered an amendment that \nsaid, shut it down.\n  The Senate accepted it. It went to conference and it was pulled out. \nSo the independent counsel still spends money.\n  The Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial saying this was some \nnefarious amendment designed to try and protect some information that \nexists deep in the bowels about some scandal with the Internal Revenue \nService--typical political sludge coming from the editorial page of the \nWall Street Journal. Then we have the same sludge offered by Mr. Novak \nin his column, I believe it was last Thursday, suggesting there is \nsomething else going on here.\n  Well, let me just say this: If we have enough money to have \nindependent counsels continuing to be paid 6 years after the subject of \ntheir investigation pled guilty, and 4 years after they were pardoned, \nit is a high-water mark for bad judgment. It is unbelievable. All it \ndescribes to me, with respect to Mr. Novak and the folks who believe we \nshould keep spending this money, is that even waste has a constituency, \nin some cases a very aggressive constituency.\n  We really need to save the taxpayers' money, and this is an \nunbelievable waste of the taxpayers' money.\n  Let me ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Robert Fulghum wrote a book entitled simply, ``All I \nReally Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.'' Many have read that \nbook. Some of it is, of course, wash your hands, share, be nice to \nothers. One, of course, is to tell the truth. That simple kindergarten \nlesson is lost in some cases and particularly in the media wars that go \non over significant issues.\n  I brought to the floor today some advertisements that are being run \nacross the country in support of those who in this Senate Chamber are \nprepared to exercise what is called a self-described ``nuclear option'' \nby the majority. What is their nuclear option? Well, they are in kind \nof a snit. They do not get all of the judges approved--just over 95 \npercent of the judges sent to us by the President. Now, because not \nevery single judge has been approved by the Senate, the majority party \nis out of sorts, cranky, upset, and sufficiently so that they and the \ngroups from outside this Chamber have decided what they ought to do is \nviolate the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the \nSenate.\n  Let me just point out what is happening as they lead up to this so-\ncalled nuclear option where they violate the rules of the Senate. They \nare creating their own fiction. The President, by the Constitution, has \nthe right to nominate Federal judges who will sit for a lifetime on the \nFederal bench. We have a separate responsibility to advise and consent. \nThe President sends a name down, and we say yes or no.\n  This President, George W. Bush, has sent 218 names of people he wants \nto serve for a lifetime on the Federal bench. We have approved 208 of \nthem. Because they have not gotten approval for all of them, they have \ndecided they want to violate the rules of the Senate in order to change \nthe rules of the Senate.\n\n  Let me give an example of one of the 10, Janice Rogers Brown. Here is \nwhat she says, and I am quoting her directly:\n\n       Senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren \n     because they have a right to get as much free stuff as the \n     political system will permit them to extract.\n\n  One does not have to be a rocket scientist to understand what this \nmeans. This is somebody whose philosophy believes that there is \nsomething inherently wrong with Social Security and Medicare. It is the \nold folks living off the rest of the country.\n  I do not know, maybe it is a person who does not know senior \ncitizens, has not visited a nursing home, does not understand what it \nis like to work without very much money, without resources, and wonder \nwhat their retirement is going to be like.\n  Do I want this person sitting on the Federal bench? No. Am I pleased \nthat I participated in saying, no, this person should not sit on the \nFederal bench? One can bet their life I am.\n  There are groups that are advertising in our States, and they are \nsaying this is an attack on people of faith if we do not support these \njudges, or it is an attack on a minority.\n  Here is a religious organization that is running ads in States:\n\n     . . . Never before has the political minority hijacked \n     democracy in this way. . . .\n\n  This religious organization says, in paid political advertising:\n\n     . . . Senate Democrats have abused the rules . . .\n\n  Another religious organization states:\n\n     . . . Never before in history have judges with majority \n     support been denied a vote by the misuse of the filibuster \n     rule. . . .\n\n  Well, there are Ten Commandments and they can be found in the 20th \nchapter of Exodus. I suggest to those who throw around this issue of \nfaith, those organizations that call themselves religious organizations \nand want to buy political ads and then not tell the truth in the ads, \nthat they refer to the 20th chapter of Exodus and the ninth \ncommandment, thou shalt not bear false witness. There are Ten \nCommandments, not nine. Do not skip the ninth when getting involved in \nthis discussion.\n  The least that is owed to the American people is the truth, and it is \nsimply not true that the minority in the Senate has abused the rules, \nor has hijacked democracy. That is simply not true.\n  The facts are that we have supported 208 of 218 nominees sent to us \nby this President. The facts are that the 60-vote requirement to get \ncloture in this Chamber is a requirement that has existed for a long \ntime, and it is a requirement that is healthy for this Chamber. It is \nprotective of the minority, whether it be Republican or Democrat. It is \nwhat requires compromise. Compromise is a good thing.\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\n  There are some in this Chamber who think that no one should ever \ncompromise. If one party runs the White House, the Senate and the \nHouse, they ought to have it their way all the time, and if they do not \nget it their way, they have a right to be angry and to change the rules \nof the Senate even if they violate the rules to do it.\n  There is a way to change the rules of the Senate. It takes 67 votes. \nI hope the 67 votes is not in dispute.\n  The majority has concocted a scheme by which with 51 votes they will \nchange or attempt to change the rules of the Senate with something they \nmislabel as the nuclear option.\n  This is something that disserves the interests of the Senate and the \nAmerican people. We have very serious problems with health care costs. \nWe have problems with the cost of prescription drugs. We have jobs \nmoving overseas in unlimited quantity. We have trade deficits, the \nlargest in the history of this country. We have serious energy \nproblems, and guess what, we have a majority that has their nose bent \nout of shape because there are 10 judges out of 218 who somehow did not \nmake it, and that is an affront to a majority that insists that they \nhave it their way all the time. I didn't take Latin because I was in a \nhigh school senior class of nine, but I think the term ``totus porcus'' \nmight just best describe what the majority party believes it is due on \nthese issues. They want it all--the whole hog--right now. If they do \nnot get it, they are prepared to go to the ultimate length that they \ndescribe as the nuclear option.\n\n  My hope is that in the coming days, heads will clear, and they will \nrethink this approach. Both parties will be in the minority at some \npoint. Both parties have been and will be in the future at some point. \nI believe any majority party, whether it be a Democratic Party or a \nRepublican Party, that decides to break the rules to change the rules \nwill rue the day that happens.\n  I came here because I want to work in a constructive way on public \npolicy. I hope we can continue to do that. But I read the Constitution \nagain and again and understand what it says. It says this Government of \nours works when we work together. The 60-vote majority in the Senate I \nknow is nettlesome. I know it gets under people's skin. But it is what \nhas always distinguished this Senate from other bodies. It is what \nrequires compromise. It says to a President--any President, Republican \nor Democratic President--when you send a name down here for a lifetime \nappointment to the bench, it ought to be a name that reflects some \nsemblance of compromise; and we have approved 208 of them. One of them \nI regret we approved. I voted against that one, by the way, a candidate \nfor a lifetime appointment on the court who has written that he \nbelieves women are subservient to men. I do not think that person \nbelongs on the bench, but the person made it through here. The fact is, \n208 of them are now serving for a lifetime on the Federal bench, which \nI think is extraordinary cooperation. I believe we have the lowest \nvacancy rate on the Federal bench that we have had for 15 years or \nmore.\n  It is profoundly disappointing to see what is going on around the \ncountry with a massive amount of money going to the television and \nradio stations, some by religious organizations, neck deep in politics, \nsaying you know what the minority party is doing in the Senate is \nhijacking democracy and engaging in mischief, abusing the rules and so \non and so forth. I again say to them that is, in my judgment, bearing \nfalse witness. They ought to know it.\n  Let's have a real debate--a thoughtful debate, not a thoughtless \ndebate--about how we proceed to address the major issues affecting \nAmerica. Yes, the major issues: health care, trade, jobs, energy--the \nsort of things that determine what kind of life our kids and grandkids \nare going to have, what kind of opportunity they are going to have.\n  When they sit around the supper table at night as a family, what are \nthe things people talk about? They talk about, Do I have a good job? \nDoes it pay well? Does it have benefits? Can I care for my family with \nthis income? Do Grandpa and Grandma have access to decent health care? \nDo we live in a safe neighborhood? Do we breathe air that is quality \nair and drink healthy water that is not going to injure our health? \nThese are the kinds of things that are important to people. Do we send \nour kids to schools we are proud of? Yet, are we debating that on the \nfloor of the Senate? No. No, regrettably not. That is not the central \nset of issues we are debating.\n  We are now debating this so-called nuclear option. Why? Because out \nof 218 names sent to us by the President asking for a lifetime \nappointment to the Federal courts, we have approved only 208. We have \napproved only over 95 percent, and that is a problem for the majority.\n  A majority will not long remain a majority if it does not understand \nthe requirement that all of us have to work together: to compromise, to \ntell the truth, and to do what is best for this country.\n  Mr. President, let me ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me go much longer. I am sorry, for 3 \nseconds let me thank my colleagues.\n  This is the time to be controlled on our side by consent, if I might \nread it into the record? My guess is it will go back and forth: Senator \nByrd, 20 minutes; Senator Reid, 15 minutes; Senator Salazar, 15 \nminutes; Senator Corzine, 10 minutes; Senator Obama, 10 minutes, \nSenator Lieberman, 10 minutes; Senator Leahy, 15 minutes; Senator \nDurbin, 1 hour, 10 minutes of that to go to Senator Murray; and Senator \nFeingold, 10 minutes.\n  Let me ask by consent to understand that is the progress on our side, \nunderstanding it would be interspersed with Republican speakers.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, let me ask the Senator, \nif I may, does the total of that amount of time exceed the amount under \nthe order that your side of the aisle has been granted, or is it less \nthan that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am told this is within the time that has \nbeen granted.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. While the Senator from North Dakota \nis here--he is one of the best speakers in the Senate. He can take a \nstory, tell it, and be clear about what he is saying. He has spoken \neloquently about the need for a compromise. I will suggest one to him. \nI suggested it 2 years ago when I came to the Senate and heard the \ndebate about Judge Estrada. I said at that time that, even if a \nDemocratic President were elected, that I would never vote to \nfilibuster his nomination. In other words, I would always vote to give \na President of the United States a fair up-or-down vote on the floor of \nthe Senate on his or her nominee.\n  I have repeated my pledge to do that on this floor several different \ntimes, and, I would say to my friend from North Dakota, if he would get \n8 or 10 Democrats to make the same pledge, there would not be any \nfilibuster. There would be no need for a rules change. We could talk \nabout gas prices, we could talk about schools, and we could talk about \nthe war in Iraq. So that spirit of compromise is there.\n  I was not here during whatever went on before, and, whatever it was, \nI wish it had not gone on. What I can remember, going back to 1967, \nwhich is when I came to this body as a legislative aide even before the \nPresident pro tempore was a Senator, is that all during that time this \ntactic was not used to deny a President an up-or-down vote on his \njudicial nominees. The only possible argument during that time was the \ncase of Abe Fortas in 1968, and that was a little different.\n  But put all that to the side, the ``who shot John'' or ``who didn't \nshoot John.'' If several on that side and several on this side would \nsimply say, as a way of avoiding this train wreck, that we would pledge \nright now, during our time here, always to vote to give a President an \nup-or-down vote on his or her judicial nominees, then there would be no \nneed for a rules change, and we could go on to our other business.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just observe, because the Senator mentioned me, my\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\npoint of supporting the 60-vote threshold is that is what requires \ncompromise. The very presence of the filibuster is what requires \ncompromise. Otherwise you do not have any incentive to compromise, be \nit the executive branch relative to the legislative branch. That was \nnot my point. It wasn't that we should find a way to allow the nuclear \noption to exist without changing the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend's point. May I \nmake my remarks now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill is \ngoing to come up. We are going to vote on it. I commend the chairman of \nthe committee for accomplishing what is a difficult job--getting a body \nthat operates by unanimous consent to agree on something and moving it \nthrough.\n  The purpose of the bill is to support the men and women who are \nfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. I was there about a month ago. There \nare so many Tennesseans in Kuwait and Afghanistan and Iraq that it \nseemed like a Tennessee homecoming. There are literally thousands \nthere--the postmasters of Winfield and Rob Camp. The President of the \nRotary Club in Lexington, a physician, just came home. The editor of \nthe newspaper in Dyersburg, two deputy sheriffs from my home county, \nthe superintendent of schools from Athens--these are people in the \nReserves or in the National Guard with mortgages and families and jobs, \nwith money and insurance issues at home. They are fighting for us. Some \nare dying, and they are risking their lives every day. Of course I want \nto vote to spend every penny we need to spend to support them and to \nkeep them safe.\n  Once we set forward on a mission, on a military mission, we should \nhave the stomach to see it all the way through to the end in a success \nstrategy, not an exit strategy, and to support the American men and \nwomen whom we ask to go.\n  That does not stop me from objecting and expressing my disappointment \nto two provisions in the bill. One is the so-called REAL ID Act. \nActually, unlike a lot of legislation we pass here, this is well named. \nThis really is a national identification card for the United States of \nAmerica for the first time in our history. We have never done this \nbefore, and we should not be doing it without a full debate. This REAL \nID provision turns 190 million driver's licenses, which are now \nineffective ID cards, into more effective national identification \ncards. To add insult to injury, we have also slapped State governments \nwith the bill for them.\n  I strongly object to this. When I was Governor of Tennessee, I vetoed \nour State ID card twice because I thought it was an infringement on \ncivil liberties. I thought that driver's licenses are for driving. If \nwe need an ID card, we should have an ID card. The legislature \noverruled me. I actually had to get one of those cards myself in order \nto get into the White House, so I lost that battle. So I am very \nreluctant for this country to have a national ID card. But I \nreluctantly concluded that, after 9/11, we have to have one and that we \nought to be thinking about what would be the best kind of ID card.\n\n  I believe the right way to consider that is when we are dealing with \ncomprehensive legislation on immigration, which I hope we do this year, \nand tackle that problem and the best way to do it. Is the best way to \ndo it to turn the driver's licenses examiners in all the States of the \ncountry issuing 190 million driver's licenses into CIA agents? I don't \nknow what it is like in Ohio or other States, but in Tennessee the \ndriver's licenses examiners by and large are there for the purpose of \nfiguring out whether you can parallel park and to take your picture. \nThey are not trained to tell whether you are an al-Qaida terrorist. \nThey are not trained in order to review four different documents and \nthen look at 10,000, maybe 20,000 different databases around the \ncountry.\n  I wonder whether it is even the right approach, in terms of having a \nnational ID card, to rely on driver's licenses. Maybe we should be \nrelying on passports. That has been an efficient system in this \ncountry. Or maybe even better, and I suspect this would be better, we \nshould turn the Social Security card--which is directly related to \nwork, which is the subject of the discussion and most of the concern \nabout immigration--into a more definite kind of identification.\n  But no; instead, without one single hearing in the Senate about a \nnational ID card--which we might not, under our Constitution, even be \nable to require to be presented to a law enforcement officer--we just \npass one, and then we send the bill to the States.\n  Here we are, a Republican Congress who got elected in 1994 promising \nto end unfunded mandates--and the Senator in the chair was one of the \nleaders in doing that--and what do we do, we come up with this big \nidea, pass it, hold a press conference, and send the bill to the \nGovernors. We do that time after time after time, and we should not be \ndoing that. That is not the way our system works.\n  It is possible that some Governor may look at this and say: Wait a \nminute, who are these people in Washington telling us what to do with \nour driver's licenses and making us pay for them, too? We will just use \nour own licenses for certifying drivers, and Congress can create its \nown ID card for people who want to fly and do other Federal things. And \nif Congress doesn't do that, then we will give out the home telephone \nnumbers of all the Congressmen and let the people--of California, say--\ncall everybody up here and say, ``why did you keep me off the airplane \nwhen I needed to get somewhere?''\n  That is what we have done. We have just assumed that every single \nState will want to ante up, turn its driver's licenses examiners into \nCIA agents, and pay hundreds of millions of dollars to do an almost \nimpossible task over the next 3 years.\n  We did that without any recognition in this legislation that we are \nnot the State government, we are the Federal Government, and, if we \nwant a national ID card, we should be creating a Federal ID card. If we \nwant the States to create one, we should talk to them about it, and \nthen we should pay for it.\n  So in the end, the States will pay the costs. In the end, the States \nwill listen to the complaints from citizens who are going to be \nstanding in long lines while they search for four kinds of \nidentification; the driver's license examiner tries to connect with \nthousands of databases, which they have no capacity to do today. The \nStates will take the blame when somebody uses a driver's license \ninappropriately.\n  The REAL ID Act has been structured in such a way that it is not \ntechnically an unfunded mandate, but anybody listening to this debate \nknows it violates the spirit of our promises in 1994 and 1995 not to do \nthis anymore.\n  So I intend to offer an amendment at the appropriate time that will \nhave two main points, but the overall point is to have the Federal \nGovernment pay for the cost of this new requirement that the States \nhave no choice but to accept. It will allow States to submit \ndocumentation to the Department of Homeland Security of what the costs \nare, and it will establish a process to pay the annual increase in \nthose costs.\n  I wish we had done this in a different way. I think we should have \nhonestly faced the fact that we now need some sort of national \nidentification card. I say that reluctantly because, as I said, I \nvetoed even a State card. But times have changed. But to do this \nwithout a hearing and without our tradition of respect for civil \nliberties and our respect for federalism, I think is wrong.\n  Mr. President, if I may take 2 more minutes, I would like to express \nmy disappointment with one other provision. This conference report says \nwe do not trust President Bush in dealing with the Palestinian \nTerritory. Here we are, a Republican Congress, at least by a majority, \nwith a Republican President who is leading a lot of the world to \nfreedom, who is just returning from a triumphant visit to Georgia--a \ngreat beacon--who has taken the courageous step of trying to help solve \nthe Middle East problems, and we are saying: Mr. President, we are \ngoing to appropriate money to help with the emerging democracy in the \nPalestinian Territory, but we do not trust you to spend the money.\n  That is what this provision does. The Senate did not vote that way. \nThe Senate voted another way. The Senate voted to give the President \nthe right to waive the authority, giving the President the right to \ndecide, in effect, who got the money.\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\n  The reason I think the provision makes so little sense is because we \nare going to turn around and say in a few weeks, as the Israelis pull \nout of the Gaza Strip, Who is responsible for security there? We are \ngoing to expect the Palestinian Authority to be responsible for \nsecurity there. Who is responsible for feeding some of the poorest \npeople in the world? We are going to expect the Palestinian Authority \nto be responsible for that.\n  If we are going to hold the Palestinian Authority responsible, the \nPresident might want to give them the money. Arafat is dead. There is a \nnew finance minister there who has impressed all of us on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  He was born in Palestine, lived here, and got his degree at the \nUniversity of Texas. He is doing things in a way that is open. He has \nearned the confidence of people all over the Middle East. He is taking \ncontrol of the money. And if he stopped doing that, the President could \nstop giving him the money.\n  But why in the world would the Congress show such a lack of respect \nto the President of the United States, in the middle of a peace \nprocess, by saying: ``No, Mr. President, we do not trust you to make a \ndecision about what to do with the money that we appropriate for the \nPalestinian Authority or to help the Palestinian Territory emerge as a \ndemocracy''?\n  So I am very disappointed by that as well. And there is other money \nthat has been authorized this year that does give the President that \nauthority. I hope in future conferences and in future debates and \ndiscussions we recognize that Arafat is dead, there is hopefully a \ndemocracy emerging, and there is a finance minister there who is making \npublic accounting of all the money. He is direct depositing money for \nthe troops. He is publicly advertising it through bids. He has \nimpressed his neighbors, and he has impressed all of us who have \nvisited with him on a bipartisan basis. I hope we keep that in mind as \nwe consider this issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Twenty minutes. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume within that 20-minute limitation.\n  I again thank Chairman Thad Cochran for his patience in the \nprocessing of this supplemental appropriations bill when it came before \nthe Senate. He was especially patient during the Senate consideration \nin seeing that all who wanted to offer amendments were afforded the \nopportunity to be heard.\n  The members of the Appropriations Committee have had a longstanding \nsense of cooperation, comity, and civility. There is always give and \ntake, live and let live, on both sides of the aisle. And that was the \nsame with regard to the Senate processing of this supplemental. \nEverybody did not get everything he or she wanted in this supplemental, \nbut Members were treated fairly in a bipartisan manner.\n  However, when it came to processing the supplemental in conference, \nseveral members were severely disappointed that the conference was \nrecessed subject to the call of the Chair. As a result, several \nSenators were precluded from offering their motions and their \namendments.\n  A number of Members on this side of the aisle have expressed \ndisappointment that the conference did not have any open debate on the \nimmigration provisions, including the REAL ID legislation, that found \ntheir way into the bill, and that neither the majority nor the minority \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee participated in the formulation \nof the REAL ID immigration provisions.\n  These REAL ID provisions were formulated behind closed doors by the \nHouse and Senate Republican leadership. After the conference had \nrecessed subject to the call of the Chair, a 55-page modified version \nof the REAL ID authorizing legislation was laid into the conference \nreport.\n  It was simply grafted onto the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill that provides funding for our military operations and our troops, \nwithout debate or participation by the conferees. I do not fault the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. This was not his doing. This \nwas done by the House and Senate Republican leadership.\n  The bill totals approximately $82 billion, which comes in at about $1 \nmillion below the request. Virtually the entire bill is designated as \nan emergency, thus increasing the deficit.\n  Department of Defense totals $75.9 billion, $0.9 billion above the \nrequest.\n  International assistance totals $4.1 billion, which is $1.5 billion \nbelow the request, but it grew in conference to levels $866 million \nmore than the House and $42 million more than the Senate.\n  Border security funding totals $450 million of new emergency \nspending. This compares to my conference motion to include $665 million \nfor border security. In order to increase the size of the border \nsecurity effort, staff identified $100 million of low priority homeland \nsecurity funds to use as offsets, bringing the total package to $550 \nmillion.\n  Despite having taken credit for improving security on our borders \nwhen he signed the Intelligence Reform Act in December, the President \nrequested no actual funding for border security. My initiative, with \nthe support of Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Judd Gregg and \nSenator Larry Craig, will result in 500 more Border Patrol agents, 218 \nnew immigration investigators and detention officers, 1,950 more \ndetention beds, 170 support personnel, and funds for training and \nhousing the new personnel.\n\n  Many of the President's requests for expanded flexibilities were \nsubstantially reduced in the Senate bill and sustained in conference.\n  The President's request for $5 billion transfer authority for Defense \nDepartment funds contained in the supplemental bill was reduced to $3 \nbillion.\n  In combination, under the conference report, the Secretary of Defense \nhas transfer authority in fiscal year 2005 of $10.7 billion, down from \na total of $14.7 billion requested.\n  The President's request for authority to spend contributions to the \nDefense Cooperation Account in fiscal year 2005, without subsequent \napproval by the Congress, was rejected as it should have been.\n  The President's request for a $200 million slush fund, entitled the \nGlobal War on Terrorism, GWOT, Fund, under the control of Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice, was rejected as it should have been.\n  The President's request for a $200 million ``Solidarity Fund'' for \nthe Secretary of State, under Peacekeeping Operations, to reimburse \ncoalition partners--such as, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Hungary, and \nBulgaria--for defense costs, was approved at a level of $230 million, \nof which $30 million can be used for GWOT-type activities. However, the \nact requires consultation and notification of the Congress prior to \nusing the money.\n  The conference report includes language that I authored prohibiting \nexecutive branch agencies from creating prepackaged news stories unless \nthe agency clearly identifies that the story was created and funded by \nan executive agency. It troubles me greatly that there has been a \nproliferation of executive branch agencies creating so-called news \nstories and then distributing them without identifying the story as \nhaving been produced with the taxpayer's money. We trust the media to \nprovide us with independent sources of information, not biased news \nstories produced by executive branch agencies, at whose expense, \ntaxpayer expense.\n  On February 17, 2005, the Government Accountability Office issued a \nlegal opinion to the executive agencies stating that such prepackaged \nnews stories violated the law. Regrettably, on March 11, 2005, the \nOffice of Management and Budget issued a memorandum to agency heads \nspecifically contradicting the opinion of the Government Accountability \nOffice.\n  This conference report ``confirms the opinion of the Government \nAccountability Office dated February 17, 2005.'' I am pleased that the \nconferees and now the Congress have agreed to this clear message that \ntaxpayer dollars should not be used to create prepackaged news stories \nunless the story includes a clear message that the story was created by \na Federal agency and paid for by taxpayer dollars.\n  I was also pleased that the conferees agreed to my sense of the \nSenate language on budgeting for the war in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\nThe conference report says that the President should submit a budget \namendment for fiscal year 2006 by September 1, 2005, and should include \nfunds in his fiscal year 2007 budget for the war when it is transmitted \nin February.\n  Congress has now appropriated over $210 billion. That is $210 for \nevery minute since Jesus Christ was born. Think of that. Congress has \nnow appropriated over $210 billion in four different emergency \nsupplementals for the war in Iraq. That is a lot of money, and it is \nyour money, $210 billion. It is your money, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, your \nmoney. Two hundred ten billion dollars for the war in Iraq, and there \nis no end in sight.\n  We should not continue to fund the war through ad hoc emergency \nsupplemental bills that are funneled through the Congress quickly when \nour troops are running out of funding.\n  The conference report also includes my proposed 3-month extension of \nthe Abandoned Mines Land Program. Last fall, I offered, and the \nCongress approved, a 9-month extension of the program in order to give \nthe authorizing committees time to act. Unfortunately, since last fall, \nthe authorizers have held no hearings and considered no bills on the \nmatter. So once again I urge the authorizing committees to approve this \nlegislation that is important to West Virginia and important to all \nother coal-producing States.\n  Finally, I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle. On the \nmajority side, I thank Keith Kennedy, Clayton Heil, Les Spivey, Sid \nAshworth, Paul Grove, Rebecca Davies, and all of the others. On my own \nside, the minority side, I thank that man from Notre Dame, our minority \nstaff director, Terry Sauvain. I thank his very able deputy, Charles \n``Chuck'' Kieffer. These are two the likes of which you will never see \nagain. I also thank Charlie Houy, Tim Rieser, B.G. Wright, Chad \nSchulken, and all of the others on the minority side who worked the \nlong hours--I mean long hours--to assist Senators in the production of \nthe final conference report.\n  Mr. President, there were some problems in conference, most notably \nthe recessing at the call of the Chair and not returning, which left \nsome of our members unable to offer motions. During the recess, 55 \npages of modified REAL ID immigration legislation were inserted into \nthe conference report, sight unseen, by the conferees. Now, can you \nimagine that? That would not have happened when I was chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. That would not have happened when I was \nmajority leader of the Senate. I will tell you, I don't blame our \nchairman or any committee members for this situation, but I do \nacknowledge that there were problems.\n  Nevertheless, the conference report provides the necessary funds for \nour troops in the field in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. I will \nalways support money for our troops, may God bless them. I support \nthem. We must support our troops, our men and women. They didn't ask to \ngo there. They are doing their duty. They are answering the call. I do \nnot support the policies that sent them there. I did not support it in \nthe beginning. I did not vote to authorize this President or any other \nPresident to use the military of this country as he might see fit. I \ndid not cast my vote there. I never, at any time, believed that Saddam \nHussein, for whom I did not carry any brief--or the country of Iraq \nposed a national security threat to our country. I said so then, I say \nit now, and I believe that. So I did not vote for the policies that \nsent them there and keep them there. There is no end in sight. It \nbleeds our country of money and blood. No, I don't support that policy, \nand I didn't support it when the President sent our men and women \nthere. But I do support the troops. I support them and will always \nsupport the troops of our country--may God bless them.\n  Nevertheless, the conference report, as I say, does provide the \nnecessary funds for our troops in the field in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere. I supported the war in Afghanistan because there was al-\nQaida. Al-Qaida attacked us. Al-Qaida invaded our country when it \ntoppled the Twin Towers, and struck the Pentagon, and drove a plane \ninto the ground in Pennsylvania. I supported that war. But there are \ntwo wars, the one in Afghanistan and the second war in Iraq--a country \nwhich did not invade our country, a country which did not strike our \ncountry, and a country which posed no security threat to our country.\n\n  But that is neither here nor there when it comes to our troops. That \nis something else. We will support our troops. I thank the Chairman for \nhis excellent work, for his cooperation and fine leadership in our \nCommittee, and for his support of the troops likewise. I urge the \nadoption of the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as Senators know, there is time for \ndebate of the conference report, for Senators to come over and speak, \nif they so choose, about the provisions of this bill and the effort we \nhave made to meet the challenge the President has laid before us, and \nthat is to produce a bill that provides funding for support for our \ntroops and other officials from the State Department and other agencies \nwho are engaged in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the global \nwar on terror. The majority of the money provided in this legislation \nis for those purposes.\n  I am pleased the committee was able to restrain the temptation that \nalways exists to add money that was over and above the request made by \nthe President. The fact of the matter is that this committee showed \ndiscipline and commitment to fiscal restraint. We brought a bill back \nin the initial stages of this process that was below the request made \nby the President and that was below the request provided in the House-\npassed bill.\n  Our Senate Appropriations Committee reported legislation providing \nfunding that was lower than either one of those documents. In \nconference with the House, we did resolve differences. There was give \nand take. Both sides had their opportunity to speak. We met on two \nseparate occasions with our Senate conferees, joining representatives \nfrom the House in a wide range of discussion. Nobody was cut off when \nthey wanted to discuss the issues or offer alternatives to provisions \nof the House-passed bill. The REAL ID provision that has come up, which \nsome have complained about, was not a product of the Senate's action. \nIt was put into the bill on the House side, but it was in conference. \nBecause that legislation contained immigration issues and the \nidentification issue, there were those in the Senate who offered \ngermane amendments on the broad, general subject of immigration policy, \nguest worker provisions, quotas, workers who could come from foreign \ncountries into the United States. The Senate will remember that we have \ndebated several amendments on those subjects. We approved some and we \nrejected some.\n  In conference with the House, a majority of the conferees of the \nSenate worked with a majority of the conferees in the House to get a \ncompromise conference report. That has been brought back to the House \nnow and passed by a substantially overwhelming margin, 368 to 40-\nsomething, as I recall.\n  The Senate is prepared to wind up debate in a matter of an hour or \ntwo, under the order that has been entered. I hope the Senate will give \nsupport to this conference report and overwhelmingly approve it. It \nreflects strict discipline in the appropriations process, but at the \nsame time it provides the funds needed for those who are engaged in the \nimportant operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to safeguard the security \nof our country and to promote democracy and help ensure a safer world. \nI am hopeful the Senate will approve the conference report.\n  I am prepared to yield the floor. Seeing no Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was curious when I put in the \nsuggestion that a quorum be present as to how time would be charged \nunder the time that is being used now under the quorum call.\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call is charged to the Senator who \nsuggests the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, since there are no Senators on either \nside present, I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally \nbetween both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe under the order the Senator from \nVermont has some time reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I will use part of it.\n  I am voting for the supplemental, but I have grave misgivings about \nthe President's policy in Iraq, the enormous strain it is putting on \nour Armed Forces, the horrific toll of the insurgency on innocent \nIraqis, but especially the lack of a credible exit strategy.\n  We tried to get legislative language considered that would link the \ntraining and equipping of Iraqi security forces to the phased \nwithdrawal of our troops. That made sense. As we train them and they \nare able to take over responsibility for security, we should withdraw \nour troops. The White House would not even consider this. I suspect had \nthe White House asked our troops in the field or the American people, \nthey would say that is what they want. It is also what most Iraqis \nwant.\n  I am voting for the supplemental because I am concerned about our \ntroops, many who were sent to fight and some of whom have died--as we \nunderstand from the press, even though we could not get this from the \nadministration--without the proper armor. I opposed their deployment to \nIraq, and I want to see them return home as quickly as possible, but in \nthe meantime, I want them to have the best protection and equipment. \nThey were sent into harm's way by the order of the Commander in Chief, \nand they should be protected as well as they can be.\n  There are other reasons I am voting for the supplemental, but I want \nto mention one in particular. There is a provision which I sponsored \nand Senators Boxer and Feinstein of California cosponsored which \ndesignates the program to assist innocent Iraqi victims of the military \noperations as the Marla Ruzicka Iraqi War Victims Fund.\n  This program, and one like it in Afghanistan, was inspired by Marla \nRuzicka of Lakeport, CA. She died on April 16, 2005, at the age of only \n28, from a car bomb in Baghdad. Marla's colleague and friend, Faiz Ali \nSalem, also died in that attack, both were on a mission of mercy.\n  I first met Marla 3 years ago. She worked closely with me and my \nstaff, especially Tim Rieser of my Appropriations Committee staff, from \nthe day after she arrived in Washington in 2002 until the day she died. \nIn fact, Tim received e-mails and photographs of her holding a child \nshe had helped that came in just hours before she was killed.\n  She was an extraordinarily courageous, determined young woman. She \nbrought hope and cheer to everyone she met, from our military to people \nwho were suffering from the ravages of the war. But she did it \nespecially for the families of Afghan and Iraqi civilians who were \nkilled or wounded as a result of the military operations. She felt \npassionately that part of being an American is to acknowledge those who \nhave suffered and help their families piece their lives back together.\n  Who would not agree with that? By showing them a compassionate face \nof America, she not only gave them hope, she helped overcome some of \nthe anger and resentment many felt toward our great country.\n  Over 90 percent of the casualties of World War I were soldiers. That \nchanged in World War II. And since then, it is overwhelmingly civilians \nwho suffer the casualties.\n  Rosters are kept of the fallen soldiers, as they should be, but no \nofficial record is kept or made public of the civilians who died. That \nis wrong. It denies those victims the dignity of being counted, the \nrespect of being honored, and it also prevents their families from \nreceiving the help they need.\n  In her young life, Marla forced us to face the consequences of our \nactions in ways that few others have. Even more importantly, she made \nus do something about it. She brought both parties in this Chamber \ntogether to help. What she did in Afghanistan and Iraq by the time she \nwas 28, the end of her short life, was an achievement of a lifetime, \nfar more than most people do in a much longer life.\n  This Saturday, from 2 to 4 in the afternoon, I am going to host a \ngathering in the Senate caucus room in the Russell Building so that \nanyone who is interested can learn more about Marla's work and the U.S. \nGovernment programs she inspired. I hope we can discuss ways for all of \nus to continue the campaign on behalf of innocent victims of conflict.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting \nnaming this program after her. I want the work she started to continue. \nI doubt that we will see another person quite so remarkable as Marla, \nbut I have to think there are a lot of other Americans who would want \nhelp if we give them the support they need.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Connecticut in the Chamber. I \nreserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I do so because it supports the men and women of \nthe American military, in my opinion the greatest fighting force in the \nhistory of the world. I say that, really having thought about it. It \nsupports them in their efforts to advance the cause of freedom and to \nprotect the security of every American by what they are doing to fight \nterrorism and terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I do want to note, however, my strong objections to House provisions \nknown as the REAL ID Act that have been included in the conference \nreport. The REAL ID Act will repeal ID security provisions enacted with \noverwhelming bipartisan support last year at the urging of the 9/11 \nCommission and place them with rigid and unworkable Federal mandates on \nState government for the issuance of driver's licenses, long \nexclusively a matter of State law.\n  The conference report from the House also includes punitive \nimmigration provisions we rejected last year and that have no place on \nan emergency spending bill. In my opinion, our Nation is safer if we \ncontinue to implement the protections we passed last December rather \nthan allow an ideological debate over immigration policy to derail \nthose initiatives so vital to the war against terrorism.\n  Notwithstanding my strong objections to the REAL ID components of the \nconference report, I strongly support the report and I do so based \nparticularly on a visit I was able to make last week to Iraq, the third \nI have been privileged to make in the last 10 months. I am back feeling \nwe are at a tipping point and it is moving in the right direction in \nIraq. It requires the sustained, strong, and visible American support \nthat is expressed in this supplemental appropriations.\n  There is no doubt that the recent spate of suicide bombings has \nriveted the media's attention and as a result the attention of the \nAmerican people, but I assure my colleagues those suicide bombings and \nthose suicide bombers are a small, though devastating, part of life in \nIraq today. They have got to be understood in context.\n  I come back from Iraq seeing it this way: There are more than 25 \nmillion people in Iraq. Eight million of them came out in the face of \nterrorist threats to vote for self-governance on January 30 of this \nyear. They have stood up a government which is impressive and \ninclusive. Their military is gaining strength and self-sufficiency \nevery day. There are 25 million on one side wanting to live a better, \nfreer life. On the other side are the insurgents, the terrorists, the \nenemy, variously estimated at 10,000 to 12,000, some would say less.\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\n  For as long as I can remember as a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee in briefings we have received and on previous trips \nto Iraq when I have asked who are these insurgents, every other time I \nhave been told most of them are former regime elements, leftovers from \nSaddam Hussein who want to go back into power and stop this new \ngovernment, particularly a government which represents the majority of \npeople in Iraq, Shi'a Muslims, to take power.\n  Then I was always told a minority is terrorists who are people \nassociated with Zarqawi and al-Qaida. This time it began to turn around \nand that is a very significant development.\n  I was informed that the number of former regime elements, the number \nof Iraqi Sunni Muslims involved in the insurgency, is dropping. In \nfact, some of them have begun to reach out to come over to the other \nside because they see the future tipping in another direction. However, \nthere is an increase in the movement into Iraq of foreign terrorists. \nSometimes they are people recruited over the Internet, recruited at \nreligious sites, coming into Iraq usually from Syria for as short as a \nday before they are strapped with bombs, sent in a vehicle aimed at a \ncrowd of Iraqis in a marketplace, sent to be in a line of Iraqis ready \nto enlist in the Iraqi military or in the police force, who then blow \nthemselves up.\n\n  What I am saying is there is a historic transformation going on in \nIraq that already has and, if it can continue to go with our support, \nwill resonate throughout the Arab world. I know that as the American \npeople every night see only the suicide bombings, they begin to lose \nhope about what is happening in Iraq. I appeal to the American people \nto understand that those bombings, as devastating as they are, are the \nresult of the fanatical work of a minority of people, the same people \nwho attacked us on September 11, 2001--same attitude, same mindset, \nsame hatred. If we diminish our support for our presence in Iraq today \nfor the Iraqis who want so desperately to find a better life and govern \nthemselves, we will have lost a moment of historic opportunity and we \nwill ultimately pay the price for it ourselves.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with the new leadership of Iraq, the \nnew President of Iraq, Jalal Talabani, a Kurdish leader for decades, \nwho many of us have met and come to know, a good man, a strong man. I \nsat with him and realized this is the duly elected successor to the \nbrutal, murdering dictator Saddam Hussein. It is a miracle, something \nthat neither he nor I, nor most of us, and particularly the Iraqi \npeople, could have imagined just a few years ago. President Talabani \ndeserves our support.\n  I met with the new Prime Minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari. I never met \nhim before. He is a good man. I found him to be thoughtful, strong, \nclear, very religious, very inclusive. Neither the Shi'a nor the Kurds \nwho suffered terribly under Saddam--and one might understand the human \ninstinct for revenge--have yielded to it. They have reached out to the \nSunnis. We have not seen it in the papers and on the TV, but they are \nreaching out to bring them into the Government to try to create a \nleadership by consensus that will assure a better future for the Iraqi \npeople.\n  I want to say a final word about the American military. As I said at \nthe outset, it is the finest in the world. It deserves our support. The \nelection, the negotiations with the Sunnis, the increasing capability \nof the Iraqi military, all bring Iraq to a tipping point in the right \ndirection. It is historic. The American military understands what is \ngoing on. I had the privilege, over the last 16 years, to visit many of \nour men and women in uniform around the world. I have never seen our \nmilitary more proud of what they are doing, with morale higher, more \nskillful, better equipped to carry out the mission than they are \ncarrying out. This bill helps them to do what we have asked them to do.\n\n  I want to say, finally, that we have to exploit this moment, this \ntipping point, and act aggressively with the Iraqi government to bring \nover more of the insurgents, thus isolating the foreign fighters, the \nterrorists, the al-Qaida/Zarqawi network people, and making it harder \nfor them to move freely and resupply themselves.\n  This has really now become quite explicitly a war against the \nterrorist movement that struck us on September 11, 2001. That, to me, \nmeans moving aggressively to close the border with Syria to stop the \nflow of terrorists, and further help bring stability to Iraq. Operation \nMatador, now in its third day in Iraq near the Syrian border, is the \nkind of sustained military effort we need. Our pride, our prayers, our \ngratitude go out to the Marines and others in the American military who \nhave advanced Operation Matador with such remarkable success.\n  Our engagement in Iraq is crucial. It is in the best bipartisan \ntraditions of American foreign policy that run from Woodrow Wilson to \nGeorge W. Bush, with a lot of good Democratic and Republican Presidents \nin between. This supplemental supports that policy. It advances the \ncause of freedom. It protects American security. It supports the \nAmerican men and women who are performing so valiantly and \nconstructively. I urge its adoption. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will cast my vote in support of \nthe conference report on the 2005 supplemental appropriations bill for \nIraq, Afghanistan, and tsunami relief. I do so despite my strong \nobjections to the administration's policy of continuing to fund our \nmilitary operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through emergency \nsupplemental bills. These needs should be addressed in the regular \nbudget request so that they can actually be paid for, not placed on the \ntab of the American people so that debt can pile up. But the fact \nremains that our troops on the ground need timely support, and I will \ncast my vote to see that they get it, and the victims of the horrifying \n2004 tsunami in South and Southeast Asia are provided with some \nmeaningful relief and assistance.\n  I am pleased that the conferees retained my amendment to make it \neasier for the families of injured servicemembers to travel to the \nbedsides of their loved ones. I am disappointed that a sunset provision \nwas added to this common-sense measure, and I will continue fighting to \nensure that the benefits to military families provided by my amendment \nbecome permanent.\n  My vote in support of this conference report also comes with serious \nreservations because it contains the extremely troublesome immigration \nand driver's license provisions of the REAL ID Act, which the House \npassed as an amendment to this bill.\n  I strongly support efforts to curb illegal immigration and to prevent \nterrorists from entering our country to do harm. But as we work to \nsecure our borders and protect our Nation from future terrorist \nattacks, we must also respect the need for refugees, foreign workers, \nfamily members, students, businesspeople, visitors, and others who wish \nto come to our Nation legally.\n\n  The REAL ID Act is a big step in the wrong direction. The new \nrestrictions on immigration in the REAL ID Act are not necessary to \nprotect national security. Rather, they will only serve to create \nserious and unjustified hardships for people fleeing persecution and \nfor other non-citizens.\n  Not only that, but the Senate has had no opportunity to consider the \nREAL ID Act. It is astounding that Congress would enact these \nsignificant immigration changes without the United States Senate ever \nhaving held a hearing on them, without the Judiciary Committee ever \nhaving considered them, and without Senators ever having taken a vote \nspecifically on those reforms or having had an opportunity to offer \namendments. Obviously these issues are too important to address them in \nsuch a truncated way. Congressional leaders have no business tacking \nthese very significant and controversial changes to immigration law \nonto an unrelated, must-pass appropriations bill. Clearly, this process \nwas used because these changes could not pass the Senate on their own \nmerit. They had to be added to legislation that contains vital funding \nfor our troops in Iraq.\n  What has happened to the legislative process? I know that some in the \nother body, and some in the Senate as well, have very strong feelings \nabout these immigration provisions. But strong feelings do not justify \nabusing the\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\npower of the majority and the legislative process in this way. I \nstrongly object to this tactic.\n  Let me explain a few of my concerns with the REAL ID Act. First, this \nconference report will make it even harder for those fleeing \npersecution to seek asylum in this country. These changes to asylum law \nare simply unnecessary. As any attorney who handles asylum cases can \ntell you, asylum cases are already extremely difficult to prove. In \nfact, only about 30 percent of asylum applications are granted today. \nThose seeking asylum in the United States already undergo the highest \nlevel of security checks of all foreign nationals who enter this \ncountry, and the provisions in this bill will result, I am sure, in the \nrejection of legitimate applications without making us any safer.\n  The asylum provisions of the REAL ID Act were improved somewhat in \nconference, and I greatly appreciate the work Senator Brownback did to \nmake changes to the House-passed version. But the changes do not go far \nenough to adequately protect asylum seekers. This bill will have real \neffects on real people--people who will be sent back to countries where \nthey or their families may be harmed or even killed because of their \npolitical or religious beliefs.\n  There are also provisions in this bill that would further restrict \njudicial review in immigration proceedings. This is not the time to \ndowngrade the judicial branch's longstanding role as a check on the \nabuse of executive branch power, particularly in light of some of the \nadministration's unprecedented actions since September 11, 2001. Non-\ncitizens have borne the burden of many of the administration's \negregious civil liberties violations that have occurred since September \n11. I believe that we can fight terrorism without compromising our \ncivil liberties. Making it harder for non-citizens to seek judicial \nreview in immigration proceedings is sending exactly the wrong message \nabout the need to respect the Constitution and basic human rights.\n  The REAL ID provisions in the conference report also have potentially \nserious environmental implications. One section of the conference \nreport allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive all laws that \nhe deems necessary to allow expeditious construction of barriers at the \nborder. Let me repeat that: The Secretary can waive any and all laws \nthat he wishes in order to construct these barriers. I guess that could \ninclude labor and safety laws, but certainly it means that \nenvironmental regulations can be waived, at the sole discretion of the \nSecretary.\n  I also want to address the driver's license title of the conference \nreport. This title of the REAL ID Act is particularly unfortunate \nbecause it repeals provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act, which we just passed a few months ago, and replaces \nthem with the unworkable mandates that Congress rejected when debating \nthe intelligence reform legislation. The intelligence reform bill \nrequired a negotiated rulemaking process to develop minimum \nidentification standards, a process that is already under way and has \nincluded State governments, the Departments of Homeland Security and \nTransportation, law enforcement, industry representatives, privacy \nadvocates, and immigration groups.\n  They all had a seat at the table under the intelligence reform bill. \nIn fact, they met for 3 full days just a few weeks ago. This process \nwould have, in all likelihood, resulted in sensible, realistic \nstandards for driver's licenses to improve security.\n  Instead, the REAL ID Act mandates a long list of expensive and \ninflexible requirements for the states, some of which could have \nserious unintended consequences.\n  Let me give you an example that demonstrates why we should not be \nrushing these provisions into law. A variety of States, either by law \nor policy, have address confidentiality programs that permit law \nenforcement officers, judges, or domestic violence victims to list \nsomething other than their home address on the face of their driver's \nlicense. They are required to provide their home address to the DMV, \nbut it is not actually printed on the license. This is an important \nsecurity measure to protect public officials and victims of violence \nfrom individuals who wish to do them harm.\n  The REAL ID Act would override these protections by mandating that a \nperson's home address be printed on the face of the driver's license \nitself. Had the Senate Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to review \nthis bill, I feel confident we could have addressed this issue in a \nmore nuanced way, and certainly the process now underway that this bill \nwill short-circuit would have taken into account the legitimate public \nsafety interest allowing some people to not list their actual \naddresses.\n  The intelligence reform bill struck the right balance by setting up a \nmechanism to help improve the security of State identification cards, \nwhile also ensuring that States and other interested parties would have \ninput into the process of determining minimum identification standards. \nI am very disappointed that the REAL ID Act is overriding this ongoing \nprocess with costly and unrealistic requirements that leave States with \nlittle discretion.\n  On top of all this, the REAL ID Act prohibits the issuance of State \ndriver's licenses to undocumented aliens. States should be the ones to \ndecide whether, in the interests of public safety, they wish to issue \ndriver's licenses to undocumented aliens. The reality is, there are \nmillions of undocumented workers in the Nation. States could reasonably \ndecide, just as Wisconsin has, that from a law enforcement and public \nsafety perspective it is better to ensure that these individuals have \nbeen tested on their driving skills, have obtained insurance, and are \nreadily identifiable, rather than to force them to drive illegally.\n  While I am extremely concerned about the effects these REAL ID \nprovisions are going to have on noncitizens and on already cash-\nstrapped State governments, I do want to note one bright stop in the \nimmigration landscape of this bill. That is the provision that \naddresses the shortage of H-2B visas for temporary, seasonal workers. \nThe cap for H-2B visas was reached just 3 months into the 2005 fiscal \nyear, in January, which meant that employers in Northern States, such \nas Wisconsin whose tourism, landscaping, and other seasonal industries \nget started later in the year, have been unable to hire workers using \nH-2B visas.\n  Senator Mikulski and Senator Gregg worked tirelessly to ensure that \nthis provision was enacted into law in time to help employers who need \nworkers this year, and I do commend them for their efforts. I have been \nproud to cosponsor their H-2B legislation, and I am very pleased this \nis about to become law. Unlike the REAL ID bill, this provision had \noverwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate and quick congressional \naction was definitely needed.\n  Mr. President, I will vote for this legislation because our Armed \nForces need the funds it provides, but I strongly object to the \ninclusion of the REAL ID Act in the conference report. Those who \nsupport these provisions have prevailed only because they were willing \nto upend the legislative process to achieve their ends. I certainly \nregret that, and I think many of us will come to regret that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss the \nconference report to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, \nwhich we hope to adopt later today.\n  First, I thank my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, for \nthe good work he has done. I plan to support adoption of this \nconference report. There are certainly a number of programs that will \nbenefit greatly from passage of this bill. It is the right thing to do.\n  I must say, though, there are a few areas, which I will discuss in a \nmoment, where I do not think we have gone quite far enough.\n  First, let's talk about the most important thing. Of course, that is \nthe money that will go to support our soldiers. That is really why we \nare here. That is the most important provision in the bill. Let me talk \nabout a couple of specific items that will aid our soldiers.\n  This bill includes Senator Craig's amendment, which I cosponsored, to \nprovide an immediate payment--it ranges from $25,000 to $100,000--to \nthose who have suffered traumatic injuries\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\non active duty, such as the loss of an arm or leg or the loss of their \nhearing or sight.\n  The bill also includes my second-degree amendment to Senator Craig's \namendment making this provision retroactive to October 7, 2001. This \nsecond-degree amendment I offered will ensure the coverage of soldiers \nwho have been injured in Iraq, injured in Afghanistan, those soldiers \nwho many of us have seen or talked to who are currently recuperating at \nWalter Reed, Bethesda, or other hospitals around our Nation, as well as \nthose who have left the hospital and are learning to live with their \ninjuries.\n  This amendment would help service members, such as Army SSG Justin \nShellhammer, whom I spoke to today on the phone. Justin Shellhammer is \na courageous young man, someone of whom we can all be very proud. I \ntalked to him on the phone this morning. He is excited he is going to \nget a leg this afternoon. He told me about how his recuperation has \nbeen coming along and what his prospects are. When you talk to someone \nlike him, your heart goes out to him. But, frankly, you feel great \nadmiration for him and how courageous he is.\n  I am also pleased this bill includes an additional $150 million for \nthe procurement of up-armored humvees. Many of us on the Senate floor \nand in the House have supported, for a long period of time, increases \nin funding for this program. It is an important program. There is a \ncritical need for these vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan and here in \nthe United States where they are used for training.\n  Quite simply, these vehicles have saved the lives of hundreds if not \nthousands of service men and women and enabled them to complete their \nmission.\n  Just a few moments ago, I talked about the fact that there are some \nitems that should have been included in the bill that are not. I am, \nfrankly, a little disappointed.\n  The conference report does not provide the death gratuity increase \nthat we provided to all Active-Duty deaths. This bill increases the \ndeath gratuity to $100,000--and that is a very good thing--to the \nfamilies of those who have died in service to our country. But the \nlanguage in the bill that came out of conference provides only for \ndeaths that occur in a combat zone or those that are ``combat-\nrelated.'' I think that is much too narrow. I think it is a shame. I \nthink it is too bad that is what the conference did.\n  If we do not apply the death gratuity increase to all Active-Duty \ndeaths--which is what we should have done--we will not be covering a \nnumber of individuals who die while carrying out their orders, who die \nin service to our country. Their families will not be covered. For \nexample, we will not cover the family of a service member who gets into \na fatal car accident carrying out very specific orders to deliver files \nfrom one side of his home base to another, in service to his country. \nHis family will not get that death benefit.\n  We also will not cover the death of a service member who gets into a \nfatal accident en route to a conference he or she was ordered to \nattend. And it will not even cover a military police officer guarding \nthe gates of one of our domestic bases who may fall from heat stroke. I \ndo not think that is right. I think that was a mistake the conference \nmade.\n  As I have done since the beginning of this Congress, I will continue, \nas I know others will, to work to expand the applicability of this \ncritical benefit.\n  I must say, I was also disappointed that we were unable to pass an \nextended TRICARE Prime medical benefit for children of decreased \nservice members. Under current law, the dependent child of a deceased \nservice member receives medical benefits under TRICARE Prime for 3 \nyears at no cost. But following that period, the dependent children may \ncontinue to receive TRICARE Prime, but they must pay for that benefit \nat the retiree dependent premium rate, available to children under the \nage of 21 or 23 if they are enrolled in school. Also, after 3 years, \nwhen a dependent child's military parent dies, and if that family \nelects to pay the premium and stay enrolled, even if they pay that \npremium, that child would move down on the food chain, so to speak, in \nterms of the availability of services and priority. I do not think that \nis right. I think we need to correct that.\n  What that means is that if there is a doctor's appointment opening, \nand your parent is alive, and your parent is continuing to serve, you \nget preference over a child whose parent was killed in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Now, do we really think that is right? I do not think so. \nI do not think there is any person on this floor or in the Senate who \nwould say that is right.\n  This is simply not fair. I don't think any Member of the Senate who \nreally understands this would say that is right. My amendment, which \nwas not included in this bill, would have changed that by putting \nsurviving children of service members killed in service in the same \nposition--no better but no worse--as if their parent would have lived \nand continued to serve in the military. It would have put them in no \nbetter position but, rather, in the same position, and they would \ncontinue to receive TRICARE Prime at no cost until they became an \nadult.\n  I wish to let my colleagues know that I plan to continue this debate \nand to try to get this in the Defense authorization bill. This is a \nmatter of simple fairness. It is the right thing to do. So this \ndiscussion will continue this week and in the weeks ahead.\n  Let me turn to another topic that this bill addresses, and that is \nhumanitarian assistance. I believe we did a pretty good job in this \nbill--again, I congratulate the chairman--as many essential priorities \nwere funded. Because of what the chairman did and what others did, many \npeople will be fed, many people will be helped maybe not at the level I \nwould have liked in some cases, but we did a pretty good job.\n  One country that certainly needs assistance in this supplemental is \nHaiti. Haiti is embarking on a road to attempt to move toward \ndemocracy. They have had a very troubled past, a troubled present. Its \ncurrent history is troubled. They are facing elections this year.\n  I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Bingaman, Chairman McConnell, \nand all the conferees who supported my efforts to include emergency \nmoney for Haiti. Haiti needs election assistance and security. This \nbill provides $20 million for election assistance this year, for police \ntraining and for public works programs. All this money is urgently \nneeded. I will be working closely with the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development to ensure this money flows quickly into \nHaiti.\n  Another troubled spot in this world is Darfur. Again, I congratulate \nthe chairman for his work. Senator Corzine offered an amendment. \nSenator Corzine has been a true champion in this area. I congratulate \nhim. He offered an amendment, of which I was the lead cosponsor, \nregarding Darfur. I thank him for his efforts and commitment to helping \nend the crisis in the region. The final conference report provides $50 \nmillion to support the African Union to stop the genocide in Darfur. \nAgain, I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy for their good work \nin this area as well.\n  The conference report also provides an additional $90 million for \ninternational disaster and family assistance to help ensure \nhumanitarian aid flows to Darfur and other African crises. We are \nlooking at genocide in Darfur. We are staring it down, and we cannot \nafford to blink. It is only right that this bill contains funding for \nthis crisis.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Kohl for his efforts to help increase our \nU.S. food aid. I worked with Senator Kohl. I was his lead cosponsor on \nhis amendment, which the Senate passed, to include $470 million in food \naid to cover known worldwide aid shortages. Again, I thank Senator \nCochran for his good work in this area.\n  The conference report, unfortunately, contains only $240 million. \nThis money will help, but it is not at the level the Senate had \nprovided. This is not enough to cover existing shortfalls, much less \nnew emergencies or worsening conditions in places such as Ethiopia. \nLast year, 300,000 children in Ethiopia died of malnutrition. This \nyear, the situation is worse, with drought destroying crops in large \nparts of the country. The people of Ethiopia will avoid the starvation \nthat is on the horizon only if we act. That means remaining open to the \npossibility of\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\nusing the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust and other tools in our food \naid arsenal. We must understand that it is not only Ethiopia where we \nhave a crisis; we have crises all over the world with regard to food \naid. We simply do not have enough food.\n  I am proud to be joining Senator Kohl in sending a letter to the \nPresident asking him to look at the Bill Emerson Trust as we enter the \nsummer season that so often results in food shortages, not just in \nEthiopia but around the world. I again commend Senator Kohl for his \ncommitment to end hunger around the world.\n  There are good parts to the conference report we are passing today. \nIt provides immediate and necessary help that our soldiers need to do \ntheir job. It provides our injured service men and women with care that \nthey desperately need. It provides money for Haiti and Darfur, other \nAfrican crises. However, frankly, we could have done more. Legislation, \nthough, is never perfect. We simply need to continue to work together \nto address issues that are not fixed in this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that under the \nprevious order, I will be recognized for up to 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, of which 10 minutes will be \nyielded to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the supplemental \nappropriations bill we are considering which funds our military \nactivities in Iraq and Afghanistan. Overall, I support this bill. We do \nneed to get the money out to our troops. But I am here today because I \nhave several concerns about what it leaves out and how it was put \ntogether.\n  I have to say I am particularly troubled that I and other Senators \nwere denied a promised opportunity to debate and vote on some very \ncontroversial immigration changes that have been attached to this bill.\n  First, let me say, I know how important the funding is to our troops \noverseas. In March, I traveled with the Senator from Illinois and \nseveral others on a bipartisan trip to Iraq and met with troops from \nthe State of Washington. To a person, each of them was a dedicated \nprofessional who was putting duty above their personal well-being. They \nneed our support, and they deserve every resource our grateful Nation \ncan provide.\n  As I have said before, I am the daughter of a disabled World War II \nveteran. I represent hundreds of thousands of Washington State veterans \nand military families. I support every dollar in this aid bill to help \nour troops protect themselves and complete successfully the dangerous \nmission we have assigned them. But I am concerned that when all of \nthese new veterans come home and need medical care, they are going to \nbe pushed into a VA system that does not have medical staff, \nfacilities, or the funding needed to care for them. That is exactly why \nI was on the Senate floor fighting to include within the supplemental \nthe critical cost of war, and that is taking care of our Nation's \nveterans.\n  I am disappointed that Republicans in the Senate have decided that \nfunding for veterans care is not an emergency and not a priority. By \ndenying that there is a crisis at the VA, they are simply ignoring our \nresponsibility to fully provide for the men and women who are risking \ntheir lives for our freedom. Our veterans, our military, and our future \nrecruits deserve better. Taking care of our veterans is part of the \ncost of having a great military. It is a real disservice that we have \nnot taken care of that funding within this bill.\n  I am here today because I am also very troubled by how far-reaching \nand unrelated immigration rules got attached to this bill without a \nvote and without an opportunity to debate. The REAL ID provision has \nramifications for privacy, for States rights, and for immigration \npolicy. I am disappointed that it has been rammed through as an \nattachment to a desperately needed bill that funds our troops. Frankly, \na lot of us are kind of scratching our heads about how this REAL ID \nprovision ended up in this conference report. I know I didn't vote for \nit. I know there wasn't even a discussion of it in conference, but \nsomehow it is included in a must-pass bill.\n  Mr. President, I served on the conference committee, and I want to \nshare with my colleagues exactly what happened in that conference \ncommittee so they will understand why the sudden appearance of the REAL \nID provision is so surprising to many of us.\n  When the conference committee met, the chairman gave assurances to \nthe minority that we would be able to vote on several provisions when \nthe conference met again. But that conference never met again, leaving \nno opportunity for the minority party to vote, much less to strike \nthese provisions.\n  I want to share with the Senate the specifics. In our second meeting \nof the conference committee, Senator Durbin, who is now on the Senate \nfloor, asked Chairman Cochran for his assurance that we would get a \nchance to vote on these immigration changes, and other open items as \nwell, before the supplemental was sent to the floor.\n  In fact, I want to read a portion of the transcript of that meeting. \nThis discussion took place on Thursday, April 28.\n  Senator Durbin said:\n\n       I would also like to say to my colleagues, if this bill \n     contains--as I believe it does--the REAL ID Act, I would like \n     a vote on that so that we can be on the record on an issue \n     that has never been brought before committee in the Senate.\n       My question to you is this, Mr. Chairman: There have been \n     times when conference committees of this magnitude have \n     recessed and never been heard from again. The next thing we \n     find is a conference committee report on the floor on a take \n     it or leave it basis.\n       Can we have your assurance that we will return for votes on \n     amendments such as those we have debated today and those that \n     I have mentioned?\n\n  Senator Cochran's response to Senator Durbin:\n\n       Senator, I would be glad to make the assurance that if \n     there is work to be done, if there are open items to be \n     considered, that we can consider those in conference. I am \n     not prepared to make a commitment as to when that will be. I \n     don't want to lead you to believe that I am going to \n     surreptitiously or in secret reach an agreement on the other \n     side without consulting all the conferees on the Senate side.\n       I think everyone in this conference has a right to \n     participate in this discussion and I wouldn't want to cut off \n     anybody's right to participate.\n\n  Mr. President, I have worked closely with Senator Cochran for many \nyears, and I do know him to be a man of his word. But to me, what that \nexchange meant, sitting there in that conference, was that we would \nhave an opportunity to vote on the REAL ID provision, but that never \nhappened. To me, that was wrong.\n  The REAL ID provision will have dramatic and far-reaching changes and \nputs an unfunded mandate on many States. Yet it was never brought \nbefore a Senate committee, and it was never voted on in the conference.\n  That is exactly why I did not sign the final conference report, which \nis very unusual for me. I did not sign it because I believe the process \nwas flawed and we were denied an opportunity to debate and discuss \nthese immigration changes before they were brought to the floor as part \nof a must-pass bill.\n  Mr. President, we are all very concerned about security, but this \nreceived very little debate. Before Congress mandates these kinds of \nchanges, we should have a more informed debate. In fact, it begs the \nquestion, why was this added to a must-pass bill without a debate? \nProbably because it could not withstand a rigorous and open public \ndebate. We should have that, and I am disappointed that the majority \ndenied us that opportunity.\n  I also want to note today the irony that the Senate is about to allow \na technical fix to immigration-related language that was included in \nthe supplemental, which I agree needs to be fixed; but the Democrats in \nthe conference committee were not provided any opportunity to fix any \nother immigration provision.\n  I want to reiterate my frustration with how the REAL ID Act was \nincluded and that we were not given the same consideration regarding \nthat language.\n  Mr. President, the REAL ID provision has some unique impacts for my\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\nhome State. This section on immigration is particularly troubling to me \nbecause Washington State has proactively enacted several laws to \nprotect the privacy of Washington State residents.\n  While I understand the needs for increased security, I don't think \nWashington State laws should be completely overridden by this \nprovision, especially without ever having had the chance for debate and \ndiscussion on it.\n  We know this bill is going to pass. Our troops need the funding it \nincludes. I am already working with communities and officials across \nWashington State to help find a way to implement these new \nrequirements. I will continue, once this is passed, to push the \nadministration to now provide the funding necessary to make these \nchanges without piling new burdens onto our already cash-strapped \nState.\n\n  Mr. President, it is really unfortunate that at a time when we should \nbe focusing on the needs of our troops and our veterans, the majority \nparty is using the supplemental aid bill as a vehicle to legislate on \nsubjects that have not received the debate and attention they deserve. \nBut at the end of the day, we know we cannot afford to fail in our \nmissions abroad. With hundreds of thousands of troops sacrificing every \nday in Iraq and Afghanistan, I will support this supplemental bill, and \nI will continue to work to fight for their care as they return home.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding me time and allowing \nme to express my frustration on how this part of the bill was put in \nwithout anybody able to discuss it in conference committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her statement with \nwhich I agree. This is called an emergency supplemental. It is the \nnature of an emergency supplemental that it funds things that were \nunanticipated, such as natural disasters and military operations that \nwe didn't anticipate. That is the nature of an emergency supplemental. \nYet, when you look at it, at the real nature of this bill, there is no \nemergency or unexpected element here. This is funding the third year of \na war in Iraq.\n  Did we expect to be gone from Iraq by this time? I don't think \nanybody suggested that. Yet the administration continues to bring the \nfunding of our troops into the Congress on an emergency basis. Why \nwould they do that? Why would they not put it through the ordinary \nappropriations process? There are two good reasons. First, it isn't \nadded to the national debt each year. The President can say, when he \npresents his budget, that we are close to being in balance. In fact, we \nare not even close. We have the largest deficit in the history of the \nUnited States of America under the Bush administration. You have to add \nthis to it. This is a real cost to the American taxpayers, to our \nGovernment. But by putting it in separately, it is a little sleight of \nhand, so that you don't add the $81 billion to the actual cost.\n  Secondly, if this went through the ordinary appropriations process, \nthere would be hearings and questions would be raised--questions I \nwould like to raise after I visited Iraq with the Senator from \nWashington. Why, in a third year of the war, are we still trying to \nfind armor plating for humvees and trucks to protect our troops? Why, \nin the third year of the war, after giving every dollar the \nadministration asked for, don't we have protective body armor for all \nof our soldiers? Why, in the third year of the war, don't we have the \nmost modern helmets and firearms that our troops need to be safe, to \nperform their mission and come home?\n  Hard questions. I might also like to ask a few questions about some \nof the major contractors who are being paid for this war. Millions, if \nnot billions, of dollars are going to companies on no-bid contracts. \nYou know the names. Halliburton leads the list. I will tell you this. \nIt is considered entirely inappropriate in Congress to raise the \nquestion about whether Halliburton has been paid too much or \nimproperly. You just don't ask those questions around here. Those are \nthings which Congress has no business asking about, according to the \nRepublican majority. Those are questions that would be asked if this \nappropriations bid went through the regular process.\n  Instead, it comes to us as an emergency. We don't have time to talk \nabout it or to ask any questions. They say: Come on now, the troops are \nat risk. Let's pass the bill and get it over with.\n  That is what we face every year. The majority knows that even those \nof us who voted against the use of force resolution for the invasion of \nIraq have said we are going to vote for the money for the troops. If it \nwere my son or daughter, my brother, or someone in my family whose life \nis at risk in Iraq, whether I agree with the way we went into the war \nis irrelevant. I am going to give those soldiers, marines, and our \nother Armed Forces every penny they need to perform their mission and \ncome home safely. We can debate the policy and whether we are going to \nmake the mistake we made in Vietnam, where our policy debate turned \ninto a debate at the expense of our troops. And so the administration \nand the Republican majority take advantage of it. They pushed this bill \nthrough on a take-it-or-leave-it emergency basis, and they say do not \nask any hard questions. We do not want to talk about armor for humvees. \nWe do not want to talk about Halliburton. Take it or leave it.\n\n  That is sad. Yet in their hurry to bring this bill to the floor, they \nload it up with things that are not related to the war in Iraq. We \nheard what the Senator from Washington said. There is a major change in \nthe law in this bill about the issuance of driver's licenses in the \nUnited States of America. Why in the world is that in this bill, the \nemergency bill for the troops? I think she has made it clear.\n  Let me give a little background. If we were fair, we would not call \nthis the emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year \nending September 30; we would call this the Larry Lindsey memorial \nbill. Why? Because Larry Lindsey happened to be the Budget Director \nunder President Bush who made a big mistake. When we invaded Iraq, Mr. \nLindsey predicted the war would cost somewhere between $100 billion and \n$200 billion. Mr. Lindsey was dismissed from his job as a result of \nsuggesting the war might cost that much money.\n  And remember Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz? They asked him: \nHow will we pay for the war in Iraq? He assured us in open testimony \nthat Iraqi oil money would pay for the reconstruction, and at one \nremarkable Senate hearing, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld even \npredicted Iraqi tourism dollars would help finance the new Iraq.\n  Fast forward to today. With the Senate's passage this week of this \nbill, American taxpayers would have committed nearly $300 billion for \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are still waiting for that tourism \nmoney, we are still waiting for that Iraqi oil money, and Mr. Lindsey \nis now in civilian life for suggesting the war might cost a third of \nwhat it has actually cost.\n  That is the reality, and there is no end in sight. We are not going \nto delay passage of this bill; there is too much at stake. Mr. \nPresident, 150,000 American soldiers rely on our prompt action on this \nbill, and it will pass here today, as it should.\n  Let me speak about some elements of this bill I think should be part \nof the record. Democrats are going to support this bill not only \nbecause it helps the troops, because it does fund some true \nemergencies. There is $900 million in emergency relief for the victims \nof the South Asia tsunami, one of the greatest natural disasters in \nmodern memory, and $400 million for humanitarian assistance in the \nDarfur region of Sudan. If this genocide in Darfur is not an emergency, \nwhat is? Unfortunately, what is missing from Darfur accountability \npassed by the Senate is seeking justice and security for the victims of \nthis campaign of murder, rape, and destruction.\n  I am also going to vote for this bill because it does include a \nprovision which I added on the Senate floor reaffirming America's \ncommitment to not engage in torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman, \nor degrading treatment of prisoners of war or other detainees. I \nbelieve reaffirming this longstanding American commitment to this \nfundamental standard of international law and decency will help restore \nour credibility and our moral\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\nstanding in a world which questions what happened at Abu Ghraib and \nGuantanamo. As many military experts have told us, it will also reduce \nthe chance that American military personnel, when captured, would be \ntortured.\n  The bill contains $5.7 billion to train Iraqi troops. Six or 7 weeks \nago when I was in Baghdad, they showed us a handful, a dozen of these \ntroops who were in an exercise. I am not a military expert. I do not \nknow if they were real soldiers. I do not know if they were really \ntrained, but thank goodness there is some effort underway to try to \nreplace American soldiers with Iraqi soldiers.\n  It also contains crucial requirements that progress and training be \nmonitored and measured, language Senator Kennedy, Senator Levin, \nSenator Byrd, and I worked hard to preserve. It is not enough for high-\nranking administration officials to assure us that 130,000 Iraqi troops \nhave been trained when only a small fraction are actually ready to \nfight, or when tens of thousands of U.S.-trained Iraqi police officers \nhave gone AWOL. We cannot find them. Knowing how many Iraqi troops are \nready to defend the nation will give us a better idea of when we can \nbring our troops home, and the sooner the better.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for working with us on the \ntroop training and torture amendments, some of the reasons I will vote \nfor this bill.\n  The final conference report does include other issues that trouble me \nwhen it comes to our troops. I have been trying for almost 3 years to \nmake certain that Federal Government employees who are members of the \nGuard and Reserve and who are activated to serve overseas do not find \nthemselves facing extraordinary financial hardships. In the Pentagon, \nwe go to businesses across America and say: If you want to be a \npatriotic business, if you want to show your love of America, show your \nlove for the men in the Guard and Reserve, and the women as well, and \nif they are activated, help their families; cover them with health \ninsurance, if you can; make up the difference in pay, if you can. And \nmany of them have stepped forward and said: We are going to do it. In \nfact, almost 1,000 different corporations and units of government--\nState and local--have said we are going to stand behind those Guard and \nReserve families. They are making enough of a sacrifice, they are \nputting their lives on the line, and we will stand behind the families \nwho stay home so that soldier, worried about his life, does not have \nto worry about the mortgage payment. We even have a Web site sponsored \nby our Federal Government saluting these great companies for standing \nbehind our Guard and Reserve, as we should.\n\n  But let me let you in on a secret. There is one major employer in \nAmerica that refuses to stand behind the Guard and Reserve. There is \none major employer that employs 10 percent of the Guard and Reserve in \nAmerica, 1 out of 10, that refuses to make up the difference in pay. \nWho could that employer be? It is the U.S. Government.\n  The Federal Government refuses to make up the difference in pay for \nthese soldiers and marines in our country. How can we possibly explain \nthat? We are praising companies and other governments that stand behind \ntheir people while we fail to do the same.\n  So on three different occasions, I offered an amendment on the floor, \nand it was adopted, which said we will stand behind the Guard and \nReserve. We will make up the difference in pay, just as other companies \ndo. Take a look at the companies that have done their patriotic duty. \nThey are big names: Sears and Roebuck, out of my State of Illinois, \nIBM, General Motors, United Parcel Service, Ford, 24 State governments. \nBut not the U.S. Federal Government. And, Mr. President, do you know \nwhat the problem is? Every time we pass it on the floor, so many \nMembers race up here to vote for it, saying: Oh, we are all for the men \nand women in uniform; God bless them; give me a flag to wave; we are \nall with them. And then as soon as it gets in conference committee, \nthey strip it. Year after year they take out this protection for \nFederal employees who are literally risking their lives today in the \nGuard and Reserve.\n  According to a recent survey made by the Defense Department, 51 \npercent of the Guard and Reserve members suffer a loss of income during \nlong periods of active duty. Three-quarters of Guard and Reserve \nmembers surveyed cited income as one of the major reasons they were \nleaving the service. We know recruiting is down, retention is under \npressure, and yet we refuse to make up the difference in pay for 1 of \nevery 10 Guard and Reserve.\n  Today, 17,000 Federal employees are activated. To date, 36,000 have \nbeen activated and deactivated. So large numbers of men and women are \naffected by this amendment. And in the darkness of the conference, \nafter the doors are closed, when the press has left, when nobody is \nwatching, they take out this protection for Federal employees.\n  The lead sponsors of this provision are going to continue the effort \nwith me. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, and Senator George \nAllen, a Republican from Virginia, have joined me. Our measure is \nendorsed by the Reserve Officers Association, the Enlisted Association \nof the National Guard, and the National Guard Association of the United \nStates.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and the Budget Committee staff \nstudied our plan. They agree it would not add $1 to the budget because \nthe cost of the affected workers' salaries is already included in the \nbudget.\n  The last time the conferees met, I asked the chairman, Senator \nCochran, for his assurance that the Republicans would not do what they \nhave done in the past and kill this amendment without giving us a \nchance for an up-or-down vote in front of God and the world. I was \ngiven that assurance, but sadly it did not happen.\n  The conference committee recessed and disappeared and, unfortunately, \nwe never had a chance to have an open vote on whether we would stand \nbehind these Guard and Reserve members. That is unfortunate. I had \nhoped the assurance by the chairman would mean we would get that vote. \nIt did not happen.\n  It appears the White House overrode anyone's intent to bring this \nmeasure up for consideration. Josh Bolton, the Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, released a letter saying the White House \nopposed our reservist pay amendment because it would ``increase costs \nand have a negative impact on morale and unit cohesion.''\n  Think about that. The argument is that the soldiers under fire \nworrying from day to day whether they will be alive would compare pay \nstubs and have a general conversation about how much money are you \ngetting from your employer, how much are you receiving, as if they \nwould care. Those units go into battle together to protect their lives. \nI do not think they resented that one soldier in that unit had help \nbecause he happened to be an employee of Sears, another soldier because \nhe happened to be an employee of one of the 23 State and local \ngovernments. They are not going to hold that against their fellow \nsoldiers. That is going to undermine morale? They have to say: You are \nlucky; I happen to work for the Federal Government, and I get no help. \nI come here and risk my life, and this amendment is defeated in the \ndarkness of a conference committee every single year.\n  That argument is just nonsense.\n  What message are we sending to conscientious employers? \nUnfortunately, the wrong message: Do as we say, not as we do. Listen to \nthe Federal Government, listen to the Members of Congress with all \ntheir patriotic speeches, and then watch as we deep-six this provision \nyear after year. It is an unfortunate message to some of the best men \nand women in America who risk their lives for our freedom.\n  We also wanted to push for more veterans health services. Senator \nMurray of Washington offered a $2 billion amendment, and she said if \nthe war is an emergency, treatment of the veterans of the war should be \nan emergency. We know that is true. We know these veterans come home \nwith real needs.\n  I had hearings across my State on posttraumatic stress disorder. I \nhave been around this business for a long time. I have never, ever \nwitnessed what I did then. We had men and women coming in who had \nserved in Iraq and returned, young men and women who risked their lives \nwearing the uniform of America. They are home now, but\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nthe war is still on their mind. For many of them, it is a destructive \nmemory, things they saw and things they did which they cannot get out \nof their minds. They come back and finally realize they need a helping \nhand. They are estranged from their families. Their spouses are saying: \nThat is not the same soldier who I sent over there. What happened to \nhim?\n  They find themselves despondent, angry, unable to cope with ordinary \nlife, turning on members of their family in anger, and they need help. \nSadly, too many of them need help they cannot find at the veterans \nhospitals. So if we promise these men and women when they serve our \ncountry that we will stand behind them, should not the Veterans' \nAdministration, the hospitals and clinics, be ready to stand behind \nthem, when they come home, for their injuries, for this posttraumatic \nstress disorder? Is it too much to ask that we have family therapists \nwho will work with spouses and children who have seen a different \nfather or a different mother come home? I believe it is only \nreasonable.\n  Senator Murray led the way. She asked for $2 billion to be put in as \nan emergency for veterans hospitals and clinics. It was turned down on \nthe Senate floor.\n  I am glad that the death gratuity is increased. Twelve thousand \ndollars for your life in service of your country? I am glad we have \nraised that to $100,000 tax free for spouses and children of those who \ndie in service. It also increases from $250,000 to $400,000 the life \ninsurance benefits that are available. There is one catch. In the \nSenate, we voted to increase these benefits for the families of all \nActive-Duty service members, but behind the closed doors of this \nconference committee which met in private and in secret, the \nRepublicans changed the rules. They decided on their own, without a \nvote, without a discussion, to restrict the new death benefits and the \nnew life insurance benefits only to families of service members who die \nin a combat zone. That simple geographical distinction, ``in a combat \nzone,'' could disqualify about half of all families who have lost a \nloved one serving on active duty since the start of the war in \nAfghanistan. These families will not be eligible for the new benefits \nbecause the husbands and fathers, wives and mothers died outside of \nwhat is technically classified a combat zone. That is arbitrary, that \nis wrong, it is unfair. Whether a soldier dies in Iraq or training to \ngo to Iraq, his sacrifice is equally great, the loss to his family \nequally devastating, and our Government owes an equal debt to his wife \nand children.\n  We have had testimony from those uniformed officials who appear \nbefore the Armed Services Committee and we ask them about this. Admiral \nJohn Nathman, Vice Chief of Naval Operations for the Navy, said: ``They \ncan't make that distinction. I don't think we should, either,'' in \nterms of who is dying in a combat zone and who is not.\n  General T. Michael Moseley, Air Force Vice Chief, said:\n\n       I believe a death is a death, and I believe this should be \n     treated that way. . . .\n\n  Sadly, these people were not listened to and, unfortunately, this \nbill does not provide the protection which our soldiers truly need and \ndeserve.\n  Senator DeWine and I, on a bipartisan basis, are lead sponsors of a \nbill to change that benefit and to make it fair. I certainly hope we \ncan.\n  This bill also shortchanges our first front-line troops at home, the \nfirst responders. All across America, police, fire departments, and EMT \nsquads are stretched thin. Many lack equipment. Many of them are not \ngetting the HAZMAT and other specialized training they need. This bill \ndoes not contain one dollar, not one dime for first responders.\n  We have so few Border Patrol agents that vigilante groups such as the \narmed Minutemen have decided to take it upon themselves to patrol the \nborders of the United States. Yet this bill contains funds to hire only \n500 new Border Patrol agents--not enough to do the job. New York City \nhas 40,000 police officers. We have 10,000 border agents to secure the \nentire U.S.-Canadian and U.S.-Mexican borders, even with the new agents \nin this bill. The Republicans have argued we can afford to give a \n$35,000 tax break to a person who is earning over $1 million a year, \nbut we cannot afford to hire 500 Border Patrol agents. Their priorities \nspeak for themselves. Homeland security is not a job for armed \nvolunteers; it is a job for professionals, and it ought to be a \npriority for this Congress.\n\n  Now let me speak for a moment to this REAL ID bill. This is a serious \nproblem. If one is going to use a driver's license to prove their \nidentity, wherever it may be--stopped by a highway patrolman or getting \non an airplane--we need to make sure that driver's license is \nauthentic.\n  We have 50 States with different standards for establishing one's \nidentity. It is a serious problem, serious enough that when the 9/11 \nCommission report came out and we put together a bipartisan bill to \nrespond to it, we included a provision in that bill that required the \nFederal Government and State governments to work together to come up \nwith realistic, operable standards to prove identity for those who were \napplying for driver's licenses. We passed that bill overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis. I was happy to be one of the cosponsors of that \nlegislation and glad that the President signed it. Then Members of the \nHouse said: We do not agree with that cooperative process. We want to \nestablish the standards on our own. We want to write them into law. And \nthey created something called the REAL ID Act.\n  We did not have public hearings on the REAL ID Act. We did not invite \nin the Governors. We did not invite the State motor vehicle agencies. \nWe did not have a conversation about an honest and realistic way to \napproach it. We were given this on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n  The American people deserve to know what they can look forward to \nunder this REAL ID Act, which is part of this emergency supplemental. \nSome say that it is just simply going to keep illegal immigrants from \nobtaining driver's licenses. If that were the case, it would be a much \ndifferent and much smaller bill.\n  Under this law, to get a driver's license in any State in America, \none will need to present several pieces of identification. One has to \nprovide a photo ID document or a non-photo document containing both the \nindividual's full legal name and date of birth; and documentation of \nthe individual's date of birth, Social Security number or the \nindividual's non-eligibility for a Social Security number, and the name \nand address of the individual's principal residence.\n  Now there is a catch to this. One has to come into that driver's \nlicense station with that proof. What is it going to be? Well, they at \nleast need a birth certificate, that is for sure, or something like it. \nThey are also going to need some proof of their Social Security number. \nThey are also going to need some proof of their residence. Now when \nthey bring those documents in for their driver's license, the State \nemployee whom they face, who is issuing the driver's license, cannot \njust accept them at face value; they have to take the documents and \nverify them with the agency that issued them. Until they verify them, a \nperson cannot receive a driver's license.\n  Imagine if one is a naturalized American citizen who was born in the \nformer Yugoslavia. You present your birth certificate to the clerk at \nthe Department of Motor Vehicles. There are two big problems.\n  How is that clerk in Springfield, IL, at secretary of state Jesse \nWhite's motor vehicle facility, going to verify the authenticity of \ndocuments issued by a government that no longer exists? Good question. \nI do not know the answer.\n  There is another problem. The REAL ID Act says that the State cannot \naccept any foreign document other than an official passport. So, even \nif the clerk could verify the birth certificate, he cannot accept it.\n  Imagine you are the person behind the counter.\n  What are you going to do? With whom do you check? Whom do you call? \nAnd what do you do about the people standing in line waiting for their \nturn to put more documents on the desk?\n  If you think a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles is a bad \nexperience today, wait until the REAL ID takes effect. This is not \nnecessarily going to make America any safer. It will make States \npoorer. The estimates are it will cost States about $500 million to \n$700 million, another unfunded mandate,\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\nand in return for this massive cost and inconvenience we will get, at \nbest, marginal increases in security.\n  The States have 3 years to put this in place and, incidentally, if we \nfind States that don't have it in place in 3 years, an interesting \nthing happens. No one's driver's license from a State that hasn't been \ncertified to be in compliance can be used for Federal identification. \nAnd if it turns out the State of Illinois, at the end of 3 years, still \ndoes not have this together, what is going to happen? It means myself, \nas a resident from Illinois, presenting a driver's license at the \nairport, will be turned away. Illinois licenses are not accepted. That \nis what this bill says--without 1 minute of hearing in the Senate, \nwithout 1 minute of debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  This is an unworkable and unfunded mandate.\n  In a conference committee, I said to the chairman: I think we need a \nvote on this. I think members ought to be asked to stand up and explain \nwhy they are going to support this without any hearing, without any \ndeliberation. I want to debate it, and I would like to have an official \nvote so we know where the Members of the Senate and the House stand on \nthis proposal.\n  I believed that I had an assurance that I would receive it, but I \ndidn't. Ultimately, the committee recessed. No votes were taken. It \ncomes to us now as part of this funding for the troops on a take-it-or-\nleave-it basis. That is not a good way to legislate.\n  Let me also say I think this REAL ID is going to create hardships \nthat are totally unnecessary. We can ascertain the identity, and we \nshould, of the people applying for driver's licenses. But the way this \nwas written is sadly not going to achieve that in the most efficient \nway. The REAL ID Act is another provision on which I wanted a vote, \nwanted a discussion, and wanted an open debate. Unfortunately, it did \nnot occur.\n  Many Democrats, despite this provision, will still support this bill \nbecause we have said from the start we are going to stand behind our \ntroops. I think the administration, the Republican leadership in \nCongress, is testing us. How many things can they load into this bill \nto force us to vote for something we are troubled with, and that is \nwhat it is all about. We all know this is not the way to pay for a war \nand it is not the way for Congress to operate. The late Larry Lindsey--\nI say ``late'' because he is no longer in public service--was fired for \nsaying the war might cost $200 billion. Now we are up to $300 billion \nand counting. Sadly, too many of the important decisions on funding \nthis war are still being made by one party behind closed doors.\n  We will pass this bill, Democrats will support it, but this has to be \nthe end of it. We need to fix this broken process. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois not only \nfor the time but also for his eloquent statement about this \nlegislation, and particularly the REAL ID bill.\n  The emergency supplemental bill we are considering today provides \nneeded funding for our men and women in uniform who are engaged in \ncombat operations in Afghanistan and in Iraq, as well as emergency \nassistance to the victims of the tsunami. This aid and assistance \ncannot wait because it is a demonstration of our Nation's good will \ntowards those who have been devastated by natural disaster, and also \nour commitment to our soldiers in combat. These noble goals are \nunfortunately tainted, however, by the decision of the Republican \nleadership to include a controversial piece of legislation known as the \nREAL ID Act.\n  Senator Durbin has gone into great detail to show how unwieldy it is \nand perhaps how unnecessary it is. There are other ways to more \neffectively and efficiently verify the identity of individuals.\n  Also, this kind of back-door legislating is symptomatic of the \nmajority's near total disregard for the precedents and procedures of \nthe Senate that have served our Nation so well and for so long. I hope \nthe American people realize this maneuver is yet another example of the \nmajority's desire to pass the most controversial legislation by sliding \nit into a bill which cannot be amended and is subject only to an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  With no Senate debate, and very little review, the REAL ID Act makes \nsignificant and harmful changes to our Nation's immigration system, as \nwell as our system of licensure of automobiles and drivers throughout \nthe United States.\n  Like many, I believe immigration is an issue we cannot and should not \nignore. However, the REAL ID Act is not the comprehensive immigration \nreform that we have gone far too long without. Instead, it \nvastly alters our Nation's established asylum procedures, placing the \nburden of proof on the applicants by requiring them to document their \ntorture or persecution. Potential asylum seekers are already thoroughly \ninvestigated, and those suspected of engaging in terrorist activities \nare already prohibited from being granted asylum under our current \nsystem. Yet the REAL ID Act will make it increasingly difficult for \nthose escaping political persecution and torture to seek refuge.\n\n  In addition, the REAL ID Act would suspend habeas corpus review of \norders of removal for aliens in the United States. Essentially, this \nchange eliminates the right of aliens facing deportation to ask the \ncourt to review their deportation, a right which the Supreme Court has \nalready upheld. This provision will deny innocently detained aliens the \nopportunity to plead their case before a judge. This goes against the \ncore principle upon which our Nation was founded.\n  It is unfortunate these unsound provisions will be enacted as part of \nthis bill. It is my hope that in the very near future we will be able \nto have a national discussion on immigration in a comprehensive, \nthoughtful, and deliberate way that will provide real solutions to real \nproblems. It is not possible to solve our immigration problems by \nsimply removing those who seek legitimate help from our Nation, or by \nraising the bar for those who are immigrating here legally. As a nation \nof immigrants and a global leader on human rights, the inclusion of the \nREAL ID Act in this bill and in this manner is unacceptable, and I will \nwork with like-minded colleagues to reverse this law.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent the time under the quorum be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the fiscal year \n2005 emergency supplemental appropriations bill. Every day in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces risk their \nlives to defend ours. They are completing a mission they did not ask \nfor and, in Iraq, a mission that is longer and more dangerous than they \nwere ever told. Yet amid roadside explosions, insurgent attacks, and \nthe loss of some of their closest friends, they wake up each day and do \ntheir jobs. They wake up each day and do whatever it takes to leave a \ndemocratic Iraq for a free Iraqi people.\n  This bill is a way for us to support these efforts. With its passage, \nI sincerely hope our troops will receive all the support and all the \nequipment they need to do their job. With its passage, I hope we do not \nhear any more stories about troops driving convoys with unarmored \nhumvees, or about troops going into battle with armor their parents had \nto send them from home for their birthday. And I sincerely hope this \nmoney will be used to train more Iraqis to secure their own country so \nwe can bring home our young people safe and secure.\n  I particularly thank the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee for working with me on several other emergency \nspending needs.\n  I say to Senator Cochran, I appreciate that this bill provides $25 \nmillion for the prevention of the avian flu. As\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nsome of you may have read, the number of cases in Southeast Asia is \nincreasing, and there is serious concern that this virus could mutate \nand jump from continent to continent, potentially causing a pandemic \nthat could kill millions of people. We have to work proactively to \nprevent such a pandemic, and I appreciate the support from the \ncommittee chairman as well as the administration on this issue.\n  Also included in the bill is an amendment I sponsored with my friend \nfrom South Carolina, Senator Graham. This amendment will ensure that \nour injured service members who remain under medical care but are no \nlonger hospitalized will not have to pay for their meals while \nreceiving therapy. I thank the graciousness of Senator Cochran for \nadopting that amendment on the floor without debate.\n\n  I also joined with Senator Durbin to address the security needs of \nour judiciary. As some of my colleagues know, a Federal judge in \nIllinois recently suffered a tragic loss, the murder of her mother and \nher husband. This bill provides necessary funding for the U.S. Marshal \nService to step up its security for our Federal judges.\n  I commend all those who have been involved, including the chairman, \nfor crafting a number of important measures in this bill. I wish that I \ncould, without any further statement, simply say how proud I am of our \ntroops and move on with the supplemental. Unfortunately, this bill also \nincludes some immigration provisions, known as REAL ID, that cause me \nenormous concern. Although I will certainly vote for the conference \nreport because of the good measures I have already discussed, it is \nimportant to state for the record my serious reservations about REAL \nID.\n  Despite the fact that almost all of these immigration provisions are \ncontroversial, the Senate did not conduct a full hearing or debate on \nany one of them. While they may do very little to increase homeland \nsecurity, they come at a heavy price for struggling State budgets and \nour values as a compassionate country. The driver's license provisions \nin REAL ID, for example, will cost an estimated $100 million over 5 \nyears. States will have to bear the majority of these costs. At a time \nwhen budgets are tight, I don't think we should be outsourcing our \nhomeland security to States that can't afford it.\n  The cost to our Nation's legacy as a refuge for asylum seekers is \nalso heavy. Conferees were able to improve some aspects of REAL ID, \nincluding increasing the limit on the number of foreigners who can \napply for asylum in the United States, but other provisions intended to \neliminate fraudulent asylum applications may end up denying asylum to \npeople who deserve to receive it.\n  These are costs that call for greater examination. As a sovereign \ncountry, we have the right to control and identify those who enter and \nexit. I have worked with my colleagues to support hundreds of millions \nof dollars for more Border Patrol agents to help exercise that right. \nBut controlling immigration is a Federal responsibility--it always has \nbeen--and it should not come at the expense of State budgets or basic \ncivil liberties. We should have more time to examine and debate the \nREAL ID provisions as part of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  These provisions, currently in the bill, are opposed by religious \norganizations, civil liberties groups, civil rights organizations, \nchurch groups, and hundreds of other groups. The legitimate concerns of \nthese groups have not been properly aired in the Senate. I am aware of \nthe fact that the REAL ID Act, despite what I say, despite my \nreservations, will become law. It will become law not because it is the \nright thing to do but because the House majority has abused its \nprivilege to attach this unexamined bill to must-pass legislation. This \nis highly inappropriate, and I hope that all of the Senate will agree \nto highlight and correct the deficiencies of these immigration \nprovisions in the year to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support our troops and their families. \nI am behind them 100 percent. They deserve our gratitude, not just with \nwords, but with deeds. This emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nhelps us do just that.\n  The House and Senate have worked hard to respond to the President's \nrequest for additional funding to support our operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We have provided more than $75 million in defense-related \nspending, including vital support to our soldiers and their families. \nWe have also provided more than $6 billion in assistance to our friends \nand allies, including $681 million to aid in the recovery from last \nyear's terrible tsunami in Indonesia.\n  We have provided a total of $17.4 billion to speed up the Army's \npurchase of trucks, additional up-armored humvees, and upgrades to \nAbrams tanks. There is also $1 billion for additional purchases of Army \nand Marine Corps trucks, tactical vehicles like humvees, night vision \nand other important protective equipment to keep our soldiers as safe \nas possible on the battlefield. We have also preserved support for the \nC130J aircraft, so vital to transporting troops and materiel around the \nworld.\n  U.S. troops will stay in Iraq and Afghanistan long enough to ensure \nthat those nations can defend themselves against chaos and terrorism. \nIt is important that we provide training and equipment to prepare Iraqi \nand Afghan security forces to take over when American troops come home.\n  To do this, we have provided $7.0 billion to train security forces in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. There is also $1.78 billion for Afghan \nreconstruction and counter-narcotics efforts. In addition to providing \n$7.7 million to support U.S. diplomatic and reconstruction efforts in \nIraq, we have provided $20 million in assistance to Iraqi families who \nhave been affected by coalition operations in Iraq.\n  We must do everything we can to care for soldiers when they are \ninjured. I am very proud that we have provided an additional $211 \nmillion for the Defense Health program.\n  This funding also includes assistance to provide meal and telephone \nservices for soldiers recuperating from injuries suffered in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. It also provides assistance for family members to travel \nto be with an injured service member recovering from combat injuries. \nTo help soldiers with the enormous medical costs that can be associated \nwith combat injuries, we have also made it possible for service members \nto get traumatic-injury protection as part of their military insurance \npackage. This insurance rider can be worth as much as $100,000 to \nservice members enrolled in the Servicemembers Group Life Insurance, \nSGLI, program. We have also made it available retroactively, to help \nout those soldiers and families already dealing with combat and combat-\nrelated injuries.\n  Mr. President, more than 1,700 service men and women have made the \nultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. Part of the debt of \ngratitude we owe the families they leave behind is to ensure that they \ndo not have to face a financial crisis while they are dealing with the \nloss of a loved one.\n  I am very proud that we have been able to help alleviate their \nburden, by increasing from $12,000 to $100,000 the fallen heroes \ncompensation for family members of troops who make the ultimate \nsacrifice for our country. This benefit is applied retroactively, to \ninclude all service members who have died since the global war on \nterror began in October 2001. In addition, the family of a service \nmember who has died will be allowed to remain in military housing for a \nyear, rather than the six months currently allowed. We have also \nincreased the life insurance benefit provided under the SGLI, from \n$250,000 to $400,000. This increase will also be applied retroactively \nto 2001.\n  I am disappointed that the conferees did not accept the advice of the \nSenate--and of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff GEN Richard \nMyers--and provide the fallen heroes compensation to families of all \nservice members who die on active duty.\n  Instead, Congress has expanded all aspects of the current coverage to \ninclude those who die in designated combat zones and in combat-related \nactivities, such as training. This is a good start, but I agree with \nGeneral Myers that every family who loses a loved one on active duty \ndeserves the gratitude of this nation and should benefit from the \nfallen heroes fund.\n  We also need to make sure that families receive the full amount of \nthis compensation. Working closely with Senator Grassley, I have taken \nsteps\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\nto ensure that the full benefit will be tax free. Senator Grassley has \nassured me that this important correction will be added to the next tax \nbill considered in the Senate.\n  We know that nearly 40 percent of the soldiers deployed today in Iraq \nand Afghanistan are citizen soldiers who come from the National Guard \nand Reserves. More than half of these will suffer a loss of income when \nthey are mobilized, because their military pay is less than the pay \nfrom their civilian job. Many patriotic employers and state governments \neliminate this pay gap by continuing to pay them the difference between \ntheir civilian and military pay.\n  I am very disappointed that this conference report does not include \nthe Reservist Pay Security Act, which would ensure that the U.S. \ngovernment also makes up for this pay gap for Federal employees who are \nactivated in the Guard and Reserves. This legislation has passed the \nSenate three times, and three times it has been stripped out of the \nconference report. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the \nHouse and Senate to build support for this important provision to help \nour National Guard and Reserves.\n\n  Mr. President, Americans joined the world in mourning the loss of \nmore than 150,000 victims of the Indian Ocean Tsunami last Christmas. \nTogether, we prayed for the 7 million displaced survivors that God may \ngive them the strength to persevere and overcome this, the largest \nnatural disaster of our time.\n  But expressions of sympathy are not enough. As I said at the time of \nthis terrible disaster, the United States must set the example and lead \nthe world in the humanitarian effort of recovery and rebuilding. \nCongress has provided $656 million for the tsunami recovery and \nreconstruction fund to support on-going and long-term relief efforts, \nincluding programs aimed specifically at women and children in the \naffected areas. We have also provided $25 million for U.S. tsunami \nwarning programs to help prevent future human disasters on the scale we \nhave seen in Asia.\n  The people of Darfur continue to suffer the terrible effects of war \nin the Sudan. Congress has provided $248 million for humanitarian \nassistance to Darfur and $37 million for Sudan peace implementation \nassistance. We have also included $50 million to be made available to \nthe African Union, for peacekeeping efforts in Darfur. Also, part of \nthe $90 million provided for food aid and famine relief can be used to \nhelp improve conditions in Darfur.\n  Because it is just as important to support our communities at home as \nit is to support our troops in the field, I will continue to fight for \nresponsible military budgets. For that reason, I joined the Senate's \nefforts to insist that the President fund our operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan through the regular budget and appropriations process. \nAfter three years in Afghanistan and two years in Iraq, we should not \nbe funding these operations as if they were surprise emergencies.\n  Unfortunately, because much of the funding included in this \nconference report has been designated as an ``emergency,'' it will not \ncount against our budget limits and instead just gets added to our \never-growing national debt.\n  This emergency supplemental is a Federal investment in supporting our \ntroops and their families.\n  We support out troops by getting them the best equipment and the best \nprotection we can provide. We support them by getting them the best \nhealth care available when they are injured in service to our Nation. \nAnd we support them by ensuring that their families do not face a \nfinancial crisis at the moment when they are grieving the loss of a \nsoldier who has sacrificed everything for our country.\n  I am proud to vote yes for our troops and their families. I am also \nproud to vote yes because this bill contains important provisions to \nhelp small and seasonal businesses in the United States.\n  The emergency supplemental contains language that provides real \nrelief to small businesses that need temporary seasonal workers by the \nsummer. This emergency supplemental contains the language I offered on \nthe floor of the Senate to temporarily solve the H2B visa shortage. It \npassed this body by a overwhelming bipartisan vote of 96-4 and was \nadopted by both House and Senate conferees to be part of the final \nbill.\n  I know that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle supported this \namendment because it is a limited fix to the H2B worker shortage that \nmany coastal states and resort states are facing. This solution is \ndesperately and immediately needed by small and seasonal businesses \nthroughout the country.\n  My amendment helps us keep American jobs, keep American companies \nopen, and yet retain control of our borders\n  I am very proud that we were able to work together, House and Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to pass this measure. This bill was a simply \nfix, it was temporary and it does not get in the way of comprehensive \nreform\n  The amendment and the Save our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act on \nwhich it is modeled will help small business by doing three things:\n  No. 1, temporarily exempting good actor workers from the H2B cap, so \nemployers apply for and name employees who have already been in U.S.;\n  No. 2, protecting against fraud in the H2B program; and\n  No. 3, providing a fair and balanced allocation system for H2B visas.\n  This amendment first and foremost protects American jobs.\n  It provides a short-term fix to the H2B visa cap which will only be \nin place through fiscal year 2006. It has four simple provisions:\n  One, it exempts returning seasonal workers from the cap for this year \nand next. That means that people who have worked here before and who \nhave gone back home are the only ones who would be eligible. The \nexemption works this way--an employer requests a visa and lists the \nname of the returning worker on his petition. The employer must provide \nsupporting documentation to the Department of Homeland Security or the \nState Department that the worker is a returning worker who has come to \nthe United States in one of the 3 prior years under the H2B program.\n  This exemption does not exempt any new workers because employers must \nshow that the worker was in the US previously in order for that worker \nto be exempt from the cap. Employers can petition for exempted workers \nat any time during the fiscal year--regardless of whether the cap on H-\n2B visas has been met or not. The legislation explicitly states that \nexempted workers are outside the cap.\n  The employer does not automatically get the exempted worker, they \nstill must go through the whole DOL and DHS process before they can get \nexempted workers. That means that employers still must prove to the \nDepartment of Labor that they cannot find American workers to fill \nthese jobs. Only then will DOL give them the ability to continue the \napplication process and get the workers who they need through DHS and \nState. Employers will go through the whole process for new or returning \nworkers. Returning workers will be exempt from but new workers will be \nsubject to the cap.\n  This provision is both forward looking and retroactive back to the \nbeginning of the fiscal year, or October 2004. That means that DHS will \nhave to determine how many returning workers were admitted prior to the \npassage of this Act and open up those spaces to new workers. That makes \nit fair so that summer employers have the same bite at the apple that \nwinter employers had. DHS estimates that between 30,000 and 35,000 \nworkers are returning workers and they will be able to use the \ninformation they have in their databases and in coordination with the \nDepartment of State to ensure that spots that were counted in the cap \nand used by exempted workers will now be opened up for new workers to \nuse so that summer employers can get their fair share.\n  This fix also has strong antifraud provisions to make sure that \neveryone is playing by the rules and that no one is misusing the \nprogram. And it gives DHS added teeth to prevent fraud and enforce our \nNation's immigration laws. A $150 antifraud fee ensures that Government \nagencies processing the H-2B visas will get added resources to detect \nand prevent fraud. This money is added to an antifruad fund to give the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Department of State and the \nDepartment of Labor some added resources to train workers so that they \ncan identify fraud in the program.\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\n  We also add strong new sanctions to the law. These sanctions are \npermanent and further strengthen DHS's enforcement power by allowing \nsanctions against those who have a significant misrepresentation of \nfacts on a petition. We increase fines and allow DHS to bar violating \nemployers from the H-2B program for up to 5 years. This section also \nsends a strong message to employers--don't play games with U.S. jobs. \nOur bill reserves the highest penalties for employer actions which harm \nU.S. workers.\n  We also make the system better by creating a fair allocation of \nvisas. Under current law summer employers lose out because winter \nemployers get all the visas. So our bill does two things: First, as I \nsaid above, we exempt returning workers from the cap, so returning \nworkers don't count for the cap. But we also divide the cap between \nsummer and winter. What that means is that of the 66,000 visas and we \nmake 33,000 available from October thru March and 33,000 available from \nApril thru September. Winter employers get half and summer employers \nget half. And we make this change permanent to make sure that even if \ncomprehensive reform cannot be reached by 2006, then at least summer \nand winter employers are competing for the limited number of visas on a \nlevel playing field.\n  Finally, we give the Department of Homeland Security the ability to \nimplement this law now, without having to issue regulations. That means \nthat employers get real relief now. DHS has a limited exemption from \nthe Administrative Procedure Act to implement the exemption section, \nthe antifraud fees and also the allocation of visas section. These \nexemptions are to prevent any barriers or delay to the immediate \nimplementation of those provisions.\n  So that is what this strong bipartisan legislation is all about. This \nis the language that 94 Senators in this body supported and that the \nHouse adopted into the emergency supplemental conference report.\n  Now we want to make sure that DHS can start its implementation \nimmediately so I want to make sure that they are very clear about what \nthe congressional intent of this legislation is:\n  Section 402 is intended to increase the number of H-2B admissions \navailable for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. This legislation was drafted \nwith the understanding that the preexisting USCIS method of \nimplementing the H-2B limitation is based upon accepting for filing the \nnumber of petitions (only some of which name the specific workers) that \nis projected to result in the authorized number of admissions, with \nallowance made for an expected number of petitions that will be denied \nor revoked and of workers with approved petitions who will not apply \nfor or qualify for visas or admission, based upon State Department \ninformation.\n  Consistent with this general methodology, and with the fact that \nUSCIS has already received sufficient petitions for fiscal year 2005 to \nfill the cap and has not required any information to be provided as to \nwhether the petitions were filed for ``returning workers'', it is \nintended that USCIS to make its best estimate as to the number of \npreviously filed petitions that likely were for returning workers, \nbased on State Department information, and accordingly to free up \nnumbers for fiscal year 2005 to be available to otherwise qualified H-\n2B aliens, whether or not they are ``returning workers.''\n  In addition, H-2B workers will be available to petitioners \nidentifying and certifying specific aliens to be returning workers. For \nfiscal year 2006, the number of new H-2B admissions available will be \n66,000, plus any aliens for whom the certification and confirmation \nrequirements of section 214(g)(9)(A), (B), and (C) of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, as amended by this section, are met.\n  Specifically, Section 405 provides that the 66,000 limitation on H-2B \nadmissions for fiscal year 2006 and thereafter will be administered as \ntwo half-year limitations of 33,000 each applicable to aliens subject \nto the overall 66,000 limitation, i.e, not including ``returning \nworkers.'' It is the intention of the supporters of the amendment that \nthis provision be administered so as to give employers seeking workers \nfor the second half of the year an opportunity to obtain them at least \nequivalent to that available to first semester employers.\n  Finally, section 407, is intended to allow this law to be implemented \nexpeditiously. The intent was to make sure that the provisions of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and other \nlaws relating to regulatory processes and forms--especially, but not \nlimited to, any requirement to promulgate new rules--to the extent any \nsuch provisions might apply, should not pose a barrier in any way to \nthe expeditious implementation of the provisions of this Act intended \nto give urgent and necessary relief to summer and seasonal employers \nand to apply the new fee provision in section 403. We therefore, \nprovide the authority to the relevant departments to waive any such \nrequirement that may otherwise delay such implementation.\n  It is a quick and simple legislative remedy with strong bi-partisan \nsupport. It fixes the problem now and takes small steps to prevent this \ndrastic shortage in the future. It is immediate and achievable because \nDHS will start implementation once it is signed by the President. And \nmore importantly, it does not exacerbate our immigration problems.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we continue to support the brave \nmen and women who put their lives on the line both at home and abroad. \nBut today, as I support funding for our troops I also stand opposed to \nthe part of the emergency supplemental known as REAL ID.\n  This controversial and overly-broad provision has no place in an \nemergency spending bill. The changes to our immigration laws and the \npolicies on asylum proposed by this legislation are major modifications \nthat are contentious on both sides of the aisle. As it is written, this \nbill undermines both due process and the principles of fundamental \nfairness on which our immigration laws are based.\n  This legislation, plain and simple, is a drastic and unknown change. \nIt is the type of change that both the House and the Senate should have \ndeliberated on and given in-depth consideration to. The Senate has not \nhad the opportunity to do that.\n  Just look at what this legislation does:\n  First, it increases the burdens on those seeking asylum in the United \nStates and limits judicial review of some decisions. These are people \nwho are often persecuted in their own countries and cannot produce the \nlevel of documentation or corroboration of their abuse that this bill \nrequires.\n  Next, it permits the Department of Homeland Security to waive ``all \nlegal requirements'' that interfere with the construction of roads or \nbarriers along our borders. That means that the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity can waive any State or Federal environmental, health and \nsafety, civil rights, labor, or criminal law. And there is very limited \nability of anyone to challenge these decisions. That means the \nSecretary has a tremendous amount of discretion to override existing \nlaws and step all over State's rights.\n  It also limits judicial review of removal cases and discretionary \ndecisions of agencies--that means an agency, not a judge, will have the \nfinal say.\n  And most notably, it creates national standards for identification \ncards that States must enforce. That means that States now must not \nonly verify the many forms of identification that are required, but \nthey are also responsible for keeping track of a drivers license \nholder's immigration status. That creates a huge increase in expenses \nfor States and it also means that State officials, who have no \nbackground in immigration law, will be forced to enforce these \ncomplicated provisions. That's an unfunded mandate on States that are \nalready in fiscal crisis.\n  Plain and simple REAL ID drastically changes immigration laws, limits \naccess to the courts and due process, and places significant new costs \nand duties on local and State governments. The Senate should have had \nthe ability to review, debate, and amend this provision before it \nbecame a permanent part of our Federal immigration law.\n  Now, I am the first to agree that we need strong and comprehensive \nimmigration reform. We need to look at all the problems with protecting \nour borders and ensuring our safety. We need to make sure that the \nprograms that work are updated and continued. We\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\nneed to make sure that the programs that don't work are fixed so that \nwe do not have porous borders. But we need to use regular order to do \nso.\n  The Senate must have the opportunity to consider comprehensive \nreform, not focus on piecemeal measures. And President Bush should lead \nthe way in working with Congress and our allies for solutions that \nprotect our borders. And for solutions that allow our rich history and \ntradition of immigration to continue. But these supposed solutions \ncannot come at the expense of our constitutional framework.\n  REAL ID is an unfunded mandate that is punitive. We do not know if \nany of the provisions will actually make us safer--we just know that \nthey override States rights and undermine civil rights and civil \nliberties. I believe that it is our duty, as Members of the Senate, to \nbalance national security interests with due process and constitutional \nrights, yet because we have not had hearings or been able to evaluate \nthis change to our immigration law we do not know the extent of its \nimpact.\n  REAL ID proposes several different and significant changes to our \nimmigration laws, I believe that it is important for the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to have an opportunity to hold hearings and \nconsider comprehensive legislation that looks at all areas of the law. \nThen the whole Senate should have the ability to fully debate the issue \non the Senate floor.\n  I am disappointed that this controversial measure was added to this \nmust pass legislation. We should be passing an emergency supplemental \nbill without the harmful REAL ID provision. And then we should turn our \nattention to real reform and the Senate should proceed to a thoughtful \nand comprehensive debate on immigration reform that protects our \nborders and our constitutional mandate.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the attacks of September 11, 2001 reminded \nus all that national security is of the utmost importance. Since then, \nwe have worked to ensure the safety of this country. Still, there are \ngaps in our immigration and identification systems that need attention. \nThose with ties to terrorist organizations should not be given asylum \nor permission to live in this country where they can do harm. Barriers \non our borders should be enhanced to adequately protect our national \nsecurity. Driver's licenses and personal ID cards should be secure, and \nshould not be given to terrorists or those who are in this country \nillegally.\n  There are provisions to address each of these concerns in the REAL ID \nAct of 2005, which has been attached to the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act. I have expressed my reservations about possible \nunforeseen costs to my State of Montana that these provisions could \nimpose, particularly the costs of changing the system of issuing \ndriver's licenses. Ultimately, however, I firmly believe that the \nfundamental aspects of this bill will make Montana, a border State \nwhere homeland security is of paramount concern, and our country safer \nand more secure in this era where illegal immigration is out of control \nand the security of our identification systems continues to be lacking. \nI am confident that any remaining funding issues can be worked out \nlater in the implementation process. Our job now is to move forward, \nand make sure that these provisions are put into place with the best \ninterest of this country in mind.\n  As I have said before, my State of Montana has one of the largest \ninternational borders. A lot of attention has been placed on border \nsecurity lately, particularly on the northern border. I think we can \nall agree that the northern border has been historically understaffed \nand lacks the necessary infrastructure to adequately screen individuals \nseeking entry into the United States who wish to do us harm. I have \nalways supported increasing the number of border patrol agents along \nMontana's northern border. It does not make sense for the Department of \nHomeland Security to heavily staff the southern borders while leaving \nlarge gaps wide open on the northern border. The end result is that \nthose wanting to enter the United States illegally may focus on the \nless secured border regions of the north so that they may cross over \nundetected. Unfortunately, the grave threat of this happening along \nMontana's vast border remains a reality.\n  In view of this, during debate on the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, I was a cosponsor of the Ensign amendment which was \nadopted that would increase the number of Border Patrol agents and \nprovide funding for Border Patrol facilities. I am happy to report that \nthe conferees reached a compromise that would provide $635 million for \nincreased border security and enforcement; this includes $176 million \nto hire, train, equip, and support 500 Border Patrol agents and relieve \ncurrent facility overcrowding. The supplemental also includes almost \nhalf a billion dollars for Immigration and Customs enforcement; $97.5 \nmillion of this would be used to hire and train additional criminal \ninvestigators and immigration enforcement agents.\n  I will always vote to protect our homeland and the safety of our \ncitizens, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same as the Senate \nconsiders the supplemental for final passage.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2005 is a vital piece of legislation. It provides \n$75.9 billion for the Department of Defense, nearly $4 billion for the \nDepartment of State, and billions more for military construction and \nother national priorities. It will come as no surprise to anyone that \nCongress will pass this bill with an overwhelming majority. Instead, we \nshould be asking what took so long.\n  The administration continues to play games with the funding of the \nwar on terror and the war in Iraq. These aren't inside-the-beltway \nissues. Every day the administration resists bringing forward an \naccurate and reasonable accounting of our future needs in Iraq, it \ncomplicates the way the Department of Defense conducts business.\n  In recent weeks, the Pentagon has been forced to shuffle $1.1 billion \nto cover Army shortfalls while the Department of Defense waits for the \nPresident to sign the supplemental into law. That $1.1 billion came out \nof Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Army National Guard personnel \naccounts. That is a dangerous way to conduct business.\n  As we pass this legislation, I urge the President to heed the advice \nof so many Senators who believe that he must better reflect the costs \nof war in his regular defense budgets and simply be straight with the \nAmerican people about the ongoing costs of operations in Iraq and \nelsewhere. Our troops shouldn't have to wait for the gear and equipment \nthey need to do their jobs well, to win the peace in Iraq, to bring the \nterrorists to justice in Afghanistan and around the world, and to come \nhome.\n  This bill takes some important steps toward the Military Family Bill \nof Rights which we have talked about for many months. It increases to \n$400,000 the life insurance coverage available to service members, and \nraises the death gratuity to $100,000 for those who die in combat and \nin combat-related incidents, including training. It also extends to 1 \nyear the length of time widows and children of military personnel may \nremain in military housing. Together, these provisions are important \naffirmations of the Congress' support for the men and women of the \nAmerican military and their families. I thank the House-Senate \nconferees for including those provisions.\n  I regret that the House-Senate Conferees struck a provision that the \nSenate added to pay an equal death gratuity to the survivors of all \nservice members killed while on active duty, regardless of the \ncircumstances. This policy was supported by 75 Senators in a floor \nvote. It was supported by the House in its version of the legislation. \nAnd it is supported by the uniformed leadership of the military. It is \nclear that the civilian leadership at the Pentagon, led by Secretary \nRumsfeld, opposed it. While they have succeeded in striking the \nprovision from this supplemental legislation, I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues, many of whom have worked on this issue for some \ntime, for its enactment.\n  While I support this bill overall, I have serious concerns about the \nattachment of the REAL ID Act to the conference report. This \nlegislation creates new hurdles for legitimate asylum seekers, allows \nthe government to waive environmental laws to build physical barriers \non the border, and forces an unfunded mandate on the States. This \nlegislation did not have so\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\nmuch as a hearing in the U.S. Senate. Such legislation should be \nconsidered in committee and before the full Senate, rather than being \nattached to an emergency spending bill. It is my hope that the Senate \nwill work to amend the most damaging provisions of the REAL ID Act as \nsoon as possible.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes the ``Save our Small \nand Seasonal Businesses Act'' which makes changes to the H-2B visa \nprogram. This provision will provide great relief to many small \nbusinesses in Massachusetts that count on foreign workers to keep their \nseasonal businesses open.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank the conferees for \naddressing potentially damaging anti-small business language in this \nbill which would have allowed small business subcontracts at the \nDepartment of Energy to be counted as prime contracts and capped all \nsmall business contracting goals at 23 percent. Section 6023 had strong \nbipartisan opposition from members of the Small Business Committees and \nfrom other members concerned about protecting small business federal \ncontracting. The compromise language included in Section 6022 of the \nfinal version of this bill lays out a process for the Small Business \nAdministration and the Department of Energy to expand small business \ncontracting.\n  The compromise requires the Small Business Administration and the \nDepartment of Energy to develop a Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, on \na methodology for measuring the achievement of awarding prime contracts \nand subcontracts to small businesses. It is my understanding that MOU \nwill in no way count the subcontracts awarded by DOE's management and \noperations contractors towards DOE's prime contracting goal. Section \n6022 also requires DOE and SBA to conduct a joint study of changes at \nDOE that would encourage greater opportunities for small business \ncontracting, and it includes temporary relief for local small firms \nthat are facing undue burdens as a result of contracts being broken out \nfrom large, bundled management and operations contracts.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Energy has the worst small business \nutilization record of all Federal agencies. This compromise is an \nopportunity to address the growing challenges facing small firms as a \nresult of contract bundling, the need for greater diligence by the \nadministration in its effort to meet the 23 percent government-wide \nminimum goal for small business contracting, and the need for greater \nmanagement and oversight by the Department of Energy of the contracting \ndollars being awarded by the Agency. I hope the administration will use \nthis opportunity to improve small business contracting at the DOE and \nwill draw on the conclusions of the ongoing studies being released by \nthe GAO to address the current shortfalls in small business prime \ncontracting and subcontracting oversight. As the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am committed to \nworking with the other committees of jurisdiction, including the Energy \nCommittee, to ensure that DOE and SBA do not undermine the intent of \nSection 6022 by using this compromise language to prevent small \nbusinesses from receiving their fair share of DOE prime contracts.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I rise today in support of H.R. 1268, the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, \nand Tsunami Relief.\n  First, while this bill addresses many areas of concern, it is \nprimarily focused on providing the American military sufficient funds \nfor its mission to aid Afghanistan in creating a strong and stable \nnation and to ensure the security necessary to rebuild Iraq.\n  Provisions in the bills to support American soldiers and their \nfamilies, such as increasing the death benefit gratuity for soldiers \nkilled this year to $100,000 and providing all members of the armed \nforces with free meals and phone service, are the right thing to do. We \nwill no longer force men and women who volunteered to serve in one of \nthe most dangerous environments to recuperate without the support of \nloved ones while charging them for their meals. Other important \nprovisions, such as providing more money to combat the effectiveness of \nimprovised explosive devices, or lED's, and providing $150 million for \nthe purchase of up-armored humvees, will serve to protect Americans \nalready operating in combat zones. The biggest danger to Americans in \nuniform remains the IED; by using funds to both prevent the IED from \nexploding and then ensuring that those that do go off near a humvee are \ndefended against, I can safely say that we are working toward the \nultimate goal of mitigating the largest source of American casualties.\n  I was also happy to see that the bill also requires reports on the \nstatus of training for both the Afghan and Iraqi security forces, so \nthat the American public is not given arbitrary numbers of successfully \ntrained soldiers and policemen without an understanding of their \ncapabilities. Just as importantly, the bill states that the President \nshould submit an appropriate budget amendment for FY 2006 by September \n1, 2005.\n  There are also some very important, non-military, provisions in this \nlegislation, nearly all of which I co-sponsored when it came to the \nfloor. All will contribute significantly to the establishment of \nincreased stability in regions throughout the world. For example, the \nUnited States has done far too little to stop the genocide and \natrocities that continue to occur in Darfur, Sudan. This legislation \nspecifically dedicates $50 million to support efforts by the African \nUnion to bring a halt to the violence and another $90 million in \nhumanitarian assistance for refugees in the region. The United States \nhas hardly anything at all to create a stable and viable government in \nHaiti, this in spite of the fact that the country is only miles from \nour shore. This legislation provides $20 million to assist in efforts \nat institution-building, law enforcement, and democracy promotion.\n  Significantly, this legislation is the only vehicle available for \ndisaster assistance to the countries affected by the tsunami in the \nIndian Ocean. I need not remind anyone that this was likely the most \ncatastrophic natural event in recent history, with nearly 200,000 \npeople in eight countries dying in just a few hours. Over 100,000 are \nstill missing. Thousands had their homes, family, and livelihoods swept \naway. The cost in dollars is easily in the hundreds of billions.\n\n  It is imperative that the United States step up to the plate and \nassist in repair and reconstruction. We have pledged almost a billion \ndollars to this effort, and this legislation provides an initial $656 \nmillion to help people get back on their feet. A substantial portion of \nthe funding is directed toward repairing replacing essential services--\nroads and highways, telecommunications and energy infrastructure, and \nwater and food distribution systems, and so on. But portions of the \nfunding are dedicated to other critical issues that will allow these \ncountries to get back to baseline--programs designed to assist women \nwith new economic opportunities now that they have lost the provider in \ntheir families, programs designed to assist individuals with mental or \nphysical disabilities as a result of the tsunami, programs designed to \nprotect orphaned children from violence and exploitation and reunify \nthem with extended or immediate families, programs to provide loans, \nbusiness advice and training in job skills so new sources of income and \nnew businesses are developed; and programs to stop the spread of \ndisease, including avian flu.\n  This bill provides funding for many important causes which I fully \nsupport. But let me take a few moments to discuss a few provisions \nabout which I have significant concerns.\n  First, the conference committee removed a provision that I had \nincluded in the Senate version of the bill that would have helped \nFederal courts cover costs associated with the substantial increase in \nimmigration related cases filed as a result of recent border \nenforcement efforts. I strongly support efforts to enhance our border \nsecurity--indeed, I cosponsored an amendment to this bill that was \noffered by Senator Robert Byrd that provided funding to hire an \nadditional 500 border patrol agents and have consistently voted to \nallocate additional resources to secure our Nation's border. However, \nwe must also consider the impact that these enforcement measures are \nhaving on our Nation's courts, especially in districts along the border \nregion. Since 1995, immigration cases in the 5 southwestern border \ndistricts--the District\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nof Arizona, District of New Mexico, Southern District of California, \nand Southern and Western Districts of Texas--have grown approximately \n828 percent. In 2003, overall immigration filings in U.S. District \nCourts jumped 22 percent, and in 2004 they jumped 11 percent. Of these \ncases, 69 percent came from these 5 districts.\n  We can't just fund the enforcement side without considering what will \nhappen to these individuals once they are detained. This approach not \nonly places a tremendous burden on our courts, but it also threatens \nour national security by limiting the ability of the courts and \nprobation services to provide adequate case oversight.\n  Second, the REAL ID Act, which was attached to the bill by the House \nof Representatives, was included in the final version of the bill. \nAlthough the conference committee made several minor modifications to \nlessen the impact of these provisions, I remain strongly opposed to \nthis section of the bill. The REAL ID Act never received a hearing in \nthe Senate and Republicans on the conference committee refused to \nconsult with their Democrat counterparts on this language. The bill \nmake it more difficult for legitimate asylum applicants to obtain a \nsafe haven in the United States and authorizes the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to waive all legal requirements which could impede \nthe construction of a fence along the border with Mexico. It also \nrepeals provisions of the recently-passed Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which implemented the recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, the intelligence reform bill \ncharged the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the \nStates, with promulgating ``minimum standards'' for State driver's \nlicenses in order to prevent fraud or abuse. Without enhancing our \nnational security, the REAL ID Act repeals this section and replaces it \nwith a system that will be extremely difficult and costly for States to \nimplement. I know that these provisions will have a significant impact \non my home State of New Mexico, and it is my hope that Congress will be \nable to revisit this legislation in the near future.\n\n  Thus, while there are some aspects of this supplemental request that \nremain troubling to me and many of my Senate colleagues, I know that by \nsupporting this bill we are working to create a more peaceful and \nstable world community and meet more of the needs of our brave soldiers \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will vote for the conference report \nbecause I believe we have few higher priorities than the safety and \nwell-being of our troops deployed in harm's way. This legislation is \ncritical to the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, providing funding \nto purchase life-saving armor, replenishing stocks of spare parts and \nammunition, and increasing the government's financial support for the \nfamilies of America's fallen heroes.\n  Probably one of the most significant provisions in this legislation \nis the $308 million added above what the President proposed to ensure \nthat more humvees deployed in combat are adequately armored. Just as in \nthe previous 2 years, I have been deeply troubled by continuing \nshortfalls in the administration's plans for outfitting our troops with \nthe protection they need. Over 1,600 U.S. troops have been killed in \nIraq since the beginning of the war in March 2003. And rarely a day \ngoes by that one does not hear about an improvised explosive device or \nroadside bomb seriously injuring an American there. This conference \nreport is a step in the right direction to better prepare our troops \nfor these threats, but more always needs to be done to ensure greater \nsecurity for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. We owe it to \nthem to make sure they have the resources to protect themselves as best \nthey can.\n  And we owe it to their families here at home to make sure that their \nsacrifices are so honored. This bill also authorizes the Department of \nDefense to increase to $500,000 the amount that can be paid to \nsurviving families of deceased servicemen and women. In addition, this \nbill rightly includes traumatic injury insurance of up to $100,000 for \nmilitary personnel seriously wounded in action. These provisions are \nthe least we as Americans can provide to the families of our men and \nwomen in uniform who are giving so much to our Nation.\n  Not all of this bill directly pertains to our troops deployed in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, however. And while I support many of these provisions, \nthere are some sections that give me pause. On the positive side, I am \npleased by the conference committee's decision to retain the amendment \nput forth by Senator Warner to stop the Navy from downsizing its \naircraft carrier fleet. We must retain the ability to quickly project \npower around the globe, particularly as emerging powers in Central and \nEast Asia amass powerful fleets in direct challenge to U.S. Naval \nsupremacy. And this amendment rightly puts the brakes on the \nadministration's efforts to cut too deeply into our Navy's critical \nassets.\n  In terms of homeland security, this bill adds an additional $450 \nmillion over the President's proposal for more border security and \ncustoms agents. I support these additional resources and am pleased the \nconferees included them in this bill.\n  But this bill is not perfect. Indeed, I have some serious concerns \nabout provisions that are included in the conference report before us. \nI also have concerns that certain important issues are not addressed by \nthis bill.\n  First, I am greatly disappointed that the conferees decided to \ninclude the majority of the text that makes up a bill called the REAL \nID Act. There are many troubling provisions in this language--virtually \nthe same language that Republican members of the House tried to push \nthrough as part of last year's intelligence reform legislation. At that \ntime, the 9/11 Commission opposed its inclusion. And the Senate \nmanagers of the bill prevented it from being included in conference.\n  But now, the vast majority of the REAL ID language has been included \nin the conference report before us. Although I do not sit on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I am concerned that this package of provisions was \nnever debated within that panel. I would note that an effort to include \nthe language in the Senate version of the emergency supplemental was \nwithdrawn after bipartisan opposition to its inclusion.\n  This bill's REAL ID provisions, among other things, would require \nState departments of motor vehicles to verify documents used to obtain \ndrivers licenses. This is an unfunded mandate--the language included in \nthis bill does not specifically appropriate any amount for this \npurpose. Reportedly, the National Conference of State Legislatures \nestimates that REAL ID will cost States between $500 million and $700 \nmillion over 5 years to implement. Many States are already dealing with \nbudget shortfalls. What impact will this additional financial have on \nStates' abilities to provide basic services for their residents?\n  These licensing regulations also raise privacy issues, as DMVs will \ngain access to much private information. All Americans, when renewing \nor obtaining a new license, will be subject to these provisions. \nCertainly, some reform with respect to identification documents might \nbe needed. But this partisan and hasty approach is not the right way to \ndo it--especially when State governments are currently working to \nestablish reasonable standards for reform that can be implemented. \nThese are only two of the many troubling provisions of the REAL ID \nlanguage, which deal with issues as far reaching as eligibility for \nasylum in the U.S. and border security.\n  I also have concerns about issues that were left out of this bill. \nFor example, this bill does not include language addressing the \npractice of renditions--the process whereby the U.S. has reportedly \ntransferred foreign prisoners, detainees, or combatants to other \ncountries for interrogation purposes. Often, the countries to which \nthese people have been transferred are known to practice torture. Yet, \nfew specifics are known about the practice of renditions.\n  Nor does this bill address important issues of accountability, such \nas the extension of the lifespan of the Special Inspector General for \nIraq Reconstruction, or the SIGIR. The SIGIR has performed admirably, \nbut its doors will be closed years before it can complete its task of \naccounting for all American taxpayer money devoted to the \nreconstruction of Iraq. Senator Feingold filed an amendment that would \nhave fixed this problem. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership \nfailed to support\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\nhis efforts, and the amendment was ruled non-germane--even though the \nSIGIR had originally been created and its authority subsequently \nextended as part of an emergency supplemental bill.\n  All in all, this bill is a mixed bag. But it contains critically \nimportant provisions to support our troops--specifically, it will help \nprovide some of the equipment our troops need in order to finish their \njobs safely. Moreover, it will help further the process of training \nIraqi Army and police forces so that U.S. troops can finish their jobs \nand come home. I believe that it is incumbent upon this body to swiftly \npass this spending bill. That is why I intend to support it when it \ncomes to a vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the conference \nreport on the President's emergency supplemental appropriations bill. \nUnfortunately, the REAL ID Act which had been attached in the House \nbill was included in the final measure.\n  The REAL ID Act should have been debated as a part of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. By attaching REAL ID to a must pass spending \nmeasure, the critical process of vetting the bill in committee was \ncircumvented and an opportunity for discussion and debate, which is \nessential for effective legislation, was denied.\n  There are many concerns I have with REAL ID in addition to the \nprocess used to bring it to the floor. First, the measure is an \nunfunded mandate to the States. Furthermore, unless every State \ncomplies, the Federal Government will have to mandate the creation of a \nnational ID. Between the creation of a new database and approval \nsystem, training for DMV workers, and struggling State budgets, REAL ID \nwill impose real costs.\n  More importantly, a database of this type will open up many privacy \nconcerns and there must be security safeguards in place to prevent the \ngathered information from being obtained inappropriately.\n  Many States, including Rhode Island, have already passed legislation \nsetting their own requirements for driver's license recipients. The \nFederal Government should not impinge upon the States' ability to \ndecide who can and cannot drive on their roads, especially without the \nfunding to support the idea. REAL ID will put more drivers on the road \nwithout licenses and without insurance.\n  I am also concerned about another provision of the REAL ID Act that \nwould allow for the waiver of all laws--Federal, State, and local--to \nbuild barriers and roads at our borders. As a strong advocate of \nenvironmental protection, I am troubled about blanket waivers from \nenvironmental laws like the Endangered Species Act and the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act.\n  The REAL ID Act, at its best, should be a catalyst for discussion of \ncomprehensive immigration reform. That discussion cannot take place in \na forum primarily devoted to quickly releasing funds for our troops \naround the world and veterans returning home.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the emergency supplemental \nappropriations conference report before us today is a critically \nimportant piece of legislation. This bill will ensure that our troops \nin Iraq, who put their lives on the line for us every day, are properly \nequipped and protected. It provides vital funds to support the \nemergence of a free Afghanistan, and it provides much-needed funding \nfor tsunami relief.\n  I am supporting this conference report even though I strongly oppose \nthe REAL ID provisions that are also included. The REAL ID Act is a \ncomplete overhaul of our immigration laws that would, amongst other \nthings, impose complicated new driver's license requirements on States, \nmake it harder for refugees at risk of persecution to be granted \nasylum, and suspend all environmental laws along the U.S. border.\n  This language will result in the most significant changes to our \nimmigration policy in 10 years. While we have long recognized the need \nfor comprehensive immigration reform, this debate has no business \ntaking place as part of an emergency spending bill. Legislation of this \nimportance deserves to be the subject of focused study and serious \ndebate. Passing REAL ID without careful consideration is reckless, \nirresponsible, and a disservice to the American people.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in this post-9/11 world, it has never \nbeen so important to work seriously and carefully on efforts to enhance \nour border security.\n  We in New York are particularly cognizant of the need for \ncomprehensive efforts to make our borders, our ports, our critical \ninfrastructure, and our airports as secure as possible. Like no other \nplace in America, like no other place in the world, New Yorkers I \nrepresent know what terrorism looks like, feels like, and costs to our \ncommunities, the economy and our psyches.\n  It is crystal clear to almost everyone that there are many questions \nthat need to be answered about how we secure our borders. As a member \nof the Judiciary Committee and a Senator from New York, an enormous \namount of my time and energy is devoted to just those questions. And \nindeed, I don't think we are doing enough to secure our borders. But \nsneaking drastic changes to our immigration laws into a must-pass \nmeasure supporting our troops is not the way to address these Issues.\n  Opinions are mixed about how effective the REAL ID bill will be in \nenhancing national security. But regardless of what you might think \nabout the merits of the bill itself--I, for instance, have serious \nconcerns regarding the impact of its asylum provisions--this is an \nissue that requires serious debate. Instead, the Republican leadership \nhas completely bypassed the committee process and slipped this \ncontroversial and complicated proposal into the emergency supplemental \nbill, which we will have to approve because it provides the necessary \nsupport of our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as \nthe vital relief for the tsunami victims abroad.\n  Immigrants have built New York and this country from the bottom up. \nOur country was founded by and made stronger by the hard work of \nimmigrants from all different countries, cultures, religions and races. \nI marvel how our new immigrants remake our land, making it a better \nplace, even as they become new Americans. Just think of how many \nrecent, and expectant immigrants now serve in our Armed Forces, some of \nwhom have made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I am proud that New York is still an epicenter for \nimmigrants. Just like my ancestors came over from Europe many decades \nago, the new generations of people just like us are beginning to take \nroot, making our country, our economy, and our culture that much \nstronger and diverse.\n  So any bill that makes such dramatic changes to our immigration laws \nshould be looked at carefully and considered judiciously. We must never \nbend in our determination to secure our borders and protect our Nation \nfrom harm. But nor can we forget what makes our Nation great. These \ndebates and decisions must be reasoned debates, not take-it-or-leave-it \nultimatums strategically devised for partisan political benefit.\n  There are provisions in this bill, for instance, that will make it \nharder for people persecuted on the basis of their race, religion, \nnational origin, or gender abroad to pursue asylum and the American \ndream.\n  There are other provisions that would allow bail bondsmen to play \njudge and determine which immigrants are dangers to the community.\n  These are major changes to our laws, and we have a system to debate, \ndiscuss and vote on such changes. No bill raising so many questions on \nissues of such fundamental importance should escape an honest debate in \nthe Senate. I urge my Republican colleagues to rethink this strategy \nand allow the Senate to do its work the right way.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are voting on the \nfinal passage of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \nDefense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005.\n  I commend my colleagues, especially Chairman Cochran, for working \ndiligently to see that the Senate act quickly to address the needs of \nour troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and emergency humanitarian needs \nworldwide. Americans everywhere are grateful for the efforts of our \ntroops who fight on the front lines of the war on terror. They have \nmade personal sacrifices for the liberty of all Americans,\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\nand we must support them by providing them with the very best \nequipment.\n  The conference report includes much needed funding for humanitarian \nassistance in areas of the world devastated by famine, disaster and \nwar.\n  I am especially pleased that we have provided $90 million for \ninternational disaster and famine assistance for Darfur, Sudan and \nother African countries including Ethiopia, Liberia, Uganda, and the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo. The situation in Sudan remains dire and \nthere are several other countries in the region that will also greatly \nbenefit from these funds.\n  The conference report also includes necessary peacekeeping dollars \nthat will address the security needs of millions of oppressed people. \nFirst, it provides $50 million in funding for the African Union mission \nin Darfur. It is the experience of many on the ground in Darfur that \natrocities do not occur when AU troops are present, and this funding \nshould facilitate an expansion of their mission. I thank my colleagues, \nSenators Corzine, DeWine, Durbin, Leahy and McConnell for their \ntireless work to get this money included in the bill. Security is \nparamount to ensuring an end to the violence that persists in Sudan, \nkilling an estimated 15,000 people per month.\n  Second, the conference report directs $680 million to general \npeacekeeping operations in other war-torn areas worldwide. The United \nStates contributions to these missions are important to security and \nstability on a global level.\n  I commend the inclusion of $5 million for assisting internally \ndisplaced persons in Afghanistan and $120.4 million for migration and \nrefugee assistance for worldwide refugee protection and for the \nPresident to meet his goals for refugee admissions this year.\n  While all of these earmarks will provide much needed protection and \nassistance to the world's poorest and oppressed people, I am extremely \ndisappointed that the Darfur accountability amendment was stripped in \nconference. The amendment which was included by the Senate, would have \nplaced targeted sanctions in the form of a travel ban and asset freezes \non individuals who are committing war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity in Darfur. It would also have directed the administration to \npursue certain policies at the U.N., including multilateral sanctions \nand an arms embargo against Sudan as well as the establishment of a no-\nfly zone over Darfur.\n  I appreciate my Senate colleagues' support of this measure and look \nforward to working together to move this as stand-alone legislation in \nthe near future. It is my hope that the administration will publicly \naddress their concerns with this bill so that we may move swiftly to \nenact the very important provisions that will help alleviate the \nongoing genocide.\n  I am also disappointed that such sweeping immigration provisions were \nincluded in this bill without adequate debate or scrutiny. What \nconcerned me most of all about the REAL ID bill is that it undermines \nAmerica's moral authority by turning away legitimate asylum seekers \nfleeing tyranny. This language was added based on a claim that our \nasylum system can be used by terrorists to enter the country. This is \nnot the case.\n  However, I would like to thank my colleague Chairman Specter for \nworking diligently to successfully soften some of the harsher language \nin the asylum provisions. As originally drafted, the REAL ID Act would \nhave created significant and additional barriers for refugees fleeing \npersecution to obtain asylum.\n  REAL ID would have greatly increased a refugees' burden of proof to \nestablish their eligibility for asylum. At the whim of an immigration \njudge's discretion, refugees would be required to produce corroborative \nevidence of their claims of persecution or prove that the central \nintent of their persecutors was to punish them for their race, religion \nor political beliefs even in cases where the refugee's testimony was \nalready credible.\n  The facts are quite obvious: persecutors are not going to issue \nofficial documents explaining their actions. In addition, proving the \nmindset of those who carry out killings, torture and other abuse is \nnext to impossible. Even if this were possible, those who flee a \ncountry often times don't have time to gather up the proper \ndocumentation they may later need in an American immigration court.\n  The incorporated revisions would make an immigration judge take into \naccount the totality of the circumstances when evaluating an applicants \nclaim and would not be able to discard a claim for subjective reasons.\n  I want to clarify that the triers of fact must consider all relevant \nfactors and base any adverse credibility determinations on a \nconsideration of all of those factors. The findings must be reasonable. \nIt would not be reasonable to find a lack of credibility based on \ninconsistencies, inaccuracies or falsehoods that do not go to the heart \nof the asylum claim without other evidence that the asylum applicant is \nattempting to deceive the trier of fact.\n  I also understand that when assessing demeanor, triers of fact must \ntake into consideration the individual circumstances of the asylum \napplicant, such as his or her cultural background, educational \nbackground, gender, state of mind, history of trauma, and other \nfactors.\n  I remain concerned about how the asylum provisions will affect the \nadjudication of claims by children. Adjudicators cannot realistically \nhold these children to the same burden of proof and standards of \npersuasion as adult asylum-seekers. For example, children reasonably \ncannot be expected to pinpoint a central motive of persecution and \nprovide corroborating evidence of their persecution.\n  I conclude by pointing out that applications for asylum have fallen \nfrom 140,000 to just over 30,000 per year, and the numbers of those who \nare actually granted asylum has fallen to about 10,000 per year. \nIndividuals fleeing persecution must already meet a high burden of \nproof and undergo intensive security measures to obtain asylum. While I \nrecognize the importance of security in the post-9/11 environment, I am \ncommitted to ensuring legitimate asylum-seekers a haven without \nimposing unrealistic barriers.\n  In addition to the asylum revisions, I am extremely pleased that we \nwere able to secure the repeal of the arbitrary 1,000 annual cap placed \non refugees fleeing coercive population control. This, along with the \nlifting of the asylum adjustment cap, will enable those who have fled \npersecution, including forced abortions, to become legal permanent \nresidents and enjoy the security and benefits that go along with that \nstatus.\n  The importance of the supplemental bill is not to be understated. Our \ntroops are valiantly protecting human freedoms and deserve our support. \nThe humanitarian crises around the world resulting from natural \ndisasters such as the tsunami, and resulting from human rights \natrocities such as genocide, cannot be ignored by a country such as \nours. I thank my colleagues for working to get this bill to the \nPresident.\n\n\n                       Iraq Security Forces Fund\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, an important component of this $82 billion \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations conference agreement is the $5.7 \nbillion appropriated for the Iraq Security Forces Fund. I commend \nSenators Stevens and Inouye, the chairman and ranking member of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, for their efforts in securing the \nfull budget request for this important effort. Security must be a high \npriority in Iraq. The sooner the Iraqis develop their own capacity to \nstabilize and secure their country, the sooner our men and women in \nuniform can come home to their families.\n  An important part of security in Iraq involves communications \nsystems. The deployment of an Advanced First Responders Network, AFRN, \nthroughout Iraq will begin to address the current lack of mission-\ncritical public-safety communications capabilities. The AFRN system, \nwhen deployed throughout Iraq, will allow for focused coordination of \nsecurity planning and execution, rapid data collection and analysis of \nchanging security threats, rapid coordination and deployment of \nsecurity assets to address threats, effective planning to reduce/\nprevent future security threats, and a more secure environment that \nwill foster democracy and economic development.\n  The AFRN infrastructure in Iraq has been designed to address needs\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nthroughout the country, including border regions and pipelines. \nHowever, additional funding is needed to meet this objective.\n  Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the chairman and the \nranking member, Senators Stevens and Inouye, whether continued funding \nof the AFRN could be a qualified activity within the $5.7 billion \nincluded in the conference agreement for the Iraq Security Forces Fund?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nthis question. Yes, I believe that funding for the AFRN could be an \neligible activity within the funding we are providing in the Iraq \nSecurity Forces Fund. I cannot guarantee the Senator any particular \nlevel of funding will be provided, but I do agree with him that \ncontinued work on the AFRN is important.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur fully with the chairman.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senators Stevens and Inouye for their insight \ninto this matter.\n\n\n                          australian nationals\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senate Majority Leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the distinguished Senate Majority Leader. I am \npleased to see that the Frist Amendment, adopted by the Senate during \nconsideration of the supplemental appropriations bill, is included in \nthis conference report. The Frist Amendment creates a new E-3 visa sub-\nclassification for Australian nationals. I would be grateful if Senator \nFrist would clarify a couple of technical points relating to his \namendment. It is my understanding that the E-3 visa would not be \nlimited to employment that is directly related to international trade \nand investment, as are the E-1 and E-2 visas. Could the Senator confirm \nthat this is his intention?\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank Senator Kyl for his question. He is correct in his \nunderstanding that the E-3 visa would not be limited to employment that \nis directly related to international trade and investment. To qualify \nfor an E-3 visa, an Australian national must be seeking employment in a \n``specialty occupation,'' as that term is defined in the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, and the U.S. employer must have obtained a \ncertified labor attestation from the Department of Labor. In other \nrespects, such as visa application procedures, periods of admission, \ndependent admissions, and spousal work authorizations, the rules \napplicable to the new E-3 visa will be the same as for other E visa \nholders currently. Also, Australian nationals will continue to have \naccess to all existing categories of visas to which they are currently \nentitled.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senate Majority Leader for these few points of \nclarification.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this urgently \nneeded funding for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines fighting \naround the world. Specifically, I would like to thank my colleague and \nfriend from Mississippi, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, for his commitment to our \nNation's Armed Forces.\n  I particularly want to express my support for the provision dealing \nwith DD(X) destroyers. This bill includes a critical provision to \nprohibit the use of funds by the Navy in conducting a ``one shipyard'' \nacquisition strategy to procure next-generation DD(X) destroyers.\n  The Navy serves not only as a central pillar of our Nation's military \nstrategy, but also as a symbol of American strength abroad. It is \ncrucial that not only do we have the most capable fleet, but also that \nwe have sufficient numbers of ships . . . and shipbuilders . . . to \nmeet our national security requirements.\n  Unfortunately, the Navy has proposed to radically change the \nacquisition strategy for DD(X) destroyers in such a manner as to ensure \nthat there is only one shipyard involved in major surface combatant \nproduction. If implemented, the Navy's ill-advised proposal to go \nforward with a ``one shipyard'' competition for DD(X) between General \nDynamics' Bath Iron Works in Bath, ME, and Northrop Grumman Ship \nSystems in Pascagoula, MS, would jeopardize our national security and \nour industrial capacity.\n  We need to move forward with DD(X) at both shipyards, as originally \nplanned. Holding a competition will inevitably delay DD(X) acquisition \nand increase the costs to taxpayers.\n  The fleet needs the capabilities of a DD(X) destroyer that will \nprovide sustained, offensive, and precise firepower at long ranges to \nsupport forces ashore and to conduct independent attacks against land \ntargets. These systems will provide a naval or joint task force \ncommander with the multimission flexibility to destroy a wide variety \nof land targets while simultaneously countering maritime threats.\n  Moreover, DD(X) will take advantage of advanced stealth technologies, \nwhich will render it significantly less detectable and more survivable \nto enemy attack than the current class of ships. It will also operate \nwith significantly smaller crews than current destroyers.\n  Conducting a competition for these ships, or implementing a ``one \nshipyard'' acquisition strategy further exacerbates the decline in \nAmerica's shipbuilding employment that has shrunk by an overwhelming 75 \npercent since the late 1980s.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill continues to build upon the \nwork many of my colleagues and I during the past several months to \nthwart the Navy's attempt to have only one shipyard capable of building \nDD(X)s. On March 1, I joined 19 of my Senate colleagues, in concert \nwith Senator Lott, to send a letter to President Bush expressing our \nstrong opposition to any ``winner take all'' competition for DD(X).\n  We all agreed that any instability or delay in the DD(X) program at \nthis time could lead to the permanent exodus of skilled men and women \nfrom the last remaining shipyards that produce our complex surface \ncombatants. Construction of surface combatants at a single shipyard \nwould affect the Navy's ability to keep costs lower in the long term.\n  The recently-passed Senate budget resolution included a sense of the \nSenate on the acquisition DD(X) that correctly emphasized that the \nnational security of the United States is best served by a competitive \nindustrial base consisting of at least two shipyards capable of \nconstructing major surface combatants.\n  The Congress has spoken very loudly, and very clearly on this rapid \nchange in direction. It is in our national interest to have two major \nsurface combatant shipyards. This appropriations bill is good for the \nNavy, good for our shipbuilders, and good for our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and funding for our \nmen and women in uniform serving around the world.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will vote to support the conference \nreport on H.R. 1268, the fiscal year 2005 Supplemental Appropriations \nbill, although I have serious reservations about the process that was \nused to attach the REAL ID Act to legislation urgently needed to ensure \nour troops are adequately funded.\n  I am voting for this legislation because it provides needed support \nto our troops in combat, additional border patrol agents to secure our \nporous frontiers, vital relief to areas affected by the recent tsunami \nin the Indian Ocean, and important disaster relief here at home.\n  My colleagues have noted that this legislation funds important needs \nfor our military, from additional up-armored humvees to increased death \nbenefits for those who have lost their lives in service to our Nation \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I agree with my colleagues that it is vital that we get these \nresources to our men and women in uniform without delay.\n  However, I have serious concerns about the process by which \ncontroversial immigration provisions were attached to the bill.\n  And I want to again express my opposition to the inclusion of the \nREAL ID Act--despite the negotiated changes during conference--because \nan emergency supplemental is not the place for the Congress to enact \nsubstantive immigration provisions.\n  The REAL ID provisions included in this legislation will bring about \nsignificant legal and policy changes in the areas of asylum law, \njudicial review,\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\ndeportation of individuals alleged links to terrorist activities, \ndriver's licenses and the border fence.\n  And while I recognize that there were modifications to the REAL ID \nAct during conference--including provisions relating to bounty \nhunters--we are still talking major changes to our immigration laws and \nI don't believe the Senate was given adequate opportunity to review, \nconsider, debate and amend these issues.\n  Any voices of opposition to the REAL ID Act were all but silenced. I \nwas a member of the conference committee, but I was not able to see the \nfinal language until the bill was ready to be filed and it was too late \nto do anything. Essentially, the minority was shut out of the \nconference negotiations on this bill.\n  The REAL ID Act wasn't the only immigration language added to this \nbill in which the Democrats were shut out.\n  For instance, the Republican leadership added language at the \neleventh hour, postcloture, which creates a new temporary worker \nprogram for 10,500 Australian workers.\n  So each year now we will see an influx of 10,500 Australian workers, \nalong with their families. Assuming that each of these professional \nworkers brings their spouse and child, in reality we could be seeing an \nincrease of 31,500 individuals each year--in addition to the other \ncategories of professional workers, such as H-1B and L-1 workers.\n  At what point do we stop creating special carve outs for different \ngroups of people or different countries? And after Australia, what \ncountry is going to come to us and ask for special exceptions to our \nimmigration laws?\n  I am pleased that the conference committee came to a reasonable \ncompromise on the issue of funding additional Border Patrol agents. The \nconference report makes available $635 million to address understaffing \nat our borders.\n\n  While this is a reduction from the amount provided by the Senate, it \nwill provide for 500 new Border Patrol agents, 50 additional \nImmigration and Customs enforcement investigators, 168 detentions \nofficers, as well as needed support staff and construction of \nadditional detention space.\n  This is a good start toward meeting the goals of the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which authorizes the hiring of \n2,000 new Border Patrol agents. That goal was developed in concert with \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee to ensure that next year we continue to \nhire additional agents to secure our borders. Unfortunately, President \nBush's budget for fiscal year 2006 only provides for 210 additional \nagents, which is simply not enough.\n  I would like to briefly comment on the military construction portion \nof this legislation. The House and Senate conferees included $1.128 \nbillion to support military construction projects worldwide.\n  This includes $250 million for projects requested by the Army in \nAlaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, and Texas, \nto support Army modernization.\n  The bill also includes $647 million for the Army to support the \nglobal war on terror--$38.5 million for projects in Afghanistan, $40.4 \nmillion for a prison and security fence in Cuba, $479 million for \nprojects in Iraq, and an additional $39 million for the design of these \nprojects.\n  In addition, there is $140 million included in the bill to support \nthe Marine Corps Force Structure Review Group to alleviate the overall \nstress on the Marine Corps produced by deployments related to the \nglobal war on terrorism. These projects are located in California, \nNorth Carolina, and Djibouti.\n  The bill includes $141 million to support Air Force projects in \nCentral Command--$31 million for Afghanistan, $58 million for projects \nin Iraq, $1.4 million for the United Arab Emirates, $42.5 million for \nUzbekistan, and an additional $8 million for the design of these \nprojects.\n  Let me turn to an issue that is of particular importance to me and to \nmy State--and that is preventing and fighting wildfires that have \nstruck the West with increasing regularity and intensity in recent \nyears.\n  As many of my colleagues know, southern California was hit this \nwinter with unusually heavy rain storms that caused severe flooding--at \nthis point it is the second wettest winter in Los Angeles since records \nhave been kept.\n  These storms dumped 70 to 90 inches of rain in parts of southern \nCalifornia that include several national forests, causing flooding, \ndebris flows, and mudslides which destroyed or damaged more than 90 \npercent of the roads in four National Forests: Angeles National Forest; \nCleveland National Forest; Los Padres National Forest; and San \nBernardino National Forest.\n  The conference report provides $24.39 million in capital improvement \nand maintenance funding to the Forest Service to repair those roads. \nThis funding will make it possible to repair roads that are vital to \nfirefighting efforts for thousands of acres in these forests.\n  We all know about the disastrous wildfires that burned in southern \nCalifornia in 2003. Fires burned 739,597 acres, destroyed 3,631 homes, \nand killed 24 people, according to the California Department of \nForestry.\n  San Bernardino Forest Supervisor Gene Zimmerman told my staff that he \nhas never seen the grass grow as high as it has this year, and it is \nstarting to turn brown--which means it could burn later this year.\n  Here is the biggest difference from 2003: right now, firefighters \ncannot get in to the forests to contain fires. The Forest Service \nestimates that 2.3 million acres of National Forest System lands are \ninaccessible to ground-based fire vehicles.\n  The Forest Service tells me that they need to begin work immediately \non roads to allow access for the 2005 fire season. They already have \ncontractors working and will add to their contracts as funding is \navailable. They have done the necessary damage assessments to enable \nimmediate start up of work.\n  With the $24 million in this conference report, the Forest Service \ncan open the majority of roads to accommodate fire apparatus by July \nand August, which is still the early part of this year's fire season.\n  I thank Chairman Cochran, Senator Byrd, Interior Subcommittee \nChairman Burns and Senator Dorgan, as well as their able staffs for \nhelping to secure this funding in the Senate bill.\n  I also thank House Chairman Lewis for working with us in the \nconference committee on an issue that is crucial to preventing a repeat \nof the devastating fires our State suffered in 2003.\n  I want to briefly highlight one last issue that is important to me, \nand I believe to the prospects for peace in the Middle East.\n  This conference report includes a provision that I offered to provide \nlegal authority for a Federal agency, the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, OPIC, to receive $10 million to help bolster economic and \ninfrastructure development in the Gaza Strip.\n  OPIC is combining forces with private organizations to build a $250 \nmillion loan fund that would be aimed at microfinance, small business, \ncorporate and mortgage lending to deserving businesses, firms and \nentities in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.\n  A meeting is being held this coming week in London among the various \nloan fund participants to continue sorting out appropriate financial \nand legal mechanisms for distributing these funds.\n  As the group moves forward, this $10 million subsidy will play a \ncrucial role in extending OPIC political risk guarantees for loans to \ndeserving Palestinian business recipients and I was pleased to assist \nin this process.\n  On a larger scale, as we begin the process of Gaza disengagement, we \nneed to help provide the Palestinians with real economic hope--not \ncontinued frustration about the lack of jobs and exports.\n  The lack of agreed mechanisms to coordinate disengagement, developing \nan agreed concept on how Palestinian security forces will take over \nareas evacuated by Israeli defense forces, and permitting greater \nfreedom of movement, between Gaza and the West Bank, to assist with \nrehabilitation efforts are just a few areas of concern.\n  I hope the $150 million provided by this conference report will \ncontribute to framing key security and economic arrangements that allow \nGaza disengagement to occur peacefully and not violently.\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\n  Although I am troubled by the inclusion of the REAL ID Act in this \nbill, the bottom line is that it provides necessary funding to our \ntroops in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as relief to countries struck \nby the Tsunami in the Indian Ocean and disasters here at home. It may \nnot be perfect, but it gives vital financial support to those who badly \nneed it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the fiscal year \n2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations conference report. This \nconference report contains important funding that gives our troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq the equipment and support they need. It also \nprovides additional resources to help train new Iraqi security forces \nthat will help speed the return of our servicemen and women.\n  In March, I traveled to Iraq to witness firsthand our military \noperations. There is no doubt that the insurgency is strong and that \nour continuing presence in Iraq, without even a goal for leaving, is \nfueling it.\n  Therefore, our troops are in grave danger every day, as evidenced by \nthe tragic number of dead and wounded. Since the beginning of the Iraq \nWar, we have suffered more than 1,600 deaths and more than 12,000 \nwounded.\n  My trip to Iraq confirmed my fears that not enough is being done to \nprotect our soldiers from the threat of roadside bombs. Roadside bombs \nare one of the leading causes of death in Iraq and are responsible for \n70 percent of those personnel killed or wounded. That is why I am glad \nthat the conference report provides $60 million to rapidly field \nelectronic jammers that help prevent the detonation of roadside bombs. \nThis is consistent with the Boxer amendment that was adopted on the \nfloor during the Senate's consideration of the bill.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report provides $150 million in \nadditional funding for up-armored Humvees. While this is not as much as \nprovided by the Bayh amendment, it is still a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I will vote for this conference report, but I do so with serious \nreservations about the lack of an exit strategy in Iraq and with \nadditional reservations about the way the REAL ID Act was attached to \nthis legislation.\n  The REAL ID Act contains sweeping changes to our immigration laws. \nThese provisions were not included in the President's supplemental \nappropriations request, nor were they included in the Senate version of \nthe bill that was approved last month.\n  But at the insistence of the Republican leadership in the House, this \nlegislation was attached to the House version of the emergency \nsupplemental bill and then rammed through conference without the \nparticipation of Democrats. The REAL ID Act will become law without \ndiscussion or debate in the Senate.\n  The REAL ID Act contains a provision that would require states to \ncollect documents proving the date of birth, social security number, \nprincipal address, and lawful immigration status for any applicant \nseeking a driver's license or identification card that would be \nrecognized by the Federal government. States would be required to keep \nthese documents on hand for a minimum of 7 years, maintain this \ninformation on a database, and allow electronic access to all other \nstates.\n  States are understandably concerned that they do not have the \ncapability to meet this mandate. Privacy concerns have also been \nraised.\n  Unfortunately, we have not had the ability to fully investigate the \nprivacy implications and other issues related to this provision. My \nState of California has worked for 3 years trying to find a workable \nsolution to this issue. But in the Senate, the REAL ID Act did not even \nwarrant a hearing. This is why the National Governors Association, the \nNational Council of State Legislatures, and the American Association of \nMotor Vehicle Administrators all oppose this legislation.\n  The REAL ID Act also contains a troubling provision that allows the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to waive all legal requirements--\nincluding environmental laws--in order to build security fences along \nU.S. borders. Security fences can be built without waiving \nenvironmental laws.\n  So, while I will vote for this bill because it helps our brave and \ncourageous troops, I am deeply distressed at the way Democrats were \nleft out of all the immigration discussions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am dismayed that nearly all of the \nprovisions of the REAL ID Act have been included in this conference \nreport after closed-door negotiations between House and Senate \nRepublicans. Democratic conferees were excluded from these \nnegotiations. Indeed, my staff specifically asked the conferees for the \nmajority to be included in negotiations on these far-reaching \nprovisions--which have never received Judiciary Committee \nconsideration--but our request was ignored.\n  I oppose the inclusion of these provisions for a number of reasons. \nFirst and foremost, this is not the way we should be legislating \ncomprehensive changes to our immigration laws. The Judiciary Committee \nnever considered them. The Senate never voted on them when the \nsupplemental appropriations bill was being debated. Indeed, Senator \nIsakson offered an amendment that included the text of REAL ID but then \nwithdrew it, reportedly under pressure from his own leadership. Many of \nus believed the Senate would vote down the Isakson amendment, \nespecially considering that six Republican Senators had joined six \nDemocratic Senators in writing to the majority leader to oppose \nincluding REAL ID in the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Second, I am concerned that the REAL ID Act will cause great hardship \nfor asylum seekers. In the guise of preventing terrorists from \nobtaining asylum--which is forbidden under current law--this conference \nreport raises the standard of proof for all asylum seekers. The REAL ID \nAct's asylum provisions are opposed by a wide variety of religious \norganizations from across the political spectrum, as well as advocates \nfor refugees and asylees. The United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops has said that the asylum provisions in REAL ID would \n``eviscerate the protection of asylum, thus preventing victims of \npersecution from receiving safe haven in the United States.''\n  Third, this conference report includes the REAL ID Act's breathtaking \nwaiver of Federal law. The Secretary of Homeland Security will now be \nempowered to waive any and all laws that may get in the way of the \nconstruction of fences or barriers at any United States border. The \nSecretary already has broad authority in this area, and to further \nincrease it demonstrates a lack of concern both with environmental \nprotection and the rule of law.\n  Fourth, the conference report repeals the minimum Federal standards \nfor driver's licenses that Congress passed only last December in the \nintelligence reform bill, in response to the recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission. The Bush administration said that it preferred the \napproach taken in the conference report to the approach favored by the \nHouse, which is contained in the REAL ID Act. The House approach, now \nincluded in this conference report, replaces the newly enacted minimum \nstandards with Federal mandates that I fear will be unworkable. The \nadministration and the States have already devoted substantial energy \nto implementing the existing standards, and this conference report may \nrepresent a step backwards in our security.\n  These new provisions will endanger the lives of victims of domestic \nviolence, including U.S. citizens. Many States currently allow victims \nof abuse--who frequently are hiding from their abusers--to obtain \ndriver's licenses that do not list their address. This conference \nreport will require all licenses to bear the recipient's address; \nunfortunately, it contains no exception for victims of domestic abuse \nor stalking. If a victim of domestic abuse or stalking is forced to \ndisclose her physical residence in order to get a Federally-approved \ndriver's license, she risks the possibility that she and her children \nwill be tracked down by their abuser. For women and children fleeing \ndomestic abuse or stalking, the option to use an alternate address is \nnot a matter of convenience or preference; it can be a matter of life \nor death. We must fix this residential address requirement when we \nreauthorize the Violence Against Women Act later this year by creating \nan exemption for victims of domestic abuse or stalking.\n  Fifth, the conference report would eliminate habeas corpus review for\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\naliens who have received removal orders. We have not taken such a step \nin this country for more than a century, but we are taking it now, \nwithout the Senate even considering the measure.\n  Overall, the REAL ID provisions in this conference report need a much \nwider airing and consideration before enactment. Unfortunately, \nRepublican conferees agreed to exclude the Democrats from consideration \nof these proposals and a group of Senate and House appropriators have \nagreed to change our immigration laws in profound ways.\n  On a much more favorable note, I am pleased that the conference \nreport included, with minor modifications, the Senate-passed provision \nto provide relief to the small and seasonal businesses across our \nnation that rely on temporary foreign workers who come here on H-2B \nvisas. I cosponsored the Senate amendment, offered by Senator Mikulski, \nto make additional visas available for aliens who wish to perform \nseasonal work in the United States. For the second year in a row, the \nstatutory cap on such H-2B visas was met before businesses that need \nadditional summer employees were even eligible to apply for visas. This \nhas hurt businesses across the country, and this amendment will provide \nneeded relief.\n  In Vermont, the main users of these visas are hotels, inns and \nresorts that have a busy summer season. I have heard from dozens of \nbusinesses in Vermont over the past year that have struggled mightily \nto manage without temporary foreign labor. I know that the Lake \nChamplain Chamber of Commerce, the Vermont Lodging & Restaurant \nAssociation and many small businesses in Vermont are vitally concerned \nand expect that similar associations and businesses in other States \nare, as well.\n  Indeed, a wide range of industries use these visas in other States. I \nimagine that nearly all Senators have heard from a constituent who has \nbeen harmed by the sudden shortage of H-2B visas, and fear that they \nwill go out of business if Congress does not act to make more visas \navailable.\n  The conference report does not raise the cap on the program, but \nrather allows those who had entered the U.S. in previous years through \nthe H-2B program to return. These are, by definition, people who came \nto the U.S. legally and returned to their own countries as the law \nrequires. The amendment also addresses the concerns some members have \nexpressed about fraud.\n  I have been working to solve this crisis for more than a year. I \njoined last year with a substantial bipartisan coalition in introducing \nS.2252, the Save Summer Act of 2004. Senator Kennedy was the lead \nsponsor of the bill, which had 18 cosponsors, including 8 Republicans. \nThe bill would have added 40,000 visas for the current fiscal year, \nproviding relief to those summer-oriented businesses that had never \neven had the opportunity to apply for visas. Unfortunately, that bill \nwas opposed by a number of Republican Senators and never received a \nvote. Our constituents suffered the consequences, and I am gratified \nthat we are prepared to provide relief.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, thousands of men and women are proudly \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the majority will return home to \ntheir loved ones, more than 1,700 have paid the ultimate sacrifice to \ntheir country, and nearly 13,000 have been wounded in action. Even \nafter Iraq's historic elections in January, violence continues on a \ndaily basis with no end in sight to the insurgency.\n  Today, the Senate is preparing to approve another massive \nsupplemental appropriations request from the Bush administration to \nfund ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The most recent \nrequest of $82 billion makes it the second largest supplemental \nappropriations measure Congress has ever passed and brings the total \namount of appropriated funds to $275 billion.\n  I support this supplemental request because I firmly believe that \nCongress has an obligation to provide our troops with all the resources \nthey need to complete their mission. While I am deeply troubled by the \nBush administration's continued practice of funding our efforts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan through supplemental appropriations requests rather \nthan the normal annual appropriations process, the bill contains too \nmany important resources for our troops not to support it.\n  This bill includes additional funding above the President's request \nfor essential items such as up-armored Army Humvees, add-on vehicle \narmor kits, night vision equipment, and radio jammers that disrupt \nremote-controlled bombs used by Iraqi insurgents. In addition, Congress \nrecognizes the extraordinary sacrifices our soldiers are making in \ndefense of freedom by increasing the amount of life insurance \nservicemembers can purchase, as well as the one-time death gratuity a \nsoldier's surviving family members receives.\n  Having said that, I have deep concerns about this most recent \nsupplemental request. For over 2 years, American soldiers have been \nshouldering most of the peace-keeping burden in Iraq. While no one \ndismisses the contributions being made by coalition members, once \nagain, I ask President Bush to reach out to our allies so that our \nefforts in Iraq are truly an international effort. The entire world has \nmuch to gain by a secure and peaceful Iraq, and other nations should do \ntheir fair share because we ask even more of our brave men and women in \nuniform.\n  While I am supportive of quick action on funding for U.S. troops, I \nmust express my strong opposition to the way the Republican leadership \nis forcing approval of far-reaching driver license legislation as part \nof this bill. There has been no real opportunity for debate of the \n``REAL ID'' amendment. Its inclusion in this must-pass bill subverts \nthe work of the Regulatory Negotiation Advisory Committee that was \nestablished in last year's intelligence overhaul bill to provide a \nthoughtful and carefully crafted approach to driver's license \nlegislation. Because we are now faced with a conference report on \nemergency funding, no further amendments will be permitted and Senators \nmust vote yes or no on the entire package.\n  The REAL ID amendment will saddle the States with a $500 million \nunfunded mandate over the next 5 years, while at the same time, \ncomplicating the issuing and re-issuing of drivers licenses. State \nemployees will be required to assume the duties of the Federal \nImmigration and Naturalization Service at a time when States are \nalready reeling from Federal cuts in Medicaid, education, and community \ndevelopment funding. With no opportunity for amendments or expert \ntestimony, Congress is being required to establish what amounts to a \nnational ID card. While the goal of establishing more secure driver's \nlicenses in the post-9/11 world is vitally important, it should be the \nresponsibility of the Advisory Committee. Forcing this ill-considered \namendment past Congress on the back of an unrelated bill that provides \nneeded funds for our troops is wrong and a disservice to the American \npeople.\n  I am uncomfortable conducting Senate business in this manner, \nparticularly when it comes to issues that affect the security of our \npersonal identity. These provisions were attached to a vital \nappropriations bill before authorizing Senate committees of \njurisdiction had an opportunity to properly scrutinize the content, \nconduct hearings, and pose questions to administration officials and \nother interested individuals. Even more astounding, Democrats were not \nincluded in negotiations to determine the immigration provisions of \nthis bill.\n  On matters as important as immigration reform and homeland security, \nit is misguided and short-sighted to pass legislation in this ad hoc \nfashion. Forcing Senators to support funding for our troops by voting \nin favor of legislation they may oppose is not in the best interest of \nour country.\n  I have deep reservations about some of the provisions included in \nthis bill, and I hope they can be reconsidered as measures apart from \nthis supplemental bill. However, I will vote in favor of providing \nadditional funds for our troops. Our first priority must be to ensure \nour troops have the necessary tools to finish their mission in Iraq and \nAfghanistan as swiftly and as safely as possible.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the provisions of \nthe conference report to H.R. 1268, the Iraq and Afghanistan Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act, concerning\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\nsmall business contracting at the Department of Energy.\n  As chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am concerned that, although the conference report \ndid not contain a substantive change to the Small Business Act's prime \ncontracts goaling requirements, it does contain a provision addressing \nsmall business contracting. I remain deeply disappointed that H.R. \n1268, an emergency appropriations measure, includes targeted language \ndealing with the Department of Energy's small business contracting. \nNumerous groups and individuals, including the SBA Administrator and \nthe SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy, wrote to Congress in opposition to \nsubstantive changes to small business prime contracting goals.\n  As a result of inclusion of this provision, the Congressional small \nbusiness committees prepared a joint statement to be submitted in both \nthe House and the Senate. Chairman Manzullo of the House Small Business \nalready filed this Statement in the House prior to the vote on the \nconference report for H.R. 1268. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the following statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Joint Statement Concerning Small Business Contracting Provisions in \n                               H.R. 1268\n\n (by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Chair of the Senate Committee on Small \n  Business and Entrepreneurship, and Congressman Donald R. Manzullo, \n              Chairman, House Committee on Small Business)\n\n       Section 6022 of H.R. 1268, as adopted in the Conference \n     Report, H. Rep. 109-72, contains certain provisions \n     concerning small business contracting at the Department of \n     Energy. These provisions were inserted as a substitute for \n     Section 6023 of the Senate version of H.R. 1268. Section \n     6023, among other things sought to amend the Small Business \n     Act to authorize counting of small business subcontracts at \n     the Department of Energy's large prime contractors for \n     purposes of reporting small business prime contracting \n     results. Because the substitute language was not adopted by \n     Congress through regular legislative proceedings in the \n     Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and \n     the House Committee on Small Business but was adopted anew \n     during the House-Senate conference, the committees of \n     jurisdiction take this opportunity to provide guidance \n     generally provided through their reports to Senators and \n     Representatives prior to their vote on the Conference Report, \n     and to affected Federal agencies prior to their \n     implementation of the Conference Report if adopted.\n       In subsections 6022 (a) and (b), the language chosen to \n     replace Section 6023 in the Conference Report directs the \n     Department of Energy and the Small Business Administration to \n     enter into a Memorandum of Understanding for reporting small \n     business prime contracts and subcontracts at the Department \n     of Energy. This replacement language does not change the \n     Small Business Act's clear distinction between prime \n     contracts and subcontracts, does not amend the statutory \n     small business prime contracting goal requirements which are \n     binding on the Department of Energy, and does not obviate \n     Congressional and regulatory policies against contract \n     bundling. This language does not repeal the President's \n     Executive Order 13360 directing the Department of Energy to \n     comply with its separate statutory prime contracting and \n     subcontracting goals for awards to small businesses owned by \n     service-disabled veterans. Any interpretation to the contrary \n     would be unreasonable and contrary to Congressional intent.\n       In subsection 6022(c), the replacement language mandates a \n     study of changes to management prime contracts at the \n     Department of Energy to encourage small business prime \n     contracting opportunities. The object of the study is to \n     examine the feasibility of establishing a procurement agency \n     relationship between the management prime contractors and the \n     Department of Energy in accordance with the requirements of \n     Federal procurement laws, Federal procurement regulations, \n     the ``Federal norm'' of government contracting as recognized \n     by the Comptroller General, and applicable judicial precedent \n     such as U.S. West Communications, Inc. v. United States, 940 \n     F.2d 622 (Fed. Cir. 1991).\n       Finally, in subsection 6022(d), the replacement language \n     imposes certain requirements upon the Department of Energy \n     concerning break-outs of services from large prime contracts \n     for awards to small businesses. First, the Secretary of \n     Energy is required to consider whether services performed \n     have been previously provided by a small business concern. \n     This requirement is for acquisition planning purposes only, \n     and shall not be construed as imposing a restriction of any \n     kind on the ability of the Department of Energy to break out \n     its large prime contracts for award to small businesses. \n     Congress recognizes that most of work currently contracted by \n     the Department of Energy to its large prime contractors has \n     never been historically performed by small businesses. \n     However, this does not waive the application of the Small \n     Business Act, the President's Executive Order 13360, or the \n     President's initiative against contract bundling to the \n     Department of Energy. Second, the Secretary of Energy is \n     required to consider whether small business concerns are \n     capable of performing under the contracts which are broken \n     out for award. This requirement is simply a restatement of \n     current statutory and regulatory requirements on contractor \n     responsibility. Subsection (d)(2) directs the Secretary of \n     Energy is required to--impose certain subcontracting \n     requirements. As the text plainly indicates, this provision \n     applies solely to small business prime contracts which were \n     formerly small business subcontracts for services.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a few of my thoughts \nregarding the Iraq/Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill that \nthe Senate is expected to pass today. In particular, I wanted to \ndiscuss the bill's important provisions that would improve the H-2B \nvisa program and provide timely relief for seasonal businesses in my \nState and across the country.\n  First, let me express my appreciation to my dear friend from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski, who has been a tireless fighter for the \nseasonal employers in her State. She and I have worked together on this \nissue for several months, and I was proud to be the lead cosponsor of \nS. 352, the ``Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act of 2005.'' Our \noffices worked closely to draft this legislation, which was \nincorporated into the Iraq/Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill \nwhen the Senate overwhelmingly approved Senator Mikulski's H-2B \namendment on April 19, 2005 by a vote of 94-6. I am pleased that this \nlegislation was also accepted in conference and will soon become law.\n  With the summer season soon upon us, I believe that the H-2B problem \nneeds timely relief that is fair to all seasonal employers, and the \nSave Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act will do exactly this. As \nmost of us know, the 66,000 cap on H-2B visas was reached in early \nJanuary; therefore, shutting out businesses that rely on H-2B workers \nin the spring and summer months. This seasonal inequity is \nunjustifiable, and therefore I am pleased that the H-2B provisions \nbefore us will divide the 66,000 cap so that 33,000 visas will be \navailable for the first half of the fiscal year and the other 33,000 \nvisas will be available for the second half of the fiscal year.\n  To provide timely and meaningful relief, the Save Our Small and \nSeasonal Businesses Act will also temporarily exempt returning H-2B \nworkers from the statutory cap. For fiscal years 2005 and 2006, H-2B \nworkers who had worked in the U.S. under an H-2B visa during the past \nthree fiscal years will qualify for this exemption and will not be \ncounted against the cap. Since the cap has already been hit for fiscal \nyear 2005, the H-2B provisions in the supplemental appropriations bill \nwill establish a ``look back''--namely, they allow the Department of \nHomeland Security to estimate how many of the H-2B visas already issued \nfor this fiscal year were given to returning workers. This is necessary \nto ensure that the Department can swiftly apply the exemption for \nfiscal year 2005 and free up visas under the cap for new H-2B workers \nfor this summer season.\n  In addition, the Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act will \nallow the Department of Homeland Security to waive the Administrative \nProcedure Act to avoid having to issue rules and go through other \nhurdles to implement the H-2B provisions before us. This is intended to \ngive the Department the ability to swiftly accept H-2B petitions and \nimplement the Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act in a timely \nmanner so that businesses can employ H-2B workers this summer.\n  As I stated earlier, I am pleased that Congress has finally acted to \nimprove the H-2B program and provide timely relief for small and \nseasonal businesses. In my State, the H-2B program is of special \nconcern to the tourist and logging industries, which are both important \nto the New Hampshire economy. For instance, in 2004 alone, New \nHampshire's tourism industry generated $4 billion in revenues and \nnearly $140 million in rooms and meals taxes, which makes up about 25 \npercent of the State's total revenue stream. For a number of seasonal \nemployers in my State, the short-term hiring needs and the nature of \ntheir businesses make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to \nfully staff their positions with U.S. workers. H-2B workers therefore \nare\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\nthe only lawful option to fulfill labor shortages when U.S. workers are \nnot available.\n  The Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act will help ensure that \nthese seasonal employers can stay in business and use a program that \nhas safeguards for U.S. workers. Moreover, as we try to reign in \nillegal immigration and bolster respect for our laws, I believe that \nCongress has shown wise judgment by passing this legislation. In \naddition to strengthening anti-fraud protections, these H-2B reforms \nwill reward employers that follow the rules and will encourage the \nlawful hiring of temporary workers instead of the hiring of illegal \naliens.\n  Some provisions of the Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act are \nonly temporary in nature and are intended to be a short-term fix. I \nrecognize that significantly more work must be done to improve our \nimmigration policies over the long term, including our guest worker \nprograms. We can no longer accept having immigration laws that fail to \nbring about order along our borders and other points of entry or are \nignored altogether. As such, Congress must re-double its efforts to \npass comprehensive immigration reform legislation, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on this long needed effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Cochran for his \nleadership on this important bill for our country, as well as ranking \nmember Byrd.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1268. I support it because it is a symbol \nof our compact with our troops and their families. I support it because \nit sends a signal of hope to other emerging democracies. And I support \nit despite some baffling decisions taken in the conference committee to \nstrike key proposals to support our troops and their families.\n  Insurgent attacks in Iraq are on the rise. There were 45 per day in \nMarch, 60 per day in April, and the rate of attacks this month is \ntopping that number. While down from the highs of the preelection \nviolence, this spike does not suggest a weakened or retreating \ninsurgency. Instead, it suggests a greater urgency is needed for even \ngreater support for our troops.\n  Last month the Washington Post quoted an unnamed American official in \nour embassy in Baghdad as saying:\n\n       My strong sense is that a lot of political momentum that \n     was generated out of the successful election, which was sort \n     of like a punch in the gut to the insurgents, has worn off.\n\n  In Colorado, we have seen Army units mobilizing for their second and \nthird tours in Iraq; this nearly 2 years after we were assured that the \nmission there had been accomplished. So it is time that we get this \nassistance to our troops and to their families.\n  This bill includes $75.9 billion for the Department of Defense and an \nadditional $450 million for increased border security. Those efforts \ncannot wait any longer. After having been needlessly delayed by the \ninclusion of extraneous provisions in the House of Representatives, we \nneed to put these investments to work.\n  We also need to put the resources to work that are called for in this \nlegislation beyond Iraq. That is why it is so important that the \nconference committee include the $5 million downpayment on America's \ninvestment in a strong and independent and democratic Lebanon, free \nfrom interference from Syria. We all remember the courageous protests \nin the streets of Beirut earlier this year. Yet despite this brave show \nof support for freedom, the President's supplemental included no \nfunding for strengthening democracy in Lebanon. That would have been a \nmissed opportunity, and I am delighted that the conference committee \nkept this funding in the conference report.\n  At the same time, we need to ensure that the enormous investment our \ntaxpayers are making in this bill is invested carefully. We were all \npainfully familiar with the reports from Iraq of security personnel \nthat received training only to turn and run when confronted with \ninsurgents, or even the instances where personnel we paid to train \nturned their weapons on our own troops.\n  That is why I am so pleased the conference report includes the \namendment I included during our debate in the Senate regarding the \nhundreds of millions of dollars we are investing in Afghan security \nforces. Like our successful efforts to invest increased resources in \nColorado police officers when I served as Colorado State attorney \ngeneral, my amendment simply says that we are prepared to pay to train \nAfghan forces, provided they are prepared to accept greater \naccountability and standards of excellence. That is the least the \nAmerican people should expect, and I commend the conference committee \nfor adopting that amendment.\n  I also want to comment on inadequacies that I see in the conference \nreport. As a new Member of the Senate, I have to express my surprise at \nthe partisan nature of the conference committee report itself. This is \na shame because the rest of the country does not see supporting our \ntroops as a partisan issue. It seems to me that in a time of war, we \ncan do better than a conference committee that meets purely on partisan \nlines, better than a conference committee that cuts out proposals that \npassed this Chamber with overwhelming majorities, and better than a \nconference committee that inserts a proposal to overturn decades of \nAmerican asylum policy, a policy that protects the world's most \nvulnerable people, even though a Senate committee has never reviewed \nthat policy.\n  The conference report provides an increase in the fallen hero \ncompensation to $100,000 for all combat-related deaths, similar to \nlanguage proposed in the Senate committee. Regrettably, it omits the \nKerry amendment, which I cosponsored and which was adopted by an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority of this body, that would have assured \nthat all the families in the military who have died since 9/11 would be \neligible to receive $100,000 in fallen hero compensation. Similarly, \njust as insurgent attacks began to spike, this conference report also \nomits much of the additional funding for up-armored humvees, \noverwhelmingly passed in the form of an amendment sponsored by Senator \nBayh.\n  As we see more and more reservists and guards men and women deployed \nto Iraq, the conference report omits protections for these patriots and \ntheir families.\n  The amendment would have ensured that Federal employees who have been \nactivated in the Guard or Reserves do not suffer any loss in salary as \na result of their willingness to take on this patriotic assignment. I \ndo not understand why the conference deleted the payment protections \nafforded these families by the Durbin amendment.\n  While the conference committee could not protect these important \nprovisions for our troops and their families, somehow this conference, \nled by Members of the House of Representatives, did find time to \ninclude within this wartime supplemental a huge proposal that has never \nreceived a hearing in the Senate.\n  I will say this about the so-called REAL ID Act included in this \nbill: It does nothing to address the calls of many Coloradans for \nserious border strengthening.\n  It will not reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants who come to \nthe United States. Instead, it will heap an unfunded mandate on the \nStates, passing onto the States our duty to protect our borders. At the \nsame time, it denies protection to refugees who come to this country \nseeking freedom from religious and political persecution.\n  Let's be clear what those protections are for. They are for the \nworld's most vulnerable people who come to this country seeking freedom \nand safety from persecution. They include Christians fleeing \npersecution in Egypt, democracy activists fleeing violence in West \nAfrica, and women fleeing abuse in Somalia. While the issue of \nimmigration is an issue that necessarily deserves attention in our \nNation's Capitol today, this is not the way to go.\n  Mr. President, it is time that we get the funding contemplated in \nthis legislation to our troops. It has been delayed long enough. I \nintend to vote for it, and I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that Senators have \nendorsed the conference report in a bipartisan way. We appreciate the \nsupport that this is receiving. In every conference, there are always \nissues that\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\narise that cannot be resolved to suit all Senators or all Members of \nthe other body. But I must say to the Senate that this was a conference \nthat was open, fair, and it allowed for the participation of all \nconferees, both parties in the Senate, and the same with the House. We \nhad two sessions; one was in the Capitol over on the House side and \nanother was on the Senate side in the Mansfield Room, where any Senator \nor any Member from the House who wanted to speak before the conference \nhad the right to do so. In addition, Members had the opportunity to \noffer motions, amendments, or suggestions for the benefit of members of \nthe conference.\n  I was very pleased to acknowledge, at the time, the important \nparticipation of the ranking member on the Democratic side in the \nSenate committee, Senator Byrd, who took an active role in the \ndiscussions, who offered a motion at one point to insist upon the \nposition of the Senate in the conference. Other members could have done \nthe same or argued against including any provision of the House-passed \nbill.\n  There has been some discussion today about the REAL ID provision. I \ndidn't think that was a wonderful idea myself. It was not included in \nthe Senate bill. It was a House provision. But the House Members \ninsisted that it be included in the conference report. Anyone who \nwanted to resist that had an opportunity to argue against it or to \noffer a motion that the Senate insist upon its position that it not be \nincluded. No Senator elected to do that.\n  I didn't know how many meetings were going to be required of the \nconference. I had no idea what the House would do in terms of insisting \non provisions in this bill as that conference began. I was, frankly, \nsurprised that we didn't have but two meetings of the conference. I \nexpected that we would have other meetings. But the House didn't think \nit was important or necessary, and I got the impression that there were \ngoing to be no more meetings but only after the second meeting had \nconcluded. Members of the committee continued to discuss issues with \nHouse conferees, and we finally reached agreement.\n  I think this is a good conference report. It is a reasonable \ncompromise between the two bills that were passed by the House and the \nSenate. We didn't get everything we wanted in the conference with the \nHouse; neither did the House get everything they wanted in conference \nwith our Senate conferees. But I think this is a fair conference \nreport. It reflects a commitment to support the President, to provide \nfunding that is needed for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIt is an urgent supplemental bill, and it ought to be passed today by \nthe Senate. I am confident that it will be.\n  I appreciate very much the assistance and the affirmative way members \nof our conference worked to ensure that we could get a conference \nreport that would be adopted by the Senate. I think we have \naccomplished that goal.\n  I am proud of the work that was done by the members of our staffs. \nThey worked very, very hard in the preparation of the conference report \nthat is before the Senate today. I especially want to thank our staff \ndirector, Keith Kennedy; Terry Sauvain, his counterpart on the \nDemocratic side; Chuck Keiffer on the Democratic side, who also worked \nvery hard; Charlie Houy, who has been a stalwart member of the staff of \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for many years; Rebecca Davies \non the Homeland Security Appropriations Committee; Sid Ashworth, the \nclerk of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator Stevens, \nchairman of that subcommittee and former chairman of the full \ncommittee, was enormously influential in this conference. I have been \nvery grateful for his support and assistance. I also thank Clayton \nHeil, counsel to our Senate Committee on Appropriations, who has been \nvery helpful as well. And there are others.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the assistance of other Senators on the \nfull Committee on Appropriations. We had strong support in the signing \nof the conference report. It has been a bipartisan achievement. It is \nnot a partisan bill, and we appreciate the fact that it is not.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time under the quorum be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in a time of war, nothing is more \nimportant than making sure that our fighting men and women have what \nthey need to do their jobs well. It is with our troops in mind that I \nwill vote in favor of this supplemental appropriations conference \nreport.\n  Having said that, I do have some major concerns about how this bill \nhas been put together and how the Congress has conducted its business \nwith respect to such emergency spending requests over the past several \nyears.\n  Thousands of brave Americans have been serving our country in war \nzones since shortly after that fateful day of September 11, 2001. But 4 \nyears later, the President and those of us in this Congress continue to \nrefuse to budget for these wartime expenses. Rather than incorporating \nthe costs of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the budget, \nthese important expenditures continue to be tagged as ``emergency \nspending.'' Emergency spending should be reserved, in my view, for \nunforeseen needs.\n  We know, however, that the need for additional funding for our \ncampaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan is something we should expect and be \nable to budget for. Unfortunately, this is not new for this Congress or \nfor the Bush administration. This is, I believe, the fourth consecutive \ntime that funding for military operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan \nhave been requested outside the regular budgeting and appropriations \nprocess.\n  By not taking into consideration the costs of these supplemental \nrequests, which we all know are coming, the President and the Congress \ncan more easily fudge the true nature of our Federal deficits and what \nour spending assumptions will be over the foreseeable future. In other \nwords, by keeping the spending out of the budget, the President and \nthis Congress can paint a fiscal picture that is, frankly, rosier than \nreality.\n  Contrast, if you will, what we are doing today with what we did \nduring the Vietnam conflict, the conflict I served in and I know others \nof us did as well. After one supplemental appropriations in 1966, \nPresident Johnson and later President Nixon included the cost of our \nmilitary operations in Vietnam in their annual budget requests, not in \nemergency supplemental after emergency supplemental. They requested \nthem in their annual budget request. That approach was the right \napproach. Whether people approved of the war in Vietnam and our \ninvolvement there, at least the approach of budgeting for it was \nappropriate. I believe we owe it to the American people, who are very \naware of the cost and nature of our operations, to be upfront about the \ntrue state of our country's finances.\n\n  To make a second point, there have been times in the last several \nyears when the House has passed a bill, the Senate has passed a bill, \nwe convene a conference committee, and the House and Senate, Democrats \nand Republicans, have a full and open opportunity to participate in \nthat conference committee.\n  Concerns have been raised. I think the chairman of this committee is, \nquite frankly, as fairminded a person as I know. It is a real joy to \nserve with him. I have said it to him privately and I will say it to \nhim publicly. But I have heard reports back from those who felt they \ndid not have opportunity extended to them to actually offer amendments \nin committee that they felt they had been assured they would have a \nchance to offer. That is a matter of concern to me and I think it would \nbe if the shoe were on the other foot.\n  Third subject, REAL ID. There was an amendment I alluded to offered \nby Senator Durbin that passed the Senate. It passed the Senate 99 to 0. \nThe amendment would have helped to compensate Federal employees who \nwere called to active duty who were making more money as a Federal \nemployee than they were after they had been activated to active duty. \nWe passed by a\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n\n99-to-0 vote a provision that said we should make up the shortfall in \nthose instances. That particular amendment that was passed by a 99-to-0 \nvote was left out of the conference report. I know other items were \nnever considered by the Senate. A prime example of that is the \ncontroversial REAL ID proposal somehow did find its way into the \nlegislation. As I recall, we never had a chance on the Senate floor to \neven discuss the REAL ID issue. It was not part of our supplemental \nbill. Yet when the final bill comes up, we are looking at 55 pages of \nnew immigration law that this body has never debated and which was \ninserted at the behest of the House Republican leadership.\n  I have a serious concern about whether these immigration provisions \nmake sense. I know some feel they do, but I have some real concerns. \nThe REAL ID Act, for example, would repeal the driver's license \nstandards framework we created last year in the Intelligence Reform \nAct, which is based on the recommendations made unanimously by the 9/11 \nCommission. In place of the 9/11 Commission framework, REAL ID would \ncreate an entirely new and expensive Federal standard for the issuance \nof driver's licenses but provide no funding to my State, Mississippi, \nSouth Carolina, or any other State, for that matter. As a former \nGovernor, I believe such unfunded mandates should not be considered \nlightly.\n  Furthermore, I have heard from a number of constituents in my own \nState who are concerned that the bill would make it more difficult for \nthose fleeing religious persecution to gain asylum, while allowing the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to waive all laws in order to build a \nfence along our borders.\n  In this post-9/11 world we know it is vital to ensure security not \nonly along our borders but also within our Nation. However, instead of \nthoroughly considering homeland security and immigration reform \nmeasures, the House has hastily tacked on legislation that could have \npotential negative consequences for the Latino and other immigrant \ncommunities in my State and across our country. I think we should have \nhad a proper debate to ensure that this legislation would actually \nprotect our Nation and make us more secure.\n  The last thing I want to mention deals with Israel and the peace \nprocess there. I returned from that part of the world about 5 weeks \nago, convinced there is an opening, a possibility, however difficult to \nachieve, that Israelis and Palestinians may find common ground; that \nthe Palestinians finally have a chance to end up with a homeland of \ntheir own and to live side by side in a separate state, in a \ngeographical area with the Israelis, who would have peaceful and secure \nborders and reasonable economic and diplomatic relations with their \nArab neighbors.\n  I came back and called Secretary Rice and said, we ought to be \nputting as much energy and time and attention into trying to forge a \nfinal compromise, a final peaceful resolution, in Israel. To the extent \nwe can do that between the Palestinians and the Israelis, we would \nprobably do more to reduce the ability of terrorists to raise money, to \nreduce the ability of terrorists to recruit new terrorists, to reduce \ntheir ability to convince people in some kind of unholy jihad to go out \nand blow themselves up and kill a lot of innocent people.\n  If the United States can somehow emerge from a peace process in the \nMiddle East and Israel and be seen as the honest broker in helping the \nIsraelis and the Palestinians get to a fair and peaceful permanent \nresolution, we would do more to set back the terrorists and end the war \non terrorism, to make us safer in this country, to make people safer in \nIsrael, in Palestinian-controlled areas, to make people safer in Iraq \nand Afghanistan as well.\n\n  When I was in Israel, I had the opportunity to travel to Ramallah. \nDuring that trip, we were behind a flatbed truck. As that truck went \nfrom Israeli-controlled territory into the West Bank, it had to go \nthrough a checkpoint. At the checkpoint, literally everything on the \nflatbed truck had to be removed and moved on to another flatbed truck \nin order to make sure there was not contraband, explosives or something \nthere that would represent an endangerment to other people.\n  One of the best ways to ensure that terrorists still have plenty of \nplaces from which to recruit new terrorists in that part of the world \nis to ensure that the rate of unemployment in Palestinian-controlled \nareas remains at about 50 percent. It is in our interest, it is in the \ninterest of the Israelis, it certainly is in the interest of \nPalestinians who want peace and a better life, for us to help bring \ndown the rate of unemployment.\n  The way to do that is not to have trucks go from one part of that \narea to stop at a checkpoint and offload on to a new truck. There has \nto be a free flow of people and a free flow of goods, a free flow of \ncommerce in that part of the world in order to help get the Palestinian \neconomy up and on its feet and to bring down unemployment.\n  My parents used to say to me, an idle mind is the devil's workshop. \nWell, people who do not have anything to do with their time are also \nprime for being recruited as terrorists. To the extent we can help \nbring down the unemployment rate in the Palestinian communities, we \nalso bring down the likelihood they are going to be recruited to become \nterrorists.\n  In the bill that passed the Senate, there is a provision for some \n$200 million to support Palestinian political, economic, and security \nreforms. As we have gone through the process in conference, roughly the \nsame amount of money has emerged, and it is not going directly to the \nPalestinian Authority. A portion of that, maybe $50 million, will end \nup going to the Government of Israel as they try to create high-\nsecurity checkpoints which would allow that truck I talked about \nearlier to go through a high-tech security checkpoint and not have to \nbe offloaded. It would enable people to move freely who are trying to \nget a job or going to a job from Palestinian areas to Israeli areas or \nvice versa, without being impeded from doing that, or having to spend \nhours trying to get through a checkpoint.\n  At the same time, we have the ability through the technology of today \nto stop the terrorists. People who are carrying contraband or \nexplosives or stuff that will enable them to hurt other people can be \nstopped at these checkpoints. There is money in this bill that would \nenable the Israelis to help build terminals, checkpoints for folks to \npass through, Palestinians or Israelis, for that matter, to reduce the \nlikelihood of terrorist incidents that will grow out of that movement \nof people, and to better ensure that goods and services in commerce can \nmove about freely. So that is a good thing.\n  There are some who will quarrel with whether the money should have \ngone directly to the Palestinian Authority or whether it is more \nappropriate to go through other organizations that we call NGOs. I am \nnot going to get into that argument.\n  I say to my friend from Mississippi, we may have a chance later on--\nmaybe in the Foreign Affairs appropriations bill or the foreign \noperations bill--to come back and revisit this issue and decide \nwhether, given the reforms that are being made in the Palestinian \nAuthority through reduced corruption, to tamp down on terrorism within \norganizations such as Hamas, we may have the opportunity to come back \nand decide whether to allocate some additional money later this year to \nstrengthen the position of President Abbas and to reward positive \nbehavior on his behalf and that of other Palestinians.\n  So those are points I wanted to make. I am going to recap them again \nvery briefly. First, the concern as we go forward for us to take as an \nexample the budgeting approach used by earlier administrations, \nDemocrat and Republican, President Johnson, President Nixon, at least \nin terms of funding the Vietnam war. After the first emergency \nsupplemental appropriation, fiscal year 1966, they said we are going to \nmake part of our regular budget request moneys to support that war \neffort. Again, we ought to do the same thing now going forward.\n  Second, I call on our Republican friends to remember the Golden Rule, \nto treat other people the way we want to be treated. As we go forward \nin these conference committees, to the extent we treat people fairly \nfrom our side, some day when we are in the majority--and some day we \nwill be--more\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\nlikely we will end up with a situation where the minority, in that case \nthe Republicans, will be treated fairly, too.\n  On REAL ID, it will be interesting to see what the States come up \nwith in response to these unfunded mandates. I don't like unfunded \nmandates. I never liked them as a Governor. I don't like it now. \nWhenever we in Washington figure out that we ought to tell the States \nand local governments how to spend the money, we don't provide the \nmoney. We tell them how to raise the money, or not raise the money, but \nwe do not provide an offset. That is a slippery slope. I think we are \non that slippery slope with respect to this REAL ID provision.\n  Finally, on the Palestinian peace initiative, I think it is important \nto promote investments in the Palestinian areas to get their economy \nmoving again, and it is important we help fund security measures that \nenable the free flow of commerce, of people and goods in and out of the \nPalestinian areas so they can reduce their unemployment rates and \nreduce the threats of terrorism.\n  With that having been said, I am going to stop here. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to speak as to how I am \ngoing to vote. Clearly, the necessity of funding for all of our troops \nrequires a ``yes'' vote on this legislation. I gladly do that. I do \nwant to express my concerns about this so-called REAL ID part that was \nput in in the dead of night, without the notification that was promised \nto the minority and without the informing of all the various Senators \nwho were part of the conference committee. This is not the way we \nshould be doing legislation. It ought to be in the full light of day. \nThat is why they refer to making legislation is like making sausage--\nyou don't know what all is in it.\n  With regard to this REAL ID Act, the concern that I have is that we \nare going to have an invasion of people's privacy without having \ncarefully considered it through committee hearings and through full \ndebate of the issue. For something that is as important to so many \nAmericans as a driver's license, we are going to start on the road of \nthe invasion of privacy. I do not think this is the way to establish \nwhat is, in effect, the first step for a national identification card. \nI don't think this is the way to do it, in the dead of night, by \nstealth and sleight of hand.\n  Second, I think Senators are going to get an earful if they are \nstarting to get the rumblings that I am getting from constituents in my \nState. When most people find out they have to haul out a birth \ncertificate when they go down to reestablish their driver's license, it \nis going to cause a great inconvenience, especially to the senior \ncitizens of this country. I think Senators are going to get an earful.\n  Third, I am quite concerned about the implication that this is going \nto have on the rights and protections of minorities. Is this the \nbeginning, portending certain discriminations because of minorities?\n  Obviously, this is a must-pass piece of legislation. It is funding \nthe war effort. It is funding our troops. We are all going to vote for \nit, and we will pass it. But we should not have something that is so \nimportant to the privacy rights of Americans added to a bill like this \nin this secretive way.\n  I wanted my comments made very clearly on the record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have something else as long as we are in a holding \npattern. What is the pleasure of the majority leader? Does he want to \ngo on and call for the vote or does he want to have some more time \nbefore the vote, in which I will speak on another subject?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have not talked to the Democratic leader, \nbut I think if we are about ready to vote, then what I might do is go \nahead and do my statement in the interest of time, unless there is \nsomething just burning that the distinguished Senator from Florida has \nto say. I will go ahead and do my statement and then--if the Democratic \nleader is available?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will tell the Senator that I have something \nthat is really burning because they are trying to drill for oil off the \ncoast of Florida. But I am going to yield to the majority leader and to \nhis wishes so he can expedite the process and the vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize for Senators having to wait for \nme. I want to begin by saying I support this legislation. I commend the \nwork of the managers of the bill, Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd. I \nunderstand how essential this bill is to our troops who are risking \ntheir lives and, of course, to the tsunami victims who are struggling \nto rebuild their lives.\n  The conference report, though, comes up short on two issues: Iraq \nand, of course, immigration--short of what the world rightly expects \nfrom the most free nation in the world, and short of what Americans \nshould expect from their elected leaders is what is written all over \nthis conference report.\n  Starting with Iraq, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nrecently said that the insurgency is as strong today as it was a year \nago. The recent upsurge in violence and unrest in Iraq seems to bear \nout that remarkable and very troubling conclusion. Yet the \nadministration acts as if the situation in Iraq is essentially under \ncontrol and the remaining difficulties are Iraq's problems.\n  The unfortunate truth seems to be that more than 2 years after \nPresident Bush declared the end of major combat operations--remember \n``mission accomplished''--Iraq has a limited capacity to defend itself \nor govern itself.\n  Even worse, the administration has no real plan to help Iraq acquire \nthat capacity. As much as the President may want to dump Iraq's \nproblems on the new Iraqi Government, his administration has a \nresponsibility to our troops and the Iraqi people to help address these \nproblems and to inform Congress how he plans to do so.\n  I would underscore that this supplemental appropriations bill should \nnot have had to come before this body at this time. It should have been \nin our regular budget. This war is ongoing. There is no reason to do it \nin this way.\n  I have supported and the Senate passed an amendment crafted by \nSenators Durbin, Levin, and Kennedy requiring the administration to \ninform us of its efforts and plans for securing and stabilizing Iraq. \nUnfortunately, Republican conferees dropped the important amendment \nfrom the text of this bill.\n  As troubled as I am by the Republican majority's actions on Iraq, I \nam perhaps more disturbed by what they decided to do on immigration, \nand how they went about it.\n  Republicans tacked the so-called REAL ID immigration legislation onto \nthis emergency supplemental that is to provide funding for our troops. \nREAL ID imposes dramatic new burdens on the States and substantially \nalters the immigration and asylum laws in ways that this Nation may \nsoon come to regret the action taken by this body.\n  For the House to self-righteously say that on appropriations bills \nthey will allow no authorizing legislation, people can always waive \nthis REAL ID--this is the mother of all authorizing legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n  This REAL ID Act makes reckless and unwise changes to our laws with \nrespect to the environment, refugees, judicial review and, most of all, \nStates rights. It is essentially anti-immigrant legislation couched in \nthe language of antiterrorism. The Wall Street Journal, not the bastion \nof the so-called liberal press, said the changes made by REAL ID ``have \nlong occupied the wish list of anti-immigration lawmakers and \nactivists.'' That is the Wall Street Journal.\n  REAL ID will make it much more difficult for individuals fleeing \npersecution to seek asylum in the United States, will sharply reduce \nthe ability of the Federal courts to rein in overzealous or ill-willed \nadministration officials, and will give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity unprecedented authority to waive environmental and other laws.\n  REAL ID could compromise the privacy of American citizens, create \nlong\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\nlines at local DMVs, and make it harder for States and the Federal \nGovernment to keep track of who is in our country. In short, REAL ID \nmay make us less rather than more safe.\n  As troubling as what the majority did on immigration is the way they \nwent about it. Republicans tacked on REAL ID knowing full well \nimmigration issues had nothing to do, as I have said before, with the \nunderlying legislation and that REAL ID had never, ever been considered \nin the Senate, either in the Judiciary Committee, the committee of \njurisdiction, I believe, or on the Senate floor.\n  Compounding matters, House and Senate Republican conferees went \nbehind closed doors without Democrats and included a modified version \nof REAL ID.\n  What so troubles me is that the Republicans have the votes. They are \nin the majority. They had the majority in the conference. But they \nrefused to have up-or-down votes so the public could see what they were \ndoing. They had the ability to turn down every amendment we offered, \nbut they were unwilling to do that.\n  They rejected a bipartisan plea to give REAL ID and other immigration \nissues the time and attention they deserved, and limited opportunities \nfor opponents of REAL ID to offer motions to strike or change what they \nagreed to.\n  As a result of the Republicans' decision to incorporate REAL ID and \ntheir abuse of the process, most Democratic conferees either refused to \nsign the conference report or did so while taking strong exception to \nthe REAL ID provision.\n  I am also disappointed about the White House's role in this matter. \nFor years now, the administration has been talking about the need to \nreform immigration laws. Remember the big trip President Bush made, \nwhen he was first elected, to meet with President Fox in Mexico? They \nhave been talking about the need for reform, so law-abiding, hard-\nworking immigrants can find work in this country, help our economy \ngrow, and support their families here and back, mostly, in Mexico. \nSince this legislation will hurt hundreds of thousands of the very \npeople the administration professes to be concerned about, I would have \nexpected the President to oppose it. Unfortunately, he chose not to do \nso.\n  The best thing we could do for our security would be to enact \ncomprehensive and effective immigration reform so we can gain control \nonce again over our borders and focus our limited resources on \nterrorists and criminals.\n  Senator Frist has indicated he is willing to set aside time for a \nseparate debate about immigration later this year, and I know he will \nfollow through on that. That is what he said he would do. The Senate \nand the American people deserve time to consider this issue and time to \nrevisit many of this legislation's most problematic provisions.\n  Finally, I think our ability to succeed in Iraq should have received \nmuch greater attention in this bill, and immigration should have been \ndealt with more thoughtfully and thoroughly in a subsequent legislative \nvehicle. Our troops and taxpayers are expecting solutions and \nleadership from the President and the Congress. The world is expecting \nthis Nation to live up to some of the lofty immigration rhetoric \nespoused by the administration early on. I regret the majority acted in \nthis fashion. I look forward to opportunities to revisit these unwise \ndecisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on the \nPresident's war and tsunami supplemental request. I take this \nopportunity to thank Chairman Thad Cochran, as well as Senator Byrd, \nfor their leadership on behalf of our men and women in uniform. This is \none of the first major appropriations for Senator Cochran under his \nchairmanship of the full committee, and I do congratulate him for a job \nsuperbly done. I also thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye. I am \nconfident we have a bill that will shortly be overwhelmingly supported \non both sides of the aisle.\n  The legislation before us is absolutely critical to winning the war \non terror. It provides $75.9 billion in support of our troops who are \nout in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan courageously hunting down the \nenemy, helping rebuild these countries, and spreading freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  We are indebted to our soldiers, and this legislation reflects our \ndeep commitment to their readiness, to their safety, to their families' \nwell-being.\n  This weekend, U.S. troops launched a major counterinsurgency \noffensive in western Iraq near the Syrian border. This region has \nbecome an infamous smuggling route and sanctuary for foreign jihadists. \nSo far, our troops have killed over 100 of the terrorists, and they \ncontinue to press the enemy back.\n  Meanwhile, this weekend, our military announced the capture of a top \nZarqawi associate, Amar Zubaydi. He was apprehended in a raid on his \nhome last Thursday. Zubaydi is an extremely dangerous man. He is \nbelieved responsible for multiple car bombings across Baghdad, as well \nas the attack on the Abu Ghraib prison last month which wounded 44 U.S. \ntroops and 13 detainees. Authorities also discovered he was planning \nthe assassination of a top Iraqi Government official.\n  The good news is he is now in custody where he can no longer wreak \nhis havoc. Military sources tell us Zubaydi's capture has provided \ninvaluable insights into the Zarqawi wing of the al-Qaida network.\n  This arrest, along with the capture of Ghassan Amin in late April and \nAbu Farraj al-Libbi in Pakistan last week, further tightens the noose. \nIndeed, we intercepted a note by one of their colleagues complaining of \nthe group's low morale.\n  Osama bin Laden and al-Zarqawi will be brought to justice, just as \nSaddam and his henchmen now sit in prison. Our brave men and women in \nuniform and their colleagues across the U.S. Government are risking \ntheir lives and working hard every day to bring that moment ever \ncloser.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to pass the supplemental swiftly so we can \nget this support to our military men and women in the field--and also, \nI should add, to the victims of the December tsunami tragedy. The war \nsupplemental includes nearly $880 million in relief funds to help \npeople in countries devastated by that deadly wave.\n  Furthermore, it includes nearly $630 million to increase security at \nour borders by hiring 500 new border agents and tightening our driver's \nlicense ID requirements.\n  America is leading the war on terror, and we are making great \nprogress. As this supplemental appropriations demonstrates, we are a \nstrong Nation, and we are a compassionate Nation.\n  I look forward to an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote on this critical \nlegislation in a few moments. Our troops and our fellow citizens are \ndepending on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we yield back the time on our side.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to follow the Senator from Alabama, after he completes his \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak in support of the \nFederal Public Transportation Act of 2005. We know it as the \nTransportation bill. This bill was marked up in the committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on March 17 and reported out with a \nunanimous vote.\n  I am proud of this legislation which was crafted on a bipartisan \nbasis with cooperation from the distinguished Senator from Maryland, \nMr. Sarbanes, the committee's ranking member and former chairman.\n  The Federal Public Transportation Act of 2005 provides record growth \nfor public transportation. The funding authorized in this bill will \nprovide for significant improvements to and expansion of the Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. I am pleased to be working with my \ncolleagues, Chairman Inhofe from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, and Chairman Stevens from the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee.\n  I want to thank my friends from the Finance Committee, Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, for working so diligently to identify additional \nmoney for public transportation. Thanks to their efforts the Banking \nCommittee's transit title provides record growth for transportation, \n$53.8 billion overhis is an increase in the share of transit funding \nover TEA-21 and I am confident that this money will be helpful in \nmeeting surface transportation needs across the country.\n  Public transportation services are often the only form of \ntransportation available to many citizens. These services provide \nmobility to the millions of Americans who cannot, for various reasons, \nuse an automobile. More than 80 million Americans cannot drive or do \nnot have access to a car.\n  Further, senior citizens are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. \npopulation. Many of them require access to public transportation in \norder to maintain their independence and to access vital healthcare \nservices.\n  Today, the American public transportation industry consists of nearly \n6,000 transit systems in both urban and rural areas. These \ntransportation agencies operate a diverse array of vehicles, including \nsubways, buses, light rail, commuter railroads, ferries, vans, cable \ncars, aerial tramways, and taxis.\n  According to the Texas Transportation Institute's 2005 Urban Mobility \nReport, congestion costs over $63 billion, more than 3.7 billion hours \nof delay and 2.3 billion gallons of excess fuel annually. The average \ndriver loses more than a week of work each year sitting in gridlock. \nThe same report finds that without public transportation, there would \nbe 1 billion more hours of delay. The report also finds that public \ntransportation reduces the cost of congestion by about $20 billion per \nyear.\n  Public transportation investments help create employment and sustain \neconomic health. The Department of Transportation has estimated that \nfor every $1 billion in Federal highway and transit investment, 47,500 \njobs are created or sustained.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, expired \non September 30, 2003, and has temporarily been extended through May \n31, 2005. The delay in providing a long-term authorization has had a \nsignificant impact on State and local governments which have been \nunable to develop long-term programs for funding. Public transportation \nrepresents an important part of the Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure, which by its nature, requires long-term planning and \nproject development. Delays in funding have resulted in project delays \nwhich ultimately increase costs and postpone the benefits which \nprojects are designed to produce. The impact is particularly \nsignificant in States with short construction seasons since planning \nmust be done well in advance of contracting for construction. \nTherefore, the committee has responded and taken action to reauthorize \nthe public transportation title of TEA-21 in order to continue the \nFederal Government's critical role in public transit programs.\n  This bill accomplishes three important policy goals. It creates \nfunding flexibility, increases accountability, and improves the \nperformance and efficiency of the transit programs in the United \nStates.\n  The bill creates several new formulas to better address growing \ntransit needs. A ``rural low density'' formula is created to allow for \ntransit services in sparsely populated areas where employment centers \nand health care are great distances apart. A ``growing states'' formula \nis created to allow communities with populations projected to grow \nsignificantly in the coming years to put in place needed transportation \ninfrastructure. A ``transit intensive cities'' formula is created to \naddress the needs of small communities where the level of transit \nservice exceeds what their population-based formula would provide for. \nFinally, our bill also creates a ``high density'' formula to provide \nadditional funding for States with transit needs that are particularly \ngreat because they have transit systems in extremely urban areas with \nhigh utilization rates.\n  The bill increases the accountability within the transit program. It \nrewards transit agencies which deliver projects that are on time, on \nbudget, and provide the benefits that they promised. Further, this bill \nallows communities to consider more cost-effective, flexible solutions \nto their transportation needs by opening up eligibility within the New \nStarts program to non-fixed guideway projects seeking less than $75 \nmillion in New Starts funds. With this change, other solutions can be \nfostered, such as bus rapid transit, which is more flexible than rail \nat a fraction of the cost.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to improve the performance and efficiency of \ntransit\n\n[[Page S4850]]\n\nsystems nationwide. It provides incentives for the coordination of \nhuman service transportation activities in order to eliminate \nduplication and overlap. It increases the focus on safety and security \nneeds within transit systems to help insulate them against terrorist \nattacks. It also enhances the role of the private sector in providing \npublic transportation in an effort to reduce cost and to improve \nservice.\n  The Federal Public Transportation Act is very good legislation. The \nfunding made available by this bill and the policy initiatives \ncontained in the bill will dramatically improve the public \ntransportation program to help Americans with their mobility needs in \nboth urban and rural areas nationwide.\n  I commend this bill to the Senate and ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my able and distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama, the chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs Committee, in strong support of the Federal Public \nTransportation Act of 2005, which has been incorporated into the \npending amendment which was offered yesterday by Senator Inhofe, the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  The Federal Public Transportation Act was reported out by the Banking \nCommittee earlier this year, and, I might add, by a unanimous voice \nvote. Moreover, although the funding level provided in this bill is \nlower than in the one we passed last year, the program structure and \npolicy decisions reflected in this bill are almost identical to those \nincluded in S. 1072, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient \nTransportation Act, SAFETEA, which passed the Senate last year with \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  At the very outset, I express my appreciation to Chairman Shelby who \nworked tirelessly on the development of this legislation last year, \nreaching across the aisle in a cooperative manner to develop a transit \nbill that will begin to address the urgent needs faced by communities \nall across the country.\n  I also want to acknowledge the leadership of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords; \nand the Finance Committee Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus, \nfor their efforts to move this very important bill forward.\n  As has already been observed in this debate, SAFETEA did not emerge \nfrom conference last year, regrettably, due in large part to the \nunwillingness of the administration to support the kind of significant \ninvestment needed to meet our pressing transit and highway needs. As a \nresult, we have had to pass six short-term extensions of the previous \ntransportation legislation, TEA-21. The uncertainty inherent in these \nshort-term extensions hinders our State and local partners in their \nefforts to meet the daily challenges of maintaining our transportation \ninfrastructure and planning for improvements.\n  I want to express my appreciation to a number of colleagues who \nworked to provide additional resources for transportation beyond what \nwas reported out by the various committees earlier this year. A higher \nlevel of investment is essential if we are to keep up with the \nincreasing demand along our entire transportation network.\n  I want to say a few words about the transit title, which was \nsupported by every member of the Banking Committee. Over the last \nseveral years, the Banking Committee and its Housing and Transportation \nSubcommittee, under the leadership first of Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland and then more recently of Senator Allard of Colorado, has held a \nseries of hearings on the Federal transit program and its contribution \nto reducing congestion, strengthening our national economy, and \nimproving our quality of life.\n  Over the course of those hearings, we heard testimony from dozens of \nwitnesses, including Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, Federal \nTransit Administrator Jenna Dorn, representatives of transit agencies \nfrom around the country, mayors, business and labor leaders, \nenvironmentalists, economic development experts, and transit riders \nthemselves. Virtually all of the witnesses agreed that the investment \nthat had been made under TEA-21 contributed to a renaissance for \ntransit in this country. In fact, transit ridership is up 23 percent \nsince 1995, and is still increasing, even faster than the growth in \nhighway use.\n  Transit plays a critical role in our efforts to combat congestion. My \nable colleague, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Shelby, made \nreference to a study released just this week by the Texas \nTransportation Institute, talking about the tremendous cost to the \nNation in lost time and wasted fuel because of congestion--people \nsimply stuck in traffic.\n  We heard testimony at our hearings about many other important \nbenefits of transit as well. For example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \ntestified that $1 billion of capital investment in transit creates \nalmost 50,000 jobs. Moreover, the economic development benefits of \ntransit are becoming more and more apparent as new systems come into \nservice. For example, we heard testimony from one of the county \ncommissioners in Dallas that over $1 billion had been invested in \nprivate development along Dallas's existing and future light rail \nlines, raising nearby property values and supporting thousands of jobs.\n  We heard from a representative of BellSouth that his company had \ndecided to relocate almost 10,000 employees from scattered sites in \nsuburban Atlanta to three downtown buildings near the MARTA rail \nstations because, as he put it, transit ``saves employees time. It \nsaves employees money. It saves wear and tear on the employees' \nspirit.''\n  Transit benefits the economy in other ways as well. For example, \ntransit investments in one community can have repercussions in many \nareas around the country. The president of the American Public \nTransportation Association, Bill Millar, who has testified before the \nSenate on a number of occasions, pointed out that when one locality \nbuilds a rail system or develops its bus system, the manufacturing or \nthe assembly of those rail cars and buses may well be done in a \ndifferent jurisdiction. So one has to keep in mind when considering the \neconomic benefits of transit, it is not only the area that is upgrading \nits transit system that benefits. That area will invariably spend its \nmoney on a whole range of supplies and services which are produced \nelsewhere in the country. As Mr. Millar said:\n\n       While the Federal money would appear to be going one place, \n     the impact of that money tends to go very far and wide.\n\n  Of course, transit is about more than our economic life. It is also \nabout our quality of life. During our hearings, we heard a great deal \nabout the importance of transit to our senior citizens, our young \npeople, the disabled, and others who rely on transit for their daily \nmobility needs. Several of our witnesses observed that the increased \ninvestment in transit and paratransit services under the previous bill \nprovided the crucial link between home and a job, school, or a doctor's \noffice, for millions of people who otherwise might not have been able \nto participate fully in the life of their community. Further, we saw \nafter 9/11 how transit can be an important lifeline in other respects, \nas well. We had very moving testimony during our hearings about the \nefforts made by transit operators on that day to move tens of thousands \nof people quickly and safely out of our city centers.\n  As a result of transit's many benefits, the demand for transit is \ncontinuing to increase all across the Nation. Small towns, rural areas, \nsuburban jurisdictions, and large cities, are all struggling to keep up \nwith the need to provide safe and reliable transit service for their \ncitizens. The Department of Transportation has estimated that very \nsignificant sums will be needed to maintain the condition and \nperformance of transit systems across the country.\n  The transit title authorizes $53.8 billion in transit investment. I \nam frank to say I believe that the transit needs of the nation would \njustify even more, but I am pleased to say that under this bill transit \nwill see a significant increase in funding over TEA-21. A strong \ntransit program is essential to our efforts to improve our citizens' \nmobility and strengthen our national economy.\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\n  I want to take just a moment or two to highlight some of the most \nimportant features of the amendment before us with respect to transit.\n  The amendment provides for growth in both the urban and rural formula \nprogram, with added emphasis placed on the rural program. The committee \nwas sensitive to the needs of the rural areas of our country, and the \nrural program will see significant growth in order to help States with \nlarge rural areas provide the services their residents need.\n  The bill also provides increased funding in the Fixed Guideway \nModernization Program. This funding is very important to helping cities \nwith older rail systems, which in some cases were built almost a \ncentury ago, make the investments needed to preserve those highly \nsuccessful systems, which literally move millions of people every \nworking day.\n  The New Starts program, which helps communities make their first \nmajor investment in transit as well as expand existing systems, also \ngrows under this bill. The New Starts program will enable communities \nto address their mobility and development needs with transit investment \nand to gain the benefits of transit that exist elsewhere in the \ncountry.\n  Furthermore, the amendment maintains the existing 80 percent Federal \nmatch on new starts transit projects, and thus continues the parity \nthat has existed between the local match requirement for highway and \ntransit projects. This is a very important factor in ensuring that the \ninvestment decision at the local level is not weighted in one direction \nor the other because of a more favorable local match requirement. Mayor \nMcCory of Charlotte, NC, made this point in one of our hearings when he \nobserved that:\n\n       There's a strong need to keep the program 80-20, as we do \n     for other forms of transportation, including roads. That does \n     send a strong message that transit is as important as our \n     road network.\n\n  The bill makes a significant change in the new starts program by \nallowing new starts funding to be used for the first time to fund \ntransit projects that do not operate along a fixed guideway, as long as \nthe project is seeking less than $75 million in Federal funds. There \nare only a few examples of such projects currently operating in the \nNation, and I hope to work with the Federal Transit Administration to \nensure that the FTA develops an appropriate quantitative methodology \nfor evaluating the costs and benefits of such projects, particularly as \nthey relate to land use and economic development impacts.\n  As we begin to experiment with different forms of transit service, we \nmust be careful not to adversely impact FTA's highly competitive and \nsuccessful process for moving projects through the New Starts Program.\n  While the bill preserves the general structure of TEA-21, several new \nformulas are included to target transit funds more directly to those \nStates and cities with extraordinary transportation needs. The bill \nincludes a new growth and density formula. The growth portion will \ndistribute funds to all States based on their expected future \npopulation, and the density portion will provide funding to those \nStates whose populations are above a certain density threshold.\n  The bill also includes an incentive tier to reward small transit-\nintensive cities, those cities with a population between 50,000 and \n200,000 which provide higher than average amounts of transit service. \nThe funds distributed under these new formulas will help communities \naddress their unique transportation needs.\n  The bill includes a requirement that metropolitan planning \norganizations development a public participation plan to ensure that \npublic transportation employees, affected community members, users of \npublic transportation, freight shippers, private sector providers--all \nthe interested parties concerned about the transportation \ninfrastructure--have an opportunity to participate in the \ntransportation plan approval process.\n  Transportation investments are among the most important decisions \nmade at the local level. I firmly believe all interested parties should \nhave an opportunity to contribute to this process. Our transportation \ninfrastructure is central to making our economy and, indeed, our \nsociety work day to day. That is why this is such a critical and \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the legislation includes a new Transit in \nParks Program to help national parks and other public lands find \nalternative transportation solutions to the traffic problems they are \nnow facing. This is a program the administration supports. It has very \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate. It is an effort to address the \nproblem of overcrowding that has come with increased visitation to our \nnational parks and other public lands. In some cases people must wait \nin long lines to get into a national park, or they get to the entrance \nand find they are turned back because the park's roads and parking lots \nare at capacity.\n  TEA-21 required the Department of Transportation to conduct a study \nof alternative transportation needs in our national parks and other \npublic lands, and that study confirmed that the parks are ready and \nwilling to develop transit alternatives. This legislation will help the \nparks make investments in traditional public transit, such as shuttle \nbuses or trolleys, or other types of public transportation appropriate \nto the park setting, such as waterborne transportation or bicycle and \npedestrian facilities.\n  In closing, let me note that there are a number of other provisions \nin the legislation that modify previous aspects of the transit \nprograms, but for the most part the committee's intention was not to \nenact major changes to a program that has worked well.\n  The committee put a great deal of effort into developing a package \nthat would recognize the various types of transit needs across the \nNation. Of course, as with any program with limited resources, no one \ngets as much as they would like. But given the framework within which \nthe committee had to work, I think we have responded fairly and \nrationally to the needs that have been expressed to us. All in all, I \nthink this is a balanced package, which I am pleased to commend to my \ncolleagues.\n  This bill provides essential support to our local and State partners \nin their efforts to combat congestion and pollution and to ensure that \ntheir citizens can access safe and reliable transit services. It is no \nexaggeration to say this is essential legislation for the future \nstrength and vitality of our economy and of our society, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, I would like to have the Senator add to his unanimous \nconsent request that following his remarks we return to the bill H.R. \n3, as amended, for consideration of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to discuss a transportation bill \nthat has been several years and several congressional sessions in the \nmaking. For a very long time now, Senator Baucus and I have worked with \nthe various authorizing committees to prudently fund the highway and \ntransit programs. Of course, this has not been an easy process. But \nlast year, we found a way to fund the programs in a way that enabled \nevery State of the Union to bring home more money for needed \ntransportation, particularly for highways. Let me repeat that because \nit is important. Every Member of the Senate, including those who \ncomplained about our funding mechanism, did better under our plan last \nyear.\n  This year we face a different set of challenges. There are conflicts \nthat arose in last year's conference that are still with us. The \nconflicts spring from three principles that have proven very difficult \nto reconcile. I will lay out those conflicts.\n  The first principle is to get a highway bill that is an improvement \nover current policy. That is where overwhelming majorities are in both \nthe\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\nHouse and the Senate. We need adequate funding for our transportation \ninfrastructure. We need to do our best to meet the job, economic \ndevelopment, and transportation needs of the country. The authorizers \nsay improved policy requires more trust fund money.\n  The second principle from conference is deficit reduction. President \nBush has rightly put deficit reduction as a key objective in general \nand applied it to the highway program in particular. Toward that end, \nthe administration has pegged spending at $284 billion in spending over \nthe applicable period.\n  In conference, the House brought forward a third principle. They made \nit clear that they would not accept the use of general fund offsets to \nprevent deficit increases because of the highway bill.\n  Over the last several years it has been frustrating to see some \nMembers advance all these principles without acknowledging the inherent \nconflict. They say: Senator Grassley, we need more money for my State \nfor roads or transit. At the same time, these same Members would say: \nSenator Grassley, why are you paying for it in this way or that way?\n  So to any complainers, I issue the challenge that I issued last year: \nIf you complain about the additional money that the Finance Committee \nhas found for your State, explain to me how you would do it \ndifferently. Would you forgo that money for your State? If you have an \nalternative, explain to me how you would find the votes for your method \nof financing. I issued that challenge last year, and somehow I didn't \nget any takers. I expect complaints again this year despite the smaller \nnumbers involved and don't expect anyone to take me up on the \nchallenge.\n  Whether folks want to admit it, as we begin floor debate and \nconference on this bill, it will become increasingly apparent that \nthese three principles conflict. As one who has tried and continues to \ntry to enact a highway bill into law, I have worked very hard to grow \ntrust fund revenues in a way that doesn't increase the deficit or \nrequire general fund offsets. While we were able to devise a floor \namendment that grows the trust fund without increasing the deficit, we \nwere not able to do so without the use of any general fund offsets. We \ndid get 40 percent of the way there using additional fuel fraud \ncompliance measures. We are filling in most of the $5 billion gap with \na small version of the refund proposal which the administration \nincluded in its fiscal year 2006 budget.\n  Finance Committee investigations reveal that many of the refunds are \nbased in fraud, and these steps will contribute to our efforts to close \nthe tax gap. A very small amount of that gap is also bridged by changes \nto gas guzzler tax administration. We are still awaiting progress on \nadditional fuel fraud measures and loophole closures and plan to fill \nin the $5 billion gap in conference. In the meantime, we are using \nother general fund offsets to do that.\n  Almost none of these general fund offsets are new, as nearly all were \nincluded in the Senate-passed JOBS bill last year. Two notable \nprovisions have been added. One of those provisions is intended to \nimprove the administration of the Internal Revenue Service's offer-in-\ncompromise program. The second involves a leasing tax shelter abuse in \nthe transportation sector that we refer to by the acronym SILOs. These \nwere the schemes that allowed big corporations to claim tax deductions \nfor bridges, pipelines, and subways that are paid for with taxpayer \ndollars but with no risk for the leasing company.\n  Congress passed the JOBS bill last fall and outlawed these SILOs but \nnot without concessions to the interests of shelter promoters. Under \nthat bill, SILO shelter promoters got more than a year to get their \ndeals-in-process approved by the Department of Transportation. And, of \ncourse, I believe that is an outrage. We exerted great effort in \nCongress to shut down this abuse, but the transition relief in the JOBS \nbill is a sop to shelter promoters and an insult to American taxpayers. \nThis amendment will end that abuse now, not a year from now.\n\n  In committee, we marked up in alignment with the President's $284 \nbillion figure. That was the deal the authorizing committees and this \ncommittee made with Leader Frist to get the bill to the floor. In our \nFinance Committee markup, I indicated my intent to work on the floor \nwith Senator Baucus, the Senate leadership, and authorizers to grow the \ntrust fund revenues in a manner that does not negatively impact the \ndeficit. I believe we have incorporated a Finance Committee amendment \nthat does just that.\n  I also understand and agree with the House position that we should \nnot mix general fund offsets and trust fund resources. To that end, I \nwant the Senate to know that I commit to working further so that no \ngeneral fund offsets are required to maintain a sufficient trust fund \nfor the conference agreement.\n  At the markup, I also asked and I continue to ask the administration \nto shift its focus away from the top-line $284 billion number and \ntoward the principle of deficit reduction. The bill before the Senate, \nincluding our recently added amendment to grow trust fund receipts, is \npaid for in its entirety principally by cracking down abuse and closing \nloopholes. In fact, this bill, as currently drafted, actually \ncontributes positively and substantially towards deficit reduction.\n  I reemphasize that an exclusive focus on the top-line spending number \nviewed outside of a deficit reduction context will only lead to a \nrepeat of last fall's conference gridlock. Gridlock in conference won't \nresolve the gridlock on our Nation's highways. So I ask all the key \nplayers at each end of Pennsylvania Avenue to focus on main street and \nwork toward a fiscally responsible highway bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to make one comment. We are on the \nbill, and I compliment Senators Grassley and Baucus for the great work \nthey have done. We have put together a good bill, and it is necessary \nto go out to the proper committee, the Finance Committee, to see what \nwe can do to enhance this bill and make it a little bit more robust. \nThey have done a great job, and I compliment them on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join in offering the \nsubstitute amendment to this bill. This bill is called SAFETEA. It \nculminates many months of hard work. I commend the chairman, Chairman \nInhofe, and Senator Bond, chairman of the transportation subcommittee, \nand especially the chairman and ranking member of the full committee, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Jeffords, for their hard work.\n  I especially thank my good friend, Senator Grassley. He is a good \nman. He is good to work with. He is pragmatic, practical, he cares, he \nwants good solutions, and he wants to advance the ball. The people of \nIowa are very lucky to have him as their Senator. Senator Harkin is \nanother great Senator from Iowa, but I particularly enjoy working with \nSenator Grassley. We have a strong working relationship and it means a \nlot to me personally.\n  This legislation is critical for Montana and also for the country as \na whole. I cannot think of any other legislation that would have such a \nsubstantial effect on our Nation's economy. The current transportation \nprogram expired in September 2003. Since then, regrettably, Congress \nhas had to enact extensions. We could not come up with a solid 6-year \nbill. We have had six extensions to the highway program--the most \nextensions in the history of the program.\n  Frankly, in addition to all of the substantive good provisions of the \nbill, it is very important to enact a full 5-year bill rather than \ngoing down the road with more and more extensions. The current \nextension expires at the end of this month, about 3 weeks from now. If \nwe fail to meet the deadline, the program lapses and States will no \nlonger receive their funds. We should not let that happen. We can and \nshould do our work right away. We have already seen an entire \nconstruction season go by without a long-term bill. In Montana, we have \na very short construction season. Winter weather prevents us from \nworking on our roads all year long. We cannot afford any more delays.\n  Because Congress has not acted, States are letting fewer bids; it is \nthat simple. Because Congress has not acted, contractors, suppliers, \nand other construction businesses have less business. Transportation \nprojects are very complex. Any bumps along the way only compound them \nover time.\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\n  Another extension is not a solution. We need to act; we need to act \nright away. We should act on this bill and head to conference. By \napproving the substitute amendment and adding funding to the bill, we \ncan speed the process to complete the conference.\n  While I supported reporting this bill out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee because of a commitment made by others to the \nRepublican leader, it was with the firm understanding I would offer an \namendment to make substantial improvements to this bill, working in \nconjunction with other Senators.\n  That is why we are here today offering this important amendment, \nwhich is part of the underlying bill, to increase the authorization and \nspending levels in this bill.\n  Chairman Grassley and I have been working for 3 years to develop the \nfinancing for the Transportation bill. It is not a simple task. I am \npleased to say the chairman and I have proposed a package that does \nseveral things.\n  First, we shore up the highway trust fund to ensure solvency during \nthe life of this bill by providing over $7 billion in additional \nreceipts during the authorization period.\n  Second, using these receipts, we increase investments in this \nNation's infrastructure by $8.9 billion for the highway program and \n$2.3 billion for the transit program.\n  Third, we fully pay for the additional highway spending in this \namendment. Repeating that, we fully pay for highway spending in this \namendment. We do so in a responsible manner.\n  Let me take a couple moments to comment on the misperceptions and, \nfrankly, outright distortions that I have heard about this amendment.\n  First, we do not raise gas taxes in this amendment. I will repeat \nthat. We do not raise gasoline taxes.\n  We can increase resources to the highway trust fund without raising \ntaxes. It is that simple. Don't be fooled by the hysteria of some who \nflatout oppose more funding for transportation and will say almost \nanything to defeat our efforts.\n  I have also heard people say this amendment transfers general fund \nmoney to the highway trust fund. That, too, mischaracterizes our \nproposal.\n  The other day, Secretary of Transportation Mineta made a very \ninteresting statement. When he described our amendment to raise the \ninvestment in transportation, he said: ``There is a dark cloud looming \non the horizon.''\n  But when his own Department estimated the unmet transportation needs \nin this country, the Transportation Department said there are more than \n$325 billion in unmet needs. That figure grows each and every day that \nwe forego maintenance of the transportation system.\n\n  This amendment is no dark cloud. Rather, adopting this amendment will \npart the clouds that others have created over this bill and allow the \nsun to shine on this bill.\n  Let me lay out the facts.\n  The President's 2006 budget submission increased the funding proposed \nfor this bill. While I believe that those levels are still artificially \nlow, I want to acknowledge that effort.\n  Two efforts by the Finance Committee made possible the President's \nincreased funding in its February budget. The administration's reliance \non these developments then makes its criticism of this amendment now \nring hollow.\n  The first reason the President was able to increase his highway \nfunding request was the Finance Committee's work last year on fuel \nfraud and the ethanol credit.\n  The President's budget proposal depends on the increased dollars from \nthe fuel fraud provisions and the volumetric ethanol credit that \nCongress enacted as part of the JOBS Act last year.\n  Over the years, the Senate spent many hours debating the merits of \nethanol incentives. I believe the incentives are good agricultural \npolicy and good energy policy.\n  But whether you favor the incentives or not, last year, Congress \nbroadly agreed that the highway trust fund should not bear the burden \nof that subsidy. The volumetric ethanol tax credit in the JOBS bill \neliminated that problem, and we do so here again today.\n  The Finance Committee also developed proposals to reduce fuel tax \nevasion. We tightened the rules for fuel transfers and increased \npenalties for noncompliance with the tax laws.\n  When Senator Grassley and I first introduced the ethanol changes and \nfuel fraud provisions, we heard some of the same comments and \ncriticisms we hear today.\n  Yet enactment of these provisions has added more than $17 billion to \nthe highway trust fund for the years 2005 through 2009. The President \nand the House could not have funded their current $284 billion \nproposals without those dollars.\n  Second, the President's 2006 budget submission also included what \nsome call ``the refund proposal.'' This provision relates to the amount \ncurrently refunded to States, cities, and schools that are exempt from \npaying the Federal gas tax.\n  States, cities, and schools do not pay the Federal fuel tax. They are \nexempt. That is appropriate. They should be. Right now, when a State, \ncity, or school fills its vehicle with taxed fuel, the organization is \nentitled to get a refund of the Federal excise tax. They get that \nrefund.\n  Currently, the general fund pays that refund. Then the highway trust \nfund repays the general fund. That doesn't make sense.\n  All we are saying in this amendment is that the highway trust fund \nshould not have to reimburse the general fund for the amount of the \nrefund. It is that simple. Those are vehicles traveling on the \nhighways. We do not raise taxes on State and local governments, not one \npenny.\n  Vehicles used by State and local governments still cause the same \nwear and tear on our roads as vehicles owned by entities that pay \nFederal gas taxes. So the highway trust fund should not have to bear \nthe burden of the exemption.\n  Some in the administration, and others, call this an ``accounting \ngimmick.'' That is flatly not the case. The administration uses the \nsame refund mechanism to pay for the President's Transportation bill.\n  If it was not an ``accounting gimmick'' in February, when the \nPresident submitted his budget, then it is not an ``accounting \ngimmick'' for Congress to use the same mechanism now. It is not a \ngimmick anyway.\n  In addition to the elements contained in the President's budget, let \nme briefly describe the other provisions that increase receipts in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  The amendment will increase collections of present-law fuel taxes. \nThe amendment will improve tax compliance with respect to blend stocks \nused in gasoline.\n  The proposal prevents the blending of untaxed chemicals with gasoline \nby imposing the Federal excise tax when blendstocks are removed from \nthe bulk system.\n  We make sure that kerosene used on the highways is taxed as diesel \nfuel, and we improve the rules for tax-free fuel purchases by requiring \nappropriate certification that an entity is exempt from the fuel taxes.\n  The amendment also dedicates the gas-guzzler tax to the highway trust \nfund. Today this transportation excise tax goes to the general fund. \nThat does not make any sense. It belongs in the highway trust fund. \nAfter all, these are vehicles that travel on the highways. It belongs \nin the highway trust fund with the rest of the Federal excise taxes \nthat are imposed on vehicles and fuels. This proposal does not take \ncurrent dollars out of the general fund, but when the guzzler tax is \npaid in the future, it will go to the highway trust fund.\n  The amendment maintains the integrity of the highway trust fund. The \nhighway program will be paid entirely by transportation excise taxes to \nthe highway trust fund. But because more transportation taxes will now \nrightfully go to the highway trust fund, there will be a gap to fill in \nthe general fund.\n  We make the general fund whole by including revenue-raisers that are \nnot related to highways. These are good policy loophole closers. \nEverybody would want to vote for these regardless, just standing alone. \nThey are the sort of provisions the Senate has passed before.\n  All in all, it is a win-win situation. This bill pays for highways \nlegitimately and replenishes the general fund legitimately.\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\n  On April 27, the majority leader stood on the Senate floor and said \nthis about the Transportation bill:\n\n       I am confident by working together we can get this done, \n     and we can demonstrate reasonable fiscal restraint.\n\n  At the Finance Committee markup, I made that same statement that we \nwould be responsible in this new funding amendment. We have done that. \nWe have been responsible.\n  I commend my colleagues who voted for the Talent-Wyden amendment to \nthis year's budget resolution. That amendment firmly stated that new \nreceipts to the highway trust fund should be available and spent in \nthis bill. Eighty-one of us supported that amendment. That is an \noverwhelming majority of the Senate supporting additional \ntransportation funding in this bill, all paid for.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, this amendment provides the \nfunding they voted for in the budget resolution. Each of the 81 \nSenators who supported the budget resolution amendment should support \nthis new money.\n  Why are we working so hard to increase the funding in this bill? Let \nme explain why we have not just given in and gone along.\n  Every billion dollars in infrastructure investment creates nearly \n47,500 jobs--every billion dollars. That is important. Over the life of \nthe bill, we will sustain more than 2 million good-paying jobs.\n  Highway jobs are jobs that stay in the United States. You cannot \nexport highway jobs. You cannot outsource highway jobs. They are not \nshipped overseas. This bill will affect all Americans whether they \nbuild the road or drive on the road.\n  Our economy could sure use a boost, and one certain way is to produce \njobs through this bill. It is a jobs bill.\n  This bill is an economic engine for my State of Montana. The last \nTransportation bill, TEA-21, provided more than $1.2 billion in my \nState and helped sustain more than 11,000 jobs. With the increased \nfunding in this substitute amendment, Montana and every other State in \nthe country will receive a much needed increase in economic growth and \ndevelopment, all paid for.\n  This amendment will also allow us to make some modest changes to the \nformulas in the SAFETEA bill. We made changes for both donor and donee \nStates. For the donee States, we have increased the guaranteed funding \nfrom 110 percent of TEA-21 levels up to 115 percent each year of the \nbill--each and every year. From a 110-percent increase to a 115-percent \nincrease--that is for the donee States.\n  For the donor States, we have provided funding to bring every donor \nState to 91 cents on the dollar beginning in 2006, with an additional \nguarantee of 92 cents in 2009.\n  I know this is not what everybody wanted, but we have limited funds. \nWe cannot do everything for everyone. I hope that as this debate \ncontinues, my colleagues will understand the very difficult task of \ndrafting a national formula. We must work together. Prior \ntransportation bills have never been partisan fights. It is very \nimportant. There is no such thing as a Republican road or a Democratic \nroad; they are American roads.\n  I remember fondly working with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan on \nISTEA in 1991. We had good debates on the future of transportation \npolicy. He had such vision, and ISTEA reflected that vision.\n  In 1998, I worked closely with two dear friends developing TEA-21--\nthe late Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island and Senator John Warner of \nVirginia. We worked side by side through many long nights and hours of \ndiscussions. Each of us brought a different perspective to the table. I \nrepresented the needs of rural and Western and Midwestern States, \nSenator Chafee represented the Northeastern States, and Senator Warner \nrepresented the donor States, generally Southern States. Each of us \nrecognized that with a national transportation program, we had to \nbalance the needs of each constituency. I believe we put together a \ngood product in TEA-21. Was it perfect? Of course not, but it moved our \ncountry forward. Did I get everything I wanted for my State? No. We did \nnot get to write legislation in a vacuum. We had to work together.\n\n  The bill before us is balanced. We have worked hard to balance the \nneeds of the various States, each with different interests but with a \ncommon purpose. We have worked hard to balance the needs of highways \nand transit. It is time for us to finish the job. We have substantial \ndifferences with the House. We need to get this bill to conference so \nwe can iron those differences out.\n  Legislating is the art of compromise. I have been fortunate to \nrepresent the people of Montana in this Capitol for the last 30 years. \nIn that time, I have worked on hundreds of pieces of legislation that \nhave become law. To craft these measures, I have worked with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle--with Members on my side and Members of the \nother side--because, after all, we all are Senators. I have not \nreceived everything I wanted. I have had to give a little bit. That is \nwhat we all do around here. We are a nation of 50 States with different \nneeds. I hope my colleagues will continue to work with us on the Senate \nfloor with that in mind. There are small States, there are large \nStates, there are urban States, there are rural States, there are donor \nStates, and there are donee States. We have done our very best to \nbalance the various needs.\n  Our ability to address many of the outstanding issues depends on the \nadded funding this amendment provides. We could not balance them \nwithout this added funding. Without additional funding in this bill, we \ncannot make further changes. It is that simple.\n  To my friends who have come to me over these past weeks asking for \nmore money for their States, I simply say: Now is the time to stand and \nbe counted. Now is the time to complete action on this bill and invest \nin our future. Let us not allow gridlock in Congress to cause gridlock \non the main streets of America. Let us adopt this amendment and provide \nthe funding our transportation system needs. Let us move this bill to \nhelp get our economy moving.\n  Mr. President, I again thank all those concerned. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know there are a number of my \ncolleagues waiting to speak this evening.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his \ncomments and a very excellent explanation as to how the Finance \nCommittee is coming up with some more money to try to make this a \nbetter bill.\n  Senator Jeffords and I have been trying to get people to come down \nwith amendments for several days now. We are pleased that Senator \nHutchinson and Senator Nelson of Nebraska have an amendment. It is one \nto which we have agreed, but there may be others who want to be heard \non it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 617 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. Nelson of \nNebraska, Mr. Burns, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Graham, proposes an \namendment numbered 617.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To limit the number of facilities at which the Secretary may \n                collect tolls in the State of Virginia)\n\n       On page 250, strike lines 17 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n       (B) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) Limitation.--The Secretary may permit the collection \n     of tolls under this subsection on 1 facility in the State of \n     Virginia.'';\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that is going to \ntry to take away the right of States to put tolls on interstate \nhighways that have already been paid for and built by the taxpayers of \nour country. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in expanding \nopportunities to toll our Nation's interstate highway system. The \ninterstate system was conceived and built with Federal tax dollars, so \ntolling interstates amounts to double taxation.\n  Today, I, along with Senators Nelson of Nebraska, Shelby, Burns, and \nPryor, offer an amendment which simply repeals a provision from the \nprevious highway bill, TEA-21, the Interstate System Reconstruction and \nRehabilitation Pilot Program, which is known as the interstate tolling \nprogram, which is fundamentally unfair to taxpayers.\n  I have said if local communities and States want to come together and \nbuild a toll road, they should be able to do it. In these situations, \nthe taxpayers know what they are getting into. Many times a vote is \nrequired to issue bonds, but at any rate the taxpayers can hold the \nelected officials accountable. To allow unelected transportation \nofficials to simply install a toll booth on facilities already paid for \nby Federal tax dollars is unacceptable.\n  Tolling existing highways will also increase the number of drivers on \nthe free roads, resulting in greater congestion and more accidents. \nStudies show that drivers will choose to bypass the tolls by driving on \nlocal, small roads. We also know that tolls on existing interstates \nwill produce substantial diversion of truck traffic to other roads, and \nour rural roads are not equipped to handle significant truck traffic.\n  In Ohio, traffic tripled on US-20 after toll increases on the Ohio \nTurnpike. Unfortunately, fatal accidents on US-20 are now 17 times more \ncommon than those on the turnpike. In response, Ohio's Department of \nTransportation decided to lower the tolls, even though the action did \nreduce the revenues for the State.\n  A recent study predicted that a 25-cent-per-mile toll on an \ninterstate would cause nearly half the trucks to divert to other \nroutes. This is an understandable economic decision for trucking \ncompanies considering that truckers' profit margins average 2 to 4 \ncents per mile and the rising price of gasoline has already affected \nprofitability. Technology already exists to help truckers and other \ndrivers evade tolls in a cost-effective manner. It does not make sense \nto invest in tolls that people will not pay.\n  Tolling interstates would reduce the safety of nearby local roads, \ndegrade the quality of life in neighboring areas, and hurt the economy. \nEighty percent of the Nation's goods travel by truck, and they will \ntravel more slowly and expensively if tolls are imposed on interstates.\n  The Federal Government collects taxes to fund the Federal interstate \nhighway system. The States should not have the right to come in and \nimpose another tax via a toll. The idea of tolling Texas highways is \nmore concerning to me because the Federal highway program has treated \nmy home State pretty poorly. Texas is the single largest donor State \nover the program's 50 years of history. We have the most highway miles \nof any State and our drivers have contributed billions to other States \nto enable them to build their portion of the Federal highway network.\n  In this bill, we will get a 91-cent return. It is better than the \nprevious 5 years, but I am going to continue to work for parity. I have \nalways defended States rights, but the flexibility to toll interstates \nhas a clear effect on interstate commerce and fundamental fairness. If \nArkansas, for example, decided to toll I-40, all deliveries coming into \nor out of Texas on I-40 would be subject to that toll. In effect, Texas \nbusinesses and citizens would be taxed for using that highway. As a \ndonor State, our taxes have already helped to finance it. So it is \nclear from the studies that tolling an interstate will shift traffic to \nother roads and potentially to other States.\n  These States would not share in the toll revenue but would bear the \nbrunt of the costs for more accidents on their roads, more traffic, \npollution, and added highway maintenance and expansion costs. I cannot \nsupport a program which could shift new traffic and related burdens to \nour State and others.\n  The underlying SAFETEA bill establishes a commission to explore \nalternative sources of transportation revenue. The commission should be \nallowed to complete its work before we start experimenting with tolls \nor any other alternative.\n  At the request of Senator Warner, we have modified the amendment to \nlimit the interstate tolling program to the Commonwealth of Virginia. \nThe senior Senator from Virginia and the State's congressional \ndelegation have been working with Virginia's Department of \nTransportation for more than 3 years on the I-81 project. Virginia is \nthe only State with an active application pending before the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation. While I disagree with implementing this \nprogram, I am willing to defer to Senator Warner on the need to allow \nVirginia to finish its application and have therefore agreed to this \nmodification.\n  I am going to defer to the Senator from Nebraska, who is one of the \ncosponsors of the bill. I hope we will be able to pass this amendment. \nIt is very important that the taxpayers of America know they are going \nto have the opportunity to use this interstate system their tax dollars \nfor 50 years have gone to build.\n  The purpose of having an interstate system was so we would have \nseamless transportation into all of our States and it is very important \nwe keep those highways that have already been built free highways for \nthe citizens who have already paid for them. I urge the support of my \ncolleagues.\n  I defer to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Pryor, and others for supporting and cosponsoring this \nlegislation, which I think is extremely important. There are several \npoints that need to be made about it. One is to point out what it does \nnot do. It does not prevent tolling. Tolling on new construction and on \nadditional construction on existing highways will be continued to be \npermitted. What it does do, as a matter of fairness, is it stops the \nequivalent of double taxation on existing highways already paid for by \nthe Federal gas tax and in many cases State gas tax dollars.\n  What this will avoid having is an additional tax now put on those \nhighways in the name and in the form of a toll, perhaps a little less \nominous sounding than a tax. If one looks at the net effect of putting \na toll on an already\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\npaid-for stretch of highway, it amounts to an additional tax, in this \ncase double taxation.\n  The second point that is important to make about this bill is it is a \nmatter of highway safety. All studies will indicate very clearly that \nif there is a choice between a toll road and a nontoll road, it is most \nlikely that truckers and other drivers will seek to use that nontoll \nroad. In many cases, that is not going to present a matter of safety, \nbut in all too many cases it will redirect traffic and reroute traffic \nto older, smaller, and less capable roads of handling that additional \ntraffic. That not only will be a burden for the roads and will \ndeteriorate the roads at a faster rate than was originally planned in \ntheir construction, but it will also raise the amount of traffic in \nmany cases on two-lane highways or smaller highways and will increase \nthe safety factor. I think it is pretty clear that we would ordinarily \nnot take away the right of a State to do this. But under these \ncircumstances, where we are allowing tolling of existing lanes on the \nInterstate Highway System, that is bad policy and it is absolutely \nunfair.\n\n  This amendment does not affect the State's ability to finance new \nconstruction using tolls, as perhaps some thought. But it does affect \nthe right to do it in the case of existing highways.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We worked out the \nquestions that have been raised with respect to the State of Virginia. \nWe believe that has now been handled, and this legislation should pass \nas part of this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand there is no further debate on \nthe amendment. I see the Senator from Texas wishing to urge the \nadoption of this amendment. We have no objection. It is a good \namendment and I urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank my colleague from Nebraska for being a \ncosponsor of the amendment. My colleague, Senator Nelson, signed on \nvery early, as did Senator Burns. I really appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, I urge the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 617) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may proceed as in \nmorning business for the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burns and Mr. Baucus are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Safe \nAccountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Act of 2005 and the \ncloture motion that was filed this evening.\n  First, I commend Senators Inhofe, Jeffords, Bond, Baucus, Grassley, \nShelby, Sarbanes, Stevens and Inouye and their staffs for their hard \nwork and strong leadership in putting together a bipartisan bill. As a \nmember of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, I am pleased to \nhave been a part of this effort.\n  In the last Congress, I was a conferee for the bill and we worked in \na bipartisan fashion, but we were unable to get the bill across the \nfinish line. To expedite the process this year, this bill is \nessentially the same language that the Senate passed the last time \naround with the support of 76 Senators. The only difference is the \nnumbers have been adjusted to reflect a lower spending level.\n  I call on the President and my colleagues in both the House and the \nSenate to work expeditiously to get this bill enacted into law as soon \nas possible.\n  We have serious needs to our aging infrastructure. The deterioration \nof our Nation's transportation system is impacting our economy, the \nenvironment, and the welfare of the American people. Passage of a \ntransportation bill cannot be delayed any further due to these needs \nand the numerous jobs it creates. It is simply too important to our \nNation in terms of its benefits to our economy and environment and to a \nsafe and equitable transportation system.\n  A new substitute amendment was added to this bill yesterday which \nincreases the total guaranteed Federal investment in highway and \ntransit funds to $251 billion, about an $11 billion increase. I am \npleased that the Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senators \nGrassley and Baucus, was able to fully offset this increase so as not \nto increase the debt, as Senator Grassley spoke so eloquently about it \nearlier today.\n  It is my understanding the bill remains budget neutral. I think it is \nimportant that everyone understand that. It is budget neutral because \nmany of these offsets were included in the Senate-passed version of the \nJOBS bill last year. They passed the Senate but were taken out in the \nconference committee on the JOBS bill, so they are available to us as \noffsets in this bill.\n  Second, offsets are included in the bill which go after the \nproliferation of abusive tax shelters used by individuals and \ncorporations and include increased criminal fines and penalties for \nthose committing those abuses.\n  Additionally, these offsets include efforts to target fuel tax \nevasion schemes to ensure that additional money is available to \nproperly fund the highway bill.\n  In 1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, \nwas enacted, increasing the Federal investment in highways and transit \nby nearly 40 percent. This bill increases funding over TEA-21 by about \n35 percent. Now, people will hear those numbers, and they will think: \nWow, that is an enormous increase in spending. But listen to some of \nthese facts.\n  While the total funding is still well below what I and several of my \ncolleagues think is appropriate and necessary, I support this bill \nbecause it represents a compromise between the Senate-passed bill last \nCongress and the level the President has requested. I commend the \nmanagers of the bill for their hard work in finding this middle ground.\n  As I mentioned, this legislation is modest, given the need. It falls \nfar short of the level that would improve and even maintain our \nNation's highway system. Frankly, the bill that passed last Congress \nwas not enough, either.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration's 2002 Conditions and \nPerformance Report, $106.9 billion is needed every year through 2020. \nIt is needed to maintain and improve our highways and bridges. And just \nto maintain the system, $75.9 billion is needed annually through 2020.\n  This bill contains $199 billion in guaranteed funding for highways \nfor 5 years. This is only an average of about $36.5 billion annually, \nwhich is $70.4 billion below what is needed to improve and $38.8 \nbillion below what is needed to maintain the system. So this is not \nsome gigantic porkbarrel ripoff legislation. It is a modest attempt to \nmeet the needs we have in our country.\n  Additionally--and I will go into this more later--I would have liked \ndonor States to get back more of each dollar they put in the highway \ntrust fund. However, the inadequate funding pales in comparison to the \nneed to pass a bill now. TEA-21 expired on September 30, 2003. That was \n19 months ago, and we are still trying to get a bill done. This program \nhas been operating under a total of six short-term extensions, and the \nnext extension expires at the end of this month.\n  Our States and our workers cannot afford for us to simply pass \nanother extension. We cannot pass another extension. State contract \nawards for the 2005 spring and summer construction season are going out \nto bid. If we fail to enact a bill by the end of this month, States \nwill not know what to expect in Federal funding, potentially delaying \nmany projects.\n  According to a survey conducted by the American Association of State \nHighway Transportation Officials, another extension could mean the loss \nof over 90,000 jobs and $2.1 billion in project delays.\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\n  This is the most significant jobs bill we will pass this Congress. We \nhave an opportunity with this bill not only to improve and repair our \ncrumbling highways and bridges but to create good-paying jobs at the \nsame time.\n  The transportation construction industry generates more than $200 \nbillion in economic activity and helps sustain 2.5 million jobs in the \nUnited States each year. According to the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, every $1 billion invested in highway construction \ncreates 47,500 jobs and generates more than $2 billion in economic \nactivity. This economic activity includes $500 million in new orders \nfor the manufacturing sector that is so desperately needed in my State.\n\n  AASHTO estimates that over the next 5 years, the highway portion of \nthis bill would create about 518,000 jobs nationally and 23,000 jobs in \nthe State of Ohio. Perhaps even more importantly, let me reiterate that \nthe failure to pass this bill could cause the loss of 90,000 jobs \nacross the country.\n  It is also estimated that every dollar invested in the Nation's \nhighway system generates $5.70 in economic benefits, including reduced \ndelays, improved safety, and reduced vehicle operating costs. This is a \n6-to-1 return on investment. It has a synergistic effect on so many \nparts of our economy.\n  Ohio's ``just in time'' economy cannot afford any further delays in \npassing this bill, as transportation congestion seriously threatens our \ncompetitiveness. Our aging infrastructure is also impacting people in \ntheir pocketbooks. Nationwide, 162,000 bridges are structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete, and 160,000 miles of highway \npavement are in poor or mediocre condition. Americans pay $49 billion a \nyear in extra vehicle repairs and operating costs due to road \nconditions. This is an average of $255 per driver in the United States \nof America.\n  Americans also pay due to increased congestion and poor road \nconditions. The average urban rush-hour driver spends almost 62 \nadditional hours a year stuck in traffic--62 additional hours a year \nstuck in traffic. Vehicles caught in stop-and-go traffic emit far more \nemissions than they do without frequent acceleration and breaking. \nTraffic congestion is also responsible for 5.7 billion gallons of \nwasted gasoline every year. Wasted fuel and lost productivity due to \ntraffic congestion costs the U.S. economy nearly $70 billion annually. \nSo this issue of highway construction, repair, and maintenance has a \ndramatic impact on the quality of life of our fellow Americans.\n  It not only costs our economy and environment, but also lives. Nearly \n43,000 people were killed on America's roads in 2003. Poor road \nconditions were a factor in one-third of those fatalities. In Ohio, \n1,277 people were killed on roads in 2003, and the number increased to \n1,285 in 2004. The Federal Government predicts highway fatalities will \ngrow to nearly 52,000 by 2009, absent any new Federal investment in \nhighway safety. Studies report that every $1 billion invested in road \nimprovements since 1950 has helped prevent 1,400 premature deaths and \nnearly 50,000 injuries, as well as helped save over $2 billion in \nhealth care, insurance, lost wages, and productivity costs.\n  If we continue to ignore the upkeep and allow the deterioration of \nour infrastructure, we risk disruptions in commerce and reduced \nprotection for public safety, health, and the environment.\n  This bill is extremely important to my State, which has one of the \nlargest surface transportation networks in the country. There are 60 \npublic transit systems serving 58 of Ohio's 88 counties. This is a \nstatistic that I am sure my fellow Ohioans are not aware of. In 2003, \nthese systems made approximately 135 million trips. Ohio has the \nNation's fourth largest rural transportation program, the fifth largest \nbus fleet, the ninth most transit vehicle miles traveled, and the tenth \nhighest overall ridership in the Nation.\n  The American Public Transportation Association estimates that for \nevery $10 million spent, 310 jobs are created, and $30 million in \nbusiness sales is generated. For transit, Ohio will receive $884 \nmillion, which is about $220 million more, or a 33-percent increase \nover TEA-21.\n  In terms of highways, Ohio has the Nation's seventh largest highway \nnetwork, fifth highest volume of traffic, fourth largest interstate \nhighway network, and the second largest inventory of bridges in the \ncountry.\n  Under TEA-21, Ohio received a 23-percent increase in highway funding. \nThis bill will provide Ohio with $7.7 billion, which is about $1.91 \nbillion more, or a 33-percent increase over TEA-21.\n  Throughout my career, I have been working to ensure that Ohio \nreceives its fair share of highway funding. Through the 1990s, we moved \nfrom receiving less than 80 percent of our contributions to the highway \ntrust fund to 90.5 percent under TEA-21.\n  This is, again, one of my top priorities for reauthorization.\n  Early this year, along with 19 cosponsors, Senator Carl Levin and I \nintroduced legislation, the Highway Funding Equity Act of 2005, to \nincrease donor States' minimum rate of return to 95 percent. It has \nbeen a pleasure to lead this effort on behalf of the SHARE--States' \nHighway Alliance for Real Equity--coalition in the Senate. This bill \nincreases the guaranteed share for all donor States to 92 percent by \n2009. While it is not the 95 percent we sought, I recognize that it is \na compromise, and the Ohio Department of Transportation has told me it \nis sufficient.\n  First and foremost, ODOT has made it clear they need a bill with an \nincreased level of investment signed into law as soon as possible. I \nhope all of my colleagues have the same kind of pressure being put on \nthem by their respective DOT directors. The bill increases funding by \n35 percent over TEA-21. In order to get it enacted before the extension \nat the end of the month expires, the bill must be passed this week.\n  Second, Ohio needs to no longer be penalized for consuming ethanol-\nblended fuel. That is one of the issues we worked on during the last \nseveral years. Because we are a high ethanol user and because of the \nfact that money didn't go into the highway trust fund, we were losing \nabout $140 million a year. I cosponsored language last Congress, \nwritten by Senator Grassley, to transfer 2.5 cents of the Federal tax \non ethanol-blended fuel from the general fund of the Treasury to the \nhighway account of the highway trust fund and to replace the 5.2 cents \nper gallon reduced tax rate for ethanol-blended fuel with a tax credit.\n  Fortunately, we were able to make these changes last Congress in the \nJOBS bill which means $400 million in increased funding for Ohio over \nthe life of this bill.\n  Our Department of Transportation has informed me they need a 91-\npercent rate of return to meet Ohio's transportation goals over the \nlife of this bill. Again, this bill takes us to 92 percent. Because of \nthis, our Ohio Department of Transportation will be able to move \nforward with their Jobs and Progress Plan, a $5 billion, 10-year Ohio \nconstruction program dedicated to Ohio's most pressing congestion, \nsafety, and rural access needs. This plan is possible because Ohio \napproved a State motor vehicle fuel tax increase in 2003 to provide \nhalf of the funding. This new construction program in Ohio will employ \napproximately 3,950 construction workers directly and another 9,850 \nindirect highway jobs. The citizens of Ohio should be proud of the fact \nthat they reached into their pockets to increase their gas tax so Ohio \nwill be a leader in this country in responding to its highway needs.\n  The Ohio Jobs in Progress Plan is going to help finance several major \nprojects throughout the State, including a $350 million project to \nrebuild I-75 in Dayton, a $400 million project to begin rebuilding the \ncentral viaduct or, as we in Cleveland call it, ``dead man's curve,'' \nand a $600 million project to improve the I-70/I-71 split in Columbus. \nIt also includes investments in high crash locations and the freight \ncorridors such as U.S. 24 and U.S. 30 in northwest Ohio.\n  In addition, the bill provides funding for $202 million worth of \nprojects that ODOT has ready to go but no funding. The 128 projects on \nthe shelf range from major reconstruction to traffic signals.\n  Finally, I have a few comments about the environmental planning and \nproject delivery provisions of this bill. As chairman of the Clean Air, \nClimate Change, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, and the past chairman \nof\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, I understand full \nwell the importance and significance of the overlap between highway \nplanning and air quality.\n  As requested by Federal, State, and local officials, this bill makes \nimportant improvements to the conformity process by synchronizing \nplanning and conformity timelines and requirements. It also modifies \nthe Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, called \nCMAQ, to include nonattainment areas for the new ozone and particulate \nmatter standards. EPA has designated about 500 counties in this Nation \nas in nonattainment, including 33 counties in Ohio. These areas will \nneed all the help they can get to attain the new standards, and the \nCMAQ Program will help to pay for those things that need to be done.\n  While these are two areas in which I believe we made progress, I \nbelieve we could have done more with the metropolitan and statewide \nplanning and transportation project delivery provisions in this bill. \nAs a former Governor, I was frustrated at how long it took to do a \nhighway project from the beginning to the end. As Senator, I have \nwanted to do something meaningful on this issue since I was chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure. While I was \nchairman, I held a number of oversight hearings on the implementation \nof the streamlining provisions included in TEA-21. Although I have not \nintroduced any amendments on this matter, I look forward to continuing \nto work with my colleagues on this issue as this bill moves forward. It \ntakes too long to build a highway in the United States.\n\n  I do want to mention an area where I think we have made good \nprogress. This is with the section 4(f) provisions of the bill. Last \nCongress, I proposed an amendment on this after working with a \nbipartisan and diverse group to develop a compromise such as the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation, the American Association of \nState Highway and Transportation Officials. I am pleased these \nprovisions are included in this bill as the process has caused more \ndelay in my State than any other planning or environmental review \nrequirement. This is a requirement of Federal law in terms of where you \ncan put a highway, in terms of areas that involve historical places or \nparks and so forth. As a result of that, it has slowed down our ability \nto move forward with highway construction.\n  As I mentioned, the 4(f) reforms are a true compromise--not far \nenough for some and perhaps too far for others. I have numerous \nexamples of this cumbersome process. I will not go into them tonight.\n  I urge my colleagues who have concerns with these provisions to \ncontact me so I can discuss the problem and how we reach a balanced \nsolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill and the cloture motion filed \non it. The current surface transportation authorization expires at the \nend of the month. We have to get this bill out of the Senate now. I \nurge my colleagues to work to achieve that, get it into conference, get \nit done, get it passed, get the President to sign it, and let's make \nsure that what APTA predicts doesn't happen, and that is, if we don't \nget this bill passed, we are going to lose 90,000 jobs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \ntoday to talk about the Transportation reauthorization bill before us \nand why I believe it is necessary to pass a transportation bill before \nthe authorization ends on May 31, 2005.\n  The Transportation reauthorization bill is a jobs bill. According to \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, each $1 billion in new \ninfrastructure investment creates 47,500 new jobs: 26,500 of these are \ndirectly related to construction, engineering, contracting, and other \non-site employees, and 21,000 are indirect jobs resulting from the \nspending associated with the investment.\n  Improving our transportation infrastructure is one of the critical \nthings we can do to create jobs.\n  My State, California, needs a robust transportation bill to help \nclean the air, ease congestion on the roads, and create jobs. However, \nI do have some concerns about this bill.\n  As a representative of a donor State, I am extremely disappointed \nthat so many States are still being asked to give more than they \nreceive in Federal transportation dollars. I believe that this bill \ndoes not adequately address the problems of donor States like my State \nof California.\n  California currently has a 90.5 percent rate of return. In other \nwords, for every dollar California sends to Washington, it gets back \nonly 90 \\1/2\\ cents for maintenance and improvement of our highways.\n  Transportation is the backbone of California's economy. Our seaports \nhandle about half of all cargo that comes into the United States, and \nthe State is also home to two of the nation's busiest ports--Los \nAngeles/Long Beach and Oakland.\n  Three-quarters of all goods shipped from California's ports are now \ntransported by truck along California's roads.\n  We need our roads to be equipped to handle the flow of these goods \nand the truck traffic that comes with it.\n  Regrettably, these roads are in desperate need of repair. More than \n70 percent of California's major local and State road miles are rated \nin poor or mediocre condition-compared with a national average of 28 \npercent--and 38 percent of the State's overpasses and bridges are \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  As a result, California's 21 million motorists pay an average of $555 \neach, or a total of $12 billion, in extra vehicle operating costs \nannually. These costs include wasted fuel, pothole damage, and \nshortened vehicle lifespan.\n  At the same time, travel on California's roads nearly doubled between \n1980 and 2000, while the population increased only 42 percent.\n  We are all familiar with pictures of California's gridlock--cars \nsitting on our freeways, moving at a snail's pace.\n  The facts bear out the images. Out of the top five congested urban \nareas in the Nation, California has three. Los Angeles is the most \ncongested, followed by San Francisco-Oakland. San Diego is the fifth \nmost congested area in the country.\n  In LA County, 85 percent of freeway lane miles are congested, and Los \nAngeles motorists waste 177 hours a year per driver.\n  Traffic congestion in California costs motorists $20.7 billion \nannually in lost time and fuel. And with rising fuel costs, that total \nis only going to increase.\n  I am also concerned with the Senate bill's changes to the Congestion \nManagement and Air Quality Improvement Program, or CMAQ. The CMAQ \nformula currently apportions funds to states based on the severity of \nozone and carbon monoxide pollution. The Senate bill proposes to change \nthe formula so that CMAQ awards to areas with ozone pollution, \nregardless of the severity of that pollution.\n  The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority--LAMTA--estimates that \nthis ``one-size fits all'' approach could cost California as much as \n$160 million in CMAQ grants over 4 years.\n  This change is a huge problem for California. California has six non-\nattainment areas for air quality, and 70 percent of the State in the \nreformulated gasoline program because our air is so dirty.\n  In addition, according to a study by the American Lung Association in \n2004, nine of the twenty smoggiest cities in the United States are \nlocated in my home State, California.\n  California needs the CMAQ funds to pay for highway enhancements to \nease the flow of traffic and reduce the amount of time trucks and cars \nare idling and spewing pollution into the air.\n  California also relies heavily on public transportation, and the bill \nneeds to adequately fund mass transit programs.\n  California has some of the largest regional transportation systems in \nthe country including Bay Area Rapid Transit--BART, CalTrain--the rail \nservice between San Francisco and San Jose, and Metrolink--Southern \nCalifornia's regional transit system.\n  These programs help reduce the number of cars on the road, which in \nturn, reduces air pollution, and decreases the amount of time my \nconstituents have to spend commuting every day.\n  Californians are facing a serious dilemma. Without adequate Federal \nhighway dollars, local communities will not be able to eliminate \nbottlenecks on highways and make necessary air quality improvements. As \na result,\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nthey will remain out of conformity with Federal air quality \nregulations, and will lose even more Federal highway dollars. This is a \nnever-ending cycle and has failed to make any strides in helping reduce \nour air pollution.\n  That is why I support toll roads as an option to provide the needed \nrevenue to make improvements to our roads. I am pleased that the Senate \nbill includes a toll road pilot program and hope that the program is \nflexible enough to allow the State to use the tolls to meet its goods \nmovement infrastructure needs.\n  I would also ask the Environment and Public Works Committee to \nconsider an amendment that would allow tolling revenue in extreme non-\nattainment areas to be used to mitigate air quality impacts that are \nimposed upon those communities by heavy duty trucks moving goods from \nCalifornia's ports to areas throughout the country.\n  I am also pleased that the bill will allow hybrid vehicles access to \nhigh occupancy vehicle--HOV--lanes. Without this authorization, \nCalifornia and other States, such as Arizona, Virginia, Colorado, and \nGeorgia will lose their Federal highway dollars by implementing their \nown State laws to allow hybrids to access these lanes.\n  This provision would increase traffic mobility and also serves as an \nimportant incentive to get more hybrids on the road, an innovative \nsolution to reduce our dependence on oil.\n  I would like to thank the Commerce Committee for including language \nin the bill that would require the Department of Transportation to \nconduct a study of predatory towing practices. Tow truck companies act \nwithout any local, State or Federal regulation. While most are good \nactors, there are a few that have taken advantage of the lack of \nregulation to prey on consumers. This has become a huge problem \nthroughout California, and in other areas including Virginia and \nArizona. This study will determine the impact of predatory towing \npractices and propose potential remedies to dealing with them.\n  While I have concerns about the fairness of the funding formulas, I \nalso realize that without a transportation bill, California's \ncommunities will lack the money they need to plan major infrastructure \nprojects. As a result, I plan to support this bill and hope that the \nconferees will keep in mind the needs of the donor States such as \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, there have been a lot of complaints \nlately over John Bolton, the President's nominee to be United States \nAmbassador to the United Nations.\n  Mr. Bolton is an excellent choice for this position, as both his \nexperience and leadership qualities prove. He graduated from Yale Law \nSchool, joined a prestigious firm, one of the country's great law \nfirms, Covington & Burling. He worked there until 1981. He began his \ncareer in public service at the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, first as general counsel, then as assistant administrator \nfor program and policy coordination. This was good training for him for \nhis potential future role with the U.N.\n  From 1985 to 1989, he was an assistant attorney general in the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. I got to know him at that time because I was a \nU.S. attorney in Alabama when he served in the Department of Justice in \nthe prestigious office of legal counsel. From 1989 to 1993, he was \nagain involved in international organizational issues when he served as \nAssistant Secretary of State for international organizational affairs. \nMr. Bolton was confirmed by the Senate for both of those positions.\n  From 1993 to 1999, he was again in private practice, as a partner \nwith the law firm of Lerner, Reed, Bolton, and McManus. In 2001, he \nbecame Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International \nSecurity. I believe he was confirmed once again in that position by the \nSenate.\n  This was excellent experience for him. He dealt with issues relating \nto world security. Some say Mr. Bolton does not believe in the United \nNations, multilateralism, and diplomacy. That statement is false.\n  The President of the United States recently stated in a television \ninterview that he asked Bolton if he supported the U.N. before he, the \nPresident, agreed to nominate him. Mr. Bolton answered that he did. \nDespite what others have been alleging, the facts show--and Mr. Bolton \nhas proven time and again--that he believes in the U.N. That is why he \nhas been such an effective advocate for honest diplomacy and an \neffective U.N.\n  For example, he was a pioneer in helping to construct the G-8 global \npartnership to help keep secure dangerous technologies and materials, \nand to help stop the spread of dangerous weapons throughout the world. \nThis global initiative will provide $20 billion through 2012 to achieve \nthese goals of making the world a safer place, by working with other \nnations.\n  Mr. Bolton was the President's point man in designing the \nProliferation Security Initiative, the PSI. Over 60 nations are now \nworking together, coordinated by John Bolton, to share intelligence, \nand are taking action to stop the transfer of dangerous weapons \nthroughout the world. He has even done pro bono work for the U.N. in \nAfrica, giving of his time for free to help those in need.\n  He also worked closely and effectively with the U.N. when he served \nas Assistant Secretary of State in the State Department for \nInternational Organizations, from 1989 to 1992.\n  He has been instrumental in galvanizing U.N. agencies such as the \nIAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to take concrete steps to \nactually make the world safer from weapons of mass destruction--not \njust to talk about it, but to do something about it. Isn't that \neffective multilateral leadership? I certainly think so.\n  He was the driving force in the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1540 \nto get countries to take meaningful steps to stop the spread of \ndangerous weapons.\n  He has clearly been instrumental in both diplomacy and \nmultilateralism and has proven to be an advocate of a United Nations \nthat fulfills its potential, its calling, to make the world safer, and \nto help people throughout the world develop to their fullest.\n  He will not, however, be an enabler of a dysfunctional U.N. John \nBolton has supported reform within the U.N. to help make it a better \norganization. This reform effort should not be misconstrued as \nopposition to the U.N. but, rather, as constructive and effective \ncriticism. When parents discipline their children, it is not because \nthey don't support them or believe in them. In fact, it is exactly the \nopposite. Good parents set guidelines and high standards for their \nchildren to guide them in life and to make them more responsible \nadults. If you love your children, you want them to reach their highest \nand best potential. That is exactly what John Bolton has done with the \nU.N.\n  He has not come out against the U.N. He has not vehemently opposed \nthe U.N., as some of my colleagues would have you believe. He has \nworked within the system to advocate reform in an effort to better the \norganization, to ensure that U.N. programs achieve their intended \npurpose.\n  Under Bolton's leadership at the United Nations, when he served as \nAssistant Secretary of State in the administration of the elder George \nBush, the U.N. General Assembly repealed, by a vote of 111 to 25, a \nresolution that described Zionism as a form of racism. Resolution 3379 \noriginally passed in 1975--72 votes for, 35 against--decreeing that \nZionism was a form of racism. Sixty-seven percent of the nations at \nthat time voted for it. It was widely recognized as a sad day for the \nU.N. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described Bolton as the \n``principal architect'' of the 1991 reversal of that resolution. Bolton \nrecently referred to resolution 3379 as ``the greatest stain on the \nU.N.'s reputation'' and called its reversal ``one highlight of my \nprofessional career.''\n  Thomas M. Boyd, a fine former official in the Department of Justice \nwho\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nwas Mr. Bolton's deputy when he was Assistant Attorney General in the \nU.S. Department of Justice, described the situation this way in a \nrecent editorial in the Boston Globe:\n\n       Starting in the summer of 1991 and continuing well into the \n     early fall, Bolton arrived at his office early each morning \n     and began calling ambassadors around the world, as well as \n     here in Washington, one by one, each time using his keen mind \n     and reputation for bluntness to their full effect. Citing \n     from memory Senator Moynihan's November 10, 1975, contention \n     that ``the United States declares that it does not \n     acknowledge, and will not abide by, it will never acquiesce \n     in this infamous act,'' Bolton refused to accept their \n     excuses and their schedule conflicts and called repeatedly \n     until he talked on multiple occasions to virtually every \n     ambassador whose country would be called upon to cast a vote. \n     In time, his perseverance began to winnow down the naysayers.\n\n  As a direct result of this effort, the hate-ridden resolution was \noverwhelmingly repealed on December 16, 1991. Let me point out an \nimportant aspect of this story. As Mr. Boyd noted, many in the State \nDepartment told him he should not pursue the repeal, that it could not \nbe done, and that it wasn't worth the effort. But because John Bolton \nis a man of integrity, conviction, courage, and determination, he \ndidn't see it that way. He didn't follow the advice of the professional \nbureaucrats and the State Department officials who said it could not be \ndone. Instead, he worked tirelessly to do something that some people \nthought could not be done. He did the right thing, and he should be \nsaluted for that. There is, indeed, a strength of character that is to \nbe noted here.\n  A terrible wrong had been righted with this repeal, and Mr. Bolton \nhad not only shown his skill in diplomacy, but his determination to do \nwhat is right. Isn't that what good diplomacy is? It is not just seeing \nif you can get along and agree with everybody's ideas, but holding \nforth good ideals, good values, fighting for them, and actually winning \npeople over to vote for the right thing. That is what good diplomacy \nis, what leadership is--not blindly going along with people's ideas \nwhether they are correct or not. He is a good man, a courageous man, \nwho will make a tremendous ambassador to the U.N.\n\n  John Bolton realizes the benefits possible to the world through an \neffective U.N., and for that reason he has worked hard to make sure it \nstays a credible organization. You cannot blame him for being concerned \nabout the United Nations. I certainly am. With the numerous allegations \nof corruption at the U.N., we need a frank and aggressive ambassador \nleading the American efforts there.\n  Last month, the Washington Times reported that two senior \ninvestigators with the U.N. committee probing corruption in the Oil for \nFood Program have resigned in protest. These investigators believe the \nreport that cleared Kofi Annan of meddling in the $64 billion operation \nwas too soft on the Secretary General.\n  The investigators believed the so-called independent inquiry \ncommittee, which was appointed by Secretary General Kofi Annan in April \nof 2004, played down findings critical of Mr. Annan when it released an \ninterim report in late March relating to his son. This scandal has only \ngotten more complicated this week as it now seems that one of the \ninvestigators has turned over potentially incriminating evidence \nagainst Kofi Annan to a House congressional committee.\n  This scandal has been described by some as the greatest scandal in \nthe history of the world. Scandals such as these undermine the United \nNations. They distract it from its intended purpose of promoting \ninternational peace and security. These scandals and mismanagement \nwaste money that could be used for peacekeeping, medical care, economic \ndevelopment, and education in poor countries around the world. This \nmoney might help prevent hostilities, famine, and revolutions that \ndisrupt these areas of the globe.\n  We need a U.S. ambassador to the U.N. who has both diplomacy and \ntenacity as leadership qualities. Mr. Bolton has both of these \nqualities.\n  One of my esteemed colleagues has alleged that Mr. Bolton blocked \ncertain information from going to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice. \nThere is no basis for this claim. Richard Boucher, the spokesman for \nthe State Department, has expressly refuted the allegation, calling it \n``silly'' and stating that ``nothing of that type occurred.''\n  Another colleague said Mr. Bolton tried to skew weapons of mass \ndestruction intelligence on Iraq, Syria, and Cuba. Again, false.\n  In every instance, whether talking about Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction program, Cuba's biological weapons, or Syria's weapons \nprogram, Mr. Bolton's speeches were cleared by the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity; that is, he submitted his comments to the intelligence \ncommunity for them to review to make sure nothing he said was \nincorrect. They cleared those speeches. There is no evidence whatsoever \nthat Mr. Bolton skewed anything. The allocations are false.\n  On the contrary, there are scores of highly credible individuals who \ntestify to his honesty and excellent candidacy for the position. For \ninstance, I have a letter from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher \nto John Bolton expressing her strong support for Mr. Bolton. It is \nfitting that she should support John Bolton, particularly in light of \nthe comments that he is too tough, too outspoken, too frank, too blunt. \nThose same criticisms were made about Lady Thatcher in 1975, earning \nher the nickname the Iron Lady. She embraced that nickname, famously \nasserting:\n\n       If you lead a country like Britain, a strong country, a \n     country which has taken a lead in world affairs in good times \n     and in bad, a country that is always reliable, then you have \n     to have a touch of iron about you.\n\n  She was absolutely right, and the same holds true in this case. If \nour ambassador is going to represent the world's great superpower in \nthe United Nations, an organization, unfortunately, that has been \nriddled with corruption and strong opposition by certain members to the \nvalues we hold dear, he must have a touch of iron about him, and he \ndoes.\n  Say what you will about John Bolton, weakness is not one of his \nweaknesses.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Lady Thatcher be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 4, 2005.\n     Hon. John R. Bolton,\n     Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International \n         Security.\n       Dear John: I am writing this letter in order to let you \n     know how strongly I support your nomination as U.S. \n     ambassador to the United Nations. On the basis of our years \n     of friendship, I know from experience the great qualities you \n     will bring to that demanding post.\n       To combine, as you do, clarity of thought, courtesy of \n     expression and an unshakable commitment to justice is rare in \n     any walk of life. But it is particularly so in international \n     affairs. A capacity for straight talking rather than peddling \n     half-truths is a strength and not a disadvantage in \n     diplomacy. Particularly in the case of a great power like \n     America, it is essential that people know where you stand and \n     assume that you mean what you say. With you at the UN, they \n     will do both. Those same qualities are also required for any \n     serious reform of the United Nations itself, without which \n     cooperation between nations to defend and extend liberty will \n     be far more difficult.\n       I cannot imagine anyone better fitted to undertake these \n     tasks than you.\n       All good wishes,\n           Yours ever,\n                                                         Margaret.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this letter of April 5, 2005, is signed \nby 13 giants of American diplomacy, including five Secretaries of State \nand two Secretaries of Defense in support of John Bolton. I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2005.\n     Senator Richard G. Lugar, \n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to urge that the Senate act \n     expeditiously to confirm John Bolton as our ambassador to the \n     United Nations. This is a moment when unprecedented \n     turbulence at the United Nations is creating momentum for \n     much needed reform. It is a moment when we must have an \n     ambassador in place whose knowledge, experience, dedication \n     and drive will be vital to protecting the American interest \n     in an effective, forward-looking United Nations.\n       In his position as Undersecretary of State, John Bolton has \n     taken the lead in strengthening international community \n     approaches to the daunting problem of the proliferation of \n     nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD). As a \n     result of his hard work, intellectual as well as operational, \n     the\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\n     G-8 has supported U.S. proposals to strengthen safeguards and \n     verification at the International Atomic Energy Agency and \n     the Proliferation Security Initiative was launched and \n     established within three months--a world speed record in \n     these complex, multilateral matters. Moreover, Secretary \n     Bolton led the successful effort to complete the negotiation \n     of UN Security Council Resolution 1540, adopted unanimously \n     in April, 2004. UN 1540 called on member states to \n     criminalize the proliferation of WMD--which it declared to be \n     a threat to international peace and security--and to enact \n     strict export controls.\n       Secretary Bolton, like the Administration, has his critics, \n     of course. Anyone as energetic and effective as John is bound \n     to encounter those who disagree with some or even all of the \n     Administration's policies. But the policies for which he is \n     sometimes criticized are those of the President and the \n     Department of State which he has served with loyalty, honor \n     and distinction.\n       Strong supporters of the United Nations understand the \n     challenges it now faces. With his service as assistant \n     secretary of state for international organizations, where he \n     was instrumental in securing the repeal of the repugnant \n     resolution equating Zionism with racism, and as \n     undersecretary for arms control and international security, \n     we believe John Bolton will bring great skill and energy to \n     meeting those challenges.\n           Sincerely yours,\n         Hon. David Abshire, former Assistant Secretary of State, \n           Hon. Kenneth Adelman, former Director, Arms Control \n           Disarmament Agency, Hon. Richard Allen, former \n           Assistant to the President for National Security, Hon. \n           James Baker, former Secretary of State, Hon. Frank \n           Carlucci, former Secretary of Defense, Hon. Lawrence \n           Eagleburger, former Secretary of State, Hon. Al Haig, \n           former Secretary of State, Ambassador Max Kampelman, \n           former Ambassador and Head of the U.S. Delegation to \n           the Negotiations with the Soviet Union on Nuclear and \n           Space Arms, Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, former \n           Ambassador to the United Nations, Hon. Henry Kissinger, \n           former Secretary of State, Hon. James Schlesinger, \n           former Secretary of Defense, Hon. George Shultz, former \n           Secretary of State, Hon. Helmut Sonnenfeldt, former \n           Counselor, Department of State.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for over three decades, John Bolton has \nhad an effective working relationship with foreign governments, \ninternational institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and the \nprivate sector. He is a man who gets results. As Secretary Rice said:\n\n       The President has nominated John Bolton because he gets \n     things done.\n\n  That is exactly what we need for the U.N. ambassador. John Bolton is \nthe man for the job.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to support him, and I do believe his \nnomination will be moving forward this week. I think this Senate should \npromptly move to confirm him in this important position.\n\n\n                      60th Anniversary of V-E Day\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this past Sunday, the 8th of May, marked \nthe 60th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe during World War \nII. I have come to the floor today to honor those who served in that \nwar and to mention our colleagues who answered the call of duty then.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I think more than half of the Senate \nhad served in World War II. There are few of us left who served during \nthat war, and in the Senate only five: Senator Akaka, Senator Inouye, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Warner, and myself.\n  That war was an enormous effort that involved our Nation's total \nmanpower. Sixteen million Americans answered the call to serve, and \nmore than 400,000 of them gave what Lincoln once called ``the last full \nmeasure of devotion.''\n  Here at home, Americans of all walks of life supported the war \neffort. Children collected rubber, tin, and steel. Families rationed \nfood and gasoline. And women, in unprecedented numbers, took their \nplace in industry and produced the tools that enabled us to win the \nwar. They joined fields which had once been closed to them, and they \nnever looked back.\n  When I went into the service, as most of my generation did, I was \nfortunate to do what I wanted to do, which was to fly. Sixty years ago, \nfor those of us who served, every day was a milestone. Every day marked \nanother step toward victory.\n  Today, we only recognize a handful of those days: Pearl Harbor Day, \nD-day, V-J Day, and V-E Day--which is what I speak of today.\n  There were so many who stepped forward when our country needed us, \nwho sacrificed on the battlefield and here at home so we could win that \nwar. It was a time defined by heroism, and it is hard to single out any \none person who did heroic things. But I am here to remind the Senate \nthat my friend, Senator Inouye, was a hero.\n  In military history there is a select group of men who have suffered \ngrave injuries on the battlefield, continued their military careers, \nand gone on to further greatness. Horatio Nelson, Joshua Chamberlain, \nand John Bell Hood are all men who were tested on and off the \nbattlefield, and their legacies endure.\n  Among these men, Senator Dan Inouye stands out because he overcame so \nmuch more just to become a soldier and waited so long to have his \nheroism officially recognized with the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  It is hard to sum up my respect and admiration for my great colleague \nand friend from Hawaii. Our friendship has spanned many decades now, \nand we call each other truly brothers. We are brothers. I can think of \nno man I respect more.\n  Last month, Senator Reid came to the floor to honor Senator Inouye's \nservice during World War II, also. Senator Reid said:\n\n       Dan Inouye is a step above all of us.\n\n  I agree with Senator Reid. As a World War II veteran, I am here to \nsalute Dan Inouye. His courage and bravery and sense of duty are an \ninspiration to not only his Senate colleagues, but I feel to all \nAmericans. In a time when men made the extraordinary seem ordinary, Dan \nInouye stood out as a hero among men.\n  I would like to read part of the citation for action that resulted in \nSenator Inouye's Congressional Medal of Honor. Senator Inouye was \nrecognized for valor in combat in the Italian campaign in a battle just \n17 days before V-E Day. The citation says:\n\n       With complete disregard for his personal safety, Second \n     Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope to within \n     five yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two \n     grenades, destroying the emplacement. Before the enemy could \n     retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine gun \n     nest. Although wounded by a sniper's bullet, he continued to \n     engage other hostile positions at close range until an \n     exploding grenade shattered his right arm.\n  Despite the intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to \ndirect his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men were \nagain deployed in defensive positions. In the attack, 25 enemy soldiers \nwere killed and eight others captured. By his gallant, aggressive \ntactics and by his indomitable leadership, Second Lieutenant Inouye \nenabled his platoon to advance through formidable resistance, and was \ninstrumental in the capture of the ridge. Second Lieutenant Inouye's \nextraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the \nhighest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, \nhis unit, and the United States Army.\n  On the battlefield and in Congress, Dan Inouye has faithfully served \nour country, his state of Hawaii, and the men and women of the \nmilitary.\n  It is men such as Dan Inouye who inspired the phrase the ``Greatest \nGeneration.'' I hope we remember all of them today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, yesterday we introduced a bill that would \nbring relief to some of the folks in my State of Montana. As you know, \nin the 1950s, nuclear testing was held in Nevada. Of course, from this \ntesting, there was some radiation drift. The major source of this \nradiation comes from nuclear explosions from a Nevada test site, which \nis located about 65 miles north of Las Vegas.\n  In studies by the National Cancer Institute, and a report that was \nrecently released by the National Academy of Sciences, we find that the \nState of Montana was left out of any compensation that was given to \nvictims of downwind exposure to radiation. In fact, according to the \nNational Cancer Institute, certain areas of Montana have been exposed \nto the highest dose, ranging from 12 rads to 16 rads. The National \nCancer Institute's charts give you some idea of the effects of the \nnuclear test site in Nevada. Of course, up in our part of the country, \nwe fall victim to southwesterly winds. If you notice, my State of \nMontana shows up with more darker red areas on the chart than any other \nregion of the\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\nUnited States, which means that we received some of the highest doses \nof radiation.\n  Montana is home to 15 of the 25 counties with the highest radiation \ndosage nationwide and the county receiving the highest dose in the \ncountry is Meagher County, MT.\n  Individuals who were affected from this nuclear testing are often \ncalled downwinders--because the wind carried the poisonous Iodine-131 \nnorth, when the gravity finally kicked in and it settled to the ground. \nPeople can be exposed to radiation from nuclear testing fallout through \nexternal radiation like a plume or a cloud passing over a region. They \ncan also be exposed by radioactivity deposited on the ground and \nremaining there for long periods of time, or by the internal exposure \nto radioactivity that accumulates in the body from inhalation or \ningestion of plants, meat or milk. Milk is the primary source of \nIodine-131 and disproportionately affects milk drinkers. Who drinks \nmilk? Children and babies who are the most vulnerable of our society.\n  This discussion leads us to the topic of thyroid cancer. The thyroid \ngland will absorb about 30 percent of radioactive Iodine-131 in the \nhuman body. Thyroid cancer is slow in development as it takes 10 to 40 \nyears to manifest itself. This means that radiation exposure in the \nlate 1950s might not manifest as cancer until the 1990s.\n  This chart compares the rates of thyroid cancer nationwide and in my \nstate of Montana. Between years 1989 and 2003, the rate of thyroid \ncancer diagnosis nationwide increased by 38 percent. At the same time, \nthe thyroid cancer rate in my State of Montana increased by a whopping \n127 percent.\n  The 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act and RECA Amendments of \n2000 offer lump-sum payments of $50,000 to civilians who were living in \nStates deemed as downwind from the nuclear testing in Nevada and who \ncontracted a specific type of cancer. States where downwinders can \ncurrently receive compensation include Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. It is \nimportant to note that Montana was not included under this law. Yet a \nreport just released by the National Academy of Sciences shows that \nMontana received the highest radiation dosage.\n  Accordingly, a most recent study on this issue shows the absorbed \nradiation dose to the thyroid of a person born in 1948 who resided for \nthe entire period in Montana is 250 milligrays. This dosage is higher \nthan most, if not all, regions presently eligible for compensation \nunder RECA.\n  My bill, S. 977, would allow Montanans who were adversely affected by \nthis nuclear testing to be counted among those folks currently eligible \nto receive $50,000 in compensation. Those eligible for $50,000 would \nalso receive compensation in the form of free medical treatments for \nthe diseases they have contracted from the exposure.\n  The fact is, Montanans were involuntarily subjected to increased risk \nof injury and disease in order to serve the national security interests \nof the United States, and they deserve our compassion and our support.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support S. 977, to expand RECA \nto victims in the State of Montana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Montana for \ndoing something about this problem. It is a huge problem. He has \nidentified it. He has some solutions, he has some ideas, and we will \nwork with him, as I am sure other Senators will in States also affected \nby this problem. I compliment him for raising the issue and finding a \nsolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4862-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADLER PLANETARIUM'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Thursday, May 12, 2005, the Adler \nPlanetarium, the first planetarium in America and in the Western \nHemisphere, will mark its 75th anniversary.\n  Max Adler recognized a need to exhibit artifacts from the history of \nastronomy to the public, and so he founded the Adler Planetarium and \nAstronomy Museum in 1930. Originally, it housed a collection of about \n500 astronomical, navigational, and mathematical instruments that would \nbecome the foundation for Alder's History of Astronomy Collection. \nToday, this collection has grown to almost 2000 astronomical artifacts \ndating from the 12th to the 20th centuries. Included in this collection \nis the world's oldest known window sundial from 1529; a telescope made \nby William Herschel, the astronomer who discovered Uranus; and a \ncollection of rare books comprising more than 2000 volumes, some of \nwhich were printed before the 1500s.\n  Over the past 75 years, the Adler's history has been marked by \nseveral milestones. In 1933, light from the star Arcturus was \nsuccessfully converted into electrical signals that turned on the \nlights for the opening ceremonies of the 1933 Century of Progress \nExposition. In 1964, the Adler Planetarium partnered with the National \nScience Foundation and began offering the Astro-Science Workshop, a \nprogram designed to challenge Chicago area high school students who \ndemonstrate an exceptional aptitude for science.\n  In 1999, the Adler Planetarium underwent renovations that produced \nthe Sky Pavilion, a 60,000 square-foot glass-enclosed addition that \nincludes five new exhibit galleries and a cafe overlooking the \nlakefront and the Chicago skyline. The highlight of this renovation is \nthe StarRider Theater, which, through the use of state-of-the-art \ncomputer projection technologies and a sophisticated audience \nparticipation system, creates a 3-D virtual reality experience for all \nthose who visit.\n  Earlier this year, the Adler Planetarium was selected by NASA as the \neducation partner for the Interstellar Boundary Explorer mission to be \nlaunched in 2008. This mission will examine the characteristics of the \nregion of space between the solar system and deep space where the solar \nwind protects Earth and the rest of the solar system from cosmic \nradiation.\n  I know that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Adler \nPlanetarium on this important day. I hope all who are involved with the \nPlanetarium will take pride in their important work as they celebrate \nthis anniversary, and I wish them continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4862-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4862-S4863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                PRIVATE FIRST CLASS ROBERT W. MURRAY JR.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nWestfield. Robert Murray, 21 years old, died on April 29 when a bomb \nexploded beside his vehicle during a reconnaissance mission in Tal \nAfar. With his entire life before him, Robert risked everything to \nfight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land \nhalfway around the world.\n  After graduating from Westfield High School in 2002, Robert attended \nIndiana State University where he studied aviation management. He was a \nlicensed pilot and a musician who decided to join the Army because of \nfamily history and a sense of patriotism and duty after the tragic \nevents of 9/11. Friends and colleagues remember him as a determined and \nwell-liked individual with a good sense of humor. His mother Katrina \nMurray released a statement praising her son's heroism, saying, ``From \nan early age, Robert wanted to enter the military. This was the path he \nchose, and I want to honor his choice by remembering him as a hero who \nserved his country proudly and made the ultimate sacrifice. He will be \nmissed by our entire family and his many friends. He brought so much \njoy and laughter.'' I stand here today to express the same sentiments \nof pride in this young Hoosier and gratitude for his sacrifices and for \nthose made by the Murray family on behalf of our country.\n  Robert was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 2nd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry \nRegiment, based in Fort Carson, CO. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his father Robert W. Murray Sr. his mother Katrina and his two \nsisters.\n  Today, I join Robert's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Robert, a memory that will burn\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nbrightly during these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Robert was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Robert will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Robert's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Robert's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Robert W. Murray, Jr. in the \nofficial record of the Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nRobert's can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said, \n``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away \ntears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Robert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4863-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRIVATE FIRST CLASS DARREN DEBLANC\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I also rise today with a heavy heart and \ndeep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nEvansville. Darren DeBlanc, 20 years old, died on April 29 when a \nroadside bomb exploded during his patrol in Baghdad. With his entire \nlife before him, Darren risked everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2003 graduate of Reitz High School, Darren was only 2 weeks away \nfrom returning home to Evansville when this tragedy occurred. In March, \nhe had been decorated for his bravery in Iraq with a Purple Heart, \nafter surviving an earlier bomb attack. Darren had a carefully laid \nplan for his life: he intended to finish his 3-year commitment to the \nArmy, then take classes in law enforcement in the hopes of boosting his \napplication to join the Evansville police force with his brother. \nFriends and family recount that he was an outgoing, driven, and \npersonable young man with a promising future ahead of him. His mother \nJudy Woolard told a local television station, ``I know if he is looking \ndown on us, he is very proud with the way his life ended because if he \nwas to go, this was the way, trying to help other people.'' I stand \nhere today to express Indiana's gratitude for Darren's sacrifices and \nfor those made by his family on behalf of our country.\n  Darren was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom.

Mr. President, this is National Women's Health Week, and \nit is certainly fitting to take stock of both our successes in \npromoting women's health while looking at the challenges ahead.\n  Historically, women's health care needs have been poorly understood. \nWhile the obvious differences between the sexes are indisputable, it \nwas assumed that those differences had limited implications, resulting \nin women being systematically excluded from health research studies. \nToo often, only men were studied and considered the health care \n``norm'' for both genders.\n  Of course, for a few diseases such as ovarian or breast cancer, the \nstudy of women was an absolute requirement. However, for so many \nothers, women were excluded. Sometimes we heard that it would cost more \nto include women in trials because more participants would need to be \nenrolled--since research results would need to be analyzed separately \nfor both men and women. That certainly sounds like a recognition that \nmen and women can differ quite substantially.\n  As researchers have looked, they have found so many times where a \nsingle difference between the sexes has so many other ramifications for \nhealth and disease. For example, because every child is genetically \nunique and different from both parents, childbearing requires the \nability of a woman to have periods of lowered immunity in her \nreproductive tract. This is also a major contributor to her \nsusceptibility to gynecologic infections, and it helps explain why \nwomen are much more susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases. This \nis critical knowledge when one is trying to protect women from HIV and \nthat knowledge simply must be reflected in strategies for protecting \nwomen.\n  Remember that men and women differ genetically--that was obvious from \nour earliest study of genetics . . . an entire chromosome is different. \nAs we learn more about the human genome, and how genes interact, we \ndoubtless will discover more differences which must be reflected in \nhealth decisions. There can be no doubt that whenever we fail to see \nwomen properly represented in health research, we risk causing major \nharm. One recent example is so notable.\n  When one federally funded study examined the ability of aspirin to \nprevent heart attacks in 20,000 medical doctors, all of whom were men, \nphysicians were left to assume that the protective effect may apply to \nwomen as well. So for years physicians have been left to assume that \naspirin had the same effect in women but we simply didn't know. Yet we \ndo know that the pattern of heart disease in women is different than in \nmen. Heart disease develops a bit later about 10 years later. Despite \nthis, heart disease kills more women than men, more than either breast \nor ovarian cancer! So in March of this year when we finally learned \nthat aspirin does not have the same effect in women as in men, we saw \nmore evidence that assuming there is no difference between men and \nwomen is no substitute for conducting proper research.\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\n  Sex differences in health are so numerous. Osteoporosis is far more \ncommon in women--as is depression. While women have the ability to \nmodulate our immunity to bear a child, it is ironic that we suffer far \nmore autoimmune disease than men. For example, 9 of 10 lupus sufferers \nare women! Drugs and alcohol affect us differently from men as well \neven a woman's response to anesthesia is different than a man's. So one \ncan see it is a critical problem when we fail to discover such \ndifferences. It compromises the quality of health care for more than \nhalf of all Americans!\n  Many of us have worked for years to achieve equal representation of \nwomen in health research. Since 1990 when the Society for Women's \nHealth Research was founded, we have had a voice to help us in our \neffort to promote the inclusion of women in health care research, and \nto educate all of us about sex differences in health and disease. The \nSociety is to be commended for its tireless efforts to increase our \nunderstanding of sex differences.\n  Today we know that equity does not yet exist in health care, and we \nhave a long way to go. Progress has been made--we have seen an Office \nof Women's Health established at the NIH, and the research at the \nInstitutes has reflected that representation. In fact, we see that not \nonly women but also children and minorities are being better \nrepresented in health research today.\n  I introduced the Women's Health Office Act to help address the sex-\nbased disparities in research and policy. This legislation provides \npermanent authorization for offices of women's health in five Federal \nagencies: the Department of Health and Human Services; the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention; the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality; the Health Resources and Services Administration; and the Food \nand Drug Administration. Currently, only two women's health offices in \nthe Federal Government have statutory authorization: the Office of \nResearch on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health and the \nOffice for Women's Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration.\n  With some offices established, but not authorized, the needs of women \ncould be compromised without the consent of Congress. We must create \nstatutory authority for these offices, to ensure that health policy \nflows from fact, not assumption. Improving the health of American women \nrequires a far greater understanding of women's health needs and \nconditions, and ongoing evaluation in the areas of research, education, \nprevention, treatment and the delivery of services and passage of this \nlegislation will help ensure that.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, \nwhich will ensure better health for our mothers, our sisters, our \ndaughters, here and abroad.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4864-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL HEPATITIS B AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the week of \nMay 9, 2005 as National Hepatitis B Awareness Week.\n  I thank Senator Santorum, who introduced this resolution with me, as \nwell as Senators Specter, Stabenow, Inouye, and Durbin who cosponsored \nit.\n  In the United States today, more than 1.25 million Americans are \ninfected with hepatitis B. Chronic hepatitis B is often called a \n``silent disease'' because more than two-thirds of patients infected \nwith the disease have no symptoms or their symptoms go unrecognized.\n  Chronic hepatitis B infection is a potentially life threatening \ndisease that may lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure and \nliver cancer. More than half a million people worldwide die each year \nfrom primary liver cancer, and up to 80 percent of primary liver \ncancers are caused by chronic hepatitis B. In the United States, more \nthan one million people have developed chronic hepatitis B infection \nand more than 5,000 Americans die from hepatitis B and hepatitis B-\nrelated liver complications each year.\n  Despite these alarming statistics, however, it is estimated that only \na small percentage of chronic hepatitis B patients are currently \nreceiving treatment for their disease. Approximately 15 to 40 percent \nof chronically infected hepatitis B patients will develop liver disease \ndue to long-term exposure. Of chronic hepatitis B patients who develop \ncirrhosis, almost half of them may die within five years because of the \nhigh risk of liver cancer associated with the progression of the \ndisease.\n  Upon closer examination of hepatitis B, researchers have found \nalarmingly disproportionate rates of infection among Asian Pacific \nIslanders and African Americans. In the U.S., as many as one out of ten \nAsian Pacific Islanders Americans are chronically infected with the \nhepatitis B virus.\n  California has initiated a number of programs to ensure that we are \nworking to stop the transmission of Hepatitis B through vaccine \nprograms and disease management programs intended to make living with \nthe disease more comfortable.\n  I recognize the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health \nOrganizations, AAPCHO, which is based in Oakland, CA, and the partners \nacross the country with whom they are working to demystify and educate \ncitizens about hepatitis B.\n  During National Hepatitis B Awareness Week, the ``AIM for the B: \nAwareness, Involvement and Mobilization for Chronic Hepatitis B'' \ncampaign will consist of a series of local awareness forums and \neducational roundtables featuring doctors, patients and families and \npatient advocates. Two will be held in California--one in San Francisco \nand one in San Jose--in addition to various other sites around the \ncountry to raise awareness and open the dialogue about chronic \nhepatitis B, prevention, disease management, and future advances.\n  It is my hope that National Hepatitis B Awareness Week will raise the \nprofile of hepatitis B, facilitate open dialogue about what we can do \nin our families and communities to stop the transmission of this \ndisease and arm ourselves with the knowledge to fight back against \nhepatitis B.\n  We possess the weapons to combat hepatitis B, including vaccination \nand treatment. For those infected, treatment options exist that are \ndesigned to stop the progression of liver disease and reduce liver \ndamage. As we recognize National Hepatitis B Awareness Week, I \nencourage Americans who may be at risk for chronic hepatitis B to get \ntested for the disease, and physicians and patients to understand there \nis a large group of patients who do need treatment right now.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the great strides made \nin hepatitis B awareness and treatment and acknowledge the ongoing \nbattle during National Hepatitis B Awareness Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4864-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4864-S4865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF MIGUEL CONTRERAS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend and fellow Californian Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer of \nthe Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO who died suddenly \nof a heart attack on Friday, May 6 at the age of 52.\n  Working families and the Latino community lost a great champion with \nthe passing of Miguel Contreras.\n  As the son of migrant farmworkers Miguel also labored in the \nagriculture fields of California. Yet through his passion to ensure \nequity and fairness for workers, Miguel advanced to become one of the \npremier leaders in the local, State, and national labor movement.\n  As a young man Miguel worked with Cesar Chavez of the United Farm \nWorkers Union to organize farm workers to secure improved working \nconditions and better wages.\n  In 1996, Miguel became the executive secretary-treasurer of the Los \nAngeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO.\n  Under his leadership the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor grew \nto become a powerful voice for working men and women of Los Angeles \nCounty.\n  Miguel was the driving force behind the transformation of an \norganization that went from a union of 125,000 members to a multi-\nethnic coalition of union workers now nearly 800,000 strong.\n  Through his leadership Miguel led a union-sponsored grass roots \npolitical drive that played a significant role in deciding the outcome \nof five Los Angeles congressional seats and countless state and local \nraces.\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n  Miguel tirelessly spent his life working to empower others, no matter \ntheir station in life.\n  While Miguel Contreras may be remembered most for his tenacity as a \nlabor leader and role model for the Latino community, his efforts to \nsecure a better future for American workers everywhere will live on.\n  My deepest sympathy goes out to his wife Maria Elena Durazo and their \ntwo sons, Michael and Mario.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to inform you of the \npassing of Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer for the Los Angeles \nCounty Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. I would like to take a few moments \nto recognize the many important accomplishments of Miguel Contreras and \nthe tremendous impact he made on the labor movement.\n  Miguel led the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor for nearly a \ndecade. During his tenure, he continuously fought for the rights of \nlaborers, and did so with great success. Through his guidance and \nleadership, The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor entered a period \nof unprecedented advancement and success.\n  Miguel Contreras was a man with humble beginnings. The son of farm \nworkers, he began working in the fields of California's Central Valley \nat a very young age. With his early exposure to the difficult life of a \nfarm worker, he quickly joined the ranks of political activists in \nlabor as a volunteer with the United Farm Workers of America. He stood \nwith Cesar Chavez and the UFW during their national grape boycott, and \ncontinued the fight for workers for the remaining years of his life.\n  In 1996, Miguel Contreras became the first Latino to win the post of \nsecretary-treasurer for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, \nAFL-CIO--comprising 350 local unions and more than 800,000 members. \nUnder his leadership, The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor had \nseen phenomenal growth. He coordinated many successful labor rights \nvictories including the labor dispute of 2000 when 8,500 janitors from \nService Employees International Union, SEIU, Local 1877 fought for and \nwon a higher standard of living and better working conditions.\n  Fighting for the rights of laborers was at the core of Miguel \nContreras' beliefs, an attribute which made him a great leader for \nlaborers throughout the State of California. He cared about regular \npeople and timelessly worked for their welfare.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the many mourning \nmembers of the labor community in recognizing and honoring Miguel \nContreras for his guidance and life-long effort in fighting to improve \nthe lives of laborers.

Mr. President, as Members of Congress, we have the unique \nopportunity to participate in special exchange programs in which \ntalented individuals from other branches of government can work \ntemporarily in our offices as legislative fellows or detailees. These \ninitiatives promote efficiency in the business of government by \ndeveloping mutually beneficial relationships between the executive and \nlegislative branches of government.\n  As Members, we have the opportunity to meet these experts and benefit \nfrom their insight, knowledge and experience. One such expert in my \noffice just celebrated 26 years of service to the USDA Forest Service. \nKenneth Karkula is currently serving a 1-year fellowship in my office \nthrough the Brookings Institute. Building on his extensive experience, \nhe has made invaluable contributions to several issues important to \nIdaho in the area of natural resources, the environment and energy. In \nthe short time since his arrival, he has become an invaluable asset to \nmy staff, filling in during recent permanent staff vacancies and being \nwilling to do whatever is asked of him.\n  Ken is on detail from his position as National Concessions Program \nManager for the Forest Service. His public service career started when \nhe fought wildland fires in the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. He then \nserved as a District Resource Staff Officer in Arizona and New Mexico \nand, in 1992, moved to the position of Forest Recreation Staff Officer \nin Lake Tahoe, CA. In 1996, he took his current position at the USDA \nForest Service Headquarters, a tremendous culmination of many hard-\nworking years. Ken's knowledge of U.S. environmental and Federal land \nmanagement policies, coupled with his experience in on-the-ground \nimplementation of these policies over the years, gives him a unique and \ncritical perspective of Federal land management issues that benefit me \nas I help explore updating and enhancing decades-old environmental \npolicies and practices.\n  I congratulate Ken on his many years of successful work and \ndedication to the American public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4865-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4865-S4866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEW ISLAMIC CENTER OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to The Islamic Center of America, one of the \nfirst Islamic institutions in North America. On May 12, the Center will \ncelebrate the completion of its new mosque complex in Dearborn, which \nwill have the distinction of being the largest mosque in the United \nStates. The festivities will continue with a grand banquet to be held \non May 14. These events will bring together Muslims, as well as many \nothers, from Michigan and around the country.\n  The Islamic Center of America traces its origin to the 1940s when \nMuslim immigrants from Lebanon and Syria began settling in Detroit and \nthus sought to bring a religious leader from the Middle East to the \nDetroit area to serve their community. A young author and scholar, Imam \nMohammed Jawas Chirri, was the choice, arriving from Lebanon in \nFebruary 1949. When the newly-formed Islamic Center Foundation Society \nwas established in 1954, Imam Chirri became its new leader and soon \nafter they decided to build a new religious center.\n  In his efforts to raise funds for the new center, Imam Chirri visited \nEgypt in 1959 and successfully secured support for the project. The \nSociety purchased land owned by the Ford Motor Company located on Joy \nRoad and Greenfield in Detroit. On September 20, 1963, the Islamic \nCenter of America first opened its doors. The building consisted of a \nlarge domed prayer room, lecture hall, kitchen, offices, and two \nclassrooms. Following the opening of the mosque, families of the \nIslamic Center began to move into the area. By 1967, the Center had \nalready outgrown\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\nthis space. Additional classrooms, an enlarged social hall, and a \nminaret were added to serve the growing membership.\n  In 1997, Imam Hassan Al-Qazwini, his wife and their three children \nmoved from California to Detroit to join The Islamic Center of America. \nUnder his leadership and guidance, the Center has continued to \nflourish. Outgrowing the location on Joy Road, the Center began \nconstruction of a new religious center on Ford Road in Dearborn in \n1999, near the Center's existing grade school, the Muslim American \nYouth Academy. The new mosque, which is located along a stretch of Ford \nRoad that is home to several churches, including St. Sarkis Armenian \nApostolic Church, St. Clement Ohridski Orthodox Church, Warrendale \nCommunity Church, St. Thomas Aquinas Roman Catholic Church, and Prince \nof Peace Lutheran Church, which is also home to People of the Book Arab \nChristian Church, will be the largest in the United States. At an \nestimated cost of between $8,000,000 and $10,000,000, the new mosque \ncomplex will accommodate 1,000 individuals at prayer time, and will \nhouse a large auditorium, social hall, and 14 additional rooms for the \nschool.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating The Islamic Center of \nAmerica on this significant achievement and in recognizing its many \nyears of service to the Muslim American community in Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4866-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO DR. GERALD ``CARTY'' MONETTE\n\n Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary \nscholar, leader, and friend, Dr. Gerald ``Carty'' Monette.\n  For more than 30 years, Dr. Monette, a member of the Turtle Mountain \nBand of Chippewa, has been a leader in the tribal college movement \nnationwide, and more specifically, at Turtle Mountain Community College \nin Belcourt, ND. When the college opened its doors on the reservation \nin 1972, Dr. Monette served as its director, and in 1978 he assumed the \npresidency of the institution.\n  During his tenure, Dr. Monette spearheaded an incredible \ntransformation of the college with an added result of his determination \nbeing a remarkable increase in the ability of all American Indians to \ngain access to higher education opportunities. In 1973, under his \nleadership, Turtle Mountain Community College joined with five other \ntribal colleges to create the American Indian Higher Education \nConsortium--AIHEC--to provide a support network for member \ninstitutions. Today, AIHEC is composed of tribal colleges and \nuniversities located in 13 States, serving American Indian students \nfrom over 250 federally recognized tribes.\n  Prior to the opening of Turtle Mountain Community College, those \nliving on the reservation had no access to higher education. \nUnemployment and high school dropout rates were both very high. The \ncollege started from very humble beginnings, offering its first courses \non the third floor of an abandoned Catholic convent, with less than 60 \nstudents and only three full-time faculty members. Today, it has grown \nto serve over 650 students, with more than 150 courses and 65 full- and \npart-time faculty members, which is due in large part to Dr. Monette's \ndedication and leadership.\n  One of the many highlights of Dr. Monette's professional life was \nrealization of his vision for a new campus for the college. He led the \neffort to secure the needed funds to construct the facility, which is \nlocated on a 123-acre site. The 105,000 square-foot facility includes \nstate-of-the-art technology, general classroom space, science and \nengineering labs, a library, learning resource center, and a gymnasium. \nThis beautiful new campus stands as a shining testament to Dr. \nMonette's untiring dedication to the cause of increasing access to \npostsecondary opportunities in Indian Country.\n  Under Dr. Monette's leadership, Turtle Mountain Community College \nalso expanded from an institution of higher learning to one of the \ncommunity's pillars of economic development and opportunity through the \ncreation of the Center for New Growth and Economic Development. Working \nwith tribal leadership, the center has embarked on several projects to \nstrengthen the community's ability to grow and become more economically \nindependent. Some of the many projects taken on by the center include a \nvery successful wind energy program, a review of the tribe's \nconstitution, a school reform initiative designed to improve student \nperformance, and a program to reintroduce traditional Native American \nfoods into the diets of tribal members, which will yield tremendously \npositive health benefits.\n  Dr. Monette has been a true agent of positive change in the lives of \nthousands of students who have passed through Turtle Mountain Community \nCollege during his tenure. He has been a true champion for higher \neducation and a powerful national advocate for the tribal colleges. His \npassion is infectious, and he has motivated everyone to reach to their \ngoals no matter how small or large.\n  Dr. Monette has dedicated his life's work to the greater good. After \n27 years as president of Turtle Mountain Community College, he has \ndecided to commence his well-deserved retirement, but he leaves behind \na lasting legacy that will stand for many generations. We owe Dr. \nMonette a debt of gratitude, and I wish him and his family all the very \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4866-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING HAMILTON SOUTHEASTERN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \nextraordinary class of students from Hamilton Southeastern High School \nin Fishers. These outstanding young Hoosiers competed against 50 other \nschools from across the Nation and won honorable mention as one of the \ntop ten finalists in the We the People: The Citizen and the \nConstitution national finals in Washington, D.C.\n  The motivation displayed by these students will no doubt lead them \nalong the path to becoming some of our country's future leaders.\n  It is my honor to enter the names of Ryan Arnold, Natasha Arora, \nKelsey Buckingham, Ricardo Doriott, Eddie Gillham, Worthe Holt III, \nCarolyn Homer, Kyle Lymberopoulos, Ashley Martin, Michael Matern, \nAllison Nimtz, Alex Orlowski, Laura Peregrim, Jennifer Wardell, Brian \nWhite and Marissa Wills in the official Record of the Senate for their \nremarkable understanding of the fundamental ideals and values of \nAmerican government.\n  I also want to take a moment to salute Jill Baisinger, these \nstudents' teacher, for her clear commitment to encouraging the \ncuriosity and development of our Hoosier youth and furthering their \nunderstanding of American Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4866-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4866-S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               A TRIBUTE TO DR. GERALD ``CARTY'' MONETTE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleagues have often heard me \nspeak on this floor about tribal colleges that provide higher education \nto the residents of this country's Indian reservations. For over 30 \nyears, these institutions have brought hope and opportunity to \nthousands of students who otherwise would not have had the chance to \nseek an education beyond high school.\n  There is a reason why the Nation's tribal colleges consistently \nmanage to achieve more with less than any other educational \ninstitutions in the United States--talented and committed leadership. \nOne of those leaders, Dr. Gerald ``Carty'' Monette, has been part of \nthe tribal college movement since its inception. As the president of \nTurtle Mountain Community College since 1978, he has seen his \ninstitution grow from a handful of students gathering in an abandoned \nconvent and a series of trailers in Belcourt, ND, to an enrollment of \n650 meeting in a state-of-the-art building in a setting that reflects \nthe sacred grounds of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.\n  Dr. Monette's modest and self-effacing manner belies a strong and \ndetermined leader who has inspired hundreds of graduates of Turtle \nMountain Community College. He had an early understanding of the ... \nrelationship between education, economic development, and community \npartnerships. As a result, the college today boasts the Center for New \nGrowth that is a regional center for economic development; he wanted \nthe College to have energy independence and today there is a wind and \ngeothermal energy center at the College.\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\n  Not only has Dr. Monette been a leader at Turtle Mountain, he has \nbeen a national leader as one of the founders of the American Indian \nHigher Education Consortium, AIHEC, and has served several terms as \npresidents of the consortium. AIHEC has been the heart and soul of the \ntribal college movement and under Dr. Monette's leadership it began an \naggressive telecommunications initiative that is enhancing communities \nthroughout Indian country.\n  As Dr. Monette prepares to apply his leadership and vision to other \neducational pursuits, I wish him and his wife, Dr. Loretta DeLong, a \nTurtle Mountain Community College graduate, the very best. He has left \na lasting legacy for his fellow members of the Turtle Mountain Band of \nChippewa and their children. We join them honoring this exceptional \nman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4867-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE MISSOURI MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute \nto the Missouri Merchants and Manufacturers Association. I am very \npleased to recognize this organization for its 25 years of superior \nservice to the Missouri business community.\n  The Missouri Merchants and Manufacturers Association was formed in \n1980. With hard work and untiring commitment, the MMMA has grown into a \nstrong, well respected voice in the legislative process representing \nover 5,000 small and mid-sized businesses across the State of Missouri. \nIt is actively involved in educating MMMA members and serving as an \nadvocate on State legislative issues impacting businesses.\n  While Governor of Missouri, I found that the MMMA's active \ninvolvement in State legislative issues provided a vital resource. As \nchairman of the Committee on Small Business, I highly value the \ninsights they have shared on numerous issues of great importance to \nAmerica's business. MMMA is a vital link in spearheading the causes of \nsmall business.\n  Over the past 25 years the MMMA has been instrumental in repealing \nthe Merchants and Manufacturers Inventory Tax. The association has \nassisted in the passage of more than 35 bills in addition to winning \nthree lawsuits before the Missouri Supreme Court. Collectively the \nMMMA's achievements have saved small and medium sized businesses more \nthan $400 million.\n  The quality individuals that comprise the MMMA epitomize the kind of \ndedication, work ethic and ideals necessary to meet the ongoing \nchallenges and demands of the business community. Their leadership has \ninfluenced passage of important legislation and provided dependable \nresources in many court cases to benefit employers. The Missouri \nMerchants and Manufacturers Association celebrated its 25th anniversary \non January 7, 2005. It is my great pleasure to congratulate the MMMA \nfor this significant accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4867-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING RIVERSIDE MAYOR RON LOVERIDGE\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mayor Loveridge has been honored as the 2005 Distinguished \nCitizen of the Inland Empire by the Inland Empire Council of Boy Scouts \nof America.\n  As mayor of the city of Riverside, Ron Loveridge lends his time and \nleadership to many organizations committed to the vitality and progress \nof his community. Last year, he served the State of California as \npresident of the League of Cities. Among the organizations that have \nhonored him for his impressive record of service are the American \nPlanning Association, the California Preservation Foundation, the \nUnited Way, and the Youth Service Center.\n  In addition to his thoughtful leadership as mayor, Ron Loveridge has \ngiven the city of Riverside his personal commitment for 40 years. A \nprofessor of political science at the University of California, \nRiverside, since 1965, Dr. Ron Loveridge has used his knowledge and \nexpertise to enrich students' understanding of and interest in the \ninner workings of local government. He has provided a model of \nconscientious citizenship, volunteering his time to advance the \nendeavors of the Riverside Arts Foundation, the Riverside County \nPhilharmonic, and the Dickens Festival.\n  In 1998, Mayor Ron Loveridge was meeting with council members and \nstaff in City Hall when a man entered and shot his gun several times. \nGiven the circumstances, it is a miracle that no one was killed. Mayor \nLoveridge was hit in the back of the neck, the bullet just missing his \nspinal cord. I met with him just after the shooting and was amazed at \nhis grace and good will following such an event. He has gone on to lead \nhis city in a similar manner, always showing grace and good will even \nin the toughest of times.\n  I applaud Ronald Loveridge for his lifetime of public service and am \npleased to invite you to join me in congratulating him as he is honored \nas the Boy Scouts of America Inland Empire Council's 2005 Distinguished \nCitizen of the Inland Empire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4867-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF VFW POST 1881\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \ntoday to recognize a very special milestone that will take place in my \nhome State in the coming days. On June 18, 2005, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars Post 1881 in Cheyenne, WY will celebrate its 75th \nanniversary. In 1930, veterans Harry Leon and Earnest Lissner founded \nVFW Post 1881. With 69 members and 7 honorary members, the first \nmeeting was conducted in a private home in Cheyenne. After a series of \nmoves and 32 years later, VFW Post 1881 established and built its \npermanent facility at 2816 East 7th Street in 1962.\n  Since its founding, Post 1881 has grown in membership and has become \na lasting positive fixture in the community. The veterans of the Post \nare a strong pillar of family support for the Active-Duty, Reserve and \nGuard personnel of F.E. Warren Air Force Base and the State of Wyoming. \nThe members of VFW Post 1881 remain dedicated to our older and ailing \nveterans with a large contingency of volunteers who visit patients in \nthe VA Medical Center in Cheyenne and Veterans Homes in Buffalo, \nWyoming and Scottsbluff, NE. They are strong supporters of the Army \nJunior Reserve Officer Training Corps, and through private fundraising \nefforts have built two outstanding softball fields for the Cheyenne \nThunder Girls Softball Association. As an exclusive project of the \nPost, these dedicated veterans offer new American flags to local \nbusinesses and individuals at no cost to replace frayed and damaged \nflags, while properly disposing of the exchanged flags. The Post's \nLadies Auxiliary carries on numerous projects benefiting the \nenvironment and the community, and independently raises funds for \nhomeless and hospitalized veterans. So it is a distinct honor to come \nbefore the Senate and congratulate the veterans of VFW Post 1881 on \ntheir 75th Anniversary.

A bill to amend the Exchange Rates and International Economic \nPolicy Coordination Act of 1988 to clarify the definition of \nmanipulation with respect to currency, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \ncurrency policies and to offer a bill, the Fair Currency Practices Act \nof 2005, that will address key concerns regarding the Treasury \nDepartment's statutory review and reporting requirements on currency \nmanipulation. In particular, this bill strengthens Treasury's hand in \naddressing currency manipulation, including the current practices of \ncountries such as China.\n  Through the practice of pegging its currency to the dollar, China \nartificially maintains the yuan, at 8.28 per dollar. While economists \ndiffer over the extent that China's currency is undervalued, it is \noften estimated to be undervalued by as much as fifteen to forty \npercent, rendering Chinese manufactured goods cheaper in the U.S.--and \nU.S. manufactured goods more expensive in China.\n  China's deliberate and unfair currency practices have contributed to \nour Nation's trade deficit with China, reaching a record $162 billion \nlast year. The yuan's undervaluation has had a profound impact on our \nNation's manufacturing sector--particularly on U.S. manufacturing \nemployment.\n  As Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, Co-Chair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, \nand a Senator from a State with a rich history in manufacturing, I am \nkeenly aware of this issue's importance. Indeed, our manufacturers--who \nare integral to our economic security and national defense--\nunjustifiably struggle to compete with countries that disregard their \ninternational obligations.\n  The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission released a \nreport today, which focuses on China's exchange rate problem. In the \nreport, the Commission notes that foreign exchange markets are sending \nclear signals that China should revalue its yuan, and that in recent \nyears all major currencies have adjusted upward with the exception of \nChina's. The Commission explains that an appreciation of foreign \ncurrencies is needed to help correct the U.S. current account deficit.\n  In the report, the Commission discusses the value of improving the \nprocess by which the Treasury Department assesses and reports upon the \nissue of foreign countries' currency manipulation. The legislation that \nI offer today, which is cosponsored by Senator Dole, makes substantial \nimprovements to that process.\n  Chair Manzullo, my counterpart in the House of Representatives is \noffering this bill today in the House. I thank him for his leadership \non issues affecting our Nation's small businesses, and particularly for \nhis efforts on behalf of our Nation's manufacturers.\n  Specifically, the legislation amends the Exchange Rates and Economic \nPolicy Coordination Act of 1988, to clarify that a country is \nmanipulating its currency if it is engaged in ``protracted large-scale \nintervention in one direction in the exchange market.''\n  The legislation also amends the 1988 Act to eliminate the necessity \nthat a country have both a material global current account surplus and \na significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States, before \nthe Secretary of the Treasury is required to enter into negotiations \nwith the offending country to end its unfair practices. The change \nrequires such negotiations if there is either a material global current \naccount surplus or a significant bilateral trade surplus with the \nUnited States.\n  Currently, the Treasury Department, the International Monetary Fund, \nand others rely largely upon suspect Chinese data in determining \nChina's trade balance with other countries. The legislation's final \nprovision instructs the Treasury Department to undertake an exercise \nexamining China's trade surplus. The investigation would include an \nanalysis of why China's reported trade surplus with the U.S. and other \ncountries differs from that reported by China's trading partners. The \nlegislation requires that the Treasury Department submit a report of \nits investigation to Congress.\n  Representative Manzullo and I will continue to collaborate on \naddressing unfair currency practices by offending countries. We Are \nboth well aware of the negative effects these practices have on our \nNation's small businesses. One of our combined efforts commissioned a \nGeneral Accounting Office study which examined issues related to \nforeign government manipulation of world currency markets. That study \nis expected to be released soon.\n  As in the past, I will continue to strive to draw greater attention \nto the effects of China's currency practices\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\nand to find solutions that enable our domestic industries to compete on \na level and fair playing field.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and that a section-\nby-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Currency Practices Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL \n                   POLICY.\n\n       (a) Bilateral Negotiations.--Section 3004(b) of the \n     Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination \n     Act of 1988 (22 U.S.C. 5304(b)) is amended in the second \n     sentence by striking ``and (2)'' and inserting ``or (2)''.\n       (b) Definition of Manipulation.--Section 3006 of the \n     Exchange Rates and International Economic Policy Coordination \n     Act of 1988 (22 U.S.C. 5306) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(3) Manipulation of rate of exchange.--For purposes of \n     this Act, a country shall be considered to be manipulating \n     the rate of exchange between its currency and the United \n     States dollar if there is a protracted large-scale \n     intervention in one direction in the exchange markets. The \n     Secretary may find that a country is manipulating the rate of \n     exchange based on any other factor or combination of \n     factors.''.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     undertake an examination, and submit a report to Congress, \n     regarding the trade surplus of the People's Republic of \n     China. The Secretary shall examine why the trade surplus with \n     the United States and other countries reported by the \n     People's Republic of China differs from the trade surplus \n     reported by the other countries. The report shall also \n     quantify the differences between the trade surplus reported \n     by the United States and other countries and what is reported \n     by the People's Republic of China.\n\n          Legislation Addressing China's Currency Manipulation\n\n       Background: The Exchange Rates and International Economic \n     Policy Coordination Act of 1998 (the 1998 Act) requires that \n     Treasury regularly make a determination of whether countries \n     are manipulating the rate of exchange between their currency \n     and the U.S. dollar for purposes of preventing effective \n     balance of payments adjustments or gaining an unfair \n     competitive advantage in international trade. If the \n     Secretary of Treasury considers that such manipulation is \n     occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material \n     global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant \n     bilateral trade surpluses with the United States, the \n     Secretary is required to take action to initiate negotiations \n     with such foreign countries on an expedited basis.\n       Section 1--Short Title--This Act will be known as the Fair \n     Currency Practices Act of 2005.\n       Section 2--Amendments Relating to International Financial \n     Policy.\n       (a)--Amends the Trade Act to eliminate the necessity that a \n     country have both a material global current account surplus \n     AND a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United \n     States, before the Secretary of the Treasury is required to \n     enter into negotiations with the offending country to end its \n     unfair practices. The change requires such negotiations if \n     there is either a material global current account surplus OR \n     a significant bilateral trade surplus with the United States.\n       Reasoning: Under current law, even if manipulation was \n     found, Treasury would not be required to act unless the \n     offending country has a significant bilateral trade surplus \n     with the U.S. AND a material global current account surplus. \n     The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission \n     recommended in its 2004 Report to Congress that the material \n     global current account surplus condition not be required.\n       (b)--Amends the 1988 Act to clarify that a country engaged \n     in ``protracted large-scale intervention in one direction in \n     the exchange market'' is manipulating its currency. This \n     language derives from the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) \n     Principles for Fund Surveillance Over Exchange Rate Policies.\n       Reasoning: Treasury repeatedly fails to make a \n     determination that China is manipulating its currency and the \n     Trade Act does not specifically define ``manipulating.'' This \n     provision clarifies that a country engaged in ``protracted \n     large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     market'' is manipulating its currency. The provision does not \n     preclude the Secretary of Treasury from finding a country to \n     be manipulating its rate of exchange based on any other \n     factor or combination of factors.\n       (c)--Requires that Treasury undertake an examination of \n     China's trade surplus and report on its findings. The \n     Department of Treasury should investigate why China's \n     reported trade surplus with the U.S. and other countries \n     differs from that reported by the trading partner countries. \n     The report should quantify these differences so that policy \n     makers will be better able to understand the facts behind \n     China's trade surplus.\n       Reasoning: Treasury and the IMF use official Chinese \n     statistics when determining China's global current account \n     and trade balances. China's global current account and trade \n     balance statistics differ markedly from the aggregate \n     statistics of its trading partners. This results in an \n     inaccurate depiction of China's true surplus, which is \n     presumably much larger than reported by China.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. \n        Cochran):\n  S. 985. A bill to establish kinship navigator programs, to establish \nkinship guardianship assistance payments for children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the Kinship \nCaregiver Support Act with my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia \nSnowe. I would like to acknowledge Senators Tim Johnson and Thad \nCochran who are original co-sponsors of this legislation.\n  Over the weekend, America celebrated Mother's Day, a special day when \nwe honored our mothers, whose love and nurturing sustains us throughout \nour lives. Mother's Day offers a wonderful opportunity to honor the \nmillions of mothers who offer the gifts of love and nurturing for \nchildren in need. They give so much to the most vulnerable among us, \nand too often they go unnoticed and unthanked. Many of these women earn \nthe title of Mother not through biology, but by their unconditional \nlove for children.\n  In New York alone, more than 500,000 children are cared for by non-\nparent relative caregivers. Nationwide, grandparents head 4.5 million \nhouseholds and other relatives head another 1.5 million households. \nLinda James of Rochester, NY is one such mother. She became a second-\ntime mother at the age of 41 when her granddaughter Jasmine was born \nprematurely and her daughter, Jasmine's mother, was unable to care for \nher daughter. When the hospital needed authorization to perform an \nemergency operation on tiny Jasmine, Linda stepped in and assumed \nresponsibility. Since that day, Linda has been Jasmine's only resource \nfor stability and happiness.\n  Over time, Linda, like many relative caregivers, faced many \nchallenges as she tried to raise Jasmine. Simple tasks such as \nenrolling her in school and securing health insurance were daunting \nbecause she had trouble finding basic information about how to approach \nthe process. Linda made many sacrifices to ensure Jasmine's success, \neven taking a leave of absence from her job so she could give Jasmine \nthe constant medical attention she required, but she often felt like \nthe cards were stacked against her. Emotionally, physically, and \nfinancially, the experience of raising little Jasmine was nothing short \nof exhausting.\n  Kinship caregivers like Linda are often the best chance for a loving \nand stable childhood for the children in their care, but Federal law \ndoes little to support these families. In fact, unless a child's \nparents relinquish their parental rights, and the relative caregivers \nbecome adoptive parents, kinship caregivers are no different from \nstrangers in the eyes of Federal law.\n  In these sad cases, children often linger in foster care \nunnecessarily while a stable, permanent, loving option is overlooked.\n  That is why Senator Snowe and I are introducing The Kinship Caregiver \nSupport Act. This proposal will provide relative caregivers with the \ninformation and assistance they need to thrive as non-traditional \nfamilies. This bill will link kinship families with localized \ninformation about the services and support available to them. By \ncreating one-stop centers for kinship caregivers, this bill will \nprovide essential support that will keep these families afloat. This \nlegislation will also allow States to use their Federal foster care \nfunds to provide kinship caregiver assistance payments for children \nlanguishing in foster care while a kinship caregiver stands ready to \nstep in.\n  At this time of year, when we remember and honor our mothers, let us \nalso remember the contributions that unconventional mothers make, \nmothers who each and every day go above and beyond the call of duty to \nhelp some of the most vulnerable of our children.\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 987. A bill to restore safety to Indian women; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The Restoring \nSafety to Indian Women Act'' and I look forward to working with the \nCommittee on the Judiciary to ensure that the provisions of this bill \nare given consideration, particularly as the reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act moves forward. I also wish to thank Senator \nByron Dorgan for co-sponsoring this legislation and for his dedication \nto addressing the health and welfare needs of Indian tribes.\n  This legislation creates a new Federal criminal offense authorizing \nFederal prosecutors to charge repeat domestic violence offenders before \nthey seriously injure or kill someone and to use tribal court \nconvictions for domestic violence for that purpose. It authorizes the \ncreation of tribal criminal history databases to document these \nconvictions and protection orders for use by all law enforcement. The \nbill authorizes BIA and tribal officers to make arrests for domestic \nviolence assaults committed outside of their presence and would \nauthorizes a comprehensive study of domestic violence in Indian Country \nto determine its impact to Indian tribes.\n  The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has had a tremendous impact on \nraising the national awareness of domestic violence and providing \ncommunities, including Indian tribes, the resources to respond to the \ndevastating impact of domestic violence. National studies show that one \nin four women are victims of domestic violence. Since 1999, the \nDepartment of Justice has issued various studies which report that \nIndian women experience the highest rates of domestic violence compared \nto all other groups in the United States. These reports state that one \nout of every three Indian women are victims of sexual assault; that \nfrom 1979 to 1992, homicide was the third leading cause of death of \nIndian females between the ages of 15 to 34 and that 75 percent of \nthose deaths were committed by a family member or acquaintance. These \nare startling statistics that require our close examination and a \nbetter understanding of how to prevent and respond to domestic violence \nin Indian Country.\n  Domestic violence is a national problem and not one that is unique to \nIndian Country. Yet, due to the unique status of Indian tribes, there \nare obstacles faced by Indian tribal police, Federal investigators, \ntribal and Federal prosecutors and courts that impede their ability to \nrespond to domestic violence in Indian Country. This bill is intended \nto remove these obstacles at all levels and to enhance the ability of \neach agency to respond to acts of domestic violence when they occur.\n  The division of criminal jurisdiction between Federal and tribal law \nenforcement and prosecutors working in Indian Country present \nchallenges. For example, Federal prosecutors prosecute acts of domestic \nviolence in Indian Country using the Assault or, unfortunately, the \nMurder statutes in the Major Crimes Act. These statutes require the \nprosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was \ndisfigured, suffered a serious risk of death or was killed before these \nfelony charges can be filed. Meanwhile, the research has shown that \nperpetrators of domestic violence become increasingly more violent over \ntime. Under the existing statutory scheme, these perpetrators may \nescape felony charges until they seriously injure or kill someone.\n  This bill would create a new Federal offense aimed at the habitual \ndomestic violence offender and allow tribal court convictions to count \nfor purposes of Federal felony prosecution when the perpetrator has at \nleast two separate Federal, State or tribal convictions for crimes \ninvolving assault, sexual abuse or a violent felony against a spouse or \nintimate partner. This provision is similar to many state laws that \napply a felony penalty to an individual who commits multiple offenses. \nIt will empower Indian tribal prosecutors and courts to document \ndomestic violence cases at the local level and give federal prosecutors \nthe ability to intervene in the cycle of violence by charging repeat \noffenders before they seriously injure or kill someone.\n  The bill would also encourage the use of existing grants authorized \nby the Violence Against Women Act to create tribal criminal history \ndatabases for use by Indian tribes and tribal, State and Federal law \nenforcement agencies to document final convictions, stay away orders \nand orders of protection issued by tribal courts. As I understand it, \nno such database exists today. This database would be used solely as a \nlaw enforcement and court tracking tool. It would enable tribal, State \nand Federal law enforcement officers to determine whether an individual \nis a habitual domestic violence offender and therefore subject to the \nfelony crime described above. It also would enhance the implementation \nof the criminal provisions that already exist in the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  All manner of law enforcement agencies report that responding to \ndomestic violence disturbances are among the most dangerous situations \nthat a police officer faces. Therefore, many States have enacted \nimmediate arrest or removal policies that enable responding officers to \ndiffuse these dangerous situations. Currently, the primary law \nenforcement authority for Indian tribes, the BIA police, are only \nauthorized to make an arrest without a warrant for an offense committed \nin Indian Country if the offense is committed in the presence of the \nofficer or the offense is a felony. This legislation would expand the \nauthority of the BIA police, and tribal police agencies that derive \ntheir arrest authority by contract with the BIA, to make an arrest \nwithout a warrant for a domestic violence offense when the officer has \nreasonable grounds to believe the person arrested committed the \noffense. This arrest authority will enable a responding officer to \ndiffuse the dangerous situation by arresting the perpetrator. This will \ngo a long way toward improving public safety for both the officer and \nthe domestic violence victim.\n  Finally, while the national data on the rates of violence affecting \nIndian women are astounding, we do not know the full extent to which \nIndian women residing in Indian Country are impacted by domestic \nviolence or the impact of domestic violence on Indian tribes. For \nexample, we know that nationally, domestic violence costs $4.1 billion \neach year for direct medical and mental health services and in my own \nState of Arizona, last year, police received approximately 100,000 \ndomestic violence calls, but we do not know the extent to which tribal \nprevention programs, law enforcement, court or medical intervention \nresources are similarly impacted. Therefore, this bill would require \nthat a comprehensive study be done on the scope of the domestic \nviolence problem in Indian Country.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee and the Judiciary Committee to ensure that these statistics \nbecome a record of the past. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Restoring Safety to Indian \n     Women Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) national studies indicate that Indian women experience \n     domestic and sexual assaults at a far greater rate than other \n     groups of women in the national population;\n       (2) there is relatively little data on the rate of domestic \n     violence perpetrated upon Indian women in Indian country or \n     the costs associated with responding to acts of domestic \n     violence in Indian country;\n       (3) Indian tribes have criminal jurisdiction to prosecute \n     Indians who commit violations of tribal law;\n       (4) the Federal Government has jurisdiction to prosecute \n     specific enumerated crimes that arise in Indian country under \n     section 1153 of title 18, United States Code (commonly known \n     as the Major Crimes Act);\n       (5) the Major Crimes Act does not include provisions to \n     provide Federal prosecutors the ability to prosecute domestic \n     violence assaults unless they rise to the level of serious \n     bodily injury or death;\n       (6) national studies conducted by law enforcement \n     organizations show that domestic violence disturbance calls \n     are the most dangerous situations and pose the highest risk \n     to responding law enforcement officers;\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\n       (7) the limited arrest authority of the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs and Indian tribal law enforcement agencies impacts \n     the ability of law enforcement to properly respond to acts of \n     domestic violence; and\n       (8) Federal and tribal prosecutors and law enforcement \n     services are hampered in their efforts to address domestic \n     violence by the lack of available criminal history \n     information for tribal ordinance offenders.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To obtain data on the rates of domestic violence \n     perpetrated upon Indian women in Indian country.\n       (2) To close existing gaps in Federal criminal laws to \n     enable Federal, State, and tribal law enforcement, \n     prosecution agencies, and courts to address incidents of \n     domestic violence.\n       (3) To address the public safety concerns experienced by \n     tribal police officers that arise in responding to incidents \n     of domestic violence.\n       (4) To prevent the serious injury or death of Indian women \n     subject to domestic violence.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide a grant program to support the \nestablishment and operation of Teachers Professional Development \nInstitutes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, legislation that will bolster \nthe content and pedagogical knowledge of our K-12 teacher workforce. \nThis measure provides resources and incentives to enlist college and \nuniversity faculties in partnerships with public school districts \nthroughout the Nation in an effort to strengthen public school \ninstruction.\n  My proposal will establish, over the next five years, forty new \nTeacher Professional Development Institutes in locales throughout the \nNation. Based on the model which has been operating at Yale University \nand the City of New Haven for over 25 years, Teacher Professional \nDevelopment Institutes consist of partnerships between one or more \ninstitutions of higher education and local, economically disadvantaged \npublic school systems. These Institutes will strengthen the present \nteacher workforce by giving participants an opportunity to gain more \nsophisticated content knowledge and instructional skills, and will \nprovide them a chance to develop--in conjunction with their Institute \ncolleagues--practical curriculum units that they can implement in their \nclassrooms and share with their schools and districts.\n  Since 1978, the Yale-New Haven Institute has offered five to seven \nthirteen-session seminars each year, led by Yale faculty, on topics \nthat teachers have selected to enhance their teaching mastery. To begin \nthe process, teacher representatives from the Institute solicit \nteachers throughout the school district for ideas on how to help meet \ntheir perceived needs--for example, improving content area knowledge, \npreparing instructional materials, managing the classroom, or \naddressing accountability standards. As a consensus emerges regarding \nseminar content, the Institute director identifies and enlists \nuniversity faculty members with the appropriate expertise, interest, \nand desire to lead the seminar. Because the topics are ultimately \ndetermined by the teachers who participate, seminars offer content \nwhich teachers believe is pertinent, valuable, and practical for both \nthemselves and their students.\n  It is, in fact, the cooperative and emergent nature of the Institute \nseminar planning process that ensures its success--rigorous topical \ninstruction\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nand relevant materials are provided based on participants' self-\nidentified needs. Granted the opportunity to examine and act on their \nown skills and knowledge, teachers gain a sense of self-sufficiency, \nand are more enthusiastic about their participation. Teachers gain \nfurther confidence as they practice using the materials they obtain and \ndevelop among their peers, ensuring that the experience not only \nincreases their subject-matter proficiency, but also provides immediate \nhands-on active learning materials that can be transferred to the \nclassroom. In short, by allowing teachers to determine the seminar \nsubjects and providing them the resources to develop curricula relevant \nto their classroom and their students, the Institutes empower teachers. \nTeachers are the front line--they are the interface between the \neducational system and the students it aspires to shape and inform--and \nthey know what should be done to improve their schools and increase \nstudent achievement. The Teacher Professional Development Institutes \npromote this philosophy.\n  From 1999-2002, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute conducted a \nNational Demonstration Project to create comparable Institutes at four \ndiverse sites with large concentrations of disadvantaged students. \nThese demonstration projects were located in Pittsburgh, PA; Houston, \nTX; Albuquerque, NM; and Santa Ana, CA. Based on the success of that \nProject, the Institute has launched the Yale National Initiative--a \nlong-term endeavor to establish exemplary Teachers Institutes in states \nthroughout the nation, just as the legislation I have introduced would \ndo.\n  Follow-up evaluations have garnered encouraging reactions from \nteachers who have participated both in the Yale-New Haven Institute and \nin the demonstration Institutes. These data strongly support the \nconclusions that virtually all teachers felt substantially strengthened \nin their mastery of content knowledge and that they developed increased \nexpectations for students' achievement. Further, because of their \npersonal involvement in the course selection and curriculum development \nprocess, teacher participants have found these seminars to be \nespecially relevant and useful in their classroom practices--in fact, \nninety-five percent of all participating teachers reported them to be \nbeneficial. Finally, study results have found that these Institutes \nfoster teacher leadership, develop supportive teacher networks, \nheighten university faculty commitments to improving K-12 public \neducation, and create more positive partnerships between school \ndistricts and institutions of higher education--something I believe is \nessential to improving students' readiness for college.\n  Several studies assert that teacher quality is the single most \nimportant school-related factor in determining student achievement. \nAccordingly, the No Child Left Behind Act requires a ``highly \nqualified'' teacher to be in every classroom by the end of the 2005-\n2006 academic year. Effective teacher professional development programs \nthat focus on content area and pedagogical knowledge are proven means \nof enhancing the success of classroom teachers and helping to meet the \n``highly qualified'' criteria. Yet, a 2003 Government Accountability \nOffice Report on Teacher Quality found that many state and local school \ndistricts view shortcomings in their current professional development \npractices as a significant barrier to meeting this requirement. These \nlocal agencies are looking for innovative, research-proven alternatives \nto their current programs, and this is precisely what Teacher \nProfessional Development Institutes will provide.\n  Nationwide, projects developed to conform to the Yale-New Haven \nInstitute model have proven to be successful in providing innovative \nteacher professional development. Virtually all teacher participants \nfelt substantially strengthened in their mastery of content knowledge \nand their teaching skills. My proposal would open this opportunity to \nmany more urban teachers and would provide high quality professional \ndevelopment to educators and policy makers throughout the Nation. In \nthis way, we can set high standards for effective teacher professional \ndevelopment as we have done for student achievement outcomes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Teachers Professional \nDevelopment Institutes Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to limit the availability of benefits under an \nemployer's nonqualified deferred compensation plans in the event that \nany of the employer's defined benefit pension plans are subjected to a \ndistress or PBGC termination in connection with bankruptcy \nreorganization or a conversion to a cash balance plan, to provide \nappropriate funding restrictions in connection with the maintenance of \nnonqualified deferred compensation plans, and to provide for \nappropriate disclosure with respect to nonqualified deferred \ncompensation plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Pension Fairness and Full Disclosure \nAct we are introducing today is urgently needed to end the nightmare \nthat the current pension system is becoming for millions of families \nacross the Nation.\n  Thousands of flight attendants and machinists from United Airlines \nhave suffered heavily in pay and job security in recent years, and now \nthey're losing their pensions, too. Yet corporate CEO's are still \nreceiving bonuses worth millions of dollars a year.\n  This nightmare is happening to workers all across America. Companies \nare cutting employees' pensions by switching to cash balance plans, or \neven going into bankruptcy. But executive retirement is still going \nthrough the roof. A recent report found over 20 percent of America's \ntop 500 largest companies have promised pensions worth more than $1 \nmillion a year for their CEOs.\n  President Bush has said that what is good for the top floor is good \nfor the shop floor. It's wrong for it to be business as usual on the \ntop floor when so much pain is spreading on the shop floor.\n  Polaroid in Massachusetts filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and terminated \nits pension plan in 2002. Its pension plan was underfunded by over $300 \nmillion dollars. Thousands of retirees had their benefits cut when the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation took over. Yet the principal \nexecutives of the company received millions of dollars in bonuses. Last \nweek, the company was sold again, and the chairman and CEO received \ngolden parachutes of nearly $10 million each.\n  The bill we are introducing will end that injustice. It prohibits \ncompanies from lining executives' pockets and ignoring commitments to \nrank-and-file workers. It will require companies to inform employees \nabout executive compensation.\n  These changes are long overdue. It's an issue of basic fairness, and \nonly Congress can solve this.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 992. A bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate the \nconsumptive demand exception relating to the importation of goods made \nwith forced labor; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am proposing to strike the \nconsumptive demand clause from Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 \n(19 U.S.C. 1307). Section 307 prohibits the importation of any product \nor good produced with forced or indentured labor including forced or \nindentured child labor.\n  The consumptive demand clause creates an exception to this \nprohibition. Under the exception, if a product is not made in the \nUnited States, and there is a demand for it, then a product made with \nforced or indentured child labor may be imported into this country.\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\n  Let us be clear: forced or indentured labor means work which is \nextracted from any person under the menace of penalty for \nnonperformance and for which the worker does not offer himself \nvoluntarily. Let us be really clear: this means slave labor. In the \ncase of children, it means child slavery.\n  Some examples of goods that are made with child slave labor include \ncocoa beans, hand-knotted carpets, beedis, which are small Indian \ncigarettes, soccer balls and cotton.\n  Throughout my Senate career, I have worked to reduce the use of \nforced child labor worldwide.\n  In 2003, my staff was invited by Customs to meet with field agents on \nSection 307 to discuss what appropriations were needed to enforce the \nstatute. At the meeting, the field agents reported that the consumptive \ndemand clause was an obstacle to their ability to enforce the law that \nis supposed to prevent goods made with slave labor from being imported \ninto the United States.\n  The consumptive demand clause is outdated. Since this exception was \nenacted in the 1930s, the U.S. has taken numerous steps to stop the \nscourge of child slave labor. Most notably, the United States has \nratified International Labor Organization's Convention 182 to Prohibit \nthe Worst forms of Child Labor. Currently, 152 other countries have \nalso ratified this ILO Convention.\n  Retaining the consumptive clause contradicts our international \ncommitments to eliminate abusive child labor. Maintaining the \nconsumptive demand clause says to the world that the United States \njustifies the use of slave labor, if US consumers need an item not \nproduced in this country. There should be no exception to a fundamental \nstand against the use of slave labor. it is my hope that Congress will \nact.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 992\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. GOODS MADE WITH FORCED OR INDENTURED LABOR.\n\n       (a) In General.--The second sentence of section 307 of the \n     Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) is amended by striking \n     ``; but in no case'' and all that follows to the end period.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     applies to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for \n     consumption, on or after the date that is 15 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 993. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \nan excise tax on amounts received under certain insurance policies in \nwhich certain exempt organizations hold an interest; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the bill imposes an excise tax, equal to \n100 percent of the acquisition costs, on the taxable acquisition of any \ninterest in an applicable insurance contract. An applicable insurance \ncontract is any life insurance, annuity or endowment contract in which \nboth an applicable exempt organization and any person that is not an \napplicable exempt organization have, directly or indirectly, held an \ninterest in the contract (whether or not the interests are held at the \nsame time).\n  An applicable exempt organization generally includes an organization \nthat is exempt from Federal income tax by reason of being described in \nsection 501(c)(3) (including one organized outside the United States), \na government or political subdivision of a government, and an Indian \ntribal government.\n  The bill provides that an interest in an applicable insurance \ncontract includes any right with respect to the contract, whether as an \nowner, beneficiary, or otherwise. An indirect interest in a contract \nincludes an interest in an entity that, directly or indirectly, holds \nan interest in the contract.\n  Exceptions apply under the bill. An exception is provided if each \nperson (other than the exempt organization) with an interest in the \ncontract has an insurable interest in the insured person independent of \nany interest of the exempt organization. Another exception is provided \nif each person, other than an exempt organization, has an interest \nsolely as a named beneficiary. An exception is also provided for a \nperson, other than the exempt organization, with an interest as a trust \nbeneficiary, if the beneficiary designation is purely gratuitous, or \nwith an interest as a trustee who holds in a fiduciary capacity for an \napplicable exempt organization or another permitted beneficiary.\n  The bill provides reporting rules requiring an applicable exempt \norganization or other person that makes a taxable acquisition of an \napplicable insurance contract to file a return showing required \ninformation. A statement is required to be furnished to each person \nwhose taxpayer identification information is required to be reported on \nthe return. Penalties apply for failure to file the return or furnish \nthe statement, including, in the case of intentional disregard of the \nreturn filing requirement, a penalty equal to the amount of the excise \ntax that has not been paid with respect to the items required to be \nincluded on the return.\n  The bill is effective for contracts issued after May 3, 2005. The \nbill requires reporting of existing life insurance, endowment and \nannuity contracts issued on or before that date, in which an applicable \nexempt organization holds an interest and which would be treated as an \napplicable insurance contract under the bill. This reporting is \nrequired within one year after the date of enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Obama, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Alexander):\n  S.J. Res. 18. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, along with my colleagues from \nCalifornia, Arizona, Vermont, Kansas and Illinois, I come to the floor \nto introduce legislation to renew sanctions against the illegitimate \nand repressive State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in Burma.\n  I do not intend today to recount the litany of abuses committed by \nthe military junta in Rangoon against the Burmese people and their \nneighbors given the extensive documentation of these violations by \ncredible sources, including the U.S. Department of State, the United \nNations and numerous nongovernmental organizations, my colleagues are \nundoubtedly familiar with many of the SPDC's heinous crimes--from the \nproduction and trafficking of illicit drugs, to the use of rape as a \nweapon of war against ethnic minority women and girls and the forced \nconscription of children into military service.\n  Instead, I urge my colleagues to act quickly--as we have in the \npast--in considering and passing the renewal of sanctions, which \ninclude an import ban on Burmese goods and visa restrictions on \nofficials from the SPDC and affiliated organizations.\n  We must act quickly as the SPDC poses an immediate danger to the \nentire region, whether through the trafficking of illicit drugs, the \nunchecked spread of HIV/AIDS, or the forced movement of people who seek \nrefuge and safety in neighboring countries.\n  There is no more definitive expression of support for democracy and \nhuman rights--for solidarity with those struggling for freedom--than an \nimport ban. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu has eloquently pointed out on \nseveral occasions, sanctions worked in South Africa, and they can work \nin Burma, too.\n  We must act resolutely as the junta continues to imprison those who \nnonviolently struggle for freedom and justice, including Nobel laureate \nand Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma has a rising \nprisoner of conscience population, with over 1,300 political prisoners. \nI renew my call that Suu Kyi and other prisoners of conscience be \nimmediately and unconditionally released.\n  Just last month, the European Union renewed sanctions against the \nSPDC that restrict members of the junta and their families from \nentering the EU, and bans EU companies from doing business in Burma. \nWhile I applaud this action, I call upon the EU and other multilateral \norganizations, including the United Nations, to do more in support of \nfreedom in Burma.\n  Specifically, the EU, along with the United States, should not \nparticipate\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\nin any Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) related meetings \nshould the SPDC assume chairmanship of that Association next year. It \nis worth noting that some ASEAN member states are now publicly \ndiscussing the junta's possible leadership with growing concern. This \nincreased attention--and a growing chorus for political reform in Burma \nin the region by likeminded lawmakers--is also appreciated.\n  Finally, while I welcome UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's personal \ncomments in support of freedom in Burma, the time for talk is over. The \nUN must act on Burma--in New York. It is past time for the UN to \ndiscuss and debate the myriad threats Burma poses to the region. What \nare they waiting for?\n  The people of Burma must know that they have no better friends in \nthis body than Senators Feinstein, McCain, Leahy, Brownback and Obama. \nThere is an unofficial Burma Caucus in the Senate, and I am proud to \nstand shoulder-to-shoulder with my dedicated colleagues on this issue.\n  To them--and to Suu Kyi and all who nonviolently struggle for freedom \nin Burma--I say ``we will prevail.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 18\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in \n     section 3(a)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n     2003.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a \nresolution introduced by myself, Senator McConnell, Senator Leahy, \nSenator McCain, Senator Brownback, and Senator Obama to renew the \nsanctions imposed on Burma by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003.\n  Last year, in response to the failure by the military junta--the \nState Peace and Development Council, SPDC--to take any meaningful steps \ntowards restoring democracy and releasing Nobel Peace Prize winner and \nNational League for Democracy, NLD, leader Aung San Suu Kyi, Congress \noverwhelmingly renewed a complete ban on all imports from Burma for \nanother year.\n  One year later, it is clear that Rangoon has once again failed to \nmake ``substantial and measurable progress'' toward putting Burma on a \nirreversible path of national reconciliation and democracy.\n  Suu Kyi remains under house arrest. On her 60th birthday on June 19, \n2005, she will have spent a total of 2,523 days in detention.\n  NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo has also remained in custody since May 2003. \nAnd 1,400 political prisoners are still in jail.\n  The military junta's ``road map'' to democracy and national \nconvention to draft a new constitution has produced no timetable for \nrestoring democracy and shut out the participation of Suu Kyi and the \nNLD, the legitimate winners of the 1990 elections.\n  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights passed a resolution \nlast month highlighting continued human rights abuses by Rangoon \nincluding ``extrajudicial killings,'' rape, torture, sex trafficking \nand forced labor.\n  And let us not forget that Congress passed the original ``Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act of 2003'' in response to a brutal coordinated \nassault by progovernment paramilitary thugs on Suu Kyi and other \nmembers of the NLD. Is anyone surprised that no one has been brought to \njustice for these crimes?\n  The generals who run the country have shown a remarkable ability to \nignore the demands of their own people and the international community. \nThe simple truth is that as long as the SPDC remains in power the \ndemocratic hopes and aspirations of the Burmese people will continue to \nbe denied.\n  Now is not the time to let the sanctions expire and try to ``engage'' \nthe military junta.\n  Doing so without any meaningful steps toward democracy taken by \nRangoon would only serve to bolster the regime's campaign against \ndemocratic government, the rule of law, and basic human rights.\n  I point out that the democratic movement in Burma continues to \nsupport sanctions against the SPDC. We must give them more time to \neffect change in Burma.\n  Let us not fall into the trap of thinking true representative \ndemocracy cannot come to Burma and the Burmese people. I agree with \nDeputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick when he said recently:\n\n       What we see throughout the world, even in places where \n     people don't expect it, like the Middle East, is a process of \n     openness and democracy. There's no reason it can't happen in \n     Burma as well.\n\n  As champions of freedom and respect for human rights, we must stand \nin solidarity with Suu Kyi, the people of Burma, and the international \ncommunity in once again calling on the SPDC to release Suu Kyi, \nrelinquish power, and respect the 1990 elections. Archbishop Desmond \nTutu has rightly said:\n\n       As long as [Suu Kyi] remains under house arrest, none of us \n     is truly free.\n\n  In the face of human rights abuses and terror, approximately 300,000 \nBurmese citizens have already defied the military junta and signed \ntheir names on a petition calling for true democratic change in Burma. \nWe must back their courage. I urge my colleagues to support the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators McConnell \nand Feinstein for their efforts to renew again the sanctions contained \nin the 2003 Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. I am proud to join along \nwith Senators Leahy, Brownback, and Obama as sponsors of this \nresolution.\n  As we take action to renew this legislation, the situation inside \nBurma grows ever dimmer. The military junta in that country controls \nthe population through a campaign of violence and terror, and the lack \nof freedom and justice there is simply appalling. The Burmese regime \nhas murdered political opponents, used child soldiers and forced labor, \nand employed rape as a weapon of war. Political activists remain \nimprisoned, including elected members of parliament, and Aung San Suu \nKyi remains a captive.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi's courageous and steadfastness in the face of \ntyranny inspires me and, I believe, every individual who holds \ndemocracy dear. Because she stands for freedom, this heroic woman has \nendured attacks, arrest, captivity, and untold sufferings at the hands \nof the regime. Burma's rulers fear Aung San Suu Kyi because of what she \nrepresents--peace, freedom and justice for all Burmese people. The \nthugs who run the country have tried to stifle her voice, but they will \nnever extinguish her moral courage. Her leadership and example shine \nbrightly for the millions of Burmese who hunger for freedom and for \nthose of us outside Burma who seek justice for its people.\n  The work of Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the National League \nfor Democracy must be the world's work. We must continue to press the \njunta until it is willing to negotiate an irreversible transition to \ndemocratic rule. The Burmese people deserve no less. And I see \nencouraging signs that the world is no longer content to sit on the \nsidelines.\n  The U.S. Congress has been in the forefront, and we stepped up our \npressure significantly in 2003 with the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct. In doing so, we took active steps to pressure the military junta, \nand we sent a signal to the Burmese people that they are not \nforgotten--that the American people care about their freedom and will \nstand up for justice in their country.\n  Now the Europeans and the countries of Southeast Asia are finally \nstepping up their own pressure. While they can and should do more, the \nsigns are encouraging. I have recently seen a report that 78 Thai \nsenators have sponsored a motion opposing Burma's chairmanship of \nASEAN, scheduled for next year. Similar moves by governments of other \nSoutheast Asian nations suggest that opposition to Burma's rotation is \nbecoming widespread, as it should--ASEAN's credibility would crumble \nunder Burmese leadership. A unified message from all ASEAN countries \nthat Burma's behavior is simply unacceptable would make clear to its \nleaders that they cannot practice repression forever.\n  For our part, I support today the joint resolution that will renew \nthe import restrictions--sanctions that are\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\nsupported by the National League for Democracy. These restrictions must \nremain until Burma embarks on a true path of reconciliation--a process \nthat must include the NLD and Burmese ethnic minorities.\n  The picture today in Burma is tragically clear. So long as a band of \nthugs rules Burma, its people will never be free. They will remain \nmired in poverty and suffering, cut off from the world, with only their \nindomitable spirit to keep them moving forward. With our action today, \nwe will support this spirit.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise with several of my colleagues to \nspeak about the importance of the renewal of the Burma sanctions. I \nalso wish to speak candidly about the Burmese Military Junta's \ncontinued oppression of their people through rape, torture and other \nsevere human rights abuses.\n  As the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Aung San \nSuu Kyi continues to inspire the democracy movement and seek support \nfor their peaceful cause. It has been reported that the National League \nfor Democracy has collected more than 300,000 signatures on a petition \ncalling for change in the country. Those who sign are actively putting \ntheir lives in danger by publicly stating that they seek democratic \nchange and some 1,400 political prisoners are locked up for supporting \nhuman rights and democracy.\n  The human rights abuses in Burma continue daily against ethnic \nminorities, political activists and others who simply suffer as \ninnocent bystanders. A 2002 Human Rights Watch report found that Burma \nhas nearly 70,000 child soldiers in its army, more than any other \ncountry in the world. Up to 2 million people have been forced to flee \nthe country as refugees and migrants and the burning of villages \ncontinues in eastern Burma, especially in the Karen and Karenni states. \nLast year I drew to your attention a report titled ``Shattering \nSilences'', in which the Karen Women's Organization carefully \ninvestigated and recorded the Burmese military regime's use of rape as \na weapon of war against ethnic minority women, revealing a shockingly \nbrutal and callous practice.\n  For the past two years, I have joined my colleagues in reauthorizing \nthe Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which bans mainly textile and \ngarment imports from Burma. When I chaired the East Asia and Pacific \nSubcommittee I held a hearing on this very subject. In that hearing I \nspoke about the importance of a multilateral isolation policy. I urge \nmy colleagues to consider the strides that have been made in just two \nyears of promoting such a policy.\n  In a major and important move, the European Union, in October 2004, \nfollowed the lead of the United States and significantly strengthened \nits sanctions on Burma, including a ban on investments in enterprises \nof the ruling regime and a strengthened visa ban. The EU also pledged \nto join the United States in opposing loans to Burma's regime from the \nInternational Monetary Fund and World Bank. The European Parliament \npassed a resolution calling ``on the UN Security Council to address the \nsituation in Burma as a matter of urgency.'' Additionally, 289 members \nof the British parliament tabled a motion calling on the UN Security \nCouncil to address the situation in Burma.\n  After both houses of Congress passed resolutions in October 2004 \ncalling on the UN Security Council to address the situation in Burma, \nthe parliament of Australia followed suit. The Australian motion called \non the government to, ``support the Burmese National League for \nDemocracy's call for the UN Security Council to convene a special \nsession to consider what further measures the UN can take to encourage \ndemocratic reform and respect for human rights in Burma.''\n  Support at the United Nations is growing as well. Burma was one of \nonly a few countries on which resolutions were passed by the United \nNations Commission on Human Rights. This was led by the European Union \nwith strong support from the United States as well as support from \nJapan. The resolution strongly condemned what it called ``the \nsystematic ongoing violation of human rights'' in Burma.\n  There has been unprecedented action on Burma within ASEAN. Whereas in \nthe past ASEAN refused to even comment on what it deemed Burma's \n``internal affairs'', many members of the organization are now publicly \npressuring Burma to step aside as the chair of the association in 2006.\n  The tough approach maintained by the United States towards Burma, \nincluding import sanctions and a possible boycott of 2006 meetings, is \nfor the first time encouraging many Asian nations to rethink whether \nthe Burmese regime should assume the rotating chairmanship. There is \nwidespread belief within the leadership of ASEAN countries that Burma \nhas failed to deliver on its promises to the region.\n  In all of the above-mentioned instances, the strong stand of the \nUnited States has influenced countries around the world. The movement \nat the EU, UN, and within ASEAN is unprecedented. We must keep up the \ntough pressure by the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to reauthorize the sanctions as a strong and \nclear signal that the United States will not support this brutal regime \nand their continued oppression of activists and minorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/10/senate-section/article/S4879-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 135--CONGRATULATING THE NATIONAL ASPHALT PAVEMENT \n ASSOCIATION ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY AND RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS \n           OF MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Jeffords) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about S. Res. 135 which \nrecognizes the outstanding accomplishments of the National Asphalt \nPavement Association, NAPA, as it celebrates it 50th Anniversary on May \n17, 2005. I am joined by my colleagues, Senators Bond, Jeffords and \nBaucus. NAPA is the only national association that exclusively \nrepresents an industry comprised of 1,500 asphalt companies nationwide, \nemploying over 300,000 men and women.\n  Today when we think of highways and roads, we think of the cars and \ntrucks that use these facilities. We think of the agricultural products \nbeing shipped from farm to market, or packages being shipped from \nfactories right to our homes. We think of mothers picking up their \nchildren after\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\nschool, and families taking trips to the beach during the summer. Of \ncourse, we also think of commutes to and from work.\n  What I have just described is our American economy in motion, and \nnone of it would be possible without quality highway pavements of which \nasphalt is one. Just 50 years ago, the country faced a transportation \ncrisis. In 1955, it was not easy to travel from city to city because \nthe Interstate Highway System did not exist. The roads were unsafe, \nslow, and difficult to use. Traveling from city to city, which today \ncould be done in hours took days.\n  In the early 20th century, asphalt pavements helped get America out \nof the mud. In the latter half of that century, the new Interstate \nHighway System improved our mobility and helped sustain our country's \neconomic growth. The Interstate Highway System's pavements literally \nwere the foundation upon which the United States and her people were \nable to emerge as the leaders of the world.\n  It was no accident that NAPA was formed just as the Federal-Aid \nHighway Act of 1956 was winding its way through Congress. The industry \nwas challenged by the need to construct long lasting pavements that \ncould meet the tougher standards of the Interstate Highway System. In \nrising to that challenge, the first ambitious program announced by the \nassociation was the Quality Improvement Program. Ever since then, \ndedication to helping its members deliver the best quality asphalt \npavement has been a top priority.\n  I am very proud of the fact that the late John W. Kelly, of the firm \nAmis & Kelly Construction Company in Oklahoma City, was one of the \nfounding fathers of NAPA. From 1958 to 1960, John W. Kelly served as \nthe second president of the Association. NAPA has also enjoyed 50 years \nof strong partnership with the Oklahoma Asphalt Pavement Association \nwhich was formed in 1952.\n  I congratulate NAPA and its members for 50 years of leadership and \ninvolvement in constructing a world-class road system.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 135) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.
