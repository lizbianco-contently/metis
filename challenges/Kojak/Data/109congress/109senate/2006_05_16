Mr. President, this morning following the opening remarks \nof the two leaders we will proceed to the consideration of a nomination \nto the Ninth Circuit Court. We have set aside up to 15 minutes for \ncomments on that nomination prior to the rollcall vote. Therefore, I \nexpect the vote to occur after 10 a.m, but it should not be too long \nafter 10 a.m. this morning.\n  Following that vote, we will resume debate on the comprehensive \nimmigration bill and the pending amendment proposed by Senator Isakson. \nThis amendment was offered yesterday and had been pending from our \nearlier consideration of the immigration bill. It was my hope to lock \nin a vote to occur shortly after the judge vote of this morning, and we \nwant to allow a few minutes for closing remarks and we want to \naccommodate a few minutes before that vote. I will be in discussion \nwith the Democratic leader about that. There may be a Democratic \nalternative which I believe may have been just submitted. We will take \na look at that and plan the vote on this accordingly. I do want to \nalert Members that we could expect a vote or two prior to our luncheons \ntoday.\n  As Senators return for the first vote of the week, they should be \nreminded--which both the Democratic leader and I did yesterday--that \nthis will be a very full week, with lengthy sessions and with a number \nof votes. We recognize that people have a lot of schedules which \ncompete with the votes, but our major priority must be this bill. We \nask for everybody's consideration in that regard. We will be in session \nas long as it takes in the evening to accommodate the wishes of \nSenators and their desire to present amendments.\n  We have this week and next week prior to the next recess to complete \nthis bill. We have a supplemental bill, a pensions bill, and the \nKavanaugh nomination--all which is a heavy load which I believe can be \naccomplished.\n  I will also add, the manager of the bill yesterday--both managers, I \nbelieve--stated we want these votes to be 20-minute votes, when we are \nactually voting and recognize that 20 minutes is a short period of \ntime, but it is plenty of time if people know as soon as the bell goes \noff that they need to start coming here.\n  I have a statement--it will be brief--on immigration, but I turn to \nthe Democratic leader if he has anything in terms of scheduling?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4571-6", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4571-S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, last night the President of the United \nStates addressed the Nation on the need to fix a broken immigration \nsystem, the focus of that speech last night being on securing the \nborders. The President was very clear on the fact that our borders have \nto be secure, we have to stop the hemorrhaging of people coming across-\nthe-border for an immigration plan to really work. I applaud the \nPresident's leadership on this important issue, this pressing issue, \nespecially because we are in the middle of this debate on the floor of \nthe Senate. I support the proposal in terms of turning to the National \nGuard as a short-term, an interim, stopgap measure to secure our \nborders because anything we do does take time.\n  The President outlined the progress that has been made over the last \n4 to 5 years on the border. Yet the problem gets worse and worse, in \nspite of the fact that we do have more people on the border. Our \ninfrastructure is getting better, and we are building barriers. The \nfact is, as the President said last night, our borders are out of \ncontrol, and we are failing the American people until we bring them \nback under control. Our border agents down there are stretched too far. \nThey are overstretched. Technology has not been fully applied to the \ndegree that it should be. Each year we have millions of undocumented \nimmigrants, illegal immigrants once they cross that border, who come \nacross the southern border and indeed our other borders as well.\n  We catch more than we did in the past, but the numbers coming are \nincreasing even faster than the numbers\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nwe catch, and far too many escape detection, and then, \nunfortunately, because of a catch-and-release program which is not \nworking to the degree it should, as the President mentioned last night, \nthey are then released into the country.\n\n  We need to beef up the electronic surveillance and physical barriers \nwhere appropriate. Bottom line, we need to stop the hemorrhaging, and \nthe President laid out a five-point plan very specifically last night, \nas to how we might do that. The reality of his remarks last night is \nthat we are debating that very issue on the floor and this body must \nact, and will act, over the next 9 or 10 days to secure those borders \nand further the comprehensive immigration reform plan that addresses \nthe issue of security and enforcement at the workplace, a strong \ntemporary worker program, and addressing--a lot of the amendments will \nfocus on this--the situation of 12 million people who are here \nillegally.\n  Our supplemental appropriations bill we passed a few weeks ago \nincluded almost $2 billion to repair fences in high-traffic areas, to \nreplace broken Border Patrol aircraft for lower traffic areas, and for \nsupporting training of additional customs and Border Protection agents. \nWe paid for this additional spending by cuts in other areas. The \nSenate--and we will hear this debated over the next several days--is \nnear consensus on putting nearly 15,000 new border security agents in \nthe field over the next 6 years.\n  We are taking action. We are taking control. But these changes are \ngoing to take time. It is not a matter of just money, it is a matter of \ntraining and support and applying that technology. That is why I \nstrongly support the President's proposal last night of sending a \ncontingent of National Guardsmen now as an interim measure.\n  But that is an interim measure, and securing our border is only one \npart--a very important part and many argue it is the most important \npart--of a comprehensive immigration reform plan that has to be tough, \nit has to be fair, and that does have to be comprehensive.\n  We started the debate once again yesterday, and we will continue \ntoday and throughout the course of this week. I am confident that by \nstaying focused under the leadership of our tremendous managers, \nChairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy, we will be able to pass a \nbipartisan comprehensive plan before Memorial Day.\n  I, also, thank Senators Hagel and Martinez for their determined \nefforts to bring consensus to the issue at hand. Under their \nleadership, we have developed, building on the work of others--namely, \nSenator McCain and Senator Kennedy--a fair, workable plan to help deal \nwith each of the four components of the comprehensive immigration \nproposal, but most specifically to address the 12 million people who \ncurrently live in the United States illegally.\n  The overall approach deals with the diversity of this population. We \nknow that 40 percent of these 12 million people have been here longer \nthan 10 years. Many are fully assimilated into our society today. We \nknow we can't give people who have broken the law a leg up in applying \nfor American citizenship, but they must be treated fairly, must be \ntreated compassionately, and that is what this bill intends to do. And \nit may be modified in making it even a little better over the next \nseveral days.\n  Law breakers should not be able to cut in line, as the President \nmentioned last night. People in this category need to be put at the end \nof the line.\n  I am confident that as we proceed with the debate, as long as we \nconsider these amendments in a fair and open way, and we have that well \nunderway today, we will have a comprehensive bill. Immigration is not a \nRepublican issue, it is not a Democratic issue, it is a sensitive issue \nthat touches on our values as a nation. We should not have to choose \nbetween respect for history as a country of immigrants with the respect \nfor our laws. I am confident we will be able to pass this comprehensive \nplan in the days to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4572-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMint).

Mr. President, yesterday morning I talked about this being \nthe summer season, new movies--there is a blockbuster out, starting \nthis Friday it is, ``The Da Vinci Code,'' with Tom Hanks. I suggested \nyesterday that in the third week of May, on the Senate floor, we have \nour own blockbuster that is part 2 of immigration.\n  We had part 1. It didn't go very well. I suggested yesterday that in \nthe President's speech he was going to give, he should become a player, \nan actor in this part 2 of the Senate blockbuster.\n  Last night the President, I thought, did a commendable job in laying \nout what he felt was a path to solving this immigration situation.\n  I acknowledge the President's statement, and I support the direction \nthe President has taken. I want the President to continue to be a \nplayer in all of this. I remind everyone, however, that much of what \nthe President talked about we should already have done. For example, \nthe President talked--and rightfully so--about the fact that we don't \nhave enough beds. We have the so-called catch-and-release program where \nwe find people who are here illegally and we let them go because we \nhave no place to put them.\n  Following the 9/11 Commission, there was a recommendation that we \nprovide additional beds for the illegals, and we did. We authorized \n18,000. But even though we have tried, the President and the majority \nhave not supported our position in this regard. We only have 1,800 \nbeds. We have to move forward and do all of that. I certainly hope that \ncan be done.\n  It is important that we have additional Border Patrol agents. We have \nalready called for them. In fact, our request has only been filled to \n75 percent capacity. The President has said we need more beds. Let's \nmove on that now. The President said we need more Border Patrol agents. \nLet's move on that now.\n  The National Guard: Yesterday, I asked the President to give us a \ntimetable. He said within the next year. I hope we can take care of \nthat situation so that we don't need to have National Guardsmen there. \nBut in this interim period, I support the National Guard being on our \nborder.\n  It is important that we move forward as quickly as possible with this \nvery important legislation. I hope in the days to come that the \nPresident will also acknowledge how wrong the Republican House approach \nis to this. They are still talking the same way. They haven't backed \ndown. They think their approach is the best, from what I have seen by a \ncouple of speeches the chairman of the Judiciary Committee gave last \nweek.\n  The President needs to stay engaged. He needs to recognize how bad \nthe House bill really is and speak to the American public about how bad \nit is.\n  Yesterday, there were some remarks on both sides on this issue which \nI thought were good. Here is an opportunity. We always talk about \nbipartisanship.\n  Interestingly, I was just talking to a member of the Republican staff \ncoming into the building today. We exchanged greetings. He said on the \nRepublican side they are just going to vote their conscience. I said \nthat is an interesting way to legislate. That is what we all need to \ndo. We should have been doing it more in the past. This is the week in \nwhich we need to vote our conscience. We don't need to vote the \nDemocratic way or the Republican way. We need to vote the American way \nand move this most important legislation down the road. I hope we can \ndo that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4572-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4572-S4573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               STEM CELLS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me also talk about one other important \nissue; that is, the American people are not only counting on us to \nfinish the immigration bill--which we need to do--but they are also \ncounting on us to finish the stem cells bill.\n  Today, in the New York Times there is a letter from Nancy Reagan to \nSenator Hatch in which she writes:\n\n       For those who are waiting every day for scientific progress \n     to help their loved ones, the wait for the U.S. Senate action \n     has been very difficult and very hard to comprehend.\n\n  Yes, it really has.\n  Last Thursday, the Republican leadership concluded the only week they\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nintend to devote to health care in this Congress. I was disappointed \nthat--despite his repeated promises to allow the Senate to consider the \nHouse-passed stem cells bill--Senator Frist didn't consider this issue \nimportant enough to bring to the floor and that parliamentary tactics \nwere used to deny our efforts to bring this forward.\n  On May 10, prior to the conclusion of Health Week, my friend, the \ndistinguished majority leader, Dr. Frist, stated:\n\n       The issue of stem cells is a very important issue. . . .I \n     am very committed to addressing that particular issue. . . \n     .The interest in stem cells will be debated in the future, at \n     a time that is mutually set by the Democratic leadership \n     working with the Republican leadership.\n\n  The one-year anniversary of the date the House of Representatives \npassed H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, is May 24, \nexactly 1 week from tomorrow.\n  The bill would offer hope to millions of Americans and their \nfamilies. Why are we waiting so long to simply vote?\n  If the distinguished majority leader agreed that this is ``a very \nimportant issue,'' then I hope he will keep this issue moving forward \nand vote on it immediately and schedule a vote on the House-passed \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4573-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Boyle, a man who is steeped in \ncontroversy, has been reversed 165 times, has ethical problems.\n  Let's go to the Milan Smiths. There are many qualified Republicans \nwho I hope meet the standard following the Constitution and who are not \ncontroversial but are good people. Some are lawyers and some are judges \nelevated to a higher position.

Smith, Jr., of \nCalifornia, to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge my \ncolleagues to vote in support of the nomination of Milan D. Smith, Jr., \nfor the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The Judiciary Committee has held a hearing on Mr. Smith, and we \nrecommend him to our colleagues.\n  He was a graduate of Brigham Young University, cum laude, in 1966, \nand he has a law degree from the University of Chicago Law School in \n1969.\n  He has had a distinguished career in the practice of law. After law \nschool, he joined the international law firm of O'Melveny & Myers.\n  In 1972, Mr. Smith formed his own firm, Smith Crane Robinson & \nParker, one of Southern California's premier law firms specializing in \ncomplex transactions.\n  Mr. Smith has served in public services. In 1988, he served as \nCommissioner of the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission \nwhere he remained until 1991.\n  The American Bar Association gave Mr. Smith a ``substantial majority \nwell qualified'' and a ``minority qualified'' rating.\n  Beyond these excellent credentials, he comes with a strong \nrecommendation from somebody who knows him very well, and that is our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Gordon Smith from Oregon.\n  I am pleased at this time to yield the floor either to Senator Smith \nor to the senior Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 5 \nminutes each to the Senators from California and 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Oregon, and 5 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee and as a Californian to indicate my support for the \nconfirmation of Milan Smith to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. It \nis a fine occasion to be able to come here and represent that we have a \nvery competent man to become an appellate court judge.\n  Mr. Smith has a long and distinguished legal career in our State. The \nchairman of the committee pointed out some of this. After graduating \nfrom the University of Chicago Law School in 1969, Milan Smith moved to \nLos Angeles where he has been an important part of the legal community \never since.\n  Mr. Smith founded the law firm known as Smith Crane Robinson & Parker \nin 1972, and over the last 34 years with Smith Crane Robinson & Parker \nhe has engaged in a wide-ranging legal practice in business and real \nestate law.\n  After reviewing his extensive record, a majority of the American Bar \nAssociation rated him ``well qualified'' to serve as a judge of the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  He has demonstrated an impressive and enduring commitment to serving \nthe public, from presiding over the Governing Board of the Los Angeles \nState Building Authority to acting as vice chairman of Ettie Lee Homes \nfor Youth.\n  As many of you know, Milan Smith is the older brother of our esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Gordon Smith. I know the Senator from Idaho was just \ntalking to Senator Smith and saying: Isn't it nice that California is \ngetting a Californian.\n\n  We are having a little tussle over another judge which the Senator \nfrom Idaho believes should be an Idaho judge, and the Senators from \nCalifornia believe should be a California judge. So that issue has not \nyet to be joined, but it certainly will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield only for a moment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Certainly.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is important to recognize that we are getting the Smith \nfrom California, and we are asking that we get a Smith from Idaho.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. California would prefer having two Smiths. But we \nwill talk about that another day.\n  The Smiths' maternal grandfather, Jesse Udall, was the chief justice \nof the Arizona Supreme Court. So Milan Smith stands poised to follow \nfamily precedent in serving on one of our Nation's highest courts.\n  I congratulate him on this nomination. I urge all of my colleagues to \nvote\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\nfor him. I say to his younger brother, who is sitting here in the \nChamber, that it is a wonderful day for both Senator Boxer and for me \nto be able to see you so happy. I know what it means to you and how \ngreat it is to have such a fine legal mind in your family. We offer you \nour best congratulations, as well.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a special day for all of us who \nare on the floor presently because this date has been coming, in my \nopinion, for far too long. We could have done this 4 years ago, but \nsometimes it takes a while for good things to happen.\n  We will not look back, we will look ahead.\n  I say to my colleague, Senator Feinstein, that we are very fortunate \nbecause we worked hard to set up a system for our district court \nnominees which is working beautifully. We don't have rancor in \nCalifornia over judges--we really don't.\n  This nomination of Milan Smith is also an opportunity to bring \neveryone together around a fine man, someone who will be, I believe, a \nvery fine judge. Why? Because Mr. Smith is highly respected by those \nwho know him and know his work. I am confident he will discharge his \nresponsibilities with dignity, integrity, and intelligence.\n  After law school, Mr. Smith joined the firm of O'Melveny & Myers and \nlater started his own law firm where he is the managing partner. His \nwork in the private sector has given him a wealth of experience and has \nearned him respect from his peers.\n  Mr. Smith's career goes beyond the private practice of law. He has \ndedicated a significant amount of time and energy to public service, as \nwell. In 1984, then-Governor Deukmejian appointed Mr. Smith to the \ngoverning board of the Los Angeles Service Building Authority where he \nserved as president until 1992. Since then, he has acted as the \nAuthority's general counsel.\n  He also was appointed as a member of the California Fair Employment \nand Housing Commission. He joined the Fair Employment and Housing \nCommission in 1988 and worked for the next 3 years to protect the \nrights of the disadvantaged. It says a lot about Milan Smith. This was \nsomething he wanted to do: protect the rights of others who are less \nfortunate than he.\n  During that tenure, Mr. Smith worked with legislators to reverse a \nSupreme Court of California decision limiting the commission's power to \nreward and collect damages for victims of discrimination. Because of \nMr. Smith's hard work, passion, and compassion, the California \nLegislature passed a bill restoring the commission's authority to award \ndamages to victims of discrimination.\n  When then-Governor Wilson vetoed the bill, Mr. Smith resigned in \nprotest. We all know a lot of fine people, but it takes guts to stand \nup and say: I submit my resignation. That shows courage and \nindependence of mind. Here is Milan Smith, standing up to a Governor of \nthe same political party. That is hard to do. I am sure it was painful. \nI am sure it was terrible. But he did it.\n  In his resignation letter, Mr. Smith said:\n\n       Despite my generally conservative political views, I've \n     come to know much more of the sexual harassment, bigotry and \n     mean spiritedness abroad in the land. To continue to sit on \n     the FEHC when we can do nothing to fairly compensate genuine \n     victims of unlawful sexual harassment, for example, would be \n     unconscionable to me.\n\n  Again, those words are eloquent. They are courageous. They show the \nkind of leadership we need in a judge. We need someone who is fair, \nsomeone who truly understands the rights of all Americans, and \ncertainly of all Californians. Mr. Smith gained my profound respect by \nrefusing to sit quietly in the face of what he believed to be \ninjustice. It gives me confidence that as judges sit around and discuss \ncases that have come before them, he will be motivated by a fierce \nsense of independence. He will not fear standing up and will be counted \nwhen the moment comes.\n  I am absolutely thrilled about this nomination. The Ninth Circuit \nwill benefit greatly with the addition of Milan Smith. I strongly \nsupport his nomination. I had written a letter in favor of this nominee \n4, maybe more, 5 years ago. This is a wonderful day for me, personally. \nI know Senator Feinstein feels that way. My colleague feels that way, \nand I think most of our colleagues feel this way. It shows we can reach \nacross party lines and come to a point where we can compromise. I am \nsure Mr. Smith isn't going to do everything I want or everything that \nSenator Frist wants, but this is a wonderful choice today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proud Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, it is an honor to be here today, a special \nday for me, I know for my brother, and all of our family.\n  Let me begin my remarks by expressing to Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer my heart felt appreciation for their kind words about my \nbig brother. Let me tell them what a pleasure it has been to work with \nthem on coming to this hour in which the Senate will vote on his \nconfirmation.\n  I would be remiss if I also did not give special thanks to Senator \nFrist and Senator Reid, the leaders of this Senate, for their courtesy \nto me in making this moment possible. Also, to Senator Specter and \nSenator Leahy, Senator Hatch who chaired the hearing for my brother, \nall have been his champions, as well, in this very difficult process.\n  Finally, most profoundly I thank President Bush for his confidence in \nmy brother, for his courtesy to my family, and to all of his staff, \nspecifically Harriet Miers, who have been wonderful throughout this \njourney. I am profoundly thankful to them.\n  I have been in this Senate now for a decade. There are times when I \nfeel a certain electricity, a certain excitement to be here. As I \nreflect upon my memories of service and the hundreds of votes I have \ncast, some stand out more than others. But those that stand out most \nfor me are those occasions when we watch the operation of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  This is one of those moments. Those special times are when the \nbranches of our Government come together and we watch the Constitution \nliterally in operation.\n  What I am talking about in a broader sense is the rule of law. The \nrule of law stands in great contrast to the rule of man. The rule of \nman has been responsible for much of the blood and carnage and horror \non this Earth. But it is the rule of law, however imperfect it is, to \nwhich we are all bound and to which we are all obligated to give \nobedience. The rule of law--equal protection, due process--involves \nprinciples which, fortunately, we in America are able to take for \ngranted in large measure but which are at the center of a good and \ndecent society that the American people have created in this country.\n  Today we are watching the three articles of the Constitution in play. \nArticle I establishes the Congress, specifically, the Senate, charged \nwith providing advice and consent on nominations to the courts. Article \nII, the President has nominated Milan D. Smith, Jr., for this position \non the Ninth Circuit. Article III is about the court's responsibility \nin dispensing equal protection and due process of law. This is one of \nthose moments when these three branches of Government intersect in the \nSenate.\n  For me, it is a very special moment, not just because of my \nresponsibilities as a Senator, my understanding of the Constitution, \nbut because it is a profoundly proud moment for my family.\n  I could speak about my brother in many contexts. My colleagues from \nCalifornia have done that already. I could speak of our mother, Jessica \nUdall Smith, who is the descendent of David King Udall, who is one of \nthe drafters of the Arizona State Constitution. I could speak of our \ngrandfather, Jesse Udall, who was the chief justice of the Arizona \nSupreme Court for many decades. I could certainly speak of the heritage \nwe received from our father, Milan D. Smith, and his service in the \nEisenhower administration, his many discussions with us about politics, \nand the importance of public service.\n  What I could also speak about is Milan's preparation. His academic \ncredentials are sterling. I could speak about his studies at Brigham \nYoung University, the University of Chicago Law School, and I could say \nmany things that would make clear about him and to others his \npreparation for this moment in this great position.\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\n  But what I will do is share with you, the whole Senate, what I wrote \nabout my brother in introducing him to the Judiciary Committee. I only \nquote a part of it:\n\n       Milan, Jr., is the eldest child of Milan Dale and Jessica \n     Udall Smith's ten children. I am the eighth in that number \n     and Milan's youngest brother. In my 54 years of life, Milan \n     has been an example and force for good in our family, and, \n     since the death of our parents, has been truly a family \n     leader and friend to us all through times of tears and \n     cheers.\n       For as far back as my memory serves, I have been witness to \n     a concourse of people who have sought him out for his wisdom \n     and judgment, for counsel and comfort on matters great and \n     small. These have included my parents, myself, and all of my \n     brothers and sisters, cousins, and kinsman from far and wide, \n     his own six children, and of course, his legions of legal \n     clients over many decades. Without respect of persons, he has \n     been a wise friend and a good shepherd to all.\n       His academic preparations and provident life speak for \n     themselves. But, in sum, what I can say is that he is one of \n     the wisest men I have ever known. He has an understanding \n     heart, a heart for judgment, he is possessed of the spirit of \n     discernment, between good and bad, right and wrong, the just \n     and the unjust. I cannot think of a time or a court, when a \n     man of his quality and preparations are more sorely in need \n     than this one, at this time, in our time.\n\n  Mr. President, I am honored to be here today to speak about my big \nbrother. I urge his confirmation to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  That brings us to the point where it is my privilege to ask for the \nyeas and nays on behalf of Milan Dale Smith, Jr.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Milan D. Smith, Jr., of California, to be United States Circuit \nJudge for the Ninth Circuit? On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran), the Senator from New Hampshire \n(Mr. Gregg), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott), the Senator from \nArizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum), and \nthe Senator from Missouri (Mr. Talent).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2611, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2611) to provide for comprehensive immigration \n     reform and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Cornyn (for Isakson) amendment No. 3961, to prohibit the \n     granting of legal status, or adjustment of current status, to \n     any individual who enters or entered the United States in \n     violation of Federal law under the border security measures \n     authorized unless title I and section 233 are fully completed \n     and fully operational.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I remind my colleagues, as announced \nyesterday, that the majority leader has authorized strict enforcement \nof the 15-minute voting rule and 5-minute extra and on stacked votes 10 \nand 5. We have a great many amendments and a lot of work to do to \nfinish this bill before Memorial Day. We are about to proceed to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson. Senator \nCraig has asked specially for 5 minutes to talk about the President's \nspeech. We are not going to be able to accommodate discussions beyond \nthe Isakson amendment, except for Senator Craig. After the 5 minutes, \nSenator Isakson will be recognized to make the opening argument on his \namendment. We do not have a great deal of time under the order to \nproceed with the two votes at noon. So let us use the time as \nexpeditiously as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we resumed yesterday what I think most of \nus believe is a historic debate in consideration of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. This body debated immigration reform and brought \nforth a resolution in 1986. We did it once again in 1996. And here it \nis, 2006, and we are back, frustrated in some ways, angered in others, \nthat there may be as many as 12 million illegal immigrants in our \ncountry, illegal foreign nationals who came in a relatively \nuncontrolled or unenforced fashion.\n  Last night I heard, and America heard, our President deliver what I \nbelieve was one of the most comprehensive approaches toward dealing \nwith this issue. First and foremost, he recognized what the Congress \ndid not recognize in 1986, nor did we recognize it in 1996. No matter \nhow comprehensive our reform is, it will not work, unless this Nation \ncontrols and secures its borders and, therefore, devises programs that \nallow a reasonable number of foreign nationals to come into our economy \non an annual basis to help us grow and help us continue to be the great \nimmigrant Nation we are. Then the President, beyond his approach toward \nsecuring the border, talked about a variety of other approaches.\n  Let me talk only about border security. A good number of us began to \nwork with the White House several months ago, and our message was quite \nsimple. We didn't believe the Congress could fashion comprehensive \nimmigration reform, that the politics of the day were too contentious, \nunless we had convinced the American people, first and foremost, that \nprimarily our southern border would become more secure, that the flood \nof humanity coming across it on an hourly basis was stopped, and that \nthe comprehensive bill that would then be fashioned would recognize the \nneeds of our economy and bring workers to our economy in a reasonable \nfashion. The President gets it. His speech last night said it. While \nthe work the Judiciary Committee and the Senate have done do beef up \nborder control, you don't get there overnight. You don't invest \nbillions of dollars and stand up a virtual wall, and a real wall in \nsome places, in a 24-hour period. The President, understanding that, is \nnow engaging the four border States along our southwestern border, with \nthe complement of the National Guard, not to enforce but to facilitate \nthe Border Patrol, which is legally trained and deputized to do what is \nnecessary in the area of border enforcement.\n  Securing our southwestern border is critical. One AP reporter asked \nme last night: Isn't this political?\n  I said: It is not political at all. The President simply gets it. If \nthis Senate doesn't get it, shame on us. We can't write a bill in any \nfashion, Democratic\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\nor Republican, that works unless our borders are secure, and the law \nplays against the border in allowing an orderly approach through that \nborder on a daily and an annual basis.\n  Yes, our economy needs immigrant workers. We will need several \nhundreds of thousands a year, if we expect our economy to continue to \ngrow as it has, to prosper. But we want them to come to work. And those \nwho might want to stay ought to get in line and apply for citizenship \nand do as all other Americans have done in the past who were born in a \nforeign country, who came here and became an American. They \nassimilated. They learned our culture; they learned our history; they \nlearned to speak English; and we accepted them with open arms. It is \nthe vitality of our country. We have always accepted an orderly amount \nof the world's humanity to become Americans. But we did it in a \ncontrolled and responsible way. That is what our President said last \nnight. We ought to applaud him for an immediate approach to a problem \nwhile we work out the long-term approach. That debate is here today. \nThat debate is here for the balance of the week, to build a \ncomprehensive reform package that plays up against a secure border that \nour President proposed to us last night and that we should rush to help \nhim implement for the sake of this country.\n  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we now have 1 hour equally divided. On \nthis side, the time is under the control of Senator Isakson, who has \nsignified that there will be 5 minutes for Senator Cornyn, 5 minutes \nfor Senator Alexander, 5 minutes for Senator Chambliss, and we will try \nto find time for Senator Thune as well. We will alternate back and \nforth. Time is under the control of Senator Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How was that time \nallocated? Was that morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Idaho was \nallocated to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see. How much time on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 34 minutes. \nThe Senator from Georgia has 27\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It was my \nunderstanding that the time of the distinguished Senator from Idaho was \nnot a part of the debate but was to precede our debate, and we were \nsupposed to equally divide the remaining time. Am I incorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was allocated to the Senator from \nPennsylvania as the bill was laid down, equally divided.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. So we have how many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 27\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado will state it.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. My understanding was that under the unanimous consent \nagreement that had been entered into by the floor managers, the next \nhour would be divided equally between the Senator from Georgia in \nrelation to his amendment, as well as the amendment that I would be \noffering following the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time following the vote between now and 12 \no'clock has already been equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So we have 34 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of the Senator \nfrom Colorado. I thank the Senator from South Carolina, the Presiding \nOfficer. I thank Senator Specter, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nfor the untiring efforts he made on the bill and the courtesies he has \nshown to me. I thank leader Harry Reid for accommodating us and \nallowing us to come to the floor and have a debate. I particularly \nthank Lindsey Graham and John McCain for seeing to it that all of us \nwho had amendments to offer had a chance to negotiate the time to do \nthat. I especially thank my staff, in particular, Mike Quiello, for the \nwork he has done on this issue over a long period of time.\n  Mr. President, to set the stage for my remarks on my amendment, let \nme, first of all, tell you a little bit about myself. I am a product of \nthe legal immigration system of the United States. My grandfather came \nhere in 1903 and went through Ellis Island. There is nobody who has \ngreater respect for the hope and opportunity and the laws of our \ncountry than do I. I was in the construction industry, and I know the \ngreat contribution the workers made to construction and to tourism and \nto hospitality services and to agriculture.\n  I, also, know the issue before us is now the most important issue \ndomestically before the United States. When I ran for the Senate in \n2003 and 2004, the most commonly asked question after Iraq was: What \nare you going to do about illegal immigration? In the first speech on \nany issue I made as a Senator, I made the statement that I thought \nillegal immigration was the No. 1 domestic issue in this country.\n  I rise to tell you my mind has not been changed. I think neither have \nthe minds been changed of the American people because you have seen the \nintensity of the interest of all Americans in border security and \nimmigration.\n  My amendment is very simple. It says that before any provision of \nthis Immigration Act could grant legal status to someone who is here \nillegally is in effect, the Secretary of Homeland Security must certify \nto the President and the Congress that every provision for border \nsecurity and enforcement contained in title I and section 233 of title \nII is in place, funded, and is operational.\n  There is a simple reason for that. In 1986, this Congress, under \nPresident Ronald Reagan, passed a border security and amnesty bill for \nthe 3 million illegal aliens who were in this country. We enforced the \nborder and granted amnesty. And 20 years later, there are 11 million to \n13 million illegal aliens who have come because of the promise of this \ncountry and its opportunity but also because we have given a wink and a \nnod to the security of our borders.\n  I want to emphasize that I am not just talking about something I am \nthinking about or that I read. I have been to our border. I took a \ncodel with Senator Coleman in February. We went to Fort Huachuca in \nArizona and saw the unmanned aerial vehicle working and identifying \nthose coming across the border and sealing a 150-mile stretch. In San \nDiego, at the border with Juarez, we saw where the barriers at \nSmugglers' Gulch have effectively stopped the people coming through \nthat gully and immigrating illegally into this country. We went up and \ndown the border and saw the bits and pieces of security that worked. We \nalso saw the over 1,500 miles of the border that are not secure--the \n1,500 miles that have allowed people to come here either through \nsmuggling or through their own volition or by paying bribes to get \nhere, to get into our workforce, to overcrowd our schools, to stretch \nthe services in our emergency rooms and put great pressure on our civil \njustice system.\n  It is time that we seal the border and secure it so that the promise \nof legal immigration works and illegally entering this country is not \nthe preferred way to cross on our southern border.\n  I commend the President for his remarks last night. The President \nlast night said, in order, the five important things we must do. The \nfirst thing the President said is to secure the border. With this \namendment, with our commitment and with the President's commitment, \nsecuring the border will take place. Then we can grant a program to \nthose who are here illegally, with the sincere knowledge that we know \nno more are coming. If we grant programs and status to those who are \nhere illegally and look the other way, the next time we bring this up \nin 10 or 15 years, it will not be 12 million, it will be 24 million \nand, worst of all, we will have lost control.\n  Last night, the President said we are a nation of laws. And we are a \nnation of laws. I submit to you that when laws\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nare enforced, and they are enforced soundly, laws are obeyed and they \nare respected. We have not enforced our border and, therefore, its \nsecurity is not respected.\n  So I call on all of our colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, \neverybody who is interested in a comprehensive reform of our \nimmigration policy and our immigration system, to think what comes \nfirst. And what comes first is securing the border. After that, the \nAmerican people would be willing to work with us on programs to grant \nstatus. But in the absence of securing the border and making that \ncommitment, we are not going to have the cooperation of the American \npeople. We are not going to have comprehensive reform, and a growing \nproblem in this country will grow even greater.\n  My last point is there may be some who say you cannot secure the \nborder or it is going to take too long. Listen, this country put a man \non the Moon in 9 years, and we responded to the terrorist attacks \nwithin 3 weeks. This country can do anything it sets its mind to do. We \nknow how to do it. In incremental places, we do it now. It is time we \nput in the additional 6,000 border security agents, put the UAVs in the \nair, put the ground sensors on the ground, put the prosecuting \nofficials along the border in those jurisdictions to see to it that the \nlaw is enforced and prosecuted, and it is time that we build the \nbarriers in those areas that are easy smuggling corridors. We must make \na commitment to ourselves and the American people.\n  The Senator from Colorado is going to offer an amendment side by \nside. I read the amendment. It gives the President the authority to \nauthorize sections 4 and 6, which are the status sections, whenever it \nis in the best interest of the national security of the United States. \nThat is well and good, but that has nothing to do with security on the \nborder. If we don't adopt the Isakson amendment to secure the border, \nthen we will have given a wink and a nod one more time to those who \nwould come here illegally. We will have said to our local governments, \nschool systems, emergency rooms, and law enforcement officers that we \ndon't care.\n  Mr. President, I think we do care. I urge support for the Isakson \namendment to the immigration bill. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3994\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3994 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado (Mr. Salazar) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3994.\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit implementation of title IV and title VI until the \nPresident determines that implementation of such titles will strengthen \n              the national security of the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NATIONAL SECURITY DETERMINATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     President shall ensure that no provision of title IV or title \n     VI of this Act, or any amendment made by either such title, \n     is carried out until after the date on which the President \n     makes a determination that the implementation of such title \n     IV and title VI, and the amendments made by either such \n     title, will strengthen the national security of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, as we come back to the floor of the \nSenate today to take up this issue of national security and the \nnational urgency on workable immigration law, I want to first say that \nI applaud my colleagues both on the Democratic and the Republican sides \nwho have been working so hard to move forward with a comprehensive \nimmigration reform package.\n  I also want to say thank you to the President of the United States of \nAmerica for his statement last night to the Nation, in which he \nappealed to the best interests of America to come together and develop \na comprehensive immigration reform package. I believe it is worthwhile \nto quote again from what the President said last night.\n\n       Tonight I want to speak directly to Members of the House \n     and the Senate. An immigration reform bill needs to be \n     comprehensive because all elements of this problem must be \n     addressed together, or none of them will be solved at all. \n     The House has passed an immigration bill. The Senate should \n     act by the end of this month so that we can work out the \n     differences between the two bills and Congress can pass a \n     comprehensive bill for me to sign into law.\n\n  Again, he said we need to work on this problem together, on all of \nits elements, or none of the elements will be solved.\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 3994 is an amendment that takes a very \ndifferent approach from the Senator from Georgia, my good friend, \nSenator Isakson. As chairman Specter noted on the floor yesterday, the \nproponents of the Isakson amendment take the view that we ought to have \nall our border-strengthening and security measures in place before we \naddress any aspect of this problem. I don't think that that is an \neffective approach.\n  In the past, for the last 20 years, when we have tried to approach \nimmigration issues by only looking at one issue at a time, we have \nfailed. We have continually thrown money at a problem to increase \nborder security through funding. Yet our borders continue to be porous \nand broken, and the lawlessness that comes with that is something we \nsee across America. I don't believe we should let this crisis fester. I \ndon't believe we should continue to tolerate those being in the shadows \nof society, the 11 million undocumented workers in this country today. \nI don't believe we in the Senate should stand in the way of a \ncomprehensive immigration reform that has extensive bipartisan support \nin this body.\n  It is very clear to all of us today that the current situation is \ninadequate and there is a lot of work that needs to be done. I want to \nmove ahead on all fronts and take the comprehensive approach that has \nbeen discussed on this floor, and a comprehensive approach which the \nPresident himself has endorsed.\n  National security is at the heart of a workable immigration law, and \nwe should not allow an immigration law to go into effect if it will not \naddress the national security interests of the United States. That is \nat the heart of my amendment. My amendment is a very simple amendment. \nAs the clerk read that amendment, it was very clear and \nstraightforward, and it simply requires the President of the United \nStates to make a determination that the national security of the United \nStates will be strengthened by the following programs: Title IV, which \nincludes the new guest worker program, and title VI, which includes the \nprovisions relating to the 11 million undocumented workers who are \nliving in the shadows of America today; and it also includes the \nbipartisan changes to immigration that have been forged in this body by \nleaders such as Senator Craig and Senator Feinstein on agriculture jobs \nand the DREAM Act, which is another bipartisan measure. Under our \namendment, those provisions of the bill cannot be implemented unless \nand until the President of the United States finds that it is in the \nnational interest and for national security that those provisions of \nthe legislation be implemented.\n  Senator Isakson's amendment, on the other hand, is designed to weaken \nthis comprehensive approach. The approach of my friend from Georgia \nwould focus only on border enforcement. When we look at the history of \nthe last 20 years, approaches that have focused on border enforcement \nonly have been approaches that have not succeeded in dealing with the \nissue of immigration.\n  I agree with President Bush that we need to address this issue in a \ncomprehensive manner, and I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. \n3994.\n  At the end of the day, it seems to me that those of us in this body \nwho recognize the importance of this issue need to understand that the \nstool has to have three legs for us to develop comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  First, we need to secure our borders. In the legislation we have \nproposed, there are multiple provisions that deal with the \nstrengthening of our borders, including the doubling of the number of \nBorder Patrol officers, bringing in new technology that would allow us \nto make sure we know who is coming and going across our borders, and a \nnumber\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\nof other provisions that are intended to ensure that our borders become \nsecure.\n  The second leg of that stool is making sure that we are enforcing our \nimmigration laws within our country. We have not done an adequate job \nof enforcing our immigration laws in this country. The President \nacknowledged that reality as well. Our legislation will make sure that \nwe are enforcing our immigration laws within the interior of our \ncountry.\n  The third leg on that stool is to make sure we are addressing the \nhuman and economic reality of the 11 million people who currently live \nin an undocumented status in America today.\n  Sometimes when we get into these debates on the Senate floor, it is a \ndiscussion about policy, but it is also important for us never to \nforget why we are here, and never to forget that there are, in fact, \nmillions of human beings who are very much affected by the current \nsystem of lawlessness on our borders.\n  Sadly, last year, over 300 people died trying to cross the border. In \nmy own community, over the last several Sundays, I heard a Catholic \npriest talk about how it is that people were dying of thirst and hunger \nin the deserts of Arizona and places such as Texas. I heard my \ncolleague, my friend from Arizona, Senator John McCain, speak \neloquently and passionately about this issue.\n  Since 1998, more than 2,000 men, women, and children have lost their \nlives crossing the border between Mexico and the United States. That is \nnot what we are about in America. Anywhere else in America if we had \n2,000 people dying, the people of America would be standing up and \nsaying we must do something to correct this problem and to correct it \nin a way that is going to work. That is why a comprehensive solution is \nneeded in this situation. That is why my amendment No. 3994 was \nproposed. It will help us move down the road to developing that \ncomprehensive immigration reform package.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion. Is it the Senator's understanding that if we accept the \nIsakson amendment, we will continue to have this culture of illegality \nin the United States? If we accept the Isakson amendment, we will still \nhave the hiring by employers of illegal aliens, we will be driving \nwages down, we will still have a whole culture of illegality, we will \nhave people in the shadows, we will have people whose names we don't \nknow because we are unable to bring people out into the sunlight and \nunderstand who is actually here in terms of our national security? Does \nthe Senator from Colorado not believe that this is really--the Senator \nfrom Colorado, as I understand it, has been a strong supporter of \nborder security, provisions that are in the underlying bill. He has \nbeen a strong supporter to make sure that this is a key element in our \ntotal immigration strategy: a strong border and that we deal with the \ndangers of our border, but to understand that if we are going to be \nable to deal with the dangers of our border, we are going to also have \nto deal with enforcement in this country of employers. We are also \ngoing to have to deal with the adjustment of the status of those who \nare here. Is that the position of the Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. President, I want to understand clearly, he is not taking a \nsecond step to anyone, is he, in having a strong border enforcement; am \nI right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has the floor.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, my friend from Massachusetts is correct. \nWe stand firmly for the proposition that we need to absolutely secure \nour borders. Indeed, if we fail to address the reality of 11 million \npeople living in the shadows of the United States today, we will have \nfailed to achieve the national security objective.\n  If one thinks about what happened in the days after 9/11, our \nGovernment ought to know who is living in our society. We cannot know \nthat when we have 11 million people living in the shadows. Those people \nneed to be brought out of the shadows, they need to be brought out into \nthe sunlight, they need to be registered, they need to pay a fine, they \nneed to learn English, and they need to do the rest of the things we \ntalk about in this legislation.\n\n  The very fundamental principle of an immigration law to provide us \nwith national security in America will be altered if we are not able to \nmove forward with the implementation of those provisions of the law.\n  The proposal which my good friend from Georgia has proposed, the \nIsakson amendment, would essentially gut the sense of our comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill because we would not be able to deal with that \nreality and we would not be able to deal with the guest worker program \nthat the President of the United States is proposing.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, \ntherefore, the Senator from Colorado, with his amendment, believes that \nhe offers a path that is going to protect our national security in the \nmost effective way because we will gain information, we will gain \nknowledge, we will understand the people who are here and will know \ntheir names, will know their addresses, will know where they live, and \nthey will be part of our society.\n  Secondly, I understand that he believes that without his amendment, \nwe are still going to have this culture of illegality where we have \nemployers hiring undocumented workers. The Isakson amendment doesn't do \nanything about that, as I understand. If we adopt the Isakson \namendment, we will still have the exploitations of undocumented \nworkers, and we will also have the conditions where we are driving \nwages down, which drives wages down for Americans. Does the Senator not \nbelieve that will continue to be the result unless we do a \ncomprehensive approach?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I agree with my friend from \nMassachusetts. In fact, that would happen. We would have 11 million \nworkers who probably would continue to work as they have been working \nnow, for some of them decades in this country, and that the system of \nillegality in terms of employers hiring undocumented workers is simply \na system that is going to continue into the future unabated. That is \nwhy it is so essential that we move forward with this issue in a \ncomprehensive approach.\n  Last night the President was absolutely correct in his statement that \nwe cannot deal with this issue of immigration reform in a piecemeal \nmanner. We have to deal with it in a comprehensive manner that \naddresses the issue of 11 million undocumented workers who are in this \ncountry today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Colorado has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 more minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for an \nadditional 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand the Senator from \nColorado, his position, quite frankly, is much more consistent with \nwhat the President talked about last night, am I correct, where the \nPresident talked about a comprehensive approach to deal with the \nchallenges of illegality. And his position is that we ought to look at \nit in a comprehensive way, and the best way to deal with illegality on \nthe border is to also deal with illegality in employment and deal with \nlegality and illegality in adjusting the status in terms of earning the \nright to remain here; am I correct?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, my friend from Massachusetts is, in fact, \ncorrect. We need to deal with the entire set of immigration issues \ntoday, including the illegal hiring of people in this country. The \nprovisions we have set forward in this bill will allow us to, in fact, \nbring those people who are here illegally and who are undocumented out \nof the shadows so we can address the national security interests.\n  My amendment requires the President of the United States to basically \nsay that before the guest worker program is implemented, the President \nhas to determine that it is in the interest of national security for us \nto implement those provisions; that before we move forward with the \nprogram that addresses the reality of 11 million undocumented workers, \nthe President of the United States shall acknowledge and make a \nstatement that, in fact, it is in the national security interests of\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\nthe United States of America. That is why this amendment is a much \nbetter, preferred approach than the amendment which is being offered by \nmy friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, finally, I have my differences with the \nPresident, but I agree with the Senator from Colorado. We support that \njudgment and that decision and his ability to make that judgment and \ndecision. That is what the Senator from Colorado supports, and I do, \ntoo.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia controls 20 minutes, \nand the Senator from Massachusetts controls 17 minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senators, Mr. \nSalazar and Mr. Kennedy, who are both Senators and lawyers and \nunderstand smoke and mirrors. I think they understand the enforcement \nof the law. The Isakson amendment calls for us to enforce the laws that \nhave been brought about because of the lack of enforcement, which is \nwhy this bill is on the floor of the Senate now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Chambliss, \nCornyn, Alexander, Domenici, and Santorum be added as original sponsors \nof the Isakson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize for 10 minutes \nthe Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is no doubt that trying to fix our \nbroken immigration system is a complex issue. Frankly, part of what we \nhave been trying to do is to find solutions that thread the needle and \nshrink the gap between the approach of the House of Representatives, \nwhich is primarily an enforcement-only bill, and comprehensive \nimmigration reform that I believe is supported by most of us in the \nSenate, including myself.\n  I differ with the sponsors of the bill in the Senate, and I intend to \noffer amendments that will, I believe, improve it, while retaining its \ncomprehensive nature. I believe it is simply surreal to suggest that \nwhat the amendment of the Senator from Georgia does somehow retreats to \nthe House position and is an enforcement-only approach.\n  Indeed, I think the Senator from Georgia has struck upon an ingenious \nway to thread the needle by saying, yes, we believe that border \nsecurity is important; yes, we believe that we ought to produce the \ncomputer systems, hire and train the people, create the databases which \nwill actually make this reform work, rather than put the cart before \nthe horse and say, with the stroke of a pen, that 12 million people who \nare living out of legal status are suddenly legal; and, yes, we are \ngoing to have 325,000 new people each year come into the country, \nregardless of whether our economy is in a boom or a bust and possibly \ncompete with Americans for those jobs.\n  What the Senator from Georgia has done is say let's put the horse in \nfront of the cart, not the cart in front of the horse. Let's do first \nthings first. Let's make sure this will actually work.\n  Last night the President talked about sending 6,000 National Guard \ntroops to help the Border Patrol secure the border, recognizing that it \ntakes time to train Border Patrol agents. We now train them at the rate \nof 1,500 a year, and we can't all of a sudden secure the border because \nwe can't all of a sudden train enough Border Patrol agents. We can't \nall of a sudden, with the wave of a magic wand, build the \ninfrastructure that is necessary. We can't, with the wave of a magic \nwand, issue the request for proposals to actually let the contracts \nthat will allow the construction of the computer systems and the \ndatabases that will actually make this work. We can't, with the wave of \na magic wand, say we are going to create a secure identification card \nwhich will allow employers to verify the eligibility of prospective \nemployees. It is going to take a little bit of time.\n  But that is not the same thing as saying, as the Senator from \nColorado has said, that somehow we are going with an enforcement-only \napproach.\n  I support a comprehensive immigration reform plan that is built on a \nfoundation of border security, that says we need to have worksite \nverification, that we need to have a secure identification card so that \nemployers can determine whether in fact a person is eligible to work. I \nbelieve we ought to have sanctions against employers who cheat. I \nbelieve we ought to have a temporary worker program, not like the \nproposed guest worker program in this underlying bill, and that will be \nthe subject for future amendments.\n  The message we need to send the American people is that we are \nactually serious about making this proposed comprehensive immigration \nreform system work. If we adopt the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado, it will send a message that we are not serious about making \nsure we have the infrastructure and the people and the systems and the \ncards in place that will actually make this comprehensive reform work.\n  The American people have already been burned once very badly when it \ncomes to comprehensive immigration reform. In 1986, when President \nRonald Reagan signed an amnesty, the tradeoff was supposed to be \nworksite verification and employer sanctions for employers who cheat. \nBut the Federal Government never did what it was supposed to do by \nproviding the means for employers to actually make that determination \nin a way that had some integrity. Now I believe the American people are \nlooking at us skeptically, wondering whether we are going to try to \npull the rug out from under them again.\n  The American people can be amazingly tolerant, they can be amazingly \nforgiving, but they won't be mocked, and they will not believe us \nunless we build some confidence into the system by saying we are going \nto take care of helping to secure the border, we are going to provide \nthe means to enforce this system, before we are going to implement a \n12-million person amnesty which will put a tremendous load on the men \nand women who are supposed to administer this system. Can you imagine \nhow long it will take to make this happen? All this does is say let's \ndo first things first, rather than put the cart before the horse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Michigan has \na special request. We know it is not completely consistent with the \nsubject matter at hand, but we are willing to yield time, Senator \nSalazar and I, out of our time, so we are not going to delay the \nproceedings of the Senate. This is an important matter.\n  I yield 4 minutes, if that is sufficient time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                  Medicare Prescription Part-D Benefit\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who are managing \nthis very important bill and Senators Kennedy and Salazar as well. We \nare engaged in an important debate right now, but there is another \nimportant debate going on around every kitchen table and in every \nsenior citizen center right now, which is what is going to happen today \nafter they can no longer sign up for the Medicare prescription Part D \nbenefit.\n  We know that for about 3 million low-income seniors, they are going \nto be allowed to continue to sign up until the end of the year without \npenalty. But for the 3 million to 5 million seniors who are not in that \ncategory, they are not allowed to continue to sign up, and there will \nbe a penalty between now and November when they can sign up again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of a bill which I will send to the desk now which extends \nthe enrollment deadline for Medicare Part D, waives the late enrollment \npenalty, provides the option for a one-time change of plan during 2006, \nand provides increased funding for State health insurance counseling \nand assistance programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am hearing this for the first time. I \nmust\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\nobject until I take a look at it and consult with some people on this \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. For current purposes, I do object.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might just continue, there are \nthree important pieces in this bill. They are certainly not new to us. \nI appreciate we are in the middle of another important discussion, but \nwe have had an ongoing discussion with seniors all across America who \nare concerned about this issue. If not this entire bill, I ask \nunanimous consent to pass a bill that would at least extend the \nenrollment until the end of the year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am constrained to object again until I \nhave had a chance to examine the specifics as to what the Senator from \nMichigan is offering.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I add that I have joined with other Senators in \nseeking to have an extension of the date. So I am in agreement with \nwhat I believe to be the thrust of what the Senator from Michigan seeks \nto accomplish. But speaking for myself, I would have to know more and \nexamine the documents before I could refrain from objecting. And on \nbehalf of others on this side, as the manager of the bill, it is \nincumbent upon me to give them an opportunity to examine what the \nSenator from Michigan wants to do. So I am constrained to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Michigan \nhas 1 minute remaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I then ask, because of the seriousness \nand sense of urgency, that we have unanimous consent at least to pass \nthe bill containing only the part that waives the late enrollment \npenalty that starts today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I again object for the reasons I said. I \nwill be glad to have the effort of the Senator from Michigan renewed \nlater today when I have had a chance to examine it and others have had \na chance to examine it. But on this state of the record, hearing it for \nthe first time and being surprised by it, we need time to study it and \ntime for others to consider it.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator has 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate the position of the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, but I ask unanimous consent to pass the bill \ncontaining a provision which provides at least a one-time change of \nplan during 2006.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Objection, without restating all my reasons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The time of the Senator \nhas expired. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Chair please advise me when 60 seconds \nremains.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia and congratulate him \non his amendment.\n  The President talked last night about what we need to do to secure \nour borders. He took an important step forward. He committed to \ndoubling the number of Border Patrol agents during his time as \nPresident. As that is ramped up, he said he would ask the National \nGuard to help us fill the gap. Guard members would help by operating \nsurveillance systems, analyzing intelligence, installing fences and \nvehicle barriers, building patrol roads, and providing training. As a \nformer commander in chief of the Tennessee National Guard when I was \nGovernor, the proposal sounded to me eminently sensible.\n  The President also talked about using high-technology verification \ncards, ways that employers could do a better job of making certain the \npeople they hire are legally here. He talked about Federal-State \ncooperation being improved with State and local law enforcement.\n  All of this will take some time, but we need to do whatever we can in \nthe Senate to ensure that the President's commitment to secure the \nborder succeeds. That is why I joined with Senator Gregg and others \nlast week to add $1.9 billion to the Border Patrol during our debate on \nthe emergency supplemental bill. That money will help replace outdated \nvehicles that are breaking down and purchase new boats and other \nequipment. That is why I am cosponsoring the amendment of Senator \nIsakson today. Senator Isakson's amendment says clearly: Border \nsecurity must come first.\n  Under this amendment, we can still pass, I believe--and I will ask \nthe Senator this question when my time has expired--we can still pass a \ncomprehensive immigration bill, but we can't adjust the legal status of \nthose illegally here until the border is secure. We have no business \npassing a comprehensive immigration bill without making sure first that \nthe border will be secure. Upholding the rule of law on our border is \nas important as defending our freedom in Iraq. A nation that loses \ncontrol of its own borders is a nation that will not likely exist for \nlong.\n  Last year, more than half a million new citizens became Americans. \nThey had waited 5 years, learned English, pledged allegiance to our \ncountry, had foresworn allegiance to the country from which they came, \nand learned about our Constitution and laws. They know the principles \nthat unite us as Americans--not our race, not our ancestry, but \nprinciples. Among those principles are equal opportunity and laissez-\nfaire. We thrive on immigration in this country. But among those \nprinciples, too, is our unity. And first among those principles--at \nleast none is more important--is the principle of the rule of law. \nThose half-million new citizens know that they are free to drive here \nacross the country but not to run stop lights; that they are free to \nmake contracts in this economy but not to break them; that they are \nfree to own a gun under the second amendment but not to shoot someone.\n  We thrive on legal immigration, but we cannot tolerate illegal \nimmigration.\n  I would like to ask through the Chair, if I may, a question of the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Through the Chair, my question to the Senator from \nGeorgia is this: I favor a comprehensive immigration bill. I would like \nto see border security. I would like to see legal status for students \nwho study here, for skilled people who help win Nobel Prizes here and \nimprove our economy. I would like to see a comprehensive immigration \nbill that includes help for people legally here to learn English and \nlearn our history and unite us as Americans. But, Senator Isakson, am I \ncorrect that if we pass your amendment, it is still true, is it not, \nthat we can pass a comprehensive immigration bill that includes all of \nthese provisions I just described? The only difference is, as I \nunderstand it, that we may not adjust the legal status of those \nillegally here until the border is secure? Am I correct about that or \nam I wrong about that?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator is absolutely correct, and the premise is \nyou don't want to create an attraction for more to come until the \nborder is secure and we know we put an end to it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, The Isakson amendment is designed to tear \napart the interwoven fabric of a bill that many of us have worked so \nhard in a bipartisan manner to pass in the Senate.\n  The Isakson amendment asserts that there can be no guest worker \nprogram and no legalization path for undocumented immigrants currently \nin the United States until security at the borders is guaranteed. \nSounds good, until you realize that comprehensive immigration reform \nconsists of several interrelated steps, each depending on the rest in \norder to maximize the prospects of the overall plan to get the job \ndone. This amendment is a prescription for failure, by ripping a \ncomprehensive plan apart. That is why this amendment has been described \nas a ``poison pill'' that would undermine the bipartisan bill before \nthe Senate.\n  The Senate recently passed the Defense supplemental appropriations \nbill, a bill that included nearly $2 billion for border security. It \nseems that what\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\nSenator Isakson wants the Senate to do is to wait until all of those \nfunds are expended, and then assess our security. Many of us have been \nfighting for years to improve border security by targeting more \nresources for technology on the borders and by adding additional Border \nPatrol agents. The Bush administration repeatedly failed to fulfill \nCongress's directives in recent years, but I was pleased to hear the \nPresident say last night that he now supports increasing the number of \nBorder Patrol agents by 6,000. He made a statement last night that was \nstronger and displayed a stronger commitment than we have heard from \nhim previously, and I hope he plans to follow through on his words.\n  The President also spoke about the need to simultaneously implement \nguest worker programs and a path to earned citizenship for the \nundocumented. This is similar to the comprehensive approach that those \nof us who supported the Judiciary Committee bill, and then the Hagel-\nMartinez compromise, still believe is necessary to reform our broken \nsystem and to secure our borders. Do Senator Isakson and the supporters \nof his amendment believe that the President is taking the Nation in the \nwrong direction? I find it troubling that with such strong bipartisan \nsupport for S. 26l1 in the Senate, and the leadership of the White \nHouse on the core principles of the bill, these Senators refuse to join \nin constructive efforts to enact comprehensive reform. From the \nbeginning, many voices outside of the Senate have been intent on \nbringing down this bill.\n  Senator Salazar has offered an alternative that supports the \nprinciples of S. 2611 and that reflects the goals laid out by the \nPresident in his statement last night. I urge all Members of the Senate \nto vote against the Isakson ameendment and for the Salazar alternative. \nWe must work toward comprehensive solutions that secure our borders and \nstrengthen the Nation, not piecemeal gambits that undermine the efforts \nof bipartisan progress toward a Senate bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. So 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes remain under the control of the Senator from Georgia, 12\\1/2\\ \nminutes under the control of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to myself, 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and 4 minutes to the Senator from Colorado.\n  I ask the Chair, when I have 30 seconds left, to be informed.\n  Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Georgia does nothing \nwith regard to the National Guard. I have listened to the debate and \ndiscussion about the National Guard. Frankly, the way the President \ndescribed it last night, the Guard would be very limited. They have \nmainly a supportive kind of proposal. I have real concerns because in \nmy State the Guard is very busy today with the flooding we have in part \nof Massachusetts. But we are open, at least I am open, on this issue. \nThis amendment has nothing to do with that.\n  The fact is that those of us who oppose the amendment of the Senator \nand support Senator Salazar's amendment believe in strong border \nsecurity. But we also read history. We know the record on the border. \nTwenty years ago, we had 40,000 people who were coming in here \nillegally; 10 years ago, it was 400,000. Do you know what we did? We \nspent $20 billion over the last 10 years, we have increased border \nguards by 300 percent, and guess what: We have doubled the numbers to \n800,000 today--to 800,000.\n  What is the answer to that? The answer to that is we need tough \nborder security, but we need tough law enforcement here in the United \nStates, and we have to deal with the legality or adjustment of status \nfor those who are here, prepared to pay a penalty, work hard, play by \nthe rules, participate in the armed services of our country, and then \njoin the end of the line for those people waiting to come into the \nUnited States--at the end of the line, and 11 years from now be able to \nachieve citizenship.\n  The fact remains, if you only do one of the proposals--and this the \nPresident of the United States understands and spoke to very clearly. I \nhave my differences with the President, but he is absolutely right. He \nunderstands history. He is a border State Governor, and he knows you \ncan't do this by itself, only at the border. The fact is, in the bill \nthat we support, we increased by 12,000 the border patrol. We create a \nvirtual fence.\n  If the Senator from Georgia has additional national security matters \nthat they think can be added, we are glad to consider them. But we are \ndealing with the recognition that you have to have a comprehensive \napproach if you are going to gain control of the borders. History \nteaches us that. We have had hours and days of hearings about that. All \nyou have to do is look at what has happened to the border in the last \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as has been pointed out, it is a three-\nlegged stool: tough border security, tough legal enforcement here in \nthe United States, and a recognition of our humanity and decency and \nour immigration background. If people are prepared to pay a penalty, \nplay by the rules, work hard, and stay free from any trouble with law \nenforcement, at the end of the line they can earn American citizenship. \nThat is the way to go, and the Isakson amendment short circuits that \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has made \nthe most eloquent statement in favor of this amendment I have ever \nheard. He put on the record exactly what we raised in title I, section \n133, to secure the border. I appreciate his comments.\n  I am happy to yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nChambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Isakson \namendment and am proud to be a cosponsor. The American people have \nheard Senators from both sides of the aisle and across the political \nspectrum come down to the floor of the Senate to talk about the 1986 \nImmigration Reform and Control Act and how it did not solve the problem \nof illegal immigration. This was the first attempt by Congress to \naddress the issue of illegal immigration in a comprehensive way. The \nImmigration Reform and Control Act was the product of a number of \ncompromises, the main one being legalizing the illegal population in \nexchange for stronger enforcement of our immigration laws both at the \nborder and inside the country.\n\n  However, we all know now that the 1986 legislation, which closely \nmirrors S. 2611, did not work and, in fact, invited further illegal \nimmigration, resulting in the critical situation we face regarding \nillegal immigration today.\n  As the Senate considers S. 2611 we are operating under the assumption \nthat there are around 11 million illegal immigrants who will take \nadvantage of an amnesty. But the fact is that we simply do not know how \nmany illegal immigrants are in the U.S. some venture to guess that \nthere are 20 million or more.\n  However, once again we find that many in the Senate are willing to \nmake the same compromise that was made in 1986: legalize an unlimited \namount of illegal aliens in exchange for increasing border security, \ninterior enforcement, and worksite enforcement.\n  I personally do not agree with this approach. I do not believe that \nwe should provide illegal immigrants with a new path to citizenship \nthrough this bill or any bill. I do not think it is the right way to \naddress the presence of a large number of illegal immigrants.\n  While I do not believe in providing a new path to citizenship for \nillegal immigrants, the Judiciary Committee disagreed. As a result, the \nSenate is now considering a bill that will provide a pathway to \ncitizenship for illegal immigrants. If we are willing to travel down \nthe same path that proved not to work before, shouldn't we ask \nourselves what didn't work with the 1986 amnesty that will work today? \nWhat has changed?\n  I think one of the main problems with the 1986 amnesty bill was that \nit ended up being one sided--the government adjusted the status of \nmillions of illegal immigrants but the promise of greater border \nsecurity, interior enforcement, and worksite enforcement never \nmaterialized.\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\n  That is why Senator Isakson's amendment is so critical. It says that \nwe cannot implement any program to grant legal status to an illegal \nimmigrant provided in this bill until the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity certifies in writing to the President and to Congress that the \nborder security measures in this bill are complete and operational. \nThis is a very simple amendment.\n  I do not see how any Senator who is serious about border security and \nenforcing our immigration laws can disagree with Senator Isakson's \namendment. It is that we ensure, before we take the same path we did in \n1986, a path I disagree with, that we remedy one of the fatal flaws of \nthe 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.\n  Disagreeing with this amendment sends the message to the American \npeople that we are more eager to give illegal immigrants a path to \ncitizenship than we are to secure our borders from further illegal \nimmigration and the smuggling of illegal drugs and weapons. I know that \nis not the message my constituents in Georgia want to hear.\n  Regardless of where Georgians stand on dealing with the current \nillegal population, the constant refrain I hear from folks back home \nis: secure the border. If we do not secure the border and have serious \ninterior and worksite enforcement, then we have accomplished nothing. \nThe American people demand no more and deserve no less.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this critical amendment, which will show the \nAmerican people that providing an amnesty to millions of illegal \nimmigrants is not more important than securing our borders. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Isakson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 9 \nminutes, the Senator from Georgia controls 4 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the President's \nspeech last night. He gets it. As you listen to the debate on the floor \nfrom both sides the aisle, more and more Republican and Democratic \nSenators get it. They understand it now. It isn't just a matter of \ngetting tough. It isn't just a matter of enforcement. It is a matter of \nenforcement and a process that results in comprehensive immigration \nreform.\n  If it were just a matter of making it tough to cross our borders, you \nwould assume we would have moved toward solving the problem. But it \nhasn't happened. In the last decade, we have doubled the number of \nBorder Patrol agents. They have spent eight times as many hours \npatrolling the border in that 10-year period of time, and during that \nsame period the number of undocumented immigrants coming into the \nUnited States has doubled--despite this dramatic increase in resources. \nEnforcement at the border is not stopping the flow.\n  The comprehensive bill says you need to do three things. You need \nborder enforcement. I support what the President said last night. I \nthink sending the National Guard, if we can get all the details, on an \ninterim basis is a good thing to move toward enforcement. But you also \nneed to have enforcement in the workplace so there is no magnet for \nthese people to move into the United States. And you need to deal \nhonestly with the 11 million or 12 million who are here and bring them \nout of the shadows so that we know who they are and where they are, \nwhether they are working and whether they pose any threat to this \ncountry. It is a comprehensive approach.\n  Senator Isakson is stuck on the first issue--just enforce the borders \nand do nothing else until you have enforced the borders. But we have \nlearned that is, in and of itself, not successful. You need to have a \ncomprehensive approach--enforcement at borders, enforcement in the \nworkplace, and a process that brings these people out of the shadows.\n  Senator Salazar has offered a reasonable alternative. He says leave \nit to the President of the United States to certify that it is in the \nbest interest of our national security to move forward with this \nprocess. That puts a mind on the job that we need. It isn't just a \nsimple certification of enforcement; it looks at the whole picture. \nUntil you look at the whole picture on immigration, we will continue to \nhave politicians debate it back and forth, with their 30-second ads \nflying in both directions, and nothing is going to happen.\n  This is a unique opportunity in our history to move forward with \ncomprehensive immigration reform, something that will finally work.\n  Twenty years ago, when we granted amnesty, we thought it was the end \nof the issue. We were wrong. We have seen a dramatic increase in \nillegal immigration into the United States. Now, 20 years later, let us \nnot repeat the mistake with a simpleminded, linear approach that says \nif we just get tough on the border, everything will be fine. You have \nto do the whole package. The President argued for that last night.\n  Part of that enforcement in the workplace is a tamper-proof ID card \nusing biometrics so we know who that employee is, where they live, what \ntheir background may be, and finally a process--a long, tough process--\nwhere those who are here undocumented can earn their way into legal \nstatus. It may take them 10 years, it may take them 12 years, but in \nthat period of time, they have to learn English, they have to work, \nthey have to pay their taxes, they have to pay any fines they owe this \nGovernment for coming into this country, and they have to show they \nhave a demonstrated knowledge of our history and the way our Government \nworks. They have to report every year so we know that they are keeping \nup with their requirements. And if they stick with it for 10 or 12 \nyears, they will reach legal status. It is not amnesty, but it is a \nsensible part of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Salazar and oppose Senator \nIsakson's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized for 4 \nminutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me reiterate that the approach which \nwas outlined by the President, which the bipartisan coalition of \nSenators has been working on, is a comprehensive approach. History has \nshown that when we take only one aspect of immigration reform, we fail. \nWe failed in 1986. We failed at different efforts over the last 20 \nyears. This time, we have to get it right.\n  The President of the United States is right when he ultimately stated \nlast night that we need comprehensive immigration reform. The proposed \namendment by my colleague from the State of Georgia, and my good \nfriend, essentially would take what are the 54 provisions of title I in \nthis piece of legislation we are currently considering, going from \nsection 101 all the way to section 154. It essentially would say that \nwe are only going to be about a border enforcement bill without dealing \nwith the other aspects of the legislation which is proposed. He would \nleave on the side what we do to bring the 11 million people who are \nhere out of the shadows and get them registered in a system where we \ncan monitor them, make sure if they are criminals they are deported, \nmake sure if they are law-abiding citizens we put them in a kind of \nguest worker program that will work, and his provision essentially \nwould gut this bill.\n  The proposal of my good friend from Georgia is no different in most \nrespects from what came out of the House of Representatives. It is a \nborder-enforcement-only bill. It has been said time and time again that \nif we are going to address the issue of immigration reform, we need to \ndo it in a comprehensive manner. We need to move with border \nenforcement, and our legislation does that. The President's statement \nlast night that in the meantime we will go ahead and have the National \nGuard assist us in making sure we are securing our borders needs to be \nfollowed.\n\n  Second, we need to make sure we are enforcing our immigration laws \nwithin the interior of our country. Our legislation proposes to do \nthat.\n  Third, we need to deal with the reality of the bill and the elephant \nin the\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nroom--the 11 million people who are living here in the United States \ntoday. We need to bring them out of the shadows. My friend from Georgia \nwould propose to leave them in the shadows for an indefinite period of \ntime, whether it be 5 years, 20 years, or 30 years, whatever it might \nbe. That will not work. We need to move forward with comprehensive \nimmigration reform today.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Isakson amendment and to support \nthe amendment which I have offered.\n  I yield my time back to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute 30 seconds to the \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be \nadded as an original cosponsor of the Isakson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of that \namendment this morning.\n  This approach is a very sound concept. In fact, as we get to the \ndebate about immigration, clearly the first and most important issue to \ndeal with is the issue of border security, and the people across this \ncountry are asking us to deal with it. Frankly, until we deal with that \nissue, we can't move on to the next issue of dealing with the 12 \nmillion people who are here already. Until we give the American people \nthe confidence that we are serious about enforcing the border, that \nbecomes an irrelevant conversation. This is a very simple concept.\n  I have supported the Isakson amendment since he first introduced it. \nWe discussed this issue several weeks ago when he had his amendment \nfiled and pending. I am glad we will have an opportunity to vote on it. \nI believe it is a very sound approach. It simply says that until we do \nthese things, we can't do these things. The first and foremost \nparamount responsibility here is border security.\n  We need to enforce our borders. The Isakson amendment makes that \nabundantly clear.\n  Again, before we can deal with the other issues in this debate, I \nbelieve the American people expect us to have a secure border and one \nthat is enforced and one that we are serious about in getting our \nillegal immigration stopped.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take the last minute 20 seconds.\n  We ought to learn from history. What we learn from history, from the \nstudies on the border and listening to those hearings, is that just \ntrying to build up the border and add the fence down there is not going \nto solve the problem. If you read from history, as has been pointed out \nby Republicans and Democrats, if you just grant amnesty, it doesn't \nsolve the problem.\n  We have crafted a balanced program which will have strong national \nsecurity, strong border protection, and also have strong enforcement in \nterms of employers and recognize that those individuals who are here \nworking hard, playing by the rules, and paying the fines, we will have \nthe ability to adjust their status.\n  You have to have the three legs of the stool. History teaches us \nthat. The Isakson amendment will take two of those important legs away. \nIt doesn't make sense if we are interested in national security, and it \ndoesn't make sense if we want to have real immigration reform. The \nPresident understands it. I hope the Senate will.\n  The President understands it. I hope the Senate will.\n  Mr. REID. Is all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senate majority still has 2\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Facts are stubborn figures. Senator Kennedy said we \nshould learn from history. He served in 1986, when we passed a bill \nthat promised border security that did not deliver and granted amnesty \nthat did not deliver, and we ended up quadrupling the number of illegal \naliens in the United States.\n  Facts are also stubborn because every word he said about the Isakson \namendment is inaccurate. He did not discuss a single word of the 614 \npages, except to say before you grant legal status to people here \nillegally, we must have border security so we do not repeat the tragedy \nof 1986.\n  In Deep South Georgia, we have an old saying: If you want to get the \nmud out of the spring, you have to get the hog out of the water. The \nhog in the water in this debate is those who have been trying to \nobfuscate everything we are trying to say.\n  Simply, we want the same thing. We want comprehensive reform. That \nbegins with what the President said last night: Border security first. \nThe President said last night that we can do it by 2008. Ask Congress \nfor the money. This is an authorization. I want a commitment.\n  If we do not commit to the people of the United States of America--\nour school systems that are overcrowded, our health care and emergency \nrooms that are challenged, our civil justice system is challenged--and \nsee to it that we get a border that is secure so we can manage our \nlegal immigration in the future, history will be the teacher that we \nhad in 1986.\n  Facts are stubborn things. The fact is, the Isakson amendment on this \ncomprehensive reform says what the President said last night, that \nsecuring the border first is job one. I submit anything that anyone \nsays that is the opposite means they want to repeat the tragedy of \n1986.\n  I ask my colleagues to sincerely search their heart and soul for \ntheir constituents and vote in favor of this amendment. Let's have \ncomprehensive reform that begins with a secure border.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. REID. I will use my leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    10,000th vote for Senator Levin\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the next vote cast, we are going to vote \non the Isakson amendment, and then we will vote on the Salazar \namendment. On the Salazar vote, the distinguished senior Senator from \nthe State of Michigan, Carl Levin, will cast his 10,000th vote.\n  It is very difficult in a short period of time, or a long period of \ntime, to convey to the American people and to this Senate the \npersonality of Carl Levin. I have had the good fortune of serving in \nCongress now for more than two decades. Prior to that, I had the good \nfortune of representing the State of Nevada in other positions in \ngovernment. Carl Levin is a unique individual. I have never served with \nanyone whom I had greater respect for his ability to understand an \nissue.\n  There are so many instances. I can look at the last time we did the \nDefense authorization bill. We worked very hard to get 45 Democratic \nSenators to have an amendment that we could agree on that we would put \nforward our position on the intractable war in Iraq, led by Carl Levin. \nIn numerous meetings we held in my office, we came up with an \namendment. He would come back each time with his handwritten notes that \nthis needed to be changed or that needed to be changed.\n  To show his integrity and how people feel about him on both sides of \nthe aisle, when we finished our difficult work, he called me within an \nhour and said: Would you mind if I discussed this with Senator Warner? \nI said: Of course, not. Within a few minutes, Senator Warner was a \ncosponsor of that Democratic amendment. It was not a Democratic \namendment, as we thought it was, it was an amendment for the Senate, \nand it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.\n  With the Schiavo case that came before the Senate, a very difficult \nmatter that came before the Senate, we were out of session. Carl Levin \nwas in town. He worked on this, as many will recall, during the recess. \nWe went back and looked at it some more. Carl Levin was changing parts \nof this. Changes were agreed upon by the Senate, and when this matter \nwent to the Eleventh Circuit, the reason they decided the way they did \nis because of what Levin did to this matter before the Senate.\n  These are only two examples I came up with as I walked into the \nSenate. The instances are too numerous to mention, but it is not \ndifficult to mention what a difference he has made in the Senate and in \nour country.\n  Here is a man who has an exemplary family. His wife Barbara is one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\nloveliest, kindest, finest people, with one of the best smiles I have \never seen on a person I have ever known. He has three daughters.\n  To try to convey the kind of man he is, I was thinking about running \nfor the Senate. I was a Member of the House of Representatives. I came \nto visit Carl Levin. One of the first things I said to him after I said \nhello, I said: I served in Congress with your brother, Sandy. Carl \nLevin said to me, in the most positive, affectionate way about his \nbrother, he said: Yes, he is my brother, but he is also my best friend.\n  That is Carl Levin, a man who was born in Detroit, MI, who has an \noutstanding educational background. He was a law professor. He \npracticed law. He now joins a distinguished group of Senators. Carl \nLevin will shortly cast his 10,000th vote. Senators Sarbanes, Lugar, \nand Hatch are in that category. Over 12,000 votes for Senators Leahy, \nBiden, and Domenici. Over 14,000 votes for Senators Stevens, Inouye, \nand Kennedy; and Senator Byrd has over 17,000 votes. One, two, three, \nfour, five, six, seven, eight, nine, he is in the top ten. And that is \nthe same reason that Time magazine announced that Carl Levin was one of \nthe best Senators in the United States. I agree with Time magazine. \nCongratulations, Carl.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Democratic leader \nfor everything he said and for everything he stands for and who he is.\n  This is a moment I have not looked forward to in terms of responding \nto what I knew was forthcoming. Basically, I don't feel 10,000 votes \nold. The Senate has changed a lot in the last 27 years. Some things \nhave not changed. The trust and the affection and respect we feel for \neach other is still the basis of our operations. That has not changed.\n  This Senate is still, surely, the singular place in the world, where \nmen and women can give their own lives and do so with respect for the \nrights of the minority to debate, to deliberate, and, yes, to delay, if \nthat is important to making an issue clear.\n  The resilient strength of this Senate makes it almost impossible for \nsomeone to serve without sensing the majesty of this place and the \nspecial responsibility we all have as caretakers of the Senate.\n  In addition to my leader, I thank all the leaders of this Senate for \nmaking it what it is and keeping it what it is so be. I thank all my \ncolleagues for all of the courtesies they have shown me over the years.\n  Let me thank my family for the constancy with which they have \nsupported me and thank my staff for all the help they have provided to \nme. We all know we cannot function without family and staff giving us \nthe total support.\n  I thank our leader for mentioning my wife Barbara and our three \nchildren. I would only add four grandchildren to that. Other than that, \nhe did cover the waterfront so well for us, and I am grateful for that.\n  Finally, let me thank the people of Michigan who have honored me for \nall these years with their trust and what is the responsibility that we \nall bear to our State and to our people.\n  I look forward to working with each of you, my colleagues, in the \nfuture as we have in the past. And a special thanks, again, to you \nSenator Reid for the feeling and passion with which you do your work \nand in speaking those words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Isakson amendment No. \n3961.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And I ask for the yeas and nays on the following \namendment, on the Salazar amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent Senator Martinez be added as a \ncosponsor to amendment No. 3994, which is my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment numbered 3961. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                      Congratulating Senator Levin\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before we proceed to the next vote, I \nwant to acknowledge that this is a historic vote for us in Michigan \nbecause our senior Senator Carl Levin will be casting his 10,000th \nvote. We are so proud of him in Michigan. He stands for all that we \nbelieve in and serves with dignity and is respected by everyone here. I \nwant to mention he is the 25th Senator in the history of our Senate to \ncast 10,000 votes.\n  I went back to research his very first vote. I thought this was an \nexample of a historic moment. He cast his first vote on February 22, \n1979. It was in favor of a Byrd motion to table a Stevens amendment to \nS. Res. 61 which was a postcloture rules change resolution. It was very \nprofound, and he has been profound ever since.\n  Congratulations to Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I join the minority leader in \ncongratulating our colleague, Senator Levin, on his 10,000th vote. His \n28-year tenure has been marked by vote after vote. It represents his \nintegrity, his character, his leadership. He cast his vote in some of \nthe most significant consequential debates of this country.\n  Senator Levin has been that tireless advocate for our military, our \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\nfamilies. His work with Chairman Warner on our annual defense \nauthorization bill provides that critical support for our troops in the \nform of both equipment and readiness. In 2004, the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States presented him with the Harry S. Truman \nAward for distinguished service in support of national defense. The \nawards go on and on and on. This is only one of the many awards he has \nreceived for his unflagging support of our military. I commend and \nthank Senator Levin for his tremendous contributions to this country \nand for his long and distinguished service to the people of Michigan.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3994\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is 2:15. We are reconvening. We are \nabout ready to proceed with the bill. We have quite a number of \nSenators who have stated an interest in filing amendments. We urge them \nto come to the floor so we can get a queue and proceed to consider the \namendments and dispose of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is the Senator asking an inquiry at this \npoint? I did not hear the inquiry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are ready for your amendment, Senator Dorgan, if you \nare prepared to offer it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be laying the amendment down in just about a \nminute. I am reviewing one piece of it. I will be laying the amendment \ndown in about a minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. While you are undertaking those last-minute \npreparations, would you give some consideration to a time agreement, an \nhour equally divided?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will do that, but I will not do it at \nthe moment. I want to perfect the amendment and begin discussions, see \nhow many on my side and perhaps your side wish to speak on it before we \nwould make an agreement with respect to the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4017\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes \n     amendment numbered 4017.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit aliens who are currently outside the United \n    States from participating in the H-2C guestworker visa program)\n\n         On page 250, between lines 13 and 14, insert the \n     following:\n         ``(1) Eligibility for deferred mandatory departure \n     status.--The alien shall establish that the alien is eligible \n     for Deferred Mandatory Departure status under section 245C.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment. I will \ndescribe very briefly what it does. It essentially strikes the guest \nworker provision, as it is now known. Guest worker is described in \nother ways--future flow, guest worker. It strikes that provision, but \nit does it in a way that would not interrupt the underlying bill's \ndecision to have those who are here for 2 to 5 years to step outside \nthis country and step back in. It would not affect those folks, but it \nwould prevent the guest worker provision from being operative in a way \nthat would allow those who are now living outside of our country, who \nare not in this country, living outside of the country, to come in in \nfuture years under this guest worker provision.\n  The guest worker, future flow--all these titles that are used by the \nPresident and by people in the Senate, it is kind of like Mr. Roger's \nNeighborhood. These are wonderful-sounding terms--future flow. I didn't \nknow what that was until I learned or heard some of the descriptions of \nfuture flow. What that means is we are going to provide a circumstance \nwhere we try to get control of immigration but at the same time allow \nothers who are now outside of our country to come into our country \nunder a guest worker provision.\n  Let me describe the circumstances, especially on the southern border, \nfor the moment. Last year, we believe there were 1.1 to 1.2 million \npeople who tried to come into this country but were apprehended and \nstopped and prevented from coming in illegally. We also believe that in \naddition to the 1.1 million or so who were stopped and not allowed to \ncome into this country illegally, there were another probably three-\nquarters of a million people who came illegally across the southern \nborder.\n  In addition to that, about 175,000 people came in legally across the \nsouthern border--those who had children here under the quotas or other \ncircumstances and came into our country legally. So 1.1 million were \napprehended and stopped, about three-quarters of a million came \nillegally, and about another 175,000 came legally into this country.\n  We are at a time where, if you read the paper every single day, what \nyou see is the new corporate economic strategy. In fact, Tom Friedman \nwrote a book, ``The World Is Flat.'' Of course, the world isn't flat. \nThat sells a lot of books, but the world isn't flat. The proposition of \n``The World Is Flat'' is that there are now 1 billion to 1.5 billion \npeople around the rest of the world\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\nwilling to work for a very small amount of money, so those who want to \nproduce products can move those jobs now to China, India, Bangladesh, \nSri Lanka, and produce for a very small amount of income. So they pay \npennies: 20 cents an hour, 30 cents an hour, 40 cents an hour to \nproduce the product. They ship the product into the United States to \nsell. Then they run the income through the Cayman Islands so they don't \nhave to pay taxes.\n  Even while this strategy of shipping good American jobs overseas is \nunderway by some of the largest corporate interests, those interests \nalso want not only to ship those jobs overseas, they want to import \ncheap labor at home. That is the strategy: export good American jobs \nand import cheap labor. That is probably a good strategy for profits, I \nam guessing, but it is an awful strategy for this country. That is not \nthe way we built this country. The broad middle class that burgeoned in \nthis country in the last century happened because of the good jobs that \npaid good wages and had health care benefits and retirement and so on. \nThat is what helped create a middle class in this country. And the \npresence of that middle class in this country, the middle-income \nworkers in this country, has made this country something very unusual \non the face of the Earth.\n  Now we see a new strategy. The world is flat, we are told. That flat \nworld means you can get rid of American jobs, move them to China. I \nhave told the stories forever, so I will not again, but Fruit of the \nLoom underwear, you know, the underwear with the dancing grapes telling \nus how wonderful Fruit of the Loom is, they are gone; Levis, they are \ngone; Huffy bicycles, gone; the Little Red Wagon is gone; Fig Newton \ncookies is now Mexican. I could tell stories forever about exporting \nAmerican jobs, but the corollary to that is that is not enough. \nExporting good American jobs is not enough. Now it is importing cheap \nlabor.\n  Alan Blinder--no radical economist, former Vice Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board--Alan Blinder just wrote a piece. He said there \nare somewhere between 42 million and 54 million American jobs that have \nthe potential to be outsourced. He said not all of them will be moved \nabroad in search of cheap wages. But, he said, even those that stay \nhere are going to have to compete with cheaper wages, with lower wages \nabroad. So that is the future. That is the strategy. That is the new \ncorporate approach--aided and abetted, I might say, by the Congress \nwith these trade deals.\n  In addition to that which is threatening American workers, we have \nthe back side coming in: illegal workers. Yes, they are illegal. When \nthey come into this country, they are illegal if they don't come \nthrough a legal process. They come in and compete with subpar wages \nwith American workers.\n  Let me just ask the question for a moment: What would happen in this \ncountry if tomorrow we had no immigration laws at all? If we said: \nLook, we are the United States of America. We are a great country. We \nsay to the rest of the world: Welcome. Come here, stay here, live here, \nwork here. Just come on, come to America. You are welcome. There are no \nlonger any immigration laws at all.\n  What would be the result of that in a world in which one-half of the \npopulation lives on less than $2 a day, in a world in which one-half of \nthe population hasn't even made a telephone call? What would be the \nresult of our saying we no longer have any immigration laws; we invite \nthe rest of the world to come to this country?\n  It is interesting. There have been polls done in other countries: How \nmany of you would like to immigrate to the United States? It is massive \nnumbers of people. We would be awash in people. So it is not selfish \nfor our country to be somewhat protective of our standard of living, \nsomewhat protective of our jobs and our interest in retaining a middle \nclass that lives well, that has a job in order to work at a decent \nwage, has health care, has retirement. It is not selfish for us to do \nthat.\n  There are many voices speaking for immigrants. I don't want in any \nway to diminish the dignity or the worth of immigrants. I come from \nimmigrants. I assume most of the people serving in this Chamber come \nfrom immigrant parents, grandparents or great-grandparents.\n  I don't want in any way for this debate to inflame or in any way \ndiminish the worth or dignity of immigrants. I don't want us to inflame \npassions against those who have tried to escape poverty in their own \ncountries to come to the United States to escape misery and poverty. \nBut we in America have a responsibility as well to our citizens, and \nthere is precious little talk about them in this Chamber these days. We \nhave built the strongest economy in the world. Now we talk about \nimmigration. I don't think that we can talk about immigration without \ntalking about American jobs, about salaries, workers' benefits, and \nopportunities for those who are here legally. Yes, I am talking about \nall the American workers. That includes Hispanic workers, African-\nAmerican, Asian, Caucasian, all American workers.\n  I will show some charts in a few moments to discuss what is happening \nto them.\n  We have gotten a lot of people speaking up for those who are \nimmigrants, many who have come here illegally.\n  Let me speak for a moment on behalf of American workers, and let me \ntalk for a little bit about what has happened to the American workers.\n  We are told by the President and by others, including debate in this \nChamber, that Americans don't want these jobs, so we need the illegal \nimmigration to occur. And now we would make it legal, and now we would \nhave additional guest workers to occur because Americans will not take \nthese jobs.\n  Seven percent of the transportation workers are illegal, but 93 \npercent are legal.\n  Americans will not take those jobs?\n  Ninety-one percent of the jobs in manufacturing are U.S. citizens, \nlegal workers, and 9 percent are illegal workers.\n  Construction: 86 percent of the people who work construction in this \ncountry are American workers, legal workers, American citizens here \nlegally. And we are told that Americans will not take these \nconstruction jobs? I don't think so. Of course, they will.\n  The evidence is pretty substantial. The question is: What has been \nthe impact on American workers of illegal immigration?\n  We talk about this, as I said, as if it is kind of ``Mister Rogers' \nNeighborhood''--it is all feel-good, easy sound bites, soft words, \nfuture flow, guest workers.\n  Let me talk about a study by Professor Borjas of the John F. Kennedy \nSchool of Government at Harvard University in 2004. He said the impact \nof immigration from 1980 to 2000--and principally we are talking about \nlegal immigration, the impact by ethnicity of U.S. workers--has cost \nthe average American worker $1,700 in lost wages per year.\n  Whom does it hurt the most? It hurts the Hispanic workers in this \ncountry, those who are here legally. It hurts the African-American \nworkers. It hurts Asian workers. It hurts all American workers.\n  This is not a painless or pain-free exercise to have millions and \nmillions of people come through the back door into this country \nillegally to assume jobs. It is not painless. The American people are \npaying the cost of that. The American workers are experiencing the \nproblems as a result of it. The problems are lower wages.\n  Let me describe what has happened to income in this country. As we \ncan see the changes in after-tax earnings by income bracket, the top 1 \npercent are doing well. It is the case of the top fifth. The people at \nbottom are hurting, with very little income increase at all.\n  What is happening is we have now the development of the ``haves'' and \nthe ``have nots.'' At least a portion of that, in my judgment, a \nsignificant portion of that imbalance comes as a result of public \npolicy in this Chamber from people who believe that as the economy \nworks when we put something in at the top--and it is called classic \ntrickle-down economics--put something in at the top, it filters down, \ntrickles down, and pretty soon everybody gets a little damp. It is not \ntrue. It doesn't work.\n  I would like to show some additional charts about what we are dealing \nwith.\n  When we talk about guest workers and future flows, let me describe it \nspecifically with respect to the bill that is\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\non the floor. The bill on the floor says we have 11 million to 12 \nmillion people who have come here illegally. We are not sure how many, \nwe need to find a status for them. And it develops three different \ncategories for them. But it also says, in addition to all of that, \nthere are other people living outside of our country whom we want to \ninvite in, in the future, 325,000 a year, and over 6 years with a 20-\npercent escalator each year that is in this bill you are talking about \nthe potential of 3.8 million additional people.\n  This piece of legislation says: By the way, let us invite another 10 \nmillion people here in 10 years.\n  That is the way it grows, with 325,000 and the 20-percent escalator.\n  Is that what we should be doing in our country? Is that the strategy \nthat makes sense?\n  This country is unusual on this planet. We live here with about 6.3 \nbillion neighbors. We circle the Sun, and in this spot on the globe \nthere is illumination of having developed something extraordinary in \nthe world. I have described the time when I was on a helicopter that \nran out of fuel in the mountains and jungle area between Honduras and \nNicaragua. We landed under power, but the red lights were on and the \nbells were ringing and we were not going to fly anymore. We were stuck \nthere for some many hours until we were found. The campesinos from the \nmountains came to see who had landed. We had an interpreter with us. I \nwas asking them, through this interpreter, a little bit about their \nlives, what they would aspire for their lives. A young woman was there \nwith three or four children. I said: What is it you aspire for your \nlife?\n  I want to come to America. I want to move to the United States.\n  I asked: Why?\n  Because that is the area of opportunity. The United States is an area \nof opportunity. It is jobs. It is for me and my children to have jobs \nin the future.\n  We find that virtually in every part of the world. So as a result of \nthat, we have had to have immigration laws. Twenty years ago, we had \nthis same problem; that is, illegal immigration overrunning this \ncountry.\n  It has a direct impact, as I have shown, on American workers, \nsomething not much discussed in this Chamber today. But it has a direct \nand a detrimental impact on American workers. That includes Hispanic \nworkers who are here legally and have been here a long time. It \ndiminishes their wages. But 20 years ago we had this debate.\n\n  The debate when I was serving in the House at the time was: How do \nyou deal with immigration? The answer was simple. Senator Simpson was \non the floor of the Senate, Congressman Mazzoli was in the House, and a \npiece of legislation passed and was signed into law called the Simpson-\nMazzoli bill. There was great celebration because this was going to \nsolve the immigration problem.\n  How would it solve the immigration problem and employer sanctions? \nThe proposition was that the lure for people to come to this country is \nto find a job. If you shut off the jobs and you say to the employers: \nDon't you dare hire illegal workers, don't you dare bring people \nthrough the back door and pay them subpar wages because they are \nillegal. If you do that, you are going to be hit with sanctions. This \nGovernment is going to penalize you.\n  Guess what. Last year, I am told there was one enforcement action in \nall of the United States against a company that was hiring illegal \nworkers. The year before, there were three actions in all of the United \nStates against employers who hired illegal workers.\n  This Government did nothing to deal with it, nothing.\n  The other day in North Dakota--they are building an energy plant--I \nbelieve it was the highway patrol who picked up seven people, illegal \nworkers. I think six were from Guatemala and one from Mexico. They \ndrove them about an hour north to Minot, ND, to the immigration office. \nThey processed them through the immigration office. They then drove \nthem back to the motel near, I believe, Washburn, ND, dropped them off \nand said: You are now required to come to Minneapolis within the next \nmonth--they gave them a specific date--to a hearing on your case. Of \ncourse, they will never be in Minneapolis. We will never see them \nagain. They will never show up again.\n  It is the process. As some call it, catch and release. You catch \nthem, you let them go, and say: Show up later. Oh, by the way, next \ntime they show up, they will probably be on another job site because \nthis Government does nothing to enforce the law. Now we are told this \nis a three-legged stool, as if this is a furniture store. All morning I \nhear three-legged stool. I do not know where the stool came from. I \ndon't know about the three legs. All I know is that you must, it seems \nto me--if you are going to be dealing with immigration issues--find a \nway to effectively reduce illegal immigration. You have to do that. You \ndon't do that by turning a blind eye to the issue of employer \nsanctions.\n  Say you are an employer and want to bring in a string of illegal \nagricultural workers and pay them subpar wages, you are going to get in \ntrouble. If you do that, you are not going to solve this problem.\n  In the President's address last night to the country, I didn't hear a \nword about that. He is going to deploy the National Guard, an \noverstretched National Guard. They have been on multiple deployments, \nin some cases, to Iraq, but no discussion about shutting off the jobs \nthat represent the lure for illegal workers to come into this country--\nnot a word.\n  It is true that the first step to deal with the immigration issue is \nto enforce the prohibition on hiring illegal workers.\n  This issue we are discussing is a big, broad issue. It has legal \nimmigrants coming in who are not citizens but entitled to work under \nthe H-2A program and the H-2B program. We have workers who come in on a \ntemporary basis dealing in agriculture. We already have processes by \nwhich people come into this country legally to work. What is being \ndiscussed is on top of all of that.\n  You have a bill that comes to the floor of the Senate that says: All \nright. Let us take the 11 million or 12 million--whatever it is--who \nare here illegally and separate them into three groups. One is the \ngroup that has been here less than 2 years. They have to go back. The \nsecond is the group that has been here 2 to 5 years. They have to go \nback, and then they can come right back in.\n  Third is the group that has been here longer than 5 years, and they \nhave the capability of earned citizenship, as will the 2 to 5 million \npeople under certain circumstances.\n  So that is what is in front of us.\n  On top of that, as if they put a big old discolored patch on an inner \ntube, this legislation--and by the way, in addition to dealing with \nthat and trying to get tough on employer sanctions, something I have \nheard before as all of my colleagues have as well, and responding to \nthose needs--in addition to all of that, we have decided there are not \nenough people coming into our country, so we want to allow more, up to \n3.8 million more in the coming 6 years. These are people who do not now \nlive here whom we want to come in to take American jobs. We are told \nthe reason for that is there will be people attempting to get across \nthe border anyway.\n  Let us at least recognize they are going to be what are called future \nflows.\n  That seems to be giving up on the issue of whether you have good \nborder enforcement. You either have decent enforcement on the border or \nyou don't. If you have good enforcement, why on Earth would you decide \nthat in addition to allowing 11 million or 12 million people who are \nhere illegally to deal with their status internally in this country and \ndecide in addition to that we have decided that, yes, we have quotas \nfor our country. We have immigration opportunities in H-2A and H-2B and \nmany other areas. But on top of that, we have decided we want up to 3.8 \nmillion more to come through our doors. Why is that provision in this \nbill?\n  I am told it is in this bill because that is the price the Chamber of \nCommerce extracted for supporting this bill. No one has disabused my \nplea of that. I am told that is the basis on which the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce would support this piece of legislation. Why would they want \nup to another 3.8 million in 6 years, or far more in 10 years? Why \nwould they want additional guest workers or future flows to come in \nlegally on top of what is already allowed in this legislation? The \nanswer is\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nsimple. It goes back to the first chart I showed. It is the economic \nstrategy and the new national world, exporting good jobs and importing \ncheap labor. The guest worker provisions and the future flow provisions \nare about importing cheap labor.\n  Yesterday I mentioned a man named Jim Fyler. Jim Fyler died because \nhe was shot 54 times. He was shot 54 times because Jim Fyler believed \nstrongly that people should have the right to collectively bargain and \nto organize. Jim Fyler cared deeply about coal miners and the \nconditions under which coal miners were working: underground, long \nhours, child labor, bad wages, no benefits. Jim Fyler was one of those \nfolks who, on behalf of collective bargaining, on behalf of forming a \nunion of coal miners, was shot 54 times.\n  We have gone through all of that in a century--people losing their \nlives fighting, battling for the right to organize, people battling for \nthe right to work in a safe workplace. We have had the political fights \nfor minimum wages, the fight to prevent polluting the air and water by \ncompanies producing products and dumping their chemicals into the water \nand the air. We have been through all of these fights.\n  Now the American worker is told: By the way, those fights are over. \nIn fact, you won them for a while, but now you have lost because anyone \nwho wants to produce can pole-vault over that and move their production \nto China and hire someone for 33 cents an hour, work them 7 days a \nweek, 12 to 14 hours a day, and if American workers do not like it, \ntough luck: The reason we did it is because you cannot compete.\n  By the way, for those who still have your jobs and they are not \noutsourced, look behind you. In the back door, we are bringing in low \nwage workers. Those low wage workers will work for substantially less \nmoney than you are willing to work.\n  This is about low wage replacement workers, as I call them. It is not \nguest workers. It is not future flow. It is low wage replacement \nworkers, 3.8 million in the coming 6 years in this bill.\n  My amendment does two things. One, it gets rid of this future flow \nguest worker. That does not mean we won't have immigration. We will. We \nhave many other provisions in the law allowing for legal immigration, \ntemporary workers, agricultural workers. That already exists. I \neliminate the provision that is above that.\n  My amendment also accommodates the underlying bill, if, in fact, it \npasses, and will not interrupt that with respect to the 2- to 5-year \npeople who must step out of the country before they come back into the \ncountry and then seek legal status. I have written this amendment so I \ndon't interrupt that, either. Someone mentioned earlier that they \nthought this would affect that. It does not. This simply affects the \npiece of legislation that will allow those who never lived in this \ncountry, who now live outside of our country, and who, in this piece of \nlegislation, will be told, in addition to all the legal ways you can \ncome to this country, we are going to have a future flow, a guest \nworker provision that allows you to take American jobs. Why? Because I \nguess American workers are not available for those jobs or maybe it is \nbecause this same body has not increased the minimum wage for nearly 9 \nyears. For 9 years, this body has not seen fit to increase the minimum \nwage. Maybe there are jobs they have trouble getting the American \nworkers to take. Maybe it is because they have not increased the \nminimum wage at the bottom of the economic ladder, the bottom rung. The \nsolution to that? Well, we will not increase wages for American \nworkers. Let's not shore up benefits for American workers. Let's \ninstead decide we will bring in additional guest workers from outside \nof our country.\n  I will show a chart that describes what these folks are earning. In \nRussia, it is 51 cents an hour in wages; 37 cents an hour in Nicaragua; \n33 cents an hour in China; 33 cents an hour in Bangladesh; 30 cents an \nhour in Haiti; and 11 cents an hour in India. This is what we want \nAmerican workers to compete with?\n  It is one thing to see American jobs moved to those overseas wages. I \nhave spoken at great length and I have almost resisted the attempt to \nspeak at greater length about these companies which have decided to \navail themselves of 20-cents-an-hour labor so they can ship their \nproduct to the store shelves in Pittsburgh, Fargo, Los Angeles, and \nChicago. I have almost resisted that, but I am thinking maybe I \nshouldn't. Maybe I should discuss at some length the circumstances of \nmoving those jobs overseas. Then, by the way, for those whose jobs have \nnot moved, we have a surprise for you in the back end.\n  We now have, additionally, guest workers coming in who will work at \nthe bottom of the economic ladder and, as the professor from Harvard \nhas said, put downward pressure on wages in this country.\n  All I am asking the Senate is this: Maybe we could have some \ndiscussion, even as we talk about immigration, about the impact and the \neffect of this subject on American workers, on workers who are here \nlegally. Yes, those are Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, \nCaucasians, everyone. Many are struggling. They lose their job and get \nanother job at lower pay. The burgeoning middle class is slimming down \nbecause the world is flat. We are, too.\n  That is total rubbish, of course. The so-called flat world is a rose-\ncolored evaluation of how corporations can simply make more money by \nhaving American jobs leave our shores and then sell their products back \ninto our country. I am saying that in the long term, I don't think that \nworks. I don't think that supports or creates the foundation for the \nsustaining of a strong, robust economy in this country that grows for \neveryone.\n  We have dangerous inequalities in this country of ours with respect \nto income. I have shown a couple of charts about that. We need to have \nsome discussion about the impact on American workers with respect to \nthese policies. That is why I have offered this amendment.\n  I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from North \nDakota whether he is prepared now to enter into a time agreement. There \nhave been no Senators on this side of the aisle who have expressed an \ninterest in debating the issue. My reply will be relatively brief. My \nsuggestion would be that we ought to seek to close off debate--it is \nnow 8 minutes to 3 o'clock--close off debate by 3:15 and move on to \nanother amendment.\n  I alert colleagues on this side: we are in a position to move forward \nwith the Kyl-Cornyn amendment, which is next on the list. I do not know \nwhat amendments will be offered by the Democrats, but I have made an \ninquiry, and they are making an effort to identify the Senators who \nwill offer amendments and bring them to the Senate. If the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment can be worked out, which is a distinct prospect, we would \nthen move to the Sessions amendment. I have alerted Senator Sessions. \nIf he can come to the Senate in the next few minutes, that will be \nhelpful. Then we have Senator Vitter's two amendments. Senator Vitter \ntalked to me shortly before noontime. If he can come to the Senate and \nbe available, we are in a position to move ahead.\n  I inquire of the Senator from North Dakota whether he is in a \nposition to agree to conclude debate, say, in 20 more minutes, equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am not in a position to do that. Forty minutes a side \nis satisfactory. I have a number of Members who have asked for time to \nspeak on amendments. We are trying to reach them.\n  I understand the Senator from Pennsylvania has an interest in \nefficiency and moving forward, but there are a good many jobs that \ndepend on getting these things right. This is an important amendment. I \nam happy to agree to 40 minutes a side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the position of the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  I ask unanimous consent that 80 minutes be divided equally between \nthe Senator from North Dakota and myself as manager of the bill and \nthat the debate be concluded in 80 minutes, unless time is yielded \nback.\n  I now have the handiwork of the expert staff. In their form, I ask \nunanimous consent that there be 80 minutes for debate in relation to \nthe Dorgan\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\namendment, provided that no second degrees be in order prior to the \nvote, and after the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to \na vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  By way of reply, I can understand the concerns of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota about the loss of American jobs. I compliment him for \nspeaking about this subject with some frequency with some effect in the \nSenate.\n  I agree totally with the Senator from North Dakota that we ought not \nto export American jobs. I also agree with the Senator from North \nDakota that we ought to retain American jobs in America to the maximum \nextent that we are able to do so.\n  The Judiciary Committee had a hearing and had four witnesses testify. \nWithout going into their testimony in great detail--it is all a matter \nof record--the net conclusions were that there would not be a \nsignificant impact in the loss of American jobs.\n  It is frequently said that the immigrants handle jobs that Americans \ndo not want. As a generalization, that is true, but not universally \ntrue.\n  We have had considerable suggestions and contentions by Senators from \nagricultural States about the indispensable nature of immigrant \nworkers. Anecdotally, I have many from my home State come to me and \ntell me about the need for agricultural workers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would on his time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say quickly, and I appreciate the \nSenator's courtesy for yielding, my amendment does nothing with respect \nto agricultural workers. We still have the provisions in underlying law \nallowing for temporary workers to come in and support the agricultural \nneeds of this country.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not unaware of that, but it goes to the overall \npoint of the experts who testify as to whether we would be taking away \njobs American workers would want. The experts further testify that \nalthough there was some impact on the wages, there would not be a \nsignificant loss in wages.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota talks about the costs of bringing \nin 10 million people, that simply is not what title IV does. The title \nhe wishes to eliminate as to any immigrants coming into the country in \nthe future is only open to those now in the country. Title IV provides \nthat there be an annual cap of 325,000, with each guest worker employed \nfor up to 3 years, renewable for an additional 3 years. Then the \napproach is that those individuals will return to their home country \nunless they can otherwise qualify to stay here.\n  The guest workers will enjoy travel privileges in and out of the \nUnited States and portability between jobs. We allow workers to obtain \ngreen cards by self-petitioning, if they qualify, and allow students \nwith advanced degrees in science and math to stay in the United States. \nTitle IV exempts workers with advanced degrees in science and math from \ngreen card caps, and it increases the annual allotment of H-1B \nprofessional worker visas from 65,000 to 115,000, with a fluctuating \ncap.\n  Title IV is important as part of a balanced program. If we do not \nprovide for guest workers who can fill the needs of the American \neconomy, then we are going to create a vacuum and a situation where \nillegal immigrants will come in to fill those needs. But if we \ncalibrate the number of guest workers which can be accommodated by our \neconomy, which are needed by our economy, then we will discourage \nillegal immigrants from coming in and taking jobs, finding jobs, which \nwould otherwise be filled by the guest workers who come to this country \nlegally.\n  This title has been crafted very carefully by the Judiciary \nCommittee. There is substantial support for it, as I understand it, on \nthe other side of the aisle, even as there is some opposition on this \nside of the aisle. But if there are other Senators who wish to come and \ndebate on this side of the aisle, I invite colleagues to debate and \nmove ahead, and perhaps yield back time if that time is not to be used.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, for being such a leader on this particular part of the \nbill which I have found extremely troubling from day one.\n  I note that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said we better \nnot take the guest worker program out because, oh, my goodness, if we \ndo take it out, there will be more illegal immigration. Well, maybe I \nam wrong on this--I do not think I am--but isn't a basic part of this \nbill to strengthen the border, the protections at the border? And isn't \nthat part of what we are trying to do so we can stop the flow of \nillegal immigration--and having done that, allow the 11 to 12 million \nwho are already here, who have clean records, who are willing to step \nforward, who are willing pay a fine, the chance at earned legalization?\n  And then there is another piece that deals with specific sectors of \nour economy, such as agriculture, where we know there are problems with \nthe workforce. With respect to the agriculture industry, we set up a \nprogram called AgJOBS, which I credit Senator Feinstein for putting it \nin the bill. Senators Craig and Kennedy, in a bipartisan effort, have \nsupported this for many years, along with myself and others.\n  So we had, I thought, a very well balanced bill until we added a \nguest worker program. In other words, the bill strengthened the border \nin one section, created a pathway for the undocumented immigrants \ncurrently in the country, and then--addressed one area, agriculture, \nwhere we know we need these workers and set up a very carefully \ntailored program. The bill also made adjustments for highly skilled \nworkers such as engineers, and fixed some of the visa programs.\n  So I thought that was a fairly balanced bill. Then what happened is, \nanother piece was added, which is this really open-ended guest worker \nprogram which, in my opinion, will result in a permanent underclass of \nworkers coming into our country.\n  What disturbs me is what the provision does to the American \nworkforce. You hear: Oh, these are people who will do work that \nAmericans won't do. Now, I would say that is a good argument when it \ncomes to agriculture. But we have taken care of agriculture in the \nbill. We have the AgJOBS provision. And we have taken care of the 11 to \n12 million undocumented workers currently in the U.S. and given them a \npath for continued employment.\n  So now, on top of it, we are looking at a program for 325,000 guest \nworkers, each and every year, with an escalator of up to 20 percent \nadded on to that. And what do you create now? A huge underclass of \nworkers who will take jobs away from Americans.\n  Now, the American people are compassionate. They are understanding. I \nthink most of them want us to do a comprehensive bill. Most of them do \nnot like what is in the House bill, where if you lean over to help \nsomeone who may be having a heart attack on the ground in front of you \nand that person is undocumented, according to the House, you could go \nto jail. The American people do not like that.\n  But the American people also know we have not raised the minimum wage \nin almost 10 long years--which, by the way, I think we ought to darn \nwell do on this bill--and that if you create another, virtually open-\nended guest worker program, you are going to hurt the American people \nat the end of the day.\n  So you hear the colleagues on the other side saying: Oh, No. 1, if \nyou don't have this additional guest worker program, then people will \nsneak across the border. No. We are strengthening the border. That is \none of the underlying principles of the bill. So that is not accurate.\n  Now they say: Oh, if you don't do this, we will have jobs that are \nnot filled. Now, what kind of jobs would guest workers do? Remember, we \nhave already taken care of agriculture, so these guest workers are not \nfor agricultural jobs. There are also separate provisions for the most \nhighly educated immigrants, the various visa programs. So what would \nthe guest workers do?\n  Here are some examples: construction, food preparation, \nmanufacturing, and transportation jobs. Now, these are\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\nfields where the vast majority of jobs are held by U.S. citizens and by \nlegal workers. So it is incorrect to claim that the guest worker \nprogram, which has been kind of added on to what I think is a good \nbill, is targeted at jobs Americans will not do. These jobs are good \njobs in good industries.\n  Now, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2004, there were \n6.3 million workers employed in the U.S. construction sector, at an \naverage wage of $18.21 an hour or $37,890 a year. Now, when I meet with \nmy working people in California, they are fighting hard for these jobs. \nThey want more of these jobs, not fewer of these jobs. The last thing \nthey want is a guest worker program that is going to provide a big pool \nof workers who may make far less than this amount and take jobs away \nfrom my people.\n  I support the underlying bill except for this provision. I think this \nguest worker provision throws the whole thing out of whack.\n  For the bottom quarter of Americans, who are making an average wage \nof about $7 an hour, construction work is a dream job. They pray for \nthose jobs. They stand in line hours for those jobs. But what are we \ndoing if the Dorgan amendment does not succeed? We are going to take \nthose jobs away because an employer is going to say: Gee, should I hire \nan $18-an-hour American worker or, let's see, a foreign worker in a \nguest worker program who I could pay less? You know what is going to \nhappen.\n  Now, I think the real reason for a guest worker program is not what \nwe hear about, oh, well, otherwise there will be more people sneaking \nacross the border, or we are short all these workers and we don't have \nworkers for construction jobs, transportation jobs, food preparation \njobs, manufacturing jobs, and the like; but it is really to set up, in \nmy view, a permanent number of workers who are prepared to work at very \ncheap wages. That would be bad for the American workforce.\n\n  If we take this guest worker program out of this bill, we will have, \nmy colleagues, a far better bill, a bill that we can all feel good \nabout, a bill that does, in fact, reach out and say to undocumented \nworkers who have worked here 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 3 years--and \nthey have clean records and they have paid their taxes and they are \nwilling to come forward and pay their fines, and the rest--we will have \na good bill for them, we will have a good bill that strengthens the \nborder, which I strongly support and have supported for years, we will \nhave a balanced bill, that includes the AgJOBS piece. But if we do not \ntake this out, we have a bill that I believe is going to hurt many \nAmerican workers.\n  So I think the real reason this was put in was to have cheap labor, a \ncheap labor workforce.\n  Now, the median wage in Mexico is $1.83 an hour. The typical hourly \nwage in China is 33 cents. So I ask my colleagues, what does a minimum \nwage--even if it is not raised, and shame on us that it has not been \nraised in 9 long years, going on 10 years--what does a $5-an-hour wage \nlook like? Heaven to those people. And we are going to sanction this \nfairly open-ended program that escalates up to 20 percent a year for \nwhat reason other than to provide a permanent cheap labor force? It is \nvery worrisome to me.\n  There are some businesses that are wonderful, exemplary. There are \nothers that would rather not look at their business as a family but \njust want to get the cheapest labor they can possibly get. So I cannot \nsupport the undermining of U.S. working conditions, and I cannot \nsupport a guest worker program that will decrease wages for low-income \nAmericans.\n  For goodness' sake, I have stood on this floor 1 year--2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \n7, 8, 9--going on 10 years, fighting to increase the minimum wage. How \ncould I possibly vote to keep in this bill a guest worker program when \nwe have such an opportunity to strengthen this bill by stripping this \nout. It would leave us with a bill with tighter enforcement at the \nborder, a humane, legal path for people who are living in the shadows--\nit will make us safer to get them out of the shadows, that is for \nsure--an AgJOBS program that is tailored to agriculture in a way that \nmakes sense, and all those visa programs that address high skilled \njobs? All that makes sense.\n  I commend the committee for giving us a chance craft such a bill. I \nwould be proud to have as my legacy such a bill. But if we can remove \nthis, what I call this guest worker add-on, if we can remove this, I \nthink we will have a far stronger bill.\n  I commend my friend, Senator Dorgan. He is--I wanted to say he is \ndogged, and he is. He is dogged on behalf of working people. And I \nthink he got this just right. I am very glad he has offered us this \nchance to improve this bill by pulling out the guest worker program.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like a brief few minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 35 minutes. \nThe Senator from North Dakota has 27\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just ask for 5 minutes in \nsupport of Senator Dorgan's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask the Senator, are you for or against the amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am for it. I know Senator Dorgan's time is limited. I \nwould ask for maybe 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will try to wrap up briefly.\n  Mr. President, I believe this section of the bill as drafted is \nflawed. It goes further than the drafters and the American people or \nthe President would want it to go. I am not sure how we can fix it at \nthis point. I think the way to concentrate everybody's mind and get it \nfixed would be for the Dorgan amendment to pass.\n  Let's start over and talk about how we are going to handle this. My \nstaff has looked at these numbers and tried to be as objective as they \npossibly can to see just what this would allow to occur in America if \nit were to pass, and I am confident that it includes more than people \nwould think.\n  First of all, it is absolutely not true that this is a temporary \nworker program. It is called guest worker, which sounds like \n``temporary worker,'' but it is not. A person will come into our \ncountry under this program--325,000 the first year. Their employer can \napply, the day they get here, the first year, for a green card. A green \ncard gives them permanent residence in the United States, unless they \nget convicted of a felony or something. They get permanent residence. \nWithin 5 years, they can apply for citizenship. So there is nothing \ntemporary about this so-called guest worker program.\n  The President mentioned this morning a couple times, I understand--I \nheard it a bit, one clip on TV--that he favored a temporary worker \nprogram. This is not a temporary worker program.\n\n  Second, the numbers are extraordinary. Some of you who have been \nlistening to me today are pretty good mathematicians. It is 325,000 the \nfirst year. But if that number is reached, automatically it kicks up 20 \npercent. The next year, if that number is reached, it is 20 percent; \nthe next year, 20 percent; the next year, 20 percent. Those are pretty \nbig numbers. In fact, if it were to stay at that 60 percent level, the \nnumbers would be extraordinary. If you took the congressional resource \nnumber, that when a person comes in under this provision as a guest \nworker and they get a green card and are able to bring in their family, \nthey have calculated 1.2 family members they would bring in for each \nguest worker. And if you add up those numbers of what we can reasonably \nexpect over a 20-year period, it would be 133 million people. I don't \nthink we will be at 20 percent every year. There are some factors that \nwould show that is not the case. But that is what the bill authorizes, \n20 percent automatically, if the caps are reached each year. If it went \nup at about 10 percent a year, you would still have a very significant \nincrease in just this one program.\n  When you talk about 100 million people, you are talking about one-\nthird of the current population of the United States being admitted \nunder a low-skill worker program, called a guest worker program, that \ndoes not require high-skill abilities.\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\n  We need to completely redo it. I believe that; I really do. I urge my \ncolleagues to think seriously about this, what we are voting for. I \nknow the motive and I know the desire to do the right thing. We are a \nnation of immigrants. We are going to allow immigration in the future \nto continue. When we do, we will increase legal immigration into this \ncountry, and I will support that. But the rate of increase provided for \nin this provision is unjustifiable and, therefore, I support the Dorgan \namendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the Senator from \nPennsylvania for his continued leadership and incredible effort on this \nissue. He has invested thousands of hours, and I continue to appreciate \nthe great job he is doing.\n  I also congratulate the President of the United States for his \nremarks last night. It is pretty obvious that his remarks were well \nreceived. He gave an outstanding depiction not only of the situation in \nthe United States but the need for us to act. As he said near the end \nof his remarks:\n\n       Tonight I want to speak directly to Members of the House \n     and Senate. An immigration reform bill needs to be \n     comprehensive because all elements of this problem must be \n     addressed together or none of them will be solved at all.\n\n  The President's comments are exactly right:\n\n       All elements of this problem must be addressed together or \n     none of them will be solved at all.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The House has passed an immigration bill. The Senate should \n     act by the end of the month so we can work out the \n     differences. . . .\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota, my friend, keeps talking about how the \n1986 amnesty didn't work. It obviously didn't work. The reason it \ndidn't work is because there wasn't a guest worker program, which is \nexactly what the Senator from North Dakota is trying to remove from the \nbill which then would give us 1986 all over again. More importantly, \nthere are certain realities in America today that we are trying to \naddress. Among them, that the American population is growing older. The \nbaby boomers are retiring and leaving in their wake a number of jobs \nthat need to be filled. Restaurants are locking their doors because \nthere is no one to serve the food or clear dishes. Today, fruit is \nrotting on the vine and lettuce is dying in the fields because farmers \ncan't find workers to harvest the crops.\n  Why do we need a viable guest worker program? So that we can stop the \nflood of illegals from coming across our borders, so we can make the \npresent incentive that brings people to cross our borders illegally \ncome to a halt. How do we do that? Our proposal says if an employer \nadvertises a job for 60 days over the Internet, in a broad variety of \nways, and no American comes forward to take that job, then a willing \nworker and a willing employer can join together in a contract that that \nperson can come and work and fill that job that it has already been \nproven an American won't take. If that person continues to work in the \nUnited States, he is allowed to remain in the United States under our \nproposal.\n  An equally important aspect is that those who are now south of our \nborder or anywhere else in the world will recognize that even if they \ncross our border illegally and are able to do so, there will be no job \nfor them because the person who has entered into that contract has a \ntamper-proof biometric visa, and that is the only document that will be \nrecognized as a valid document in order for someone to obtain \nemployment.\n  So if someone does cross our border illegally, gets a job--one, he \nshouldn't get it because he doesn't have that contract but, two, if an \nemployer hires that individual, then, of course, that employer should \nbe prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n  It is not an exact parallel, but let me remind colleagues, about 15 \nyears ago we declared a war on drugs. All of us, we were going to stop \nthe flow of drugs from coming across our border and destroying America. \nAny objective observer will tell you that our progress has been \nlimited, if at all successful. Why? Because there is still a demand for \ndrugs, and they are coming across our borders. People are using them, \nand there is still a demand.\n\n  There is a demand for workers in this country. And these people are \ncoming across our borders, both northern and southern--we seem to \nconcentrate so much of our attention on the southern border, but they \nare coming across both borders--to feed themselves and their families \nwhich they can't do where they are. I would be glad to discuss the \nfailure of the Mexican Government to enforce their border, including \ntheir southern border, the need for us to work more cooperatively, the \ncorruption problems, all of the issues that are associated with the \nissue of people coming across our border. But I predict, even if we had \nthe best cooperation from the Mexican Government, people who can't feed \nthemselves and their families where they are would still try to come to \nthis country to get jobs. And if you can prove that there are jobs that \nno American will take, why not have a process, a system where someone \ncan come and take it and work?\n  There are very few of my colleagues who would deny that the \noverwhelming majority of people who come to this country are honest, \nGod-fearing, hard-working people, some of whom, by the way, have died \nin the desert in an effort to come, a larger number every year in the \nArizona desert. Their only desire is to better themselves and provide \nbetter lives for themselves and their families. There are all kinds of \nother benefits associated with this, as well. One of the reasons why \nworkers come to this country today and stay is because it is so \ndifficult to move back and forth to the families and the homes they \ncame from. If they have a tamper-proof visa, then, of course, on their \nvacations or even at the completion of their work, they would feel \ncomfortable in returning to the place where they came from. But now, \nwith the difficulty of crossing back and forth over the border, more \nand more of them remain here, and sometimes there is a criminal \nelement.\n  Let me make another point. With illegal immigration, with \ntransportation of people across the border who are coming across \nillegally, terrible things are happening. We have the coyotes who \nmistreat them, the coyotes who sometimes hold them captive and demand \nmore and more money. There are shootouts on our freeways in Arizona. No \nState in America understands how terrible this issue is more than the \ncitizens of my State because over half of the people crossing the \nborder illegally are coming across the Arizona Sonora Desert. It is \nterrible what is going on. The exploitation and the mistreatment of \nthese people who are honest, who are God's children, is terrible. If we \ncould have a viable guest worker program, one that we could enforce, \nthen you would lose this incredible attraction that draws people \nillegally into our country and, of course, all of the associated bad \naspects of it that the citizens of my State of Arizona are so \nintimately familiar with.\n  Of course, it frustrates citizens. Of course, it frustrates the \ncitizens of my State to have so many hundreds of millions of dollars in \nuncompensated health care costs, to have law enforcement requirements \nand expenses go up, to have all of the problems associated with illegal \nimmigration. But to say somehow that we are not going to satisfy what \nis clearly, primarily economic immigration--by the way, the Border \nPatrol statistics say 99 percent of those attempting to cross our \nNation's border illegally are ``economic immigrants''--then we are \ngoing to be faced with a problem. No wall, no barrier, no sensor, no \nbarbed wire will ever stop people from trying to do what is a basic \nyearning of human beings all over the world, and that is to have better \nlives for themselves and their families.\n  I hope and believe we will reject the Dorgan amendment. As the \nSenator from Alabama said, he wants to go back and start over. There \nare a number of us who have invested years in this issue.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his continued leadership.\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\n  By the way, all of us are very grateful that he survived a very \nserious aircraft emergency recently. We are glad that he is well and \nwith us.\n  I hope we will reject the amendment. I hope we will then move on to \nother amendments and within a relatively short period of time resolve \nmost of the controversial aspects of this legislation.\n  Finally, I thank the President of the United States for what was \ngreeted, as we know from the overnight polls, very favorably by the \nAmerican people, his support of a comprehensive resolution of this \nterrible issue that afflicts our Nation, that of illegal immigration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be willing to yield 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Massachusetts. But before doing so, I urge other Senators \nto come to the floor to offer amendments. It is thought that if we \nfocus on the guest worker provisions, we can finish them up this \nafternoon. Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn actually have precedence, but \nif they would be willing to yield to the other Senators on guest \nworker, I think we would finish this entire category. And perhaps we \ncan find a way to work out Kyl-Cornyn in the interim. We will be \nlooking for an amendment from Senator Bingaman who wants to reduce the \nnumber of guest workers. We have an amendment by Senator Obama which is \non a related issue, I am told, on labor protections. And we have an \namendment by Senator Feinstein on having some sunset provisions. Then \nit is hoped we can get agreement on Senator Kerry's amendment and be \nable to accept that. If we could finish this grouping, we would be well \non our way.\n  So if those Senators can come to the floor, we can work out time \nagreements and proceed in an expeditious manner. Meanwhile, Senator \nKennedy has requested 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nwant to thank my friend and colleague and the principal sponsor of the \nmajor comprehensive legislation.\n  In addition, I ask the Senator from Arizona, is it not true that you \nhave the advertising for a worker in the United States where there is \nnot an American worker and a willing worker who comes from outside of \nthe country, that they have some important labor protections--\nprotections with regard to the minimum wage, with regard to Davis-\nBacon, with regard to service contracts, protections against \nexploitation of contractors, which were the source of great abuses at \nthe time we had the Bracero issue and question. Is it not true that we \nhave some protections for those individuals and, therefore, the idea \nthat there is going to be a continuation of the exploitation of these \nworkers working in a substandard way is fundamentally addressed? And is \nit also not true we have some 2,000 inspectors that are included in the \nunderlying legislation that are going to be charged with the \nenforcement of this provision, which we have never had?\n  I listened to so many people talk about 1986 and the amnesty. Part of \nthat provision was to have employer enforcement, and it didn't take \nplace--not under Republicans or Democrats. But we have addressed that \nissue in the McCain-Kennedy proposal. We have 2,000 individuals whose \nsole responsibility is going to be in terms of the adequate enforcement \nof the labor protections. Is it also not true--it is true--that we have \nhad important economists who have been before our Judiciary Committee \nwho say that this will have an important, positive impact in terms of \nwages, working conditions, and treatment of American workers?\n  I know there are several items that are included in this question, \nbut I want to make sure that we include and add on to what was the \nexcellent presentation of the Senator from Arizona. We have talked \nabout having a comprehensive approach. We hoped to have a comprehensive \napproach earlier this morning, and we have a comprehensive approach by \nrecognizing what the Senator from Arizona has said and is so obvious--\nthat is, if you are going to have the demand in this country and \ndesperate people in the others, it makes a good deal more sense to try \nto develop a legal process by which that can be controlled, rather than \nthink that we are going to be able to build fences high enough, long \nenough, along the 1,800-mile border and prohibit tunnels deep enough to \nkeep people out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in response to my friend from \nMassachusetts, the Kennedy-McCain bill was a subject of long \nnegotiations. And for more than a year, many of these issues were \ndiscussed with us and others. We felt that one of the most important \naspects of this legislation was the protection of workers. One of the \nreasons why illegal immigration is so evil--one aspect you don't hear \nso much about is the terrible treatment and exploitation by cruel \npeople of innocent people. A year ago last August, I believe, a \npoliceman in Phoenix opened the door of a horse trailer and 73 people \nwere packed inside, and one was a 4-month-old child.\n  Often, the Senator from Massachusetts and I have discussed what it is \nlike to die in the desert. Every year, every summer more people die. \nThey are not coming--99 percent of them, according to the Border \nPatrol--to do evil things but to work. Why are there jobs? Because \nthere are jobs that Americans will not fill.\n  My response to the Senator from Massachusetts is that no one should \nbe under the misunderstanding that this is another Bracero Program. The \nBracero Program died because of the abuses associated with it. This \ngives them a status not of citizenship but of equal protection under \nthe law. Any human being who resides in the United States should not be \nsubject to exploitation and cruelty. That is the nature of America. We \ndon't say in America that only citizens have the protections of our \nlaws. We say anyone who comes to our country does, too.\n  So, finally, I want to say to my friend from Massachusetts that this \nis a fundamental part of this legislation, as he knows. If you take \nthis out, you will then be face with the exact same economic pressures \nthat we have been experiencing in the past. And as much as I believe in \ntechnology and as much as I think walls are important and UAVs and all \nthat, there has never been a case in history where you have been able \nto stop people from doing something that has to do with their very \nexistence. That is the way many people feel who come here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One final question. The Senator is addressing the issue \nof real security, national security. But we are committed to trying to \nhave a secure border. We have gone through the measures which we have \nincluded in our legislation, many of which were enhanced during the \ncourse of the markup and have been expanded in the supplemental. But a \nkey aspect of that security and in controlling the border is to stop \nthe flow of people climbing fences, going into tunnels, and \ncircumventing the border. A key aspect of this is to develop an orderly \nprocess by which people in the limited numbers that we have outlined in \nthe bill would be able to come.\n\n  Would the Senator not agree that this is a security issue, border \nsecurity issue, as well as a worker issue?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with the Senator. Interestingly enough, if I can \nmention again, the President of the United States, having served as \nGovernor of the State of Texas, understands this issue very well. He \nmade a very important point last night because all elements of this \nproblem must be addressed together or none of them will be solved at \nall. The President is exactly right. None of these problems can be \nsolved unless we have a comprehensive approach to this legislation.\n  Again, Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, briefly, \nthat we still have a terrible problem of drugs flowing across our \nborder. If we had the guest worker program that we have talked about in \nthis legislation, then there would be people who are coming for jobs, \nand we could focus our effort and attention on the drug dealers who are \nnow corrupting America's youth. I thank the Senator and, again, I hope \nmy colleagues realize the implication of this vote because if we did \ntake it out, then obviously--at least in the view of most experts that \nI know--the rest of the reforms would not be either applicable or \nenforceable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am going to make a few comments briefly\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\nin rebuttal. Then I understand Senator Dorgan is prepared to yield back \ntime and so will I. The other Senators whom we had talked about, when \nthey come to the floor, will be ready for their amendments \nmomentarily--Senators Bingaman, Obama, and Feinstein. If they are not \nhere, Senator Vitter can be recognized or Senator Kyl and Senator \nCornyn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, I intend to use my remaining \ntime at the conclusion of the comments of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fair enough. My information was incorrect then. By way \nof brief rebuttal on the question of impact of guest workers on the \nAmerican workers, I ask unanimous consent that the testimony of Dan \nSiciliano, from the Stanford Law School, be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The key statement of Mr. Siciliano is:\n\n       Some claim that immigration reduces employment levels and \n     wages among native-born workers. This is generally not true.\n\n  The text of his statement amplifies on that. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the statement of Professor Harry Holzer from Georgetown University \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The essence is a statement that:\n\n       There seems little doubt, then, that any negative effects \n     of immigration on earnings are modest in magnitude and mostly \n     short-term in nature.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Professor Richard \nFreeman, Harvard University, be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. His conclusion was:\n\n       The gains to native complements exceed the losses to native \n     substitutes, so that immigration--like trade and capital \n     flows--are a net boon for the economy.\n\n  The Senator from California had made the argument that American \nemployees are disadvantaged by cheaper costs from immigrant employees, \nand that is not so under the express terms of the statute.\n  The bill, S. 2611, does protect U.S. workers and eliminates \nincentives for employers to hire foreign workers, unless no U.S. worker \nis available. The bill provides that employers must at least pay the \nhigher of the actual wage paid to other employees with the same skill \nso that immigrant workers are paid the same or, the prevailing wage for \nthat job. Employers must provide the same working conditions and \nbenefits that are normal to similar jobs, and employers must provide \ninsurance if State workers' compensation doesn't cover all the workers. \nSo that under the pending legislation, an employer has the same cost to \nhire a foreign worker as a U.S. worker.\n  How much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Senator Kennedy. Let me get to this point that the Chairman \n     has made, Dan, with your analysis. You gave us some \n     projections. You talked about the limitations in terms of \n     productivity, the numbers in the labor force, retirement \n     issues, and then the job growth. And you talked about GDP, 14 \n     percent and 11 percent. You talked about legal and the \n     illegal. Maybe you could just flesh those figures out a \n     little bit. What you appear to be saying is that if you \n     consider the numbers of both legal and illegal, you get a \n     certain rate of growth, and without them you get another \n     different rate of growth. And that is what I would be \n     interested in.\n       Maybe we cannot parse between the legal numbers the \n     Chairman talked about, whether that is 500,000 or we are \n     looking at just the general range of numbers now. Could you \n     expand on that?\n       Mr. Siciliano. Sure. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. I think \n     this also answers Chairman Specter's question in part, which \n     is: What is the true net economic contribution and where does \n     it come from and why? And so from my viewpoint, and in light \n     of the demographic numbers, it appears that our economy is on \n     the trend growth rate, we hope, at 3 percent or better. Now, \n     that growth rate of GDP is reliant on many factors. One of \n     the key factors is available workers to fill the jobs that \n     are created. So even while at the high-skill level you have \n     Nobel Prize winners and other people inventing companies, \n     somebody needs to build the buildings, clean the buildings, \n     you know, service the lavatories in which these people are \n     operating. And this is a part of the capacity for GDP to \n     grow.\n       So to put a finer point on it, if you look at the fiscal \n     economic impact, which is the Government coffers impact, it \n     might be true that lower-skilled workers, just like all of us \n     on average, actually, at the moment because of deficit \n     spending, have a negative impact on the fiscal bottom line. \n     But that should not be confused--and this would be a mistake \n     to confuse this. That should not be confused with the \n     economic impact. It is a little like my younger sister who \n     recently said, ``I am earning more, but look at all the taxes \n     I am paying. I am paying more taxes.'' I said, ``Yes, but you \n     are earning more.''\n       And so we may have a modest net negative fiscal impact for \n     all low-wage workers in the United States, not just \n     immigrants. That is not unique to immigrants, documented or \n     undocumented, but what we do know is it helps us achieve a \n     higher rate of growth and national income goes up, which \n     benefits everybody. It becomes your challenge, I think to \n     talk about how to, you know, work that out at who shares and \n     how at the pie level. But it is clear that this divide \n     between available workers and the demand for workers will \n     slow down economic growth if we do not manage it \n     appropriately.\n       Senator KENNEDY. Let me just get to the high skilled/low-\n     skilled. I think most of us would like to believe that we are \n     going to train our own people to be able to take these high-\n     skilled jobs. And we have under our current programs training \n     resources that are paid into the fund to try to continue to \n     upgrade skills for Americans. But we are not able to get \n     quite there at the present time.\n       Other countries, industrial countries, have required \n     training programs. They pay--what is it?--in European \n     countries a percent and a half, other countries, so that they \n     have required training programs, which we do not have, \n     continuing training programs which we do not have.\n       So how are we going to adjust? What is your sense about how \n     we are going to--we have seen a significant--actually, we are \n     getting the skills, but where people that are going to into \n     these high-skilled programs, but how are we going to get \n     Americans up to speed so that those Nobel laureates are going \n     to be the sons of native workers rather than foreign workers? \n     What can you comment on that?\n       Mr. Siciliano. I think there are two issues. One, you know, \n     the expanded H-1B program with the continued diversion of \n     monies into special training programs is a good start, so we \n     need the talent in the first place. We need that high-skilled \n     talent to maintain our competitive edge, which gives us some \n     runway into which to develop and train native talent. It \n     cannot happen overnight. So the first question is: What do we \n     do to make sure over the next 20 years we still get the \n     world's absolute bet and brightest, lure them to our best \n     universities, have them pay for that education, make them \n     enamored of the United States, and then they stay here and \n     then have children.\n       Now, you divert that money and you direct it into targeted \n     training, and that is a bigger issue, I think, to entice \n     U.S.-born workers into the difficult and long-term training \n     that will prepare them for a modern, very knowledge-based \n     economy. But the start is to make sure we keep the industries \n     here because we lure the right talent here, and then we do \n     something over the next 20 years so that the 5-year-olds \n     right now do end up getting the double Ph.D., electrical \n     engineering and applied physics, and go on to win the Nobel \n     Prize. But you are talking about the 5-years-olds, not the \n     25-year-olds. We need the 25-year-old to get an H-1B, have \n     their own Government pay to go to Stanford University, get \n     that Ph.D. there, and then work at Google, stay here. Good \n     deal for us.\n       Senator Feinstein. Let me mention another point. I happen \n     to believe that the weakest part of the bills that I have \n     supported is the guest worker program. From a California \n     perspective, it is impossible to say to somebody you can come \n     here for at least six years by renewing your guest worker \n     permit, but at the end of six years you have to go home. The \n     experience we have had is quite simply people do not go home. \n     Therefore, it seems to me that the H-2A program, where you \n     bring someone for a limited period of time, has a much better \n     opportunity to work because then they do go back and forth \n     across the border\n       What do you believe is the optimum amount of time that an \n     individual will come as a guest worker and then actually \n     go home at the end of that period of time?\n       Mr. Siciliano. Senator Feinstein, I think one thing to \n     consider is that by limiting the amount of time that an \n     employer may utilize a guest worker, it alters their behavior \n     in terms of their incentives to invest even in a low-skilled \n     guest worker. So even a low-skilled worker will require a \n     certain amount of training and investment, and the shorter \n     the duration of that opportunity for employment, the less \n     investment there is, which is bad for everyone.\n       I think one of the possible alternative views here is to \n     recognize some of the limitations that occur if you create a \n     temporary guest worker program and then instead try to \n     identify those lesser-skilled individuals who, in the long \n     run--if you created boundaries of wage and hour rules, \n     allowable behavior on the part of businesses, and then\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\n     screened up front for who you would allow to enter on that \n     basis and create some path, assuming continuing employment, \n     and a very high bar for behavior and civic behavior, then \n     perhaps you can solve both problems, because I believe the \n     evidence demonstrates and I think a lot of the arguments \n     assume that the economy will work it out. If there are no \n     opportunities, people will go back.\n       Senator Feinstein. But that is difficult to do. Therefore, \n     if you take the 10 to 12 million people that are here already \n     that work in agriculture, construction, landscaping, \n     housekeeping, et cetera, and provide a steady stream of \n     employment and enable them to have a pathway to legalization, \n     are you not really doing the best thing possible economically \n     to see that there is economic upward mobility?\n       Mr. Siciliano. I see. With that subset, yes, I would argue \n     that that is the right path, and then on the other question I \n     would defer. I am sorry that I don't have a solution. . . .\n       Chairman Specter. Thank you, Senator Feinstein.\n       Senator Kyl.\n       Senator Kyl. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, panel. One \n     of the arguments for not being as tough in enforcing the law \n     especially at the border is that in the years past there was \n     a lot of circular migration especially from Mexico and \n     Central America, people who came here, worked for a while and \n     then went back home. It wasn't hard for them to continue that \n     process, but once we began strong border enforcement, then \n     they were stuck and stayed.\n       I don't know that there is any evidence to support that or \n     refute it, but it has been the basis for a lot of people \n     talking about this concept of circularity, and I want to get \n     back to that concept and also ask you this question in view \n     of the fact that at least a couple of you are very skeptical \n     that a temporary worker program really ends up being \n     temporary because people don't want to go home. I mean, what \n     I just said may to some extent refute that, but clearly there \n     are people that probably fall into both categories.\n       What we haven't talked about here is the differentiation \n     between a time like today when we are at very high employment \n     and a time when in the future we will have a recession and we \n     will have high unemployment. And let me stipulate for a \n     moment, even though there is a little bit of argument about \n     mechanization, and so on, that in the lettuce fields of Yuma \n     County, it has always been hard to get Americans to do that \n     work. It has been traditionally work done, by the way, by \n     people who live in Mexico and come across everyday and go \n     back home by and large, although there are some that stay \n     longer.\n       In Arizona, we can't find enough people to build houses \n     today. Under the bill that Senator Cornyn and I have, we \n     would be issuing lots of temporary visas right now. But we \n     have also seen many economic downturns when you can't get a \n     job in construction, no matter how skilled an American \n     citizen you are. In that case, under our bill we wouldn't be \n     issuing temporary visas. We would let the ones that are here \n     expire; we wouldn't issue any more.\n       I am troubled by the fact that all of you seem to be so \n     skeptical that people would return. One concept was that, \n     well, when there is not work, they will return. But isn't it \n     just as likely that what they will do is under-bid Americans \n     for those same jobs?\n       I have gone through enough political times when we were in \n     that high employment situation where Americans were looking \n     for work. It is not a pleasant thing. So I am concerned about \n     a program that lets people come in under today's \n     circumstances, but who may not have a job, or at least \n     there won't be enough jobs for everybody in tomorrow's \n     circumstances.\n       Given that fact, doesn't it make sense to consider the \n     economic realities in how many permits you issue, and \n     especially if you are saying folks won't go home, to be very \n     careful about the number of visas that you issue for these \n     low-skilled workers because you have to consider tomorrow's \n     lack of employment opportunity as well as today's full \n     employment opportunity?\n       I have sort of posited several different thoughts and \n     questions inferred there. If you could just each give me your \n     general take on what I have said.\n       Mr. Siciliano. let me throw in one item, as well, to \n     clarify. For all we know about business cycles, we still \n     don't know a lot. One of the things, I think, to observe is \n     that as we go into a down business cycle, we make macro \n     adjustments to the cost of capital as a way of spurring the \n     economy potentially and creating jobs and creating businesses \n     through capital formation.\n       It is worth thinking about--and I don't think it is a \n     conclusive answer for you, but it is worth thinking about the \n     fact that available labor supplies during a downturn is its \n     own form of self-corrective mechanism. And I would fear \n     second-guessing at a micro level the small and medium-size \n     businesses who might be reformulating strategies to alter \n     their response to global competition and need the liquidity \n     that is provided by available workforce. And we do suffer \n     through a terrible time which is short and hence has changed, \n     but it might be akin to cost of capital.\n       Labor is one of the critical inputs to all of economic \n     development and we tinker with it at a micro level, we might \n     inadvertently prevent ourselves from emerging as quickly as \n     we might otherwise have from a recession.\n       Senator Kyl. I appreciate that. In view of the fact that \n     there is only one more to question, might I just offer a \n     comment? All of that there is fine in economic theory. As I \n     said, I have had to stand in town hall meetings with 3 or 400 \n     Americans that don't have jobs.\n       Senator Sessions. I am not sure wno to ask this question \n     to, but if anybody would speak up and give me a thought on \n     it, I would appreciate it. Is there a difference economically \n     in the effect of a temporary or a permanent worker? Does \n     anybody have any thought about that?\n       Mr. Siciliano. Senator Sessions, I will address one small \n     part so that others can comment, and that is I think we know \n     intuitively that renters and owners treat their properties \n     differently. Renting to own may be a compromise, but I would \n     say that we have recent evidence citing Giovanni Peri's paper \n     out of UC-Davis in November that we know that the \n     entrepreneurial behavior of those immigrants who feel that \n     they have some possibility of being here in the long term is \n     increased because they are more likely to invest their \n     capital here in the United States to engage in skill-building \n     that resonates better in the United States and they get \n     better returns on.\n       So my one comment would be we know we sometimes get very \n     efficient and good behaviors for our national interest from \n     immigrants of all skill levels if the think they may have a \n     long-term role to play here both about themselves and their \n     children.\n       Senator Sessions. Would it be in our interest, therefore, \n     to attempt to identify the people that bring the most skill \n     sets and the most ability to the country when we allow \n     whatever limited number we have to come here legally?\n       Mr. Siciliano. Mr. Chairman, I am familiar with the the \n     [Center for Immigration] study. I can answer the specific \n     question, if I may.\n       Chairman Specter. Go ahead, Professor Siciliano.\n       Mr. Siciliano. Thank you. That particular study has two \n     types of expenditures--direct payments to immigrants and \n     immigrant households, so it includes sometimes U.S. citizen \n     children, and indirect attributive costs which are the \n     general expenses by the government divided by the number of \n     households in the United States.\n       The study is actually dominated by the general government \n     expenditures component of those costs. So, in other words, \n     you take the government expenditures, you divide it by the \n     number of households, and then you take that number. And that \n     number is a large number right now because we have high \n     levels of expenditures relative to tax collections.\n       That is why it is driven by our fiscal state as a Federal \n     Government, as opposed to simply the behavior of the \n     immigrants. The direct payments are an important component, \n     but they are actually dominated by and outweighed by the \n     general expenditures share, which is interesting, but I think \n     it overstates the interest of that particular number that you \n     have cited. It is not irrelevant.\n       Chairman Specter. The President of the Dominican Republic \n     was very interested in the money coming back to the Dominican \n     Republic. The estimates are the immigrants in the United \n     States send home about $39 billion a year in remittances. So \n     on one hand, there is a concern about what that does to our \n     economy. That purchasing power is not being used in the \n     United States.\n       The other aspect is that our foreign relations are very \n     complicated. We heard a great deal about the difficulties \n     with Venezuela and President Chavez. A vote of the Andean \n     countries on protecting property rights was three-to-two, \n     with the United States winning. We have trade there to try to \n     strengthen our foreign relations. We heard a lot of talk \n     about their recognizing the leaders of the foreign \n     governments, recognizing our rights to control our borders, \n     but also looking for a humanitarian approach that we have.\n       How big an impact is it, Professor Siciliano, if $39 \n     billion is remitted from the United States to the home \n     countries?\n       Mr. Siciliano. Well, as a component of the overall economy, \n     I actually think it is a fairly small number, but it \n     obviously has tremendous impact for the countries who receive \n     the remittances.\n       Two points. One, the transmission of that money actually \n     generates substantial revenue and profits for U.S.-based \n     business, primarily financial institutions who serve as the \n     intermediaries to make that happen. I don't think we want to \n     forget that.\n       The second issue is that the money lands in the hands of \n     individuals who are nationals of obviously that country and \n     some of it recycles as demand for our goods and services, \n     hence jump-starting, we hope, the ongoing trade relations \n     which may mitigate some of the foreign national risks you \n     have identified. So I think it is a small piece in a big \n     global economy and one that shouldn't dominate the thinking \n     about how we decide \n     to move forward on the immigration de-\n     bate . . .\n       Chairman Specter. Professor Siciliano, do you have a brief \n     comment?\n       Mr. Siciliano. Yes, two key points. I think anecdote in the \n     hands of the economist is a dangerous weapon, so let me just \n     give two kinds of actual points of data. First, in the 1960s \n     we know that roughly half of the U.S. workforce lacked a high \n     school diploma, and now about 12 percent of the native-born \n     workforce lacks a high school diploma.\n       This skill set difference is driving the comment that I \n     think is true, which is it is not\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\n     the case that immigrant labor is displacing by and large U.S. \n     labor or depressing wages, and there are two key points to \n     highlight that. Nevada and Kentucky, arguably similar in cost \n     of living in many ways--7.5 percent of the population of \n     Nevada right now is estimated to be undocumented. The average \n     high school drop-out wage is $10 per hour. In Kentucky, less \n     than 1 percent of the population is estimated to be \n     undocumented, and yet the high school drop-out wage is $8.73 \n     per hour.\n       It can't be simplified into simply saying immigrant labor \n     shows up and it hurts U.S.-born labor. It is much more \n     complex than that. I think, net, it clearly benefits U.S. \n     labor . . .\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n         Does Immigration Help or Hurt Less-Educated Americans?\n\n\n Testimony of Harry J. Holzer, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, April \n                                25, 2006\n\n       The vast majority of economists in the U.S. believe that, \n     on average, immigration is good for the U.S. economy. By \n     helping reduce the costs of producing certain goods and \n     services, it adds to our national output, and makes consumers \n     better off. Business owners also profit very clearly from \n     immigration.\n       At the same time, it is possible that some native-born \n     Americans--especially the less-educated Americans who might \n     have to compete with immigrants for jobs--might be made worse \n     off. Certain costs--especially for public education and \n     services to the poor--might rise. And there are various \n     noneconomic considerations, both positive and negative.\n       On these various issues, what does the evidence show? And \n     what does the evidence imply for immigration policy?\n\n\n              Effects on Earnings of Native-Born Americans\n\n       For many years, most studies of the U.S. labor market have \n     shown little or no negative effects of immigration on the \n     wages or employment of native-born workers--including \n     minorities and those with little education. More recently, \n     another few studies that use different statistical methods \n     from the earlier ones find somewhat stronger negative \n     effects. According to these more recent studies, immigration \n     during the period 1980-2000 might have reduced the earnings \n     of native-born high school dropouts by as much as 8 percent, \n     and those of other workers by 2-4 percent.\n       However, some strong statistical assumptions are required \n     to achieve these results. And, even in these latter studies, \n     the long run negative effects of immigration (i.e., after \n     capital flows have adjusted across sectors to the presence of \n     immigrants) are reduced to only 4-5% for dropouts and \n     virtually disappear for labor overall.\n       There seems little doubt, then, that any negative effects \n     of immigration on earnings are modest in magnitude and mostly \n     short-term in nature. To the extent that high school \n     graduates as well as dropouts in the U.S. have fared poorly \n     in the labor market in recent years--especially among men--\n     other factors are much more likely responsible (such as new \n     technologies in the workplace, international trade, and \n     disappearing unionization).\n       Native-born minority and especially African-American men \n     face many labor market problems besides immigration--such as \n     poor education, discrimination, and the disappearance of jobs \n     from central-cities. In recent years, their high rates of \n     crime and incarceration, as well as child support obligations \n     for non-custodial fathers, have worsened their situation.\n       Does immigration also worsen their plight? There are \n     certain sectors--like construction, for example--where direct \n     competition from immigrants might reduce employment \n     opportunities for black men.\\2\\ But in many other \n     occupational categories (e.g., agriculture, gardening, \n     janitorial work) such competition is more limited or \n     nonexistent, as the native-born men show little interest in \n     such employment at current wage levels. In the absence of \n     immigration, it is possible that wages would rise and maybe \n     entice some native-born men to seek these jobs that they \n     consider dirty and menial; but the wage increases needed \n     would likely never materialize in many cases, as employers \n     would either replace these jobs with capital equipment or \n     enter other kinds of business as wages rose.\n       Two additional points are important here. First, the \n     potential competition to less-educated American workers from \n     immigrants depends in part on the overall health of the \n     economy. Immigration rates have been fairly constant to the \n     U.S. over the past few decades. In the very strong labor \n     markets of the late 1990's, these rates of immigration did \n     not prevent us from achieving extremely low unemployment \n     rates and real earnings growth, even among the least-educated \n     Americans. In the more sluggish labor markets since 2001, the \n     same rate of immigration generates more concern about job \n     competition. But, even in this latter period, the very weak \n     earnings growth of most American workers cannot possibly be \n     attributed to the arrival of a million or so new immigrants \n     annually.\n       Second, the illegal status of perhaps one-third of \n     immigrants might well magnify any competitive pressures they \n     generate for less-educated native-born workers. The reduced \n     wages and benefits associated with their illegal status offer \n     employers one more incentive for hiring them instead of \n     native-born workers, who might be interested in some of these \n     jobs and might be more appealing to employers at equal wages.\n\n\n                         Other Economic Effects\n\n       There is virtually no doubt that immigration reduces the \n     prices paid by consumers on many goods and services. There \n     remains much uncertainty about the magnitudes of these \n     effects, and on exactly who benefits the most. For instance, \n     higher-income Americans might benefit the most from child \n     care and other private household services, gardening, and \n     food preparation services in restaurants. But lower-income \n     Americans likely * * * disproportionately from lower \n     prices on food, housing and even some medical services \n     that are associated with immigrant labor in agriculture, \n     construction and health support occupations respectively.\n       Over the next few decades the contributions of immigrant \n     labor to certain key sectors will likely grow more important. \n     For example, the scientists and engineers needed to keep our \n     nation competitive in scientific innovation and new product \n     development will depend to a growing extent on foreign \n     graduate students who choose to remain here after finishing \n     their schooling, even though their presence might reduce the \n     incentives of some native-born students from entering these \n     fields. In other sectors, the retirements of ``Baby Boomers'' \n     may also generate stronger labor demand. A variety of labor \n     market adjustments (such as delayed retirements, new \n     technologies, greater foreign ``offshoring'' of work, etc.) \n     will likely mitigate the impacts of these retirements in the \n     aggregate. But in certain key sectors--especially health care \n     and elder care--these adjustments are less likely to meet the \n     necessary demand, and the need for immigrant (and other) \n     labor may remain quite strong.\n       Perhaps the most serious economic costs imposed by \n     immigrants on native-born Americans--at least in those few \n     states that serve as the primary ``ports of entry'' to \n     immigrants--are those associated with public education, \n     health care and other income transfers to the poor. While \n     these costs are no doubt significant in those states, they \n     have been reduced by legal changes in the welfare system that \n     reduced immigrant eligibility for such transfers. Over time, \n     immigration might modestly improve the fiscal status of \n     Social Security and Medicare, as it helps replenish the \n     falling ratios of workers to retirees.\n       By far the greatest benefits of immigration to the U.S. \n     accrue to the immigrants themselves, whose earnings here are \n     often vastly higher than they would be in their home \n     countries. Both foreign policy and humanitarian \n     considerations might lead us to approve of this, even though \n     the direct economic benefits to native-born Americans are \n     more limited.\n\n\n                          policy implications\n\n       If immigration is largely good for the overall U.S. \n     economy, should we simply ``open the floodgates'' and remove \n     all legal restrictions on it? Most Americans would be \n     reluctant to do so, especially since there are some \n     significant costs to immigration, and at least some workers \n     who are made worse off. The noneconomic implications of such \n     a move (e.g., for the national character and makeup of our \n     communities) might also be troubling to many people.\n       But, if our ability to restrict immigration legally is \n     imperfect, what shall we do? Efforts to improve the \n     enforcement of existing laws in humane ways (e.g., without \n     creating felonies for illegal immigrants and those who hire \n     or assist them, or building costly fences along the Mexican \n     border) may be worth trying, though their effectiveness may \n     be limited. On the other hand, generating pathways by which \n     illegal immigrants in the U.S. can achieve full citizenship \n     (by paying fines, back taxes etc.) makes a lot of sense, \n     given that their illegal status imposes hardships on them and \n     their children while likely exacerbating the competition they \n     pose to native-born Americans. It seems unlikely that any \n     such move would dramatically raise the incentives that \n     illegal immigrants currently have to enter the country given \n     the gains in their standards of living that occur even when \n     they enter illegally.\n       Guest worker programs have some major limitations, \n     particularly in terms of enforcing legal rights for these \n     workers and ensuring that they maintain some bargaining power \n     relative to their employers. Since most guest workers stay \n     permanently, the benefits of such an approach seem dubious. \n     But some legal changes that encourage greater immigration of \n     highly educated workers over time would likely generate \n     greater benefits to the U.S. economy.\n       Finally, if we really want to improve opportunities for \n     less-educated Americans in the labor market, there are a \n     variety of approaches (such as improvements in education and \n     training, expansion of public supports like health insurance \n     and child care, and supporting protective institutions such \n     as minimum wage laws and unions) that would likely be more \n     effective than restricting immigration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n              The New Immigration and the New U.S. Economy\n\n   (Richard B. Freeman, Harvard University and NBER, April 25, 2006)\n\n\n            Statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\n       I have organized my comments around eight points.\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\n       (1) Immigration is part of globalization. It is intimately \n     connected to increased trade, free mobility of capital, and \n     transmission of knowledge across national lines. Ideally, \n     immigration and these other flows allow the U.S. and the \n     world to make better use of available resources and to raise \n     national and world output. A worker who comes to the U.S. \n     increases the American labor supply, which means the country \n     can produce more. If that worker does not immigrate, he or \n     she may make the same or similar good in their native country \n     and export that good to the U.S. Or a U.S. or other \n     multinational may invest in that worker's country to produce \n     the good. In other situations, the immigrant may bring \n     capital, particularly human capital, with them, so that both \n     capital and labor move together. The message for thinking \n     about immigration in the global economy is: view immigration \n     as related to trade and capital flows; policies that affect \n     trade and capital will alter immigration and conversely.\n       (2) Immigration is the least developed part of \n     globalization. Immigrants make up about 3 percent of the \n     global workforce; whereas international trade's share of \n     world output is around 13 percent; and foreign equities in \n     investors' equity portfolio are on the order of 15 percent, \n     as of the early 2000s. Consistent with this, the range of pay \n     for workers with nominally similar skills is far greater than \n     the range of prices for goods around the world or the returns \n     to capital: The ratios of wages in the same occupation in \n     high paying countries relative to low paying countries are on \n     the order of ten to one measured in exchange rates and are on \n     the order of four to five to one measured in purchasing power \n     parity prices. The comparable ratio for prices of Big Macs is \n     less than 2 to 1 and the comparable ratio for the cost of \n     capital is 1.4 to 1. Thus, there is a huge incentive for \n     workers to immigrate from developing countries to developing \n     countries. Given this gap in incomes, the incentive to \n     immigrate will remain huge for the next 40-50 years at least.\n       (3) In the simplest economic model of globalization, the \n     flow of people, goods, and capital are substitute ways to \n     raise production and economic well-being. During the NAFT A \n     debate, the Clinton Administration argued that the treaty \n     would reduce illegal Mexican immigration to the U.S. on the \n     notion that increased trade with Mexico would create more \n     jobs there and lower the incentive to migrate to the U.S. \n     This turned out to be incorrect. The U.S. attracts capital \n     flows and unskilled immigrants and skilled immigrants while \n     running a huge trade deficit. One reason is that the U.S. has \n     a technological edge and a business climate edge over most \n     other countries, particularly poor countries.\n       ( 4) Economic analysis predicts that immigrants reduce \n     earnings of substitute factors and raise the earnings of \n     complementary factors, where complements include capital and \n     other types of native-born labor. The gains to native \n     complements exceed the losses to native substitutes, so that \n     immigration--like trade and capital flows--are a net boon for \n     the economy. Most immigration studies estimate the adverse \n     effect of immigrants on native earnings or employment, but \n     the logic of the analysis establishes a direct link between \n     the losses to native substitutes and the larger gains to \n     native complements. Studies that compare wages/employment in \n     cities with lots of immigrants with wages/employment in \n     cities with few immigrants find little adverse effect of \n     immigration on native workers. But this also means that there \n     is little native gain from immigration (save when immigrants \n     do things that no native can or will do at any reasonable \n     wage). Studies that compare wages/employment among groups \n     over time find that immigrants depress the wages/\n     employment of natives, with a larger impact among more \n     highly educated workers. Even so, the gains and losses to \n     natives from immigration are dwarfed by the gains that \n     immigrants themselves make. An unskilled Mexican can earn \n     6 to 8 times as much in the U.S. as in rural Mexico. The \n     main beneficiaries from immigration to the U.S. are \n     immigrants; this is why so many are willing to enter \n     illegally when they can--from Mexico or Central America or \n     the Caribbean.\n       (5) The huge difference in the earnings of low skilled \n     immigrants, in particular, in their native land and in the \n     U.S. creates a powerful economic force for continued \n     immigrant flows and makes it very difficult to control the \n     U.S. borders. At the same time, however, it suggests that \n     many current illegal immigrants or potential immigrants would \n     be willing to pay for legal status in the country. To change \n     immigration flows from illegal to legal and to control the \n     flows requires redistributing some of the huge gains to \n     immigrants to natives.\n       (6) At the other end of the skill distribution, the U.S. \n     relies extensively on highly skilled immigrants to maintain \n     our comparative advantage in science and technology. The \n     United States imports science and engineering specialists, \n     who help the country maintain its position at the \n     technological frontier. During the 1990s boom, the United \n     States greatly increased the proportion of foreign-born \n     workers among scientists and engineers. In 2000 over half of \n     the country's Ph.D. scientists and engineers were born \n     overseas! Sixty percent of the growth of S workers over \n     this decade came from the foreign born. Without this flow of \n     immigrants, U.S. labs, including government labs such as \n     those of NIH, would have to cut their workload in half. \n     Highly skilled immigrants add to the ability of our economy \n     to maintain predominance in high-tech industries with good \n     jobs and growth potential. The desire of highly educated \n     immigrants to come to the U.S. is a major competitive \n     advantage to the U.S.\n       (7) But having a huge flow of highly skilled immigrants \n     invariably reduces the incentives for American students to go \n     on in science and engineering. The 1990s increase in science \n     and engineering employment occurred without great increases \n     in pay for these workers, in part because of the large supply \n     of foreign born specialists desirous of coming to the U.S. \n     Without gains in earnings and quality of work life, many \n     outstanding American students, particularly men, shunned \n     science and engineering in favor of business, law, and other \n     disciplines. This does not however mean that the U.S. must \n     limit foreign flows to attract more Americans into these \n     fields. It can attract more Americans with more and increased \n     graduate fellowships and undergraduate scholarships. To \n     maintain the U.S. as the lead scientific and technological \n     country, the U.S. should develop policies to attract more \n     able students from our native born population without seeking \n     to reduce immigrant flows.\n       (8) Multinational firms today source highly skilled labor \n     globally. They seek the best workers they can get regardless \n     of country of origin. As the number of university graduates \n     is increasing throughout the world, the competition facing \n     educated American workers has risen. Is it better for native \n     born and resident Americans to compete with educated \n     foreigners from developing countries who come as immigrants \n     in the U.S., where wages and working conditions are \n     reasonably high, or to compete with them when they are \n     working overseas, where wages and working conditions are \n     generally lower? Is it better to have U.S. firms offshore \n     jobs or bring in more immigrants? While there is no \n     definitive analysis of these questions, my guess is that it \n     is better to have the top foreign talent in the U.S.; and to \n     do what we can to get them to become citizens and remain here \n     than to have them compete with U.S. workers from lower wage \n     settings overseas. Because trade and capital and immigration \n     flows are intimately connected, however, there are some \n     economic factors operating in the other direction.\n       In sum, we should think about the economics of immigration \n     in two parts. Taking unskilled and often illegal immigration \n     first, the main beneficiaries of low skill immigration are \n     the immigrants, who have a huge economic incentive to come to \n     the U.S. when they can. The vast improvement they can make in \n     their lives and the lives of their children by coming to our \n     country speaks well for our society, even if few of those \n     benefits accrue to current citizens and residents. With \n     respect to the highly educated immigrants, they add to the \n     country's strength in the sectors that we need to prosper in \n     the global economy. We should compete actively in the global \n     market for the top students and workers in science and \n     engineering and other technical fields, but also provide \n     incentives for more Americans to enter these fields.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment and \nsupport Senator Specter and Senator Kennedy's and Senator McCain's \nposition. I think, relative to the effort in this Congress and in the \nSenate, nobody has put more time into the issue of how we secure our \nborders relative to the actual physical activity on our borders than I \nhave because I find myself in the jurisdiction of the Appropriations \nCommittee that covers the border security issues.\n  I have come to this conclusion: We can secure our borders. But you \ncannot do it with just people and money on the border. There has to be \na policy in place that creates an atmosphere that lessens the pressure \nfor people to come across the border illegally. The essence of doing \nthat is this guest worker concept. Yes, you have to do everything we \ncan to tighten up the borders in the area of boots on the ground, \ntechnology being used, and making sure we have a strong Coast Guard, a \nstrong immigration force, and strong border security force. That type \nof commitment has been a primary effort of the Senate and myself. We \nput $1.9 billion into the supplemental that went through here to try to \nupgrade the capital for the aircraft and cars and unmanned vehicles and \nthe necessary facilities for the Coast Guard, recognizing that border \nsecurity has to be significantly beefed up.\n  The President made this point last night very well. But that cannot \nstop the issue--that doesn't resolve the issue of how you secure the \nborder because as long as you have human nature guiding people's \nactions, and as long as you have the role of supply and demand in play, \nyou are going to have\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\npeople who are willing to take the risks to come across the border \nillegally, no matter how many people you have there. If you are paying \n$5 a day in Mexico and $50 a day in the United States for a job, and \nyou have a family and you are trying to better yourself, you are going \nto want to seek that job in America.\n  The question is, Isn't there a way to set this process up so that a \njob seeker can come here, do the job, which the employer also needs \nthem to do because they can't otherwise fill that position--and this \nbill protects to make sure that is the case, that it is not taking jobs \nfrom Americans--isn't there some way to set this up so that a person \ncan come into this country, work a reasonable amount of time, and then \nreturn to their country, or be here as a guest worker in a guest worker \nstatus?\n  That is what this bill attempts to address. It is one of the three \nelements of the formula for getting control over our borders. The first \nelement is, of course, strong physical capability on the borders to \ncontrol the borders.\n  The second element is to make sure we have in place a program where \nwhen people come into this country to work, they can come in legally.\n  The third element, of course, is enforcement at the workplace to make \nsure people who are working have that legal status of a guest worker.\n  That is the essence of this bill, in part, along with the border \nsecurity elements. I strongly support it and hope we will reject the \namendment as proposed.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is not on \nthe floor of the Senate. My understanding was when his side was \nfinished, he was going to yield back his time. I will proceed on the \nassumption that his time is done, and I have the right to close. How \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 23 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an interesting discussion and \ninteresting debate. A couple of points have come to mind.\n  I have heard now three or four people come to the floor of the Senate \nand say: We have worked a long time and we put together a comprehensive \nproposal--in fact, they credited the President for saying the proposal \nneeds to be comprehensive--and you can't take any part of this and \nchange it. It is like pulling a loose string on a cheap suit: pull the \nstring, the arm falls off. You destroy the bill if you do anything that \nalters it.\n  Then they come to the floor and say this is a three-legged stool, and \nif you cut off one of the legs, the stool falls over. Maybe they ought \nto bring a four-legged stool to the floor of the Senate. If you have a \nbad leg, you better have another leg to balance on.\n  The fact is, this is not a three-legged stool or a cheap suit. It is \nbad policy, just bad policy.\n  I want to answer some of the offers made by the other side. First, \nthis issue of guests, temporary workers. We have a guest bedroom in our \nhome. We call it the guest bedroom because it is not used much. But \nwhen someone uses the guest bedroom, you expect they are going to be \nthere for a short period and leave. They are friends who come and stay. \nIf somebody were to come and stay forever in that room, I guess I \nwouldn't call them a guest. Yet this so-called guest provision they \nhave stuck in this bill by saying we are going to declare illegal \nimmigration legal for up to 3.8 million people in the next 6 years--\nthat is the way we will deal with illegal immigration. We will just \ncall it legal. The so-called guest provision is people who come here, \nthen apply for a green card, and then stay. There is nothing temporary \nabout that. Don't call them guests. Guests, future flow--what soft-\nsounding words. Maybe tourists, guest tourists, future flow. But we \nknow why they are coming. My colleagues described why they are coming. \nThey want to work in this country.\n  The problem is, in all this discussion, I don't hear anybody talking \nabout the American worker. What is the impact on the American worker?\n  I didn't know all of the economists just cited by my friend from \nPennsylvania. They are probably very distinguished economists, probably \nextraordinarily well-educated economists, probably economists whose \nnames I should know and, if so, I apologize.\n  Let me read this name, Paul Samuelson. I studied his textbook on \neconomics. I actually taught his textbook in college. Professor Paul \nSamuelson. If you didn't learn this in Economics 101, then you should \nhave failed. He says:\n\n       Let us underline this basic principle: An increase in the \n     labor supply will, other things being equal, tend to depress \n     wage rates.\n\n  That is exactly what has happened in this country. Now we say there \nare 11 to 12 million people who have come to this country illegally. I \nsaid earlier that I don't want to diminish the worth or dignity of \nanyone who is in this country legally or illegally. I am not interested \nin trying to diminish their worth or dignity. Somebody has been here 25 \nyears, didn't come legally 25 years ago, has a child here, or two, \nperhaps a grandchild, they worked here, paid taxes here, I am not \ninterested in rounding them up and moving them out of this country.\n  I understand some of the urges of people who have written some of \nthis legislation. What I don't understand is this: There is no \ndiscussion about its impact on the American worker when they say: Oh, \nby the way, let's solve all these issues and let's, on top of all of \nthis, add one more big arm that sticks out, and that is the so-called \nguest workers where we allow 3.8 million people in the next 6 years who \nare not here now, not working in America now, living outside of our \ncountry now, to come in and take American jobs.\n  What on Earth are we thinking? Can't there be some modicum of \ndiscussion about the effect on American workers?\n  I put this chart up earlier, and I will put it up again because this \ndiscussion relates exactly to a string of failures. I am told we are \nall complimenting the President for his speech last night. I don't \ncompliment the President for his trade strategy. We have the highest \ntrade deficit in the history of this country: every single day, 7 days \na week, $2 billion in trade deficit--every single day. That means \nAmericans jobs are going overseas. We are choking on debt.\n\n  What is the status of this trade? It is a green light for big \ncompanies to export jobs, and they are going wholesale, 3 to 4 million \njobs just in the last few years. They are leaving.\n  By the way, Alan Blinder, a mainstream economist, former Vice \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in his recent piece: I \nbelieve in ``Foreign Affairs,'' that there are now 42 to 54 million \nAmerican jobs that are potentially subject to being exported to other \nparts of the world because now we have 1 billion to 1.5 billion people \nin the rest of the world willing to work for pennies. So 42 to 54 \nmillion American jobs are subject to that kind of influence.\n  He says they won't all be exported, but even those who remain here \nwill see lower wages and downward pressure on wages and benefits, \nhealth care, and retirement. That is the future on that side. Exporting \ngood jobs.\n  The world is flat, we are told. The book shines from the bookstores, \n``The World is Flat.'' We look with rose-colored glasses at all the \nAmerican jobs now in Bangalore, now in Xinsheng, China. We say: Isn't \nthat something?\n  I will tell you what is something. Those jobs used to be here \nsupporting families. There is no social program this Senate works on \nthat is more important than a good job that pays benefits and allows \npeople to take care of their family. There is no social program as good \nas that.\n  We are talking about exporting good jobs, and exactly the same \ninfluence that resulted in this provision being put in this bill wants \nthere to be imported cheap labor through the back door. That is what \nthis guest worker provision is all about: importing cheap labor.\n  We are told the reason the 1986 law that was trumpeted 20 years ago, \nimmigration reform, sanctions against employers who hire illegal \nimmigrants didn't work is because there was no guest worker program. \nThat is unbelievable to me. That is not the case at all.\n  This proposition is to say: You know how we will stop illegal \nimmigration? We will just define them all as legal.\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\nAt least 325,000 plus 20 percent, that is 3.8 million in 6 years. We \nwill define them as legal. We won't have a problem, we will just change \nthe definition.\n  Let me show a couple of charts. These are people living in \nextraordinarily primitive conditions. They are undocumented workers. We \ncan see where they are bunking. They were brought in, by the way, by a \ncompany to help repair in the aftermath of Katrina, a Government \ncontract, mind you, with undocumented workers.\n  Let me tell you whose jobs they took. That contractor hired these \nfolks, and all the electricians, including one Sam Smith whose house \nwas completely destroyed in the Ninth Ward after Katrina slammed into \nthat coast. He returned to the city because of the promise of $22-an-\nhour wages for qualified, experienced, long-term electricians. He and \n75 people were guaranteed work for a year at that naval institution.\n  He was quickly disappointed. He lost his job within 3 weeks because \nthe other contracting company brought in undocumented workers who were \nunqualified and were willing to work for pennies.\n  I am the one who exposed this situation, and not long after I exposed \nit, there were inspectors who went on that base. I don't know the \nresult of it all. All I am telling you is this is going on all across \nthis country. This is a guy who lost his home and had a job and was \ndisplaced by someone coming through the back door willing to work for \npennies. It wasn't just that person, it was the employer who decided \nthey wanted to fatten their profits by hiring, in this case, illegals.\n  The way to solve that is not to say: Let's make them legal. The way \nto solve that is to say that job ought to go to Sam who lost his home, \nwho is a qualified electrician. He is the person who needed that job. \nYet contractors bring in these undocumented workers or, in this case, \nthey perhaps bring in workers under the so-called guest worker \nprovisions. Actually, they are not really guest workers, they are low-\nwage replacement workers. We should call them what they are.\n  We were told in the discussion earlier that we should accept this \nbecause we can't stop it. It is going to happen whether we like it or \nnot, so let's just declare them legal. I don't understand that at all.\n  I mentioned earlier that this planet we live on, to the extent we \nknow it, is the only place in the universe where we know life exists \nand we move around the Sun. On this planet of ours, we were blessed to \nbe born in this country, live in this country, or come to this country \nand be a part of this great place called the United States. We built a \nstandard of living unparalleled in the world. We did that through great \nsacrifice and through great debates. Now we are told none of that \nmatters very much because it is a flat world, it is a global economy; \nby the way, we can move jobs overseas, and we can bring cheap labor \nthrough the back door.\n  Just once--and I guess it won't happen this afternoon--just once I \nwould like to hear a real debate about jobs in this country, about \nAmerican workers and, yes, that includes Hispanic, African-American, \nAsian-American workers--our entire workforce. Just once I want to hear \na discussion about what this means to American workers. Yet almost none \nof that has been heard on the floor of the Senate any time during this \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have the opportunity to serve on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. We had one hearing that dealt with these issues and dealt \nwith some of the issues the Senator has been talking about \nspecifically. Professor Richard Freeman--and these were pretty pro-\nimmigration panels, but I think they all agree with Senator Dorgan--\nRichard Freeman holds the Herbert Asherman Chair, professor of \neconomics at Harvard University. This was his quote just a few weeks \nago at a hearing:\n\n       One of the concerns when immigrants come in that way, they \n     may take some jobs from some Americans and drive down the \n     wages of some Americans and, obviously, if there is a large \n     number of immigrants coming in and if they are coming in at a \n     bad economic time, that's likely to happen.\n\n  Is that consistent with the Senator's views and that of Professor \nSamuelson?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case, although this is Professor \nFreeman. I have never known an economist to lose his or her job to a \nbad trade agreement. They sit around thumbing their suspenders. They \noccasionally smoke a pipe, wear their little corduroy coat with their \nleather arm pads. They pontificate about these issues. The fact is, \nhalf of them can't remember their telephone numbers, and they are \ntelling us what is going to happen 5 years in the future.\n  I understand, and I think most people understand, what is happening \nin this country today. What is happening today is the export of good \njobs and the import of cheap labor and depressing the conditions of \nemployment in America. That is what is happening, and nobody seems to \ncare very much.\n  The inequality grows. The wealthy get wealthier, the people at the \nbottom are stuck--they haven't had an increase in the minimum wage in 9 \nyears, mind you, so they are stuck and they are losing ground.\n  The question is, Who is going to stand for them and speak for them?\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator has 10 minutes 15 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I mentioned earlier--and I think it fits \nexactly with the debate--the export of jobs and import of cheap labor. \nI mentioned about the dancing grapes. All of us have seen when Fruit of \nthe Loom advertises their underwear, they do it with people called \ndancing grapes. Somebody is dressed in red grapes and somebody else is \ndressed in green grapes. We have all seen them. What kind of adult \nwould wear a grape suit and sing? Nonetheless, we are all entertained \nby dancing grapes.\n  The dancing grapes represent Fruit of the Loom underwear, T-shirts, \nshorts, so on. They were made in this country, just as Levis and other \nproducts were made in this country. The dancing grapes danced right out \nof our country. All those jobs to make those underwear, gone. This \ncountry doesn't make one pair of Levis anymore. Not one pair of Levis \nis made in the United States.\n  Anyway, the dancing grapes leave our country, and those jobs are \nelsewhere. Why are they gone from this country? Because they went in \nsearch of cheap labor.\n  So to the extent that companies can move these jobs out of this \ncountry to find cheap labor, they will. They still want to sell back \ninto this country. They still need the American consumer, the American \nconsumer who has just lost his or her job. One question is, then, where \nis the income going to come from?\n  In any event, even as they move these jobs out of this country, there \nare some that will remain in this country. In this new global economy, \nthere are some jobs you can't move. And some of the same economic \ninterests that want to move the jobs they can want to displace the jobs \nthey can't with cheap labor.\n  How do they do that with cheap labor? What they do is they attract \npeople to come into this country from areas around the world--and one-\nhalf of the people in this world live on less than $2 a day--they \nattract people to come in the back door. At the moment, it is illegal, \nso we gather on the floor of the Senate to talk about illegal \nimmigration. What is one of the approaches to solve this? Let's just \nget a stamp and stamp it legal. That way we can say we don't have \nillegal immigration. So it appears to me what we are going to have is \nup to 3.8 million people in the next 6 years, who will come into this \ncountry and take American jobs, who otherwise would be declared \nillegal. By the way, that is on top of the 11 million or 12 million \npeople the underlying bill will describe as legal. They say we are \ngoing to allow them to come in, take American jobs, but they will not \nbe illegal because we have decided in the Senate we are going to put a \ndifferent stamp there. It is going to be fine.\n  So nobody on the Senate floor is standing up and saying: What about \nthe tradeoff here of an American family? We hear a lot about other \nfamilies. One of my colleagues just described\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\neconomic immigrants. Man, the world is full of them. If the world has \none-half of its population making less than $2 a day, are there \neconomic immigrants willing to come from many corners of this globe to \nthis country? The answer is, of course. But we have immigration laws \nand quotas because if we were flooded with tens and tens of millions of \npeople searching for opportunities in our country, we would diminish \nopportunities for Americans who live here and work here and built this \ncountry. So that is why we have immigration quotas.\n  One final point, if I might, on this issue of employer sanctions. \nThat is a matter of will. You know there are no employer sanctions. The \nlaw says there are employer sanctions. Last year, I am told--I need to \ncheck this for sure, but I am told that there was one enforcement \neffort against one employer that hired illegal immigrants. The year \nbefore, there were three in the entire United States--three. That is a \nmatter of lack of will. That is a matter of looking the other way when \nbusinesses want to hire cheap labor through the back door. Only when \nthey are pressed will authorities finally go down and take a look at \nthe folks living in these conditions who have taken jobs of people who \nlost their homes in Hurricane Katrina. Only when they are forced will \nsomeone show up, knock on the door, and say: You know something, this \nisn't legal.\n  This is a very important debate. In some ways, I regret that we have \nas short a time as we do. I probably should not have agreed to a time \nagreement, there is so much to say about it. Yet we will have a vote \nthis afternoon.\n  My colleagues have spoken here with great authority. We all come here \nand wear white shirts and dark suits and all sound authoritative. Some \nare right, and some are wrong. It is hard to tell the difference. So we \nwill have a vote on this. At the end of this vote, I suppose this will \nmove right ahead because we are told, if this vote prevails, if my \namendment prevails, as I said earlier, it is like pulling a loose \nthread on a cheap suit--the whole arm falls off and the whole suit is \nworthless. I don't understand why they construct legislation that way, \nbut every time somebody brings a proposal to the floor of the Senate \nwhich is the result of negotiations, they say you can't interrupt \nanything because, after all, when we shut the door and negotiated this, \nwe all did that in good faith, so don't be messing with our product. If \nyou pull one piece of it out, you ruin what we have done. I have heard \nthat a million times on the floor of the Senate.\n  I think the Senate ought to just mess with this piece and say to \nthose folks who constructed it, with respect: You are wrong about this. \nThis piece is the price for the Chamber of Commerce to support this \nlegislation. This piece is the price for the Chamber of Commerce to \nsay: Allow us to bring 3.8 million people through the back door, cheap \nlabor, and we will support the legislation, the substantial immigration \nreform.\n  I just happen to disagree with that. I happen to stand here in \nsupport of and concerned about--immigrant families, yes, but in support \nespecially of American workers, in support of workers who do not seem \nto have much of a voice on the floor of this Senate.\n\n  The next trade bill that comes up, once again we will see their jobs \nfurther traded overseas. It is bizarre. There is no minimum wage \nincrease for 9 years. Every trade agreement that comes along is pulling \nthe rug out from under American workers, God bless them. See you, so \nlong.\n  That is the way it goes around here. Maybe we ought to call this what \nit is. Maybe we ought to stop at this. Maybe the stop sign on behalf of \nAmerican workers ought to be to say it is time for this Senate to stand \nup for American jobs. After all, this country's middle class, which we \nbuilt over the last couple of centuries, especially the last century, \nthat middle class is what supported the highest standard of living in \nthe world. But that standard of living will not long exist if we export \ngood jobs to low wage countries and then import cheap labor to perform \nthose subpar-wage duties here in this country. That is not, in my \njudgment, what works for our country's best economic future.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator, I believe, wanted to ask if I \nwould yield for a question. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would, briefly. I think it sort of confirms what you \nare saying. We had a subcommittee hearing on this, and the second \nprofessor, Dr. Barry Chiswick, the head and research professor at the \nDepartment of Economics at the University of Illinois in Chicago, said:\n\n       [T]here is a competition in the labor market. And the large \n     increase in low-skilled immigration that we've seen over the \n     last 20 years has had a substantial negative effect on the \n     employment and earning opportunities of low-skilled \n     Americans. . . . [The] large increase in low-skilled \n     immigration has had the effect of decreasing the wages and \n     employment opportunities of low-skilled workers who are \n     currently resident in the United States.\n\n  Does that comport with the theme of the remarks of the Senator?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. It seems to me this is \nnot at issue, the question of what this means to American workers. It \njust is not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Here is Professor Harry Holzer at the same committee \nhearing, three out of five witnesses, most of them pro-immigration \nwitnesses. He is an associate dean and professor of public policy at \nGeorgetown. He says:\n\n       Now, absent the immigrants, employers might need to raise \n     those wages and improve those conditions of work to entice \n     native born workers into those [construction, agriculture, \n     janitorial, food preparation . . . ] jobs.\n       I believe when immigrants are illegal they do more to \n     undercut the level of wages of native born workers.\n\n  So I think he also would agree with the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say that this economic strategy \nisn't working. This doesn't work. Fig Newton cookies moved to Mexico, \nand the Chinese just bought WHAM-O, Hula Hoop, Slip `N Slide, and \nFrisbee. To the extent this bill will make illegal workers come in \nstamped as legal, we know they are not going to make Fig Newtons and \nFrisbees because those jobs are gone, but we know there is a reason for \na guest worker provision, and the reason is there are interests that \nsupport this bill only on the condition that they continue to allow low \nwage workers to come in the back door even as major American \ncorporations are exporting good American jobs out the front door. I \nthink that is a construct that 5, 10, and 20 years from now is \ndangerous to this country and restricts opportunity rather than expands \nit for the American people.\n  I do not support this provision. I hope my colleagues will support my \namendment and strike this guest worker, future flow, or low wage \nreplacement worker provision, as I call it, in the underlying piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will yield back. Is all time consumed \nby Senator Dorgan?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield my time. I move to table the Dorgan amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on Agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nthe chairman, for yielding to me.\n  I ask consent to bring up Senate amendment 3981.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 3981.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the number of H-2C nonimmigrants to 200,000 during \n                            any fiscal year)\n\n       Beginning on page 292, strike line 18 and all that follows \n     through page 295, line 4, and insert the following:\n       (g) Numerical Limitations.--Section 214(g)(1) (8 U.S.C. \n     1184(g)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(c) may not exceed \n     200,000.''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as we all know, the immigration bill \ncreates a new temporary guest worker program aimed at providing an \nequal and orderly process for individuals to come to this country and \nto work in sectors of our economy where there is a shortage of \navailable workers.\n  We had good debate in connection with the Dorgan amendment with \nregard to that guest worker program. Everyone who listened to that \ndebate understands this is a new program which is being added to our \nimmigration laws, one which is not available today for anyone to use.\n  Specifically, the bill pending before the Senate allocates 325,000 \ntemporary visas for the first fiscal year, and in each subsequent year \nthe numerical limit is flexible.\n  If the cap is reached--that is, the full 325,000--the number of \navailable visas would increase. It could increase by 10 percent, it \ncould increase by 15 percent, it could increase by 20 percent in the \nnext fiscal year, depending upon how quickly those visas were used or \ntaken.\n  In essence, what the bill provides--the bill pending before us--is \nfor an open-ended automatic-increase mechanism that has the potential \nto significantly increase the number of visas we are making available. \nWhen I say an automatic-increase mechanism, we have all heard about \ncompound interest. Everyone who has a checking account knows the power \nof compounding interest. What we have here is not compounding interest, \nit is compounding immigration, because the 20-percent increase over the \nprevious year's level continues indefinitely into the future. You start \nwith 325,000, plus 20 percent; then you take the new figure, plus 20 \npercent; then you take the new figure, plus 20 percent; and it goes on \nand on.\n  My amendment, which Senator Feinstein is cosponsoring, would simply \nput in place, instead of that, a hard cap of 200,000 on the number of \nvisas available each year under this program. Of course, in addition to \nthis program, we all understand there are many other programs that \npeople can use to gain legal access into our country.\n  Let me show a chart. This chart: guest worker visas issued under S. \n2611. Now, the olive-colored wedge down at the bottom represents the \nnumber of visas that would be issued over the next 6 years under my \namendment. That is 200,000 per year, each year, for 6 years, or a total \nof 1.2 million visas under the guest worker program.\n  If the Senate were to defeat the amendment I am offering and just go \nwith the bill as it currently pends before the Senate, then it could \ntake any of a number of courses. If there is a 10-percent increase, \nbecause of the speed with which people apply for these visas, it would \ngo up to 2.725 million visas by the end of 6 years. If it is a 15-\npercent increase, it gets you to 3.222 million visas by the end of 6 \nyears. And if, in fact, there are enough applicants for these visas to \nget you a full 20-percent increase, then you get to 3.8 million \nimmigrant visas issued over this 6 years.\n  Now, why did I stop this chart at 6 years? The truth is, this \nlegislation has no sunset. This legislation continues indefinitely \nuntil Congress changes the law again. So this chart could just as \neasily have been for 10 years or 15 years or 20 years. And if you \nreally want to see the power of compound immigration, just like the \npower of compound interest, we should have developed a chart that takes \nus out 10 or 15 or 20 years. So the chart exemplifies how the number of \nguest workers may increase over this 6-year period under these \ndifferent scenarios. The chart could have been made for a longer \nperiod.\n  If the 325,000-person cap is reached within the first 3 months of the \nfiscal year, we will have added almost 4 million guest workers over \nthis 6-year period. If the cap is reached in the second quarter of the \nfiscal year, we will have added just over 3 million. And if the cap is \nhit in the third quarter of the year, we will have added a little under \n3 million workers under this particular program.\n  In addition, it is important to note that although these visas are \nissued only for up to 6 years, these workers have the right to petition \nto become legal permanent residents within 1 year if the employer files \nfor them or within 4 years if they self-petition.\n  Frankly, I believe we need to be a little more judicious with respect \nto the number of visas we are allocating under this program. This is a \nbrandnew program. Under my amendment, which sets the numerical limit \nfor such visas at 200,000, there would be no more than 1.2 million \nguest workers admitted over these first 6 years.\n  We need to recognize that guest worker programs, if they are not \nproperly implemented, can impact on American workers. Senator Dorgan \nmade the case, I believe very eloquently, that many economists have\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\nspoken about the downward pressure on wages that results when you \nincrease the labor supply. We need to recognize that our success with \nregard to the temporary worker program we have now, such as with regard \nto agricultural workers, has been mixed. We should not make a mistake \nhere by erring on the side of extravagance in allocating these visas or \nauthorizing the issuance of these visas until we know how this program \nis going to impact American workers.\n  I did not vote for Senator Dorgan's amendment to eliminate the guest \nworker program, but I do believe we need to be judicious about the \nextent of the guest worker program that we authorize. We definitely \nshould not be signing on to some kind of automatic compounding of the \nnumber of workers eligible for legal entry into this country under that \nprogram. There are a variety of jobs that may be filled by these guest \nworkers--from construction jobs to hotel service jobs--but we should \nnot be placing American workers in these sectors of our economy in the \nposition of competing with virtually an unlimited number of guest \nworkers, which is what I fear we are putting in the law if we leave the \nlaw the way it now pends in this pending legislation.\n\n  The underlying bill does create a temporary guest worker task force. \nThis task force is charged with assessing the impact of the guest \nworker program on wages and on labor conditions and the employment of \nAmerican workers and with then making recommendations about whether the \nnumerical cap should be lowered or raised. But then you go on with the \nlegislation, and the increase mechanism is not in any way tied to the \nrecommendations of the task force. The overall number of visas could \nsignificantly increase automatically, regardless of whether the program \nis determined, by this temporary guest worker task force, to be hurting \nAmerican workers.\n  So if Congress wants to raise the caps, we have the authority to do \nthat every year. We meet here every year. We can raise the cap. But we \nshould not provide for an automatic increase in the number of temporary \nvisas irrespective of how that increase is affecting American workers.\n  Just to be clear, reducing the number of guest worker visas to \n200,000 a year is not a drastic measure that undercuts the bill's goal \nof providing a more realistic framework for immigrants to legally come \ninto this country. According to the Congressional Research Service, \nunder this overall bill, we will at least be doubling--here is a chart \nthat shows what is going to happen to the projections for employment-\nbased legal permanent residents coming into this country under this \nlegislation. We will at least be doubling the flow of legal permanent \nimmigration under the bill in the first year. We increase family- and \nemployment-based numerical limits, and we exempt categories of \nindividuals from these caps.\n  Overall, the bill does provide for many legal avenues for individuals \nto legally come into the United States and to work. For example, as \nthis chart shows--this is a chart based on the Congressional Research \nService report--we are significantly increasing the number of \nemployment-based legal permanent residents under the bill.\n  I strongly believe the amendment I am offering with Senator Feinstein \nis a reasonable approach. It ensures that an unlimited number of guest \nworkers are not admitted under this program. I hope my colleagues will \nagree with me that this is a good change. This amendment would improve \nthe legislation, would allow us to maintain a guest worker program, \nwhich the President has strongly endorsed maintaining, but would \nimprove the program by limiting it to a level we can understand and \nmanage in these first few years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that it be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Seventeen and a half?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I think one of the things we really need to understand about \nthis bill is that it is a very large bill. It is 640 pages long. It \ncontains a multitude of programs. And it--through the visa programs, \nthe nonimmigrant visas--brings in large numbers of people.\n  I think when we were in Judiciary we did not realize the extent to \nwhich large numbers of people are brought in on some of these visas. We \nwere working to a march. We had to get the bill done. And it is my \nunderstanding that studies of the bill now on the floor have shown that \nthis bill could allow up to 193 million new legal immigrants. That is a \nnumber greater than 60 percent of the current U.S. population in the \nnext 20 years. Now, that is a way-out figure--20 years--but I think we \nhave to begin to look at each of the visa increases over at least the \nnext 10-year period to determine how many people would come in, \nparticularly the guest worker program.\n  I am happy to cosponsor this amendment with Senator Bingaman. The \namendment does two things: it lowers the annual numerical cap from \n325,000 of H-2C guest worker visas--and there are a myriad of guest \nworker visas, but this one is H-2C--to 200,000, and it eliminates the \nannual escalator.\n  In my view, all annual escalators in this bill should be eliminated \nbecause they bring in too many people over a relatively short period of \ntime. This bill has the potential, as I said, to bring in millions of \nguest workers over the years. This means that over 6 years--the length \nof an alien's stay in the United States in this one temporary visa \ncategory--there could be 1.2 million workers in the United States.\n  Under the current proposal, let's say you start at 325,000 guest \nworkers in the first year, and you add the 10-percent escalator. The \n10-percent escalator would yield, over 6 years, 2.7 million people. The \n15-percent escalator would take it to, over 6 years, 3.2 million \npeople. And if you had the 20-percent escalator, it would take it up \nto, over 6 years, 3,807,000 people. It is simply too many. So the \ncurrent bill doubles and even triples the number of foreign guest \nworkers who could enter the United States over the 6 years of our \namendment.\n  I hope this amendment will pass. I would hope that we could eliminate \nthe escalators in these visa programs. The H-1B visa escalator would \nhave a total of 3.67 million people over the next 10 years coming in \nunder an H-1B visa. We increase the H-1B from 56,000 to 115,000, and \nthen we put in a 20-percent escalator each year. If the number of visas \nreached the 115,000--and it will--therefore, the next year you add 20 \npercent. Then if that is reached, you add another 20 percent. And it \ncompounds in this manner to the tune of a total of 3.6 million.\n  I am very concerned about this. I hope the Bingaman amendment will be \nsuccessful. Again, it does two things. It reduces the base amount from \n325,000 to 200,000, and it eliminates the escalator. Two hundred \nthousand guest workers a year are ample because this is just one part \nof the bill. There are other visa programs. There is AgJOBS. There is \nearned adjustment. It all adds up to millions and millions of people.\n  I strongly support the Bingaman amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nvote yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. First, I thank the Senator from California for her \nstrong support for my amendment. Particularly because of her role in \nthe development of the legislation in the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\nCommittee, she pointed out very well the reasons this amendment is \nmeritorious. I hope people, even some Members on the Judiciary \nCommittee with Senator Feinstein, will look at this favorably and \nconsider it an improvement to the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Alexander from Tennessee be \nadded as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I know we have one other Senator who has indicated a \ndesire to speak in favor of the amendment. Let me point out to my \ncolleagues that both myself and Senator Alexander are Members who voted \nagainst the Dorgan amendment that was just tabled. I cannot speak for \nSenator Alexander, but from my perspective, I am persuaded that there \nis value in having a viable guest worker program. I support that part \nof the legislation. My concern is with the magnitude of it, \nparticularly since it is a new program.\n  For us to start it at 325,000 per year and then have an automatic \nescalator in the law and have no sunset on it at all, so that we all \nunderstand that this is permanent law, unless Congress comes back and \nchanges the law 10 years from now, we will still be taking the previous \nyear's total and be able to increase it by 20 percent. That gets to a \npoint where American workers are going to have a very legitimate \ncomplaint. I favor allowing an opportunity for people to come here and \ntake jobs that Americans don't want. But I do not favor allowing people \nto come here to bid down the price of labor to such a point that \nAmericans are unwilling to take jobs for the very meager salaries that \nemployers are able to pay.\n  It is a straightforward amendment. I hope my colleagues will support \nit. I know we do have one more speaker. I believe the Senator from \nCalifornia would like 2 minutes. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. As \nanyone watching the debate saw, I was in support of what Senator Dorgan \nwas trying to do which was to strip the guest worker program from this \nbill, a bill that has a lot of good to it. I do support strengthening \nthe border, and I do support giving 11 or 12 million hard-working \npeople who have paid their dues, who will come forward and learn \nEnglish and who will pay the fines, who have a clean record, a path to \nlegality. I strongly support that, and I strongly support the AgJOBS \nprovision of this bill. But I predict that this guest worker program, \nwhich the Senate has now ratified, is going to come back to haunt \npeople because, as Senator Bingaman has shown us, the way this bill is \nstructured, the workers will grow exponentially in this guest worker \nprogram to the point where, according to some estimates, we are talking \nabout tens of millions of guest workers over the next 20 years.\n  What Senator Bingaman is trying to do is to put a cap on this, a real \ncap, not the phony cap that is in the bill that says it will escalate \nup to 20 percent every year. You figure out the math. It is kind of \namazing.\n  What Senator Bingaman is doing is making this a better bill. I \nstrongly support the cap he is proposing. I thank him for the \nopportunity to speak on behalf of his amendment. As usual, he has \nbrought commonsense to the Senate. I hope the Senate will strongly \nsupport the Bingaman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is always difficult to make a \ndetermination as to what is the right figure. The committee came to the \nfigure of 325,000, after a great deal of analysis and thought. It is \nthe result of a compromise that was worked out, with some figures being \nsubstantially higher than that, some lower. But that is the figure the \ncommittee came to. The amendment offered by Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Feinstein would also eliminate the fluctuation which is to \nallow for a 20-percent increase if we hit the top. What we are trying \nto do in this legislation is to accommodate the market, if there is \ndemand for these guest workers. So the fluctuating cap is perhaps even \nmore important than the difference between 325,000 and 200,000.\n  When we considered the Dorgan amendment, we were debating the issue \nas to the way the guest worker program fits into overall comprehensive \nreform so that if we were able to accommodate the needs of the American \neconomy with these guest workers, then we fill the jobs. They are not \nopen. We do not create a vacuum on jobs so that immigrants who are in \nthis country illegally would be available to take the jobs. This is a \nregulatory approach which accommodates for the needs of the economy and \nis the figure that we best calculate to accommodate them. I think if we \nhad come in at 200,000, we would be looking at an amendment for 125,000 \nor at some other figure. There is an obvious give and take as to \nwhatever figure we have. Somebody has a different figure to make it \nlower.\n  I have great respect for those who say we ought to protect American \njobs and that we ought not to have guest workers who are going to take \nthose jobs or lower the compensation for the people who hold American \njobs. We put into the Record on the Dorgan amendment testimony from \nthree expert witnesses. I will not repeat it and put it into the Record \nagain. But the essential conclusion was that there would be minimal \nimpact on taking American jobs and minimal impact on compensation.\n\n  The statute is carefully constructed to protect American workers, \ntaking away any incentives for employers to hire foreign workers. For \nexample, the employees must be paid the higher of what is the actual \nwage paid to other employees with the same skill or the prevailing wage \nrate for that job. So the law requires the employer to pay the \nimmigrants the same as they would pay somebody else. And the employers \nmust provide the same working conditions and benefits that are \navailable for similar jobs. You don't have a class of immigrant workers \nwho are being taken advantage of. The employers must provide insurance \nif the State workers compensation doesn't cover all of these workers. \nSo you have a situation where there are no incentives to lose American \njobs. We think this figure is a fair figure and a realistic figure \narrived at by the committee after very long deliberation and after a \ncompromise. We think this figure should stay.\n  In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I would \ninquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes remaining, and the \nSenator from New Mexico has 7 minutes. Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. May I ask my colleague, is it his intent that I should \nclose my argument now and then we would have a vote?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that concise \nanswer.\n  Let me say that I have great respect for the chairman and his efforts \nto put together a bill that he believes makes sense. As he says, it \naccommodates the market. That is an interesting concept, accommodating \nthe market. The amendment I am offering, along with Senator Feinstein \nand Senator Alexander, is an amendment that would say that we need to \ngo at this in a prudent fashion and limit the number of people who are \ngoing to be able to come into the country and apply through this new \nprogram that we are defining for the first time in law as part of this \nbill.\n  Some of the arguments I have heard in favor of the guest worker \nprogram relate to the workers themselves, the workers who are trying to \nget into this country to make a better life for themselves. I have \nempathy for those workers as well. But, quite frankly, there is a \nvirtually unlimited supply of people who would like to come here and \nwork and improve their life by doing so. We need to make judgments \nabout how large a group we are going to allow in each year. That is why \nI am proposing the amendment.\n  As far as employers are concerned, there are a lot of employers who, \ngiven the option of signing a contract to bring in workers from another \ncountry who they know will be in many respects less likely to complain \nabout working conditions, less likely to raise\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\nany concerns about their employment situation, would find that \nattractive. And accordingly, you could see a great demand by some \nemployers to go ahead and meet their employment needs through this \ndevice.\n  As I said before, I favor a guest worker program. It makes sense to \nhave a guest worker program.\n  But I think it also makes sense for us to do it in a more reasonable \nway than the bill currently calls for and not to build in some kind of \nautomatic escalator that will occur regardless of what we determine the \nimpact is going to be on American workers. I think we can come back and \nraise the cap again if we decide in 2 years or 5 years, or whatever, \nthat we want to do that. But we should not build into this legislation \nan automatic escalator that will make it extremely likely that the \nnumber of workers will substantially increase in coming years by virtue \nof this legal provision that we put in the law.\n  Mr. President, I urge the support of my amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will see this as a way to improve the legislation rather \nthan an undermining provision of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays. I put my colleagues on notice that this is going to \nbe a strict 20-minute vote because we have Members who have planes to \ncatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back? All time is yield \nback. Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we have been engaged in extensive \ndiscussions to try to move the schedule along.

He says he will try not to use all of it.\n  Tomorrow morning we will go to Kyl-Cornyn, and since people are still \nlooking at it, we do not have a time agreement. Senator Kennedy says he \nwill make a good-faith effort to limit debate to 30 minutes tomorrow.\n  Then we will go to the amendment of Senator Obama, and once we have \nhad a chance to analyze it, we will see if we can accept it. Then we \nwill go to Senator Sessions. The majority leader has authorized me to \nsay that there will be no further votes tonight.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I ask the chairman to yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. It is my understanding that following Senator Kerry this \nevening we will lay down the Kyl-Cornyn-Graham-Allen-McCain-Frist-\nBrownback-Martinez amendment so all can see what it is and we can start \nsome debate this evening and then finish the debate tomorrow. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct.\n  I now yield to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBingaman be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, obviously this is an issue that has touched \na lot of nerves all across the country. We all understand the \nvolatility and the tension within in it. We have an enormous task to \ntry to find a fair, orderly, humane, and secure process for protecting \nour border. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Last night, President Bush spoke to the Nation about the challenge we \nface. I have strong reservations about some of the President's \nimmigration proposals. But I believe on balance the President gave a \nthoughtful and compelling address that laid out why we have to act \nurgently. I think he particularly talked about the importance of acting \ncomprehensively in solving the immigration puzzle.\n  I say to my colleagues, I think most of us have found as we have been \nwrestling with this issue, it is like a balloon. If you push in one \nplace, it expands in another place, so you have to come at it in a \ncomprehensive way. Each component of this reform is dependent on the \nother component in order to make the overall reform successful. We are \nnot going to be successful if we don't create an effective employer \nverification system because workers will find a way to keep coming if \nwe don't. By the same token, securing the border doesn't address the 11 \nmillion undocumented workers currently in the country.\n  We need the President's leadership so that this bill or this approach \ndoes not turn into one of those unfunded mandates or neglected \nopportunities like No Child Left Behind or even the Medicare \nprescription drug law.\n  Last night, the President announced his intention to dispatch 6,000 \nNational Guard troops to the southern border. All of us agree we need \nto strengthen the southern border. But I disagree with President Bush \nabout how we ought to get there and how fast we can get there. Yes, we \nneed more strength and more personnel at the border. We need better \nenforcement of our immigration laws. But, particularly in a post-9/11 \nworld, when you look at the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, we \nneed to do a better job of preventing the flood of immigrants who are \ncrossing the borders every day.\n  But the bottom line is, what you need to do that job is not a \nmakeshift force of already overextended National Guardsmen to \nmilitarize the border but rather specialized agents who are trained to \ndo the police work, to track down individuals who make an illegal \ncrossing, and to ensure that the borders are not easy avenues for those \ncrossings.\n  I remind my colleagues that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when \nour cities and our communities were facing a crime epidemic, we didn't \nsend the National Guard in to do the job. We hired more police officers \nand invested in community policing. The COPS Program put 100,000 \nskilled and trained law enforcement officers on the streets of the \ncommunities of our country and crime dropped.\n  After 9/11, the mission of the Border Patrol changed. No longer are \nthey charged with simply securing the border. They are now patrolling \none of the greatest vulnerabilities in the war on terror. As their \nmission changed, their numbers increased, but they have never increased \nenough to do the job.\n  Each year for the past 10 years between 700,000 and 800,000 illegal \nimmigrants arrived in this country. Despite more than doubling the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents between 1995 and 2005, Federal \nenforcement of our immigration laws has decreased significantly. The \nnumber of border apprehensions has declined by 31 percent, from an \naverage of 1.5 million apprehensions a year between 1996 and 2000, to \nan average of 1.05 million between 2001 and 2004.\n  At the same time, the number of illegal immigrants apprehended within \nthe interior of the country has plummeted by 36 percent, from an \naverage of 40,193 between 1996 and 2000, to an average of 25,901 \nbetween 2001 and 2004.\n  As much as the strength of the Border Patrol has grown in the last \nyears, actual performance demonstrates that we have to close a gap by \nalmost twice or three times as much. The current Border Patrol agents \nprotect more than 8,000 miles of international border and they detect \nand prevent smuggling, unlawful entry, undocumented immigrants, they \napprehend persons violating the immigration laws, and they interdict \ncontraband such as narcotics. They work under difficult circumstances \nfor long periods and in all kinds of weather.\n  Currently, we have fewer than 12,000 Border Patrol agents. Those \nagents are responsible for patrolling 8,000 miles of land and seacoast, \nand because of the need to provide continuous coverage, no more than 25 \npercent of those agents are securing our borders at any given moment. \nThat means there are only 4,000 agents patrolling 8,000 miles of land \nand our borders. So, if instead of spreading them out as we do today \nyou put them all along the border, with just Texas alone, you would \nthen have roughly two Border Patrol agents per mile. It is physically \nimpossible to protect the borders of the United States under those \ncircumstances.\n  There are additional numbers put into this legislation, but I have \nheard\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nthat, in fact, by joining the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center \ntogether with the National Training Center in Artesia, NM, which has \nrecently increased its training capacity, we could do more. It is not \nrocket science, it is about capacity. If you don't have the capacity, \nthen you build the capacity to meet the demand.\n  If we have the will to make this happen, we can make it happen.\n  So we already know this is a stopgap measure with the military to \ncover up what is already a failed immigration policy and a failed \nborder policy. The\n9/11 Commission warned us, several years ago now, that we needed to \nhave additional personnel. Those calls have never been heeded. We need \nto heed them now. My amendment will increase the number by an \nadditional 1,000 this year and that will be above the increase of 2,000 \nagents contained in the underlying bill.\n  Frankly, I think we ought to be trying to do more than that, but that \nis the reasonable level that we seem to be able to accept and also \ntrain at the same time under the current circumstances.\n  In addition, my amendment would give border State Governors the \nability to request up to 1,000 more Border Patrol agents in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security in times of international border \nemergencies. In deciding whether to grant the Governor's request, the \nSecretary would have to consider the effect any shuffling of Border \nPatrol agents would have on overall border security.\n  Last year, a survey by Peter D. Hart found that just 34 percent of \nthe front-line Border Patrol agents said they were satisfied with the \n``tools, training, and support'' they received to protect our borders. \nThat should be 100 percent. What we need to do is guarantee that we \ntake the steps in order to make it so.\n  In addition, my amendment increases the number of helicopters and \npower boats available for Border Patrol, and it provides Border Patrol \nagents with the training they need to use those tools. We guarantee a \nratio of one patrol vehicle for every three agents and ensure that each \nof those vehicles is equipped with a portable computer. That also \nprovides every agent with clear and encrypted two-way radios, night \nvision equipment, GPS devices, high-quality body armor, and reliable \nand effective weapons. It makes each and every agent certain that they \nhave the necessary equipment and uniforms for the kind of climate in \nwhich they are working.\n  I am glad that the Senator from Pennsylvania is prepared to accept \nthis amendment. I thank my colleagues for their support of it.\n  As I said, if we don't have a sufficient training capacity, it is \nclear that the expertise needed is real. I heard of Border Patrol \nagents who have had to go through survival training and different kinds \nof training that is highly specialized. These individuals are engaged \nin law enforcement and police work. I think everybody in this country \nwould like to see our National Guard, which is already stretched thin, \nminimally involved to the degree possible. The best way to do that is \nto get more Border Patrol agents trained faster.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think it is a good amendment to \nincrease the number of Border Patrol agents. We accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3999) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now yield to Senator Kyl for the Kyl-\nCornyn amendment. I ask unanimous consent that it be the first \namendment pending tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me briefly explain this amendment. It is \na somewhat different version from what was introduced a couple of weeks \nago and was pending at the time this legislation was laid aside for \nother business.\n  This amendment has the primary purpose of ensuring that people who \nhave committed serious crimes or have absconded after on order for \ntheir removal has been issued would not be entitled to the benefits of \nthe legislation.\n  Specifically, in the bill as written, there were certain crimes which \nwere included, and if you had committed one of those crimes, you \ncouldn't participate in the program--certain crimes of moral turpitude, \nfor example.\n  What we found was that list was not all-inclusive and there were \nother serious crimes, including felonies, that were not included and \ntherefore we felt should be added so that nobody who had committed a \nserious crime would be able to participate in the program.\n  Among the crimes that courts have said did not involve moral \nturpitude and therefore needed to be included in this legislation are \nthe following: alien smuggling, conspiracy to commit offenses against \nthe United States, simple assault and battery, involuntary \nmanslaughter, simple kidnapping, weapons possession--for example, one \nof the cases dealt with possession of a sawed-off shot gun--burglary, \nmoney laundering, and there are others as well.\n  The point is, we want to be sure this legislation denies the benefits \nof legal status, including potential citizenship, to anyone who has \ncommitted a serious crime of this type. Therefore, the statute provides \nthat if you have been convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors or \nhave been convicted of a serious crime or there are reasonable grounds \nto believe the alien has committed a serious crime outside of the \nUnited States prior to arrival, and there are reasonable grounds for \nregarding the alien as a danger to the security of the United States, \nthen in those events the individual would not be able to participate in \nthe benefits of the law.\n  In addition to that, there are several categories of individuals who \nfor various reasons have been ordered removed from the United States \nand have adjudicated their case and a final order of removal has been \nissued, either by an immigration judge or another judge or immigration \nofficial. Here, too, given the fact that we want the benefits of this \nlegislation to apply to people who are willing to comply with the law, \neven where there has been a court adjudication of this statute, if they \ndo not like the results and decide they are not going to leave even \nthough the judge ordered them to leave, then we should not allow the \nbenefits of this legislation to apply to them.\n  One of the things which is inherent in most of the bills--I think in \nall of the bills, including the bill that is on the floor--is the \nconcept that you are not permitted to be in the United States unless \ncertain things happen. If you commit a crime, for example, then you \ncan't stay here. That relies to some extent on the individual complying \nwith the court order to leave.\n  This part of the amendment says that when you have been ordered to \nleave by a judge, you have to do that. If you have demonstrated that \nyou are not willing to do that, then you shouldn't be able to \nparticipate in the benefits of this law.\n  One of the things we have done--and as a result, there have been \nseveral cosponsors added to the legislation--is provided some \nopportunities to have this provision waived if people can make certain \narguments. For example, if an individual who has been ordered to be \nremoved can demonstrate they did not receive notice of removal \nproceedings, under that condition, this provision could be waived.\n  In addition, the alien could argue that his failure to appear and be \nremoved was due to exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the \nalien or that the alien's departure from the United States would result \nin extreme hardship to the alien's spouse, parent, or child who is a \ncitizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for \npermanent residence.\n  There is one other factor that has been added relative to coming into \nthis country based upon fraudulent documents. In those situations, the \nalien could argue that there was a reason this provision should be \nwaived and the alien should still be permitted to participate in the \nbenefits of the legislation.\n  We think we have drafted something that is fair, that ensures that \npeople who should not be citizens of the United States or granted other \nlegal status under the bill will not be granted the status, but that if \nthere is some reason they can argue that there should be an exception, \nthey will have every right to do so. In that sense, we think this is a \nfirm but fair provision.\n  I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and colleagues \nwho support the underlying legislation would consider this not an \nunfriendly amendment but an amendment that is truly designed to ensure \nthat a key principle is upheld. The principle is already built into the \nunderlying bill in one respect. The object of this amendment is to make \nsure it is complete and covers all of the kinds of crimes one might \nwant to cover. As a result, we would hope this would receive an \noverwhelming response and could be supported by a large number of our \ncolleagues, both on the Democratic and Republican side.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this vote will not occur until \ntomorrow, but it is an important vote. I think it will demonstrate our \nwillingness to continue to move this legislation forward.\n  I appreciate the consideration of this amendment and ask my \ncolleagues to support it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Kyl and Cornyn for this \namendment. I thank them for the intense discussions and negotiations \nfor which we have been able to get widespread support for this \namendment; also, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  Senator Cornyn and Senator Kyl have focused attention very \nappropriately on one who is convicted of a crime, who would more \nlikely, obviously, commit another crime. That is not what this bill is \nall about. I think these efforts bear fruit in this amendment, and they \nseek to bar the potentially dangerous criminal alien from taking \nadvantage of this program.\n  The amendment specifically addresses individuals who have been \nconvicted of one felony or three misdemeanors. It also addresses those \nwho have just ignored our laws and thumbed their nose at our judicial \nsystem. But thanks to these negotiations, we allow individuals who may \nhave been caught up in an unjust and unfair system to apply for a \nwaiver and possibly have their cases reconsidered.\n  I believe that ultimately this amendment makes the bill better and \nour country safer.\n  I wish to again thank Senators Kyl and Cornyn for their willingness \nto negotiate some questions that we had about a very small aspect of \nthis bill. I think it preserves the very important intent of the Kyl-\nCornyn amendment--that we will never allow people who have committed \nfelonies or crimes to be eligible for citizenship in this country. I \nthank them for their efforts in this direction. I hope our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle will have a chance to examine this \namendment overnight, and perhaps we could dispense with it early in the \nmorning.\n  There are a number of amendments on our side. I am told there are a \nnumber of amendments on the other side. I think we have made good \nprogress today in addressing some of the major issues, but obviously we \nneed to move forward. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwill see fit to have a vote as quickly as possible so we can move on to \nother amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague and\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\nthank him, Senator Graham, and Senator Kennedy for their work in \nhelping us to negotiate provisions of this amendment.\n  I join my colleague from Arizona in expressing the view that we \nshould not take very long tomorrow to conclude the debate, and I hope \nwe will receive substantial support for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for the record, I would like to compliment \nour staff because most of the hard work in this place goes on in some \nback room with our staff people trying to work through the problems of \nthe bill. They have done a great job for Senators Kyl, Cornyn, and \nMcCain. I am proud of what my staff has done, and particularly Senator \nKennedy's staff. We have all gotten good staff support on this issue.\n  Very clearly, succinctly, to the point, if you are a criminal, if you \nhave committed a felony, if you have committed a crime or three \nmisdemeanors, you don't get a second shot. Off you go. That, to me, is \nimportant.\n  Under the bill, we are trying to give people a pathway to citizenship \nthat would be earned and that would add value to our country. Senators \nKyl and Cornyn have made this a better bill because the one thing we \nshould all be able to agree on here is you are not adding value to the \ncountry when you openly admit people who are criminals, who are mean \nand hateful, and who keep breaking the law.\n  There is another group of people who are subject to deportation on \nthe civil side. I think it is very fair that in a limited class of \ncases, we will allow people on the civil side subject to deportation a \nchance to make their case anew in terms of being eligible for a future \nguest worker program that may become our Nation's law based on the base \nbill.\n  Who are these people? If you are in a civil deportation hearing and \nyou can demonstrate that you never received the order to leave, then we \nare going to give you a second shot. It is hard to comply with \nsomething you don't know about. That happens on occasion.\n  Second, we are going to allow you, on the civil side receiving a \ndeportation order, to make an argument about how it would affect your \nfamily and take the human condition into consideration.\n  There is a unique group of people who come to this country--not by \nillegally crossing the border and overstaying their visa--who are one \nstep ahead of a death squad in some foreign land. It could be Haiti or \nother places, it could be Cuba, with an oppressive Communist regime, \nand the only way they can get out of that country to come here is it \nmake up a story that would keep them from being killed. What we are \nsaying is, if you come into our country through an inspection system \nand you have to save your family from an oppressive government or ahead \nof a death squad, we will let you tell us about that. We will sit down \nand figure out if it makes sense to make you part of this program.\n  There are not that many people, but we don't want to leave anybody \nbehind that has a meritorious case to be made on the civil side. If you \nare a criminal, forget it. You have had your chance, and you have blown \nit. This, to me, makes the bill better, whether it is the underlying \nbill or not. This is a concept that is uniquely American.\n\n  If you believe in playing by the rules, as Americans do, and you hurt \npeople, you are not going to get a second shot at hurting people again \nin our country. If you got caught up in a legal system that sometimes \nis complicated and you have a meritorious argument to be made and you \nhave never hurt anyone, we are going to listen to what you have to say.\n  I am proud to be part of it. Senator Kennedy has been very helpful. I \nhope we can get close to 100 votes. This is something that should bring \nus together. Senators Kyl and Cornyn demonstrated the best of this \nbody, reaching out, even though Members may not agree with the base \nbill, to try to find a way to make this part of the bill better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Arizona, the senior Senator, the Senator from South \nCarolina, for working with Senator Kyl and myself on this amendment.\n  This whole subject is complicated and has so many different moving \nparts. What I mean by ``subject,'' I mean comprehensive immigration \nreform. Sometimes I think people start with a deep skepticism about \nwhat other Senators are actually trying to do.\n  I hope as this amendment is accepted when we vote tomorrow, showing \nthe alliance that has been created around this amendment, that our \ncolleagues understand, even though there may be some who disagree with \nsome aspects of the bill in the Senate, we are deeply committed to \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We understand it is important we have \nborder security, interior enforcement, worksite enforcement, a \ntemporary worker program, and that we deal in a humane and \ncompassionate fashion with the 12 million people who now live in our \ncountry in violation of our immigration laws.\n  Certainly, there are improvements that can be made to this underlying \nbill. This amendment is designed to do exactly that. It is ironic that \nit was first introduced well over a month ago and then, unfortunately, \nwe were unsuccessful in getting a vote on the amendment. It now looks \nas if, through hard work, discussion and cooperation, the intent behind \nthe amendment is better understood. It has already been eloquently \nexplained by Senators Kyl, Graham, and McCain.\n  Let me say the whole purpose of this amendment was to make sure that \nthose who have already had access to our criminal justice system and \nour civil litigation system, and lost, cannot come back and get another \nsecond bite at the apple. This amendment clarifies whether certain \nconvicted criminals are eligible for the benefits of the legalization \nprogram contained in the underlying bill.\n  To be clear, the underlying bill, without this amendment, would allow \ncertain criminal aliens to get legal status. The underlying bill \ndisqualifies aliens who are ineligible to obtain a visa because of \ncertain criminal convictions. But this only means crimes that are \ndefined as crimes involving moral turpitude or drug-related crimes.\n  Under the current bill, without this amendment, not all crimes--\nincluding some felonies--would bar an alien from obtaining legal \nstatus. Let me share quickly a few examples of crimes that do not \nautomatically exclude an alien from getting a visa and therefore would \nnot render an alien ineligible for legalization absent this amendment.\n  For example, someone who has been convicted of the crime of \nkidnapping; someone who has been convicted of the crime of weapons \npossession; for example, possession of a sawed-off shotgun. Another \nexample would be alien smuggling. This amendment would make ineligible \nany alien who has been convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors.\n  Ironically, this provision, once this amendment is accepted, will \nbring this bill in the Senate up to par, basically, with the 1986 law \nwhich recognized that problem and excluded any alien that had been \nconvicted of a felony or three misdemeanors. That is the basis upon \nwhich this amendment is offered.\n  I might also add, of course, those who have had an opportunity to \nhave their cases adjudicated, to have their day in court, but simply \nthumb their nose at the law and have gone underground, those \nindividuals who have already had a bite at the apple, have already had \ntheir day in court and lost and simply gone underground and defied \ntheir deportation order, they also would be excluded from the \nlegalization benefits contained in the bill, subject to some of the \nexceptions and the extreme hardship provisions that Senator Graham and \nothers have discussed.\n  I very much appreciate my colleagues, including Senator Kennedy, the \nmanager of the bill on the minority side, indicating their positive \nresponse to this amendment. While there is no formal agreement, it is \nthe sense that this amendment is likely to be accepted by overwhelming \nnumbers.\n  It just goes to show if we continue to work together, talk to each \nother and try to work our way through our differences, we can make \nprogress on the bill and actually improve it over the bill as proposed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in view of some things that were said a \ncouple weeks ago, let me close this out with a couple of brief \ncomments.\n  At the time that Senator Cornyn and I first introduced this \namendment, we speculated that it might ultimately result in 300,000, \n400,000 500,000 people being denied the benefits of the legislation. \nHowever, there were those on the other side who said this was a poison \npill, this was going to preclude everyone who came into the country \nillegally or overstayed a visa from getting the benefits of the \nlegislation. We said: No, that is not true. It is cast narrowly by its \nterms. It talks about convicted felons, three misdemeanors, and the \npeople who have avoided a court order or a judge's order that they \nleave the country. That is it.\n  Some on the other side said: We look at the language, and we think \nmaybe this could apply to anyone who comes into the country illegally. \nBy laying it down, you have created a poison bill. As a result, they \nwould not permit a vote on the amendment. As a result, this legislation \ncame to the end of the period of time, the end of the week, and the \nmajority leader had to lay it aside so that the Senate could go on its \nrecess.\n  Senator Cornyn and I never had an intention to bring the bill to a \nhalt or to create some kind of a poison pill that would make it \nimpossible for anyone to support the legislation if the amendment were \nagreed to. We simply were trying to point out that there was a \ndeficiency in the bill. Serious criminals could become citizens of the \nUnited States. We felt that was wrong.\n  So we introduced the amendment and tried to explain at the time that \nwas our sole motivation. Frankly, we could have dispensed with this \namendment 3 weeks ago if our colleagues had simply gotten down to the \ndebate, carefully read it, talked it out with us, and gotten a vote.\n  Because of a question that our colleagues raised that we referred to \nearlier this evening, we have made a couple of modifications to the \namendment, demonstrating that we are perfectly willing to negotiate a \nprovision if there is a sense that we should have done something a \nlittle bit differently, which we did.\n  I hope as we proceed to introduce other amendments to this \nlegislation, that our colleagues on the other side will be willing to \nhave votes. We wanted to have a vote on this earlier today or tonight \nor to lock in a time for a vote tomorrow. No, the other side said: No, \nwe are not ready yet.\n  If we continue at this pace, we are not going to finish the bill by \nMemorial Day, as the majority leader has requested, as the President \nhas requested, and as we are committed to do.\n  Our colleagues are going to have to do two things with respect to the \nrest of the debate on this bill: No. 1, to be willing to move with us \nto a quick consideration of amendments, a reasonable time for debate, \nthen a vote, and then move on to the next amendment. No. 2, instead of \ncharacterizing amendments in a way that is not correct and attributing \npolitical motives to those who are simply trying to point out \ndeficiencies in the bill and correct them with these amendments, they \nought to simply be willing to come to the Senate, have the debate, and \nthen proceed to a vote on the amendment.\n  We are not in this to somehow try to stop the legislation as our \nrepeated efforts to get a vote and move on have demonstrated.\n  I join my colleague from Texas in saying I appreciate the fact that, \nhopefully now, knock on wood, tomorrow morning, first thing, we will be \nable to have a vote on this amendment and not only vote on it but \nfinally, having sat down and looked at it, our colleagues will say: \nThis is an amendment we can support. It makes sense to deny citizenship \nto serious criminals.\n  If we can approach the other amendments in the same fashion we have \nfinally gotten to with this amendment, we can actually finish this \nbill. I urge my colleagues to cooperate with us in that way.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, through the Chair, I inquire, isn't it a \nfact over the last few weeks on behalf of the Republican leadership, \nthe Senator has tried to collect all of the potential pool of \namendments and consolidate those amendments down into a reasonable \nnumber in a good-faith effort to try to move this process forward? We \nshared that list with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nDoes the Senator believe that demonstrates the good faith we have tried \nto demonstrate from the very start?\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Yes, we have tried to do that.\n  I see the distinguished minority leader is here, and I suggest the \nbest way to get this bill quickly considered and finished is to lay \ndown as many of the amendments as Members have ready and then have the \nminority and majority side work together to figure out the proper order \nof those amendments, to try to enter into time agreements. If we are \nable to do that, I don't have any doubt that working in good faith we \ncan complete the work of this Senate before the Memorial Day recess on \nthis important piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has asked that I \nindicate that we have no objection to his being in the queue.\n  As has been announced by the distinguished manager of the bill, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, we are going to take up the Kyl amendment, \nthe Obama amendment, and then we are going to go to Sessions, then a \nDemocrat, and as far as we are concerned on our side, we have no \nobjection whatever to Senator Inhofe being the next Republican \namendment in order.\n  I have not checked with the majority leader, and if there is a \nproblem, I can change it, but I ask consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the minority leader \nfor that quick response to my request. I know we are all anxious to get \nas many amendments up and taken care of as possible.\n  I know we cannot do this until probably tomorrow sometime, and it is \nour understanding there is now a unanimous consent for Senators Kyl, \nObama, Sessions, a Democrat, and then me. With that, if no others want \nto be heard on the amendments, I would like to visit about the \namendment we will take up tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in his speech, the President endorsed the \nidea that people immigrating to this country should assimilate and \nlearn English.\n  I will quote from his speech:\n\n       . . . We must honor the great American tradition of the \n     melting pot, which has made us one nation out of many \n     peoples. The success of our country depends upon helping \n     newcomers assimilate into society, and embrace our common \n     identity as Americans. Americans are bound together by our \n     shared ideals, an appreciation for our history, respect for \n     the flag we fly, and an ability to speak and write the \n     English language. English is also the key to unlocking the \n     opportunity of America. English allows newcomers to go from \n     picking crops to opening a grocery . . . from cleaning \n     offices to running offices . . . from a life of low-paying \n     jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of their own. When \n     immigrants assimilate and advance in our society, they \n     realize their dreams . . . they renew our spirit . . . and \n     they add to the unity of Americans.\n\n  Last November, speaking to an audience in Davis-Monthan Air Force \nBase in Tucson, President Bush again stated his support for immigrants \nto learn English. He said:\n\n       Every new citizen of the United States has an obligation to \n     learn our custom and our values, including liberty and civic \n     responsibility, equality under God and tolerance for others, \n     and the English language.\n\n  So this has been very specific. Ronald Reagan addressed it many \ntimes, certainly, in the State of the Union Message. I recall being \nhere in 1999, when President Bill Clinton at that time said:\n\n       Our new immigrants . . . have a responsibility to enter the \n     mainstream of America. That means learning English.\n\n  It goes on and on and on. I think almost every Member has at one time \nor another talked in the Senate about the reasons it is necessary for \nthe English language to be part of any kind of an immigration bill.\n  Today, once again, I am offering my English amendment, No. 3996, \nalong\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\nwith my colleagues, Senators Sessions, Coburn, Burns, Bunning, and \nothers. My amendment follows Congressman Peter King's bill, H.R. 4408, \nas well as Senator Shelby's bill, S. 323, from the 105th Congress, by \nmaking English the official language and requiring all official \nbusiness of the United States to be conducted in English.\n  It also allows exceptions. This is very important because arguments \nhave been made against it. But there are exceptions where our law \nspecifically says something should be done in another language, such \nthings as protecting someone's legal rights to make sure they \nunderstand what their privileges are, what their responsibilities are \nwhen they are served.\n  Also, recently, when we experienced Hurricane Katrina, where an \nevacuation order was issued, that order could be delivered by the \nFederal Government in necessary languages to get the message out.\n  So we have taken care of these problems.\n  I would suggest there are three main reasons to adopt this amendment. \nOne is for unity and assimilation. To begin with, as the President has \nsaid numerous times, learning English is vital to achieving \nassimilation, assimilating yourself into society. So many people are \nlooking at illegals who are coming over and getting jobs, but they do \nnot stop and think about the fact that in order to become a citizen, \nyou have to assimilate into society so you can enjoy the benefits. They \ndo not come naturally. You have to make it happen.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt echoed this point at a luncheon for the \nNational Americanization Committee on February 1, 1916. He said:\n\n       Let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn \n     English, but that he has got to learn it. . . . He has got to \n     consider the interest of the United States or he should not \n     stay here.\n\n  It goes all the way back for many years. Our leaders have reiterated \nthis. Our country is made up of immigrants from all over the world, \nimmigrants who have joined together under common ideas, common beliefs, \nand a common language to function as ``one nation under God.''\n  As we allow great numbers of immigrants, legal and illegal, into the \ncountry, we are overwhelming the assimilation process and creating what \nsome have called ``linguistic ghettos,'' segregating these immigrants \ninto a massive underclass who are not able to obtain good-paying jobs \nand climb out of poverty and Government dependency.\n  By not requiring immigrants to assimilate and learn English, we are \nalso undermining our unity and importing dangerous, deadly philosophies \nthat go against our American ideals.\n  September 11 is an example of this, as Muslim extremists executed \ntheir jihadist philosophy against the United States and caused \nthousands of Americans to lose their lives.\n  The second thing to be considered is the cost. The Office of \nManagement and Budget estimates that it costs taxpayers between $1 \nbillion and $2 billion to provide language assistance under President \nClinton's Executive order that came out during his Presidency.\n  There are also enormous costs associated with the mandate that local \ngovernments provide multilingual ballots. For example, Los Angeles \nCounty taxpayers spent over $1.1 million in 1996 to provide \nmultilingual voting assistance in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, \nJapanese, and Filipino, according to a GAO report.\n  In 2002, Los Angeles's multilingual election costs more than doubled \nto $3.3 million, according to the Associated Press.\n  The third reason is, this is something the American people want. All \nthe American people want it. I have never seen anything polled more \nconsistently than this issue has been polled. Three national \nassociations are dedicated solely to this amendment: U.S. English, \nEnglish First, and Pro-English.\n  Senator Specter's Judiciary Committee invited this amendment in the \nLegislative Directors' meeting in the Republican Policy Committee by \nsaying it ``welcomed amendments on English'' as a means to enhance \n``assimilation'' of immigrants.\n  This issue has raised millions of dollars in direct mail over the \nyears. These donors must include populists, given the huge levels of \nsupport. No other amendment has been more thoroughly vetted. This \nconcept has been around for decades, indeed, for centuries. \nHistorically, the legislation has been bipartisan.\n  In 1997, several of us joined Senator Shelby in his official English \nbill. It was a bipartisan bill with 21 cosponsors, including Democrats \nHollings and Byrd and many others. And over 150 current Members of the \nHouse of Representatives have cosponsored official English legislation.\n  Most of the States--27--have made English their official language. \nThis is kind of interesting. The vast majority of the States, on their \nown, on a State basis, have made English the official language.\n  There are 51 nations around the world that have made English their \nofficial language, but we have not. Now, can you explain to me why \nGambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia, and \nZimbabwe have made English their official language, yet the United \nStates has not?\n  The pollsters, consistently over the last 20 years, have all shown \npositive results at levels in the 80s, the 80-percentile range. In \n1988, G. Lawrence Research showed 87 percent favored English as the \nofficial language, with only 8 percent opposed and 5 percent not sure.\n  A 1996 national survey by Luntz Research asked: Do you think English \nshould be made the official language of the United States? Eighty-six \npercent of Americans supported making English the official language. \nOnly 12 percent opposed it.\n  Eighty-one percent of first-generation immigrants, 83 percent of \nsecond-generation immigrants, and 87 percent of third- and fourth-\ngeneration immigrants supported making English the official language.\n  I think a lot of people have this misunderstanding that this is some \nkind of a protectionist issue. Yet the vast majority of Latinos, the \nvast majority of immigrants have supported this, also.\n  In 2000, Public Opinion Strategies showed 84 percent favored English \nas the official language, with only 12 percent opposing.\n  Ninety-two percent of Republicans, 76 percent of Democrats, and 76 \npercent of Independents favor making English the official language. \nThat is according to a 2004 Zogby International poll.\n  Another Zogby International poll question on official English--this \npoll is a month old, conducted between March 14 and 16 of 2006--said: \nFive out of six likely voters support official English. When informed \nthe United States has no official language, five out of six likely \nvoters--84 percent--agree the country should make English the official \nlanguage. The majority of Hispanic voters support official English. An \noverwhelming majority of likely Hispanic voters--71 percent--agree the \ncountry should make English the official language.\n  A bipartisan majority support official English. Official English is \nnot an ``extreme'' position. Eighty-four percent of self-identified \n``moderate'' voters support English as the official language.\n  Hispanics also agree learning English is important. So it is not just \nthat it is the right thing to do, it is what they can do for \nthemselves. The National Council of LaRaza, which opposes official \nEnglish, commissioned a 2004 Zogby poll showing that Latinos believe in \nthe importance of learning English. Over 97 percent strongly agreed \nthat ``the ability to speak English is important to succeed in this \ncountry.''\n  In south Florida, Hispanics back English, according to a 2005 \nUniversity of Miami School of Communications/Zogby International \nsurvey. ``How important is it for Hispanics who immigrate to the United \nStates to adopt American culture?'' Seventy percent said it is very \nimportant. These are Hispanics who are responding.\n  The December 2002 Pew Hispanic Center/Henry J. Kaiser Family \nFoundation National Survey of Latinos asked:\n\n       Do you think adult Latino immigrants need to learn English \n     to succeed in the United States or can they succeed even if \n     they only speak Spanish?\n\n  About 9 in 10--89 percent--of Latinos indicate that they believe \nimmigrants need to learn to speak English to succeed in the United \nStates.\n  And this goes on and on and on. There should not be any question in \nanyone's mind that one of the most\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\npopular notions out there is for us to adopt English as the official \nlanguage.\n  Finally, according to ProEnglish, a group dedicated to making English \nthe official language, one out of every five Americans speaks a \nlanguage other than English at home.\n  Referring to immigrants speaking English in our country, Congressman \nSteve King of Iowa said:\n\n       I don't think the immigrants are the problem; I think it is \n     the people at the border that are telling them that they \n     don't have to learn English, should not have to and keep them \n     in these cultural enclaves so that then allows them to \n     control the immigrants and gives them political power.\n\n  I believe we are doing a great disservice if we do not recognize this \nas one of the true, great issues of our time. There is no more \nappropriate time than during the consideration of this immigration bill \nto bring this out and finally do something we have talked about doing \nnow for over 100 years and getting it done and getting it done on this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat how much I appreciate the minority \nleader allowing me to get into the queue. We look forward to having \nthis debated and voted on tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 20 years ago I was pleased and proud to \nhelp welcome Toyota to Kentucky. I rise today, equally pleased and \nproud, to congratulate Toyota on its 20 years of success in the \nCommonwealth and to wish them much continued success for the future.\n  Toyota provides 7,000 jobs in the Georgetown, KY, plant that it \nopened 20 years ago, and the company's manufacturing operations in \nKentucky produced half a million American-made cars last year alone. In \nfact, the Toyota Camry, which is manufactured in Kentucky, has been the \nmost popular model on the American market for the last 4 years and \neight times in the past 9 years. Beginning this fall, Toyota will bring \nthe future of automotive technology to Kentucky with the production of \nthe environmentally friendly Camry Hybrid. The Georgetown plant will \nproduce 4,000 models a month.\n  Since it arrived in Kentucky, Toyota has invested more than $5 \nbillion in its operations. This includes the manufacturing site in \nGeorgetown; Toyota's North American Parts Center-Kentucky, the \ncompany's largest parts-distribution center in the world, in Hebron, \nKY; and its North American manufacturing headquarters in Erlanger, KY. \nTogether, these businesses provide about $500 million a year in \npaychecks to Kentucky workers. More significantly, Toyota has become an \nanchor for related suppliers and vendors that provide thousands more \njobs for Kentuckians.\n  Toyota has provided an important economic lesson on the value of \ninsourcing. Some have bemoaned the loss of American jobs to overseas \nfirms. Well, we in Kentucky are proud to have nurtured one of the first \nand most successful efforts by an overseas manufacturer to bring jobs \nhere. Toyota and Kentucky both have benefited greatly from this \npartnership over these last 20 years.\n  And Kentucky has gained more than just jobs--Toyota has proved to be \na model member of the business community. It supports education, \ncomputer literacy in the workforce, the University of Kentucky \nChildren's Hospital, and many other worthy causes across the \nCommonwealth. Many Kentuckians have benefited from Toyota's generosity, \nand we are all happy that Toyota chose Kentucky as its major center for \nU.S. operations two decades ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nthousands of Kentuckians who work for Toyota for their dedication to \nachievement and success, both on the job and in their communities. \nKentucky is still reaping the rewards of its 20-year partnership with \nToyota, and we hope to continue to do so for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4610-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4610-S4613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Lance M. Chase\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen son of \nOklahoma who died while defending his Nation, SSG Lance M. Chase.\n  Staff Sergeant Chase grew up in Midwest City Oklahoma and graduated \nfrom Midwest City High School in 1991 after playing football there. He \nwas also an avid fisherman and fan of NASCAR. Before joining the Army \nin 1995, Staff Sergeant Chase spent 20 months working for the Oklahoma \nCity Sheriff's Office as a detention officer alongside his father who \nis a Reserve officer and member of the sheriff's bomb squad.\n  Staff Sergeant Chase was assigned to 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry \nRegiment, 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood Texas. There he trained \nother soldiers on how to maintain and move M1A2 Abrams tanks and was an \nhonored marksman. After returning from his first tour of duty in Iraq, \nhe got involved with efforts sending books and hygiene products to the \nIraqi people. He told his wife Kristen that his biggest joy was seeing \nIraqi children returning to their local schools.\n  Before Staff Sergeant Chase went to Iraq, he told his two sons--\nBrett, who is 11 years old, and Trevor, who is 9 years old, that he \nwould rather fight this type of terrorist war on their soil than to \nfight it on our own soil where his children would be in danger. Staff \nSergeant Chase was in his second tour of duty in Iraq on January 23, \n2006, when his M1A2 Abrams tank was hit by an improvised explosive \ndevice in Baghdad, Iraq. He was 32 years old. SSG Chase clearly \nunderstood our mission in Iraq and felt that he had helped to make the \nlives of the Iraqi people better. Staff Sergeant Lance M. Chase \ndeserves to be remembered for the fine soldier that he was and the \nsacrifice that he made for us.\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant John G. Doles\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor a brave soldier from Oklahoma who gave \nhis life in service of this Nation. SSG John Doles of the U.S. Army \nembodies the spirit and values that have protected this country's \nfreedom and continue to spread hope to the far corners of the world.\n  Sergeant Doles was an ``all-American kid'' he grew up in Chelsea, OK, \nriding horses and playing football. Sergeant Doles joined the Army in \n2000 and attended Airborne School at Fort Benning, GA. He went on to \nbecome a Ranger and told his father that this was what he wanted to do \nwith his life because he loved his country.\n  Sergeant Doles was also a devoted family man. He left behind a wife, \nHeather, and two children, Logan and Breanna. After his tour in \nAfghanistan, he planned to reenlist and become an instructor at the \nArmy Ranger Camp at Fort Benning, GA, so he could be closer to his \nfamily.\n  Sergeant Doles was no stranger to the hazards of duty. He \nparticipated in one of the largest combat jumps since World War II. His \nunit parachuted into northern Iraq in March of 2003 with the ``Red \nDevils.'' This major operation assisted in the swift liberation of \nIraq. Sergeant Doles was a squad leader of about a dozen soldiers with \nthe 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment, part of the 173rd Airborne \nBrigade. On Friday September 30, 2005, he was killed in an ambush in \nShah Wali, Afghanistan. He was 29 years old.\n  Sergeant Doles gave his utmost to his family and his country. He has \nleft behind many who saw firsthand what a true hero he was. As a son of \nOklahoma and a fine example of what this country stands for, Staff \nSergeant Doles deserves our honor and remembrance.\n\n\n                  Private First Class Travis J. Grigg\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a remarkable man. \nPFC Travis J. Grigg was an Oklahoman through-and-through: a hard \nworker,\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\ndedicated, friendly, and a lover of his family and country. Those who \nknew him best remembered him as athletic and caring more about others \nthan himself. He graduated from Inola High School, of Inola, OK, in \n1999 and was a starter on the football, basketball, and baseball teams. \nHe entered the U.S. Army in 2004, proudly serving his Nation in Iraq \nfor about a year.\n  According to his family, Private First Class Grigg found his niche in \nthe Army. He was a team player and a responsible man who once \ncommented, ``I feel like we're helping some people over here.'' He was \nassigned to the 1st Battalion, 320th Field Artillery Regiment, 101st \nAirborne Division. He joined the Army to earn money for college to \nbecome a teacher and football coach, but after joining, he decided that \nhe wanted to become a firefighter like his father.\n  November 15, 2005, in Taji, Iraq, Private First Class Grigg was one \nof four individuals in a HMMWV that was hit when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated. Tragically he, along with four other \nsoldiers, did not survive the incident. He was 24 years old.\n  Private First Class Grigg will be missed by his father, four sisters, \nand two brothers. His sacrifice will not soon be forgotten by them his \nfriends, his fellow soldiers, or by his country. I ask that we take \nthis time to honor his name and his life.\n\n\n               Petty Officer Second Class Brian K. Joplin\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a son of Oklahoma, \nPetty Officer Brian K. Joplin.\n  Petty Officer Joplin grew up in Hugo, OK and was assigned to \nHelicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 15, based at the Naval Air \nStation in Corpus Christi, TX. He was an aviation machinist and was \nknown as a mechanic whose talent was second to none. Petty Officer \nJoplin was always willing to donate his time to his friends and \nneighbors. He spent his Memorial Day weekend of 2005 repairing and \ncertifying a vintage B-25 Mitchell Bomber that was very much like the \none his grandfather flew in World War II.\n  Petty Officer Joplin was deployed to Iraq in June of 2005. On Tuesday \nOctober 4, 2005, he was on a training mission when he fell from his MH-\n53 Sea Dragon helicopter and was killed. He was 32 years old.\n  Petty Officer Joplin is survived by his wife of 12 years, Belinda, \nand his daughters, Tori and Alicia. They will always remember a loving \nhusband and father who had a great sense of humor, patience, and \nforgiveness and our thoughts are with them. We remember Petty Officer \nJoplin for his service, dedication, and love of his country, and at the \nsame time, we recognize his valor and commitment. He will not be \nforgotten. It is because of men like Petty Officer Joplin that I am \nproud to be a part of this great country. He was a special soldier, a \ntrue Oklahoman, and a true American.\n\n\n                  Private First Class David J. Martin\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay homage to Army PFC David J. Martin, who \ngave the ultimate sacrifice for his country with his life. Although he \nwas only 21 years old, Private First Class Marshall was a dedicated \ndefender of America and knew the value of freedom and the sacrifices \nfreedom sometimes demands. For his service, I am proud to honor him on \nthe Senate floor today.\n  Private First Class Martin was a member of the Second Battalion, \n502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, of the 101st Airborne \nDivision. A native Oklahoman from Edmond, Private First Class Martin \nwas one of four sons of Richard and Janet Martin. Private First Class \nMartin's mother is the president of the Edmond and North Oklahoma City \nChapter of the Blue Star Mothers, a support group for mothers whose \nchildren are in the military and also send care packages to our \nsoldiers in Iraq. We hold her in our prayers as all of her sons are \nserving our country in some way. Private First Class Martin's younger \nbrother, Daniel, also enlisted last year, and his older brothers, Neil \nand Andrew, are police officers in Edmond, OK.\n  After graduating from Edmond North High School in 2002, Private First \nClass Martin briefly attended the University of Central Oklahoma and \nwas a member of the ROTC unit there before enlisting in the Army. He \nearned an Army Achievement Medal during his training in Fort Benning, \nGA, for being an outstanding leader.\n  Private First Class Martin had only been in Iraq for a month when he \nwas tragically killed. On October 31, 2005, the humvee he and three \nother fellow soldiers were riding in was struck by an improvised \nexplosive device in Al Mahmudiyah, Iraq. I ask that the U.S. Senate now \npay tribute to PFC David Martin, a man who knew the true meaning of \nservice and sacrifice. I am proud of him and proud of his demonstrated \ncommitment to winning the freedom of those he did not know. We will not \nforget this Oklahoman hero, this American patriot--PFC David Martin.\n\n\n                    First Sergeant Tobias C. Meister\n\n  Mr. President, I stand today to honor the memory of a brave American \nwho gave his life defending the Nation. He felt a call to serve his \ncountry, to be part of something bigger than himself, and ultimately he \npaid the highest price. First Sergeant Tobias C. Meister, of Jenks, OK, \nwas assigned to the Army's 321st Civil Affairs Brigade which was \ndeployed to Afghanistan.\n  First Sergeant Meister was born in Remsen, Iowa and joined the Iowa \nNational Guard in 1992, 2 years prior to graduating from Ramsen-Union \nCommunity High School in Iowa. He was an infantryman before \ntransferring to the Reserves in 1998 and attending the University of \nTexas at San Antonio. There he earned a business degree and later took \na job in Tulsa, OK, with the oil and gas firm Horizon Natural \nResources.\n  First Sergeant Meister was an accomplished martial artist who was \nundefeated as a kickboxer. Those who fought against him knew \nimmediately he was a fierce competitor. One of his opponents said that \nMeister weighed about ``165 pounds and you knew 100 pounds of it was \nheart if you saw him fight.'' He loved martial arts and the discipline \nthat it required.\n  First Sergeant Meister was a drill sergeant and had been named the \nArmy Reserve's Drill Sergeant of the Year in 2002. In 2004, he decided \nto join those he had been training for combat. On December 28, 2005 in \nAsadabad, Afghanistan, he was killed at the age of 30 during combat \npatrol operations when an improvised explosive device was detonated \nnear his humvee.\n  First Sergeant Meister gave his life for the freedom of millions of \nAmericans and also for the peace and prosperity of the Afghani people \ncrippled by a totalitarian regime. He is survived by his wife Alicia \nand 18-month-old son Will. The loss of this exemplary husband, father, \nand soldier is a loss we all feel; our thoughts and prayers are \nespecially with his family and friends. He knew that he and his fellow \nsoldiers were fighting to protect America, to keep their Nation safe. \nIt is for men like First Sergeant Meister that I am proud to be a part \nof this great country. He was a special soldier, a special man, and a \ndefender of our freedom.\n\n\n                   Technical Sergeant Jason L. Norton\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a man who paid the \nlast full measure for the protection of our freedom. TSgt Jason L. \nNorton was from Miami, OK, and was assigned to the 3rd Security Forces \nSquadron at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska serving as a patrol and \nsecurity officer training police canines. He had been deployed to Iraq \nin November of 2005.\n  Technical Sergeant Norton joined the Air Force in 1992 after \ngraduating from Miami High School in 1991, where he played football and \nwrestled. His Air Force career took him to many different places. He \nwas known as smart, easy to talk to, and always willing to share what \nhe knew with others. He earned 17 medals, including an Air Force \nCommendation Medal, 4 Air Force Achievement Awards, and 2 Air Force \nExpeditionary Service Medals. He enjoyed his time in Alaska, earning a \nreputation as a great Alaskan hunter while also providing his time as a \nfather figure to children who needed one.\n  For Technical Sergeant Norton, family was everything. Even though he \nwas stationed 4,000 miles away in Alaska, he made a point to return \nhome often to see his family. He met his wife Cristina while he was \nserving at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, and they have two \nchildren, a daughter, Rebecca, who is 8 years old, and a son Dalton, \nwho is 7. He has been described as a great father who showed an equal \ndevotion to his lifelong friends. Once he traveled back to Oklahoma \nfrom Alaska to attend the funeral for the\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nwife of a longtime friend who had died of cancer.\n  On January 22, 2006, TSgt Jason L. Norton's vehicle struck an \nimprovised explosive device while conducting a convoy escort in the \nvicinity of Taji, Iraq. He was 32 years old, and the Air Force \nposthumously awarded him the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Mr. \nPresident, we have lost a shining example of dedication, service, and \nsacrifice for others and should never forget the sacrifice of TSgt \nJason L. Norton.\n\n\n                    Army Specialist Joshua M. Pearce\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to remember a young man from Oklahoma, \nArmy SPC Joshua M. Pearce, who knew what it meant to be a soldier and \nwas willing to pay the ultimate price for our freedom.\n  Specialist Pearce was from Guymon, OK, and was a baseball pitcher on \nthe Guymon High School baseball team who was voted ``Life of the \nParty'' and ``Best Looking'' by his senior classmates in 2003. He \nalways wanted to be a soldier, so he enlisted in the Army right after \ngraduation, joining his older brother, Jeremy, in the Armed Forces. \nSpecialist Pearce was described by friends and family alike as a person \nwho always made everybody in the room smile.\n  Specialist Pearce was deployed to Iraq as a part of the 2nd \nBattalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team \nthat is stationed at Fort Wainwright, AK. Over the 6 months he served \nin Iraq, he talked to his mother, Becky Hilliard, through e-mail, \ntelephone, or instant messaging on a daily basis. In an open letter he \nwrote on September 11, 2005, Specialist Pearce stated that ``I am not \nhere to kill someone; I am here to help as many as I can live a better \nlife. If killing some people to save the life of a fellow soldier \nhappens to fall in the agenda, so be it. We drive down the streets of \nthese little towns and see little children on the corners bare-footed \nasking for water, food, or whatever they can get.'' He told his sister, \nHeidi Barncastle, that ``he was doing this so his nephews didn't have \nto.''\n  Specialist Pearce was riding in his Stryker military vehicle on \nFebruary 26, 2006 near Mosul, Iraq, when it was hit with an improvised \nexplosive device. He was 21 years old. Specialist Pearce did not want \nhis friends and family to mourn his loss should he die. He was doing \nwhat he always wanted to do and believed in the mission that he was on. \nMr. President, we will not forget this Oklahoma hero and American \npatriot, SPC Joshua M. Pearce, who died doing something that he loved.\n\n\n               Private First Class Joshua Francis Powers\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Oklahoma's brave soldiers \nwho has given us the last full measure to protect our freedom. PFC \nJoshua Francis Powers' sacrifice for his country should never be \nforgotten.\n  Private First Class Powers was from Skiatook, OK. He joined the Army \nin July of 2005, 1 month after earning his GED. He was remembered as an \neven-tempered soul who had varied interests from collecting swords and \nknives, making soap for senior citizens, fishing, and just simply \nhitting golf balls out into the pasture to occupy his time. He had a \npenchant for reading, sewing, playing video games, and often served as \na peacemaker between his brothers, Michael and Jonathan. He was also a \ndevout son who would often fix his mother Patrica's frozen pipes before \nhe was asked to.\n  Private First Class Powers was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 592nd \nInfantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division at \nFort Campbell, KY. After joining the Army, he was worried that his dog, \nSpunky, who had been his pet since he was in kindergarten, would die of \nold age before he got home. Private First Class Powers had been in Iraq \nfor only 2\\1/2\\ weeks before he died of noncombat related injuries. He \nwas 21 years old. Mr. President, we should always remember those who \nserved the way PFC Joshua Francis Powers served and sacrificed for our \nfreedom.\n\n\n                       Corporal Jeffry A. Rogers\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor a true hero who, on November 16, 2005, \ngave his life while serving in Iraq. Cpl Jeffry Alan Rogers is an \nexample of the selfless dedication that is essential to maintaining \nthis country's freedom.\n  Corporal Rogers was from Oklahoma City and attended Putnam City North \nHigh School. He was one of six from the class of 2002 who enlisted in \nthe military after graduating. He insisted on enlisting in the Marines \nafter witnessing the horrors of September 11 saying, ``We have to keep \nour world safe. We have to protect our people.''\n  Corporal Rogers became an outstanding marine assigned to F. Company, \n2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Division in Camp Pendleton, CA. His high test \nscores earned him an invitation to join the security forces and a \n$50,000 scholarship. He suggested to his parents that they build a \nhouse with the money that they had saved for his college education, and \nhe even designed the house where his family now lives in Yukon, OK.\n  Corporal Rogers is remembered as a courteous and loving man who \nalways said the little things that mean a lot to people. His commanders \nfondly recall how he invested into those under him and helped them set \ngoals.\n  In his last letter to his parents, he quoted John 15:13 saying \n``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for \nhis friends.'' Mr. President, Cpl Jeffry Rogers indeed demonstrated \nthis deepest love. At 21 years of age, he put aside his own safety, \nvolunteering to serve in the most dangerous of professions. He gave \neverything, and his sacrifice will be remembered by friends, family, \nand all of us who are profoundly indebted to him.\n\n\n                 Technical Sergeant Patrick L. Shannon\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor a son of Oklahoma who after over \n37 years has finally returned home. TSgt Patrick L. Shannon was serving \nhis country in the Vietnam War when he was declared missing in action \nin 1968 after the radar site he and 18 other servicemen were operating \nin Laos was attacked by North Vietnamese commandos. We now know that \nTechnical Sergeant Shannon did not survive the attack. He was 30 years \nold.\n  Technical Sergeant Shannon was from Owasso, OK, and was operating a \nradar installation Lima Site 85 atop the Pha Thi Mountain in the \nHouaphan Province in Laos, which was approximately 13 miles south of \nthe border with North Vietnam. Lima Site 85 was helping to direct U.S. \nbombing missions of key targets in North Vietnam. On the morning of \nMarch 11, 1968, the site was overrun by North Vietnamese commandos. \nOnly 7 of the 19 servicemen survived the attack, and the United States \nlater bombed the site for 4 days to destroy the equipment that was left \nbehind. North Vietnamese soldiers later threw the bodies of the dead \nservicemen off a cliff because the rocky ground did not permit a \nburial. This is where the remains of Technical Sergeant Shannon were \nfound.\n  Technical Sergeant Shannon finally came home last year. A DNA sample \nfrom his sister helped to positively identify Technical Sergeant \nShannon and bring closure to his family who had wondered what had \nreally happened to him on that fateful day. His youngest child, Paula \nWallace, said that her father ``would be happy to be back in America.'' \nMr. President, I, too, am happy that TSgt Patrick L. Shannon has \nfinally returned home after answering his country's call to arms.\n\n\n                 Sergeant First Class Brandon K. Sneed\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor a brave soldier from Oklahoma who gave \nthe last full measure to protect our freedom. SFC Brandon Sneed of the \nU.S. Army embodied the spirit of service and the values that make this \ncountry what it is today.\n  Sergeant Sneed was a great soldier. He joined soon after graduating \nfrom high school in 1990. As he rose through the ranks, he developed a \nreputation of dependability. He was serving as a field medic with Bravo \nCompany in the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment attached to the \n69th Armor Regiment serving in Iraq.\n  Sergeant Sneed was no stranger to the hazards of duty. He would \nroutinely go under fire to retrieve wounded soldiers. His second tour \nin Iraq was scheduled to end in December of last year.\n  Sergeant Sneed was also a family man. He married his wife Lori in \n1994, and they had three children, Christopher, Brandee, and Brandon, \nJr. His family had just moved into a new home. Sergeant Sneed met his \nwife while they both served their first tour in the Army together; they \nhad plans to open a rehabilitation facility upon his retirement from \nthe Army.\n  On October 10, 2005, Sergeant Sneed was killed while attempting to \nrescue\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nan injured soldier when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was destroyed by a \nroadside bomb. This occurred near Ramadi in Iraq's Anbar province. He \nwas 33 years old. He had a strong sense of duty, work ethic, and a \ncaring heart. He was devoted to his family, his country, and gave the \nhighest sacrifice to his soldiers. Sergeant First Class Sneed deserves \nour honor and remembrance.\n\n\n                        Corporal Joshua J. Ware\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor one of this country's fallen warriors, \na young man that comes from my home State of Oklahoma. Marine Cpl \nJoshua J. Ware was serving the cause of freedom in Iraq when he paid \nthe ultimate price.\n  Corporal Ware was born in Lawton, OK. He played football and baseball \nand ran track at Roland High School. In 2002, 1 year before he \ngraduated, he signed up for the Marine Corps and enlisted just 5 days \nafter graduating from High School and just 2 days after his birthday.\n  Corporal Ware was serving in Iraq with F Company, 2nd, Battalion, 1st \nMarine Division, and bravely fought in the second battle of Fallujah. \nHe was on his second tour of duty in Iraq on November 16, 2005, when he \nwas killed as a result of enemy small arms fire in Ubaydi, Iraq. He was \n20 years old and was the first Comanche or Kiowa to die in combat since \n1968.\n  Many are left behind who are proud and grieved at his sacrifice. \nCorporal Ware is survived by his parents, three brothers, and one \nsister.\n  The loss of Corporal Ware is one that will continue to be felt as the \nyears pass. He gave more than was required, in life and in the \nsacrifice of his death. He gave up his own well-being, putting himself \nin harm's way, and demonstrated courage that demands our recognition. I \nhope to express our gratefulness for his sacrifice with these simple \nwords and honor him before the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4613-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOSCOW HELSINKI GROUP\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last Friday, May 12, marked the 30th \nanniversary of the oldest active Russian human rights organization, the \nMoscow Helsinki Group.\n  The creation of the Moscow Helsinki Group was announced on May 12, \n1976, at a press conference called by Academician Andrei Sakharov, who \nlater won the Nobel Peace Prize for his defense of human rights and his \ncommitment to world peace. Formally named the ``Public Group to Assist \nin the Implementation of the Helsinki Final Act in the USSR,'' its \nmembers sought to monitor the Soviet Government's implementation of the \nhistoric Helsinki Accords.\n  At the initiative of Professor Yuri Orlov, a physicist by profession \nand a veteran human rights activist, the group joined together 11 \ncommitted individuals to collect and publicize information on Soviet \nviolations of the human rights provisions enshrined in the Helsinki \nAccords. The group monitored fundamental rights and freedoms, including \nfreedom of movement and freedom of religion, as well as the basic \nrights of minorities.\n  The group documented evidence of systemic human rights abuses and \nprovided reports of Helsinki violations to the Presidium of the Supreme \nSoviet and the embassies of Helsinki signatory countries in Moscow. \nAdditionally, these reports were widely distributed to Western \ncorrespondents. All together, the Moscow Helsinki Group published 195 \nnumbered reports, along with numerous other documents, some of them in \ncooperative initiatives with other human rights organizations. These \nreports played a critical role in documenting the Soviet Union's \nfailure to adhere to many of its Helsinki commitments.\n  The example set by the Moscow Helsinki Group inspired human rights \nactivists elsewhere in the USSR. Helsinki monitoring groups were \nfounded in Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia, and Armenia, and affiliated \ngroups were also established to combat psychiatric abuse for political \npurposes and to defend religious liberty in Lithuania. As time went on, \nmore brave individuals joined the Moscow Helsinki Group in its pursuit \nof truth and accountability.\n  However, regrettably, the Soviet Government had no intention of \ntolerating the ``assistance'' provided by the Moscow Helsinki Group in \nmonitoring the Soviet Union's adherence to Helsinki commitments. The \nstate-controlled Soviet press launched a campaign of slander against \nthe group. By early 1977, the group's founders, Dr. Yuri Orlov and \nAlexander Ginzburg, a longtime activist who had earlier produced the \ncelebrated ``White Book'' on the trial of writers Andrei Sinyavsky and \nYuli Daniel, had been arrested on political charges. Cyberneticist \nAnatoly ``Natan'' Sharansky and retired geologist Malva Landa were \narrested shortly thereafter. Orlov was sentenced to 7 years in a labor \ncamp and 5 years in internal exile. Ginzburg received 8 years labor \ncamp and 3 years internal exile. Sharansky was sentenced to a total of \n13 years in labor camp and prison, and Landa received 2 years internal \nexile.\n  Other members followed this path into the ``Gulag'' or were forced to \nemigrate. By 1981, KGB pressure had left only three members of the \nMoscow Helsinki Group at liberty in the Soviet Union, and they were \nforced to announce the ``suspension'' of their work. In 1984, one of \nthose three, Dr. Elena Bonner, joined her husband, Dr. Sakharov, in \nforced internal exile in the closed city of Gorky.\n  Tragically, in December 1986, just as the Soviet political system was \nshowing the signs of the exhaustion that would eventually lead to its \ncollapse, Moscow Helsinki Group member Anatoly Marchenko died during a \nhunger strike at Chistopol Prison. Just over 2 months later, hundreds \nof known political and religious prisoners were freed from the Soviet \nprison system.\n  With the advent of Glasnost, the Moscow Helsinki Group was formally \nreestablished in July 1989 by a handful of Helsinki veterans, and \nseveral new members joined their cause. Today, the Moscow Helsinki \nGroup continues to work to defend human rights in post-Soviet Russia. \nAnd while there have been dramatic changes in Russia since the collapse \nof the Soviet Union, the lure of authoritarianism still has a strong \nappeal for some in today's Russia.\n  Mr. President, on the occasion of its 30th anniversary, I \ncongratulate the members and former members of the Moscow Helsinki \nGroup, many of whom, sadly, are no longer with us, for their courage \nand fortitude in the struggle against tyranny. I wish the group \ncontinued success as they work to advance democracy, defend human \nrights, and promote a vigorous civil society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4613-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4613-S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN BRAMLEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the end of this month, John Bramley will \nstep down as provost of the University of Vermont. From a day-to-day \nstandpoint, the provost of a university is more important than the \npresident of a university. The provost is the chief of operations who \nembraces the president's vision and implements ideas into reality. By \nensuring that academics, research, and student life are running \nsmoothly, the provost creates an environment that enriches the lives of \nstudents, faculty, administrators, and the community.\n  As provost of the University of Vermont since 2002, John Bramley has \nnot only excelled as provost, but also set a standard that will serve \nas a benchmark to measure other provosts around the country.\n  I have known John since he came to the University of Vermont from \nEngland in the early 1990s. I believe that John excelled as provost \nbecause of his leadership in earlier positions that he held at the \nuniversity. John is first and foremost an animal science scholar who is \nknown internationally for his groundbreaking research on bovine \nmastitis. He is also an excellent teacher who genuinely enjoys the \ninteraction between and challenges from students--both undergraduate \nand graduate. That became evident when he was recognized with the \nJoseph Carrigan Teaching Award in 1998.\n  John easily made the transition to administrator. He directed the \nuniversity's farm programs, cochaired the agricultural extension \nprograms, chaired the Department of Animal Sciences and, perhaps most \nnotably, was chair of the Faculty Senate--a position held by election \namong his faculty peers.\n  I jokingly think that his early demonstration of these administrative\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\nskills likely led to his demise as being tapped interim provost and \nthen eventually as provost in 2002. And we are so grateful that John \nwas at his position, as this turned out to be a critical time in the \nhistory of the University of Vermont.\n  It is no secret that during the 1990s UVM suffered from several years \nof unstable and rocky leadership. Not surprisingly, such a rapid \nturnover at the helm of a major university led to many problems \nincluding budget shortfalls; low morale among faculty, staff and \nstudents; and, less than stellar relations with the local Burlington \nand statewide communities. The work of both interim president Ed \nColodny and John guided the university to calmer waters during that \ndifficult time, and helped to build a strong and valuable foundation \nfor the incoming president.\n  Under President Fogel's administration, the university has been \nreinvigorated and its prestige restored. I am sure that President Fogel \nwould agree when I say to all my colleagues that we owe much to John \nBramley for bringing the university into this new, promising chapter in \nits history.\n  John is stepping down as provost, but I am glad that I do not have to \nend this speech with a farewell. John will be returning to what I think \nhe enjoys most, his teaching and research. I know he will continue to \nbe an important part of the University of Vermont community and I look \nforward to continuing to see him on campus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4614-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF REPRESENTATIVE TINA FALLON\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize Representative \nEvelyn K. ``Tina'' Fallon upon her retirement from Delaware's House of \nRepresentatives after more than 28 years of dedicated public service. \nKnown to friends and colleagues alike as ``Tina,'' she is a woman with \na kind heart, diverse interests and great abilities. Tina embodies the \nbest of Delaware.\n  Born in Dudley, NC, on September 16, 1917, Tina has experienced \nfirsthand the many changes that Delaware has undergone over the years \nand this level of experience will be difficult, if not impossible, to \nreplace.\n  A longtime resident of Seaford, DE, Tina holds a bachelor of arts \ndegree from Meredith College, located in Raleigh, NC, and a master's \ndegree in education from the University of Delaware. She married her \nhusband, James D. Fallon, Jr., in 1938, and they had four children \ntogether. After James' passing in 1982, Tina continued to raise their \nsons, George, James, William and Howard.\n  Before winning her first campaign when she was 61 years old, an age \nwhen many public servants are ready to retire, Tina worked for more \nthan 25 years as an educator teaching math and science at Seaford High \nSchool. This experience has allowed her to speak with authority about \nDelaware's education system and the many issues that affect Delaware's \nyoung people.\n  Often recognized as the oldest member of the State legislature, Tina \nbrought a wealth of knowledge to Delaware's House of Representatives \nalong with energy and enthusiasm that belied her age. Her life \nexperience gave her an understanding of faith and family values that \ntranscended party slogans and struck an authentic chord in her \nconstituents and everyone who had the pleasure of calling her their \nfriend.\n  Representative Fallon quickly became known as one of Delaware's most \napproachable and hardestworking public officials. Her keen intellect \nand commonsense approach to problem-solving helped her serve her \nconstituents and make Delaware a better place for us all.\n  Tina also served as a mentor for incoming members of Delaware's House \nof Representatives. Her positive attitude and boundless energy set a \nhigh standard for her colleagues to follow. A firm believer in \nacknowledging the hard work and accomplishments of her constituents, \nTina was often seen visiting homes and businesses throughout the 39 \ndistrict while delivering House tributes to those who deserved them.\n  During my time as Governor, I had the honor of naming Representative \nFallon as the ``Travel and Tourism Person of the Year'' in 1998 for her \noutstanding work to promote and develop Delaware's tourism industry. \nDelaware's economic health and many small businesses are better off \nbecause of her efforts to promote the first State's historical and \nnatural attractions. Also in 1998, she was honored by the National \nRepublican Legislators Association as a ``1998 Legislator of the \nYear.'' She was one of only 10 people across the Nation to receive this \nhonor.\n  As a member of the influential Joint Finance Committee, \nRepresentative Fallon helped shape Delaware's multibillion dollar \nannual operating budget. Her ability to work with members of both \nparties made her an invaluable participant in figuring out how best to \nfund the current and future needs of Delaware. Tina also chairs the \nHouse Tourism Committee and is a member of five other committees as \nwell.\n  Following her retirement, Tina plans to spend time with her children \nand grandchildren. After such a distinguished career serving the people \nof Delaware, I am certain that many will agree with me when I say that \nher retirement is well deserved. I thank Tina for her friendship, \napplaud her service, and wish her and her family only the very best in \nall that lies ahead for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4614-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4614-S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n          TEN-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE BUFFALO, WV TOYOTA PLANT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nmilestone in my home State of West Virginia. Ten years ago, in 1996, a \nworld-renowned automobile company, the Toyota Motor Corp., began \nproducing engines and transmissions in my home State, marking the first \nmajor automobile manufacturing plant in West Virginia. In the following \n10 years, Toyota Motor Manufacturing of West Virginia, TMMWV, has never \nstopped expanding. It now employs more than 1,100 people and has \ninvested more than $1 billion in our State.\n  But the story actually begins almost 10 years earlier with a series \nof meetings I had with Dr. Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of Toyota's \nfounder and its visionary leader for much of the 1980s and 1990s. I met \nDr. Toyoda's father, the company founder, during my time in Japan in \nthe 1960s. He soon introduced me to his son, Shoichiro, who would go on \nto steer Toyota into the 21st century, beginning production of the \nLexus line and the Prius hybrid, as well as turning Toyota into a truly \nglobal force in the automobile industry. So in the mid-1980s, very \nearly in my Senate career, I began the long, slow process of trying to \nwoo this great company and great family to invest in West Virginia as a \nkey part of their bold plan for investment in the United States and in \nNorth America.\n  I recall walking through cornfields in Putnam County with the Toyota \nsite selection committee--facing the hurdles of excavation, preparation \nof the site, the narrow valley in Buffalo, highway infrastructure, and \nthe construction of a bridge to reach the site. By the time Toyota \ndecided to make Buffalo its new home, I felt like a full-fledged member \nof that site selection team. The cornfield of those days is now a \nstate-of-the-art manufacturing facility, with a spotless parking lot \noutside for the hundreds of West Virginia workers proud to arrive for \nwork there every day.\n  Many in the company and outside thought this move was a mistake for \nToyota. They thought that transportation of materials and people to and \nfrom Buffalo would be too difficult. They thought that West Virginians \ncould not do the work.\n  But Dr. Toyoda saw what others did not--a strong, smart, and friendly \nworkforce and a great place to do business. Although it took many years \nand a number of meetings with my friend Dr. Toyoda--meetings I now look \nback upon fondly--Toyota finally decided to place a production facility \nin West Virginia, and we held our first of many groundbreaking \ncelebrations here in 1996.\n  Now, Toyota's plant in Buffalo, WV, has gained national and \ninternational renown. It is the single most productive engine and \ntransmission facility in all of North America for 3 years running, \naccording to the Harbour Report, which is the auto industry authority \non manufacturing efficiency and productivity. Toyota has implemented \nmore recommendations from its Buffalo workforce than from most of its\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\nother facilities. In fact, other much larger cities around the country \nare envious of our tremendous success. In The Buffalo News recently, we \nlearned that Buffalo, NY, is looking longingly at Buffalo, WV, and its \nenormous success in the automotive industry.\n  Toyota is now the second largest automobile producer in the world and \nhas expanded six times in West Virginia alone. Our plant has also \nspawned a number of automotive suppliers around the State. Toyota has \nbeen the anchor to what is now a well-developed supply chain for auto \nparts, serving not only Toyota but also other car manufacturers in the \nUnited States. All of this growth has taken West Virginia, in just 10 \nshort years, to its position today as a major center of American \nautomotive manufacturing.\n  The credit for these great accomplishments goes, first and foremost, \nto the men and women of West Virginia, some of whom drive hours a day \nto work at this plant. But Toyota's management in the United States and \nin Japan has given these workers the tools they need to succeed and \nexcel. I extend my gratitude for this coordination and my \ncongratulations for 10 years of hard work and great accomplishments.\n  Again, Mr. President, I commend the workers and Toyota for 10 years \nof operations in West Virginia. This company, which is a worldwide \nmodel for any kind of manufacturing, took a risk on West Virginia. But \ntheir investment has paid enormous dividends, just as I promised my \nfriend Dr. Toyoda it would almost 20 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4615-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIBYA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Libya's experience demonstrates \nthat countries have more to gain by acting responsibly and abiding by \ninternational norms than by seeking weapons of mass destruction. \nHowever, the establishment of diplomatic relations between our \ncountries does not mean that Libya's progress on all fronts has been \nsatisfactory.

As we begin developing a new \nrelationship with Libya, we must continue to press Libya to improve its \nhuman rights record and governance problems, and to address the cases \npending in U.S. courts with regard to its terrorist activities of the \n1980s.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4615-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                  CONGRATULATING BUDRO KENNETH BAISDEN\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I want to congratulate \nBudro Kenneth Baisden and other young, aspiring poets for their poetry \nas part of the Poetry of Rural Places writing competition. Budro \nBaisden comes from southern West Virginia and he has lived in our coal \nfields, surrounded by coal miners and the culture of the coal fields. \nHe participates in the Coalfield Writers, Marshall University Writing \nProject. This month, as the West Virginia winner, he got to travel to \nWashington, DC, for the first time, to accept his award, and to read \nhis poem in the Library of Congress. In his poem, Baisden eloquently \nexpresses the arduous life of a coal miner, the adversity that \noppresses rural Americans, and the acceptance of a life destined to be \nspent underground in the mines. Given the mine tragedies that hit West \nVirginia and other States earlier this year, the spirit and the \nsimplicity of his words implores us to acknowledge the parallel \nexperiences of rural Americans nationwide. The words of this young West \nVirginia poet should inspire us to think about life through the eyes of \na coal miner. It is with great pride that I submit this poem for the \nRecord to share with my colleague and the public.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the poem be printed in the Record.\n  The poem follows:\n\n                    Life Through a Coal Miner's Eyes\n\n     Dark at day\n     Dark at night\n     It never changes\n     That's the mines\n\n     Cold and wet this they know\n     Still they put on their hardhats\n     And go\n\n     No one knows why they seek that hole\n     Deep in the mountains\n     With all that coal\n     To risk their lives for a single light pole\n     That shines through a window of a\n     Coal miner's home\n\n     But there is only one thing that shines so bright\n     Not the light you pass every night\n     It's the smile of their wives\n     When they come home at night\n\n     That's life through a coal miner's eyes.\n\n                                                  --Budro Baisden.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Baisden is one of several students visiting \nWashington for the Poetry of Rural Places program, representing the \nNational Writing Project, NWP, and the Rural School and Community Trust \ninitiatives. Working together in a unique partnership, the NWP and the \nRural School and Community Trust have provided students from rural \nareas nationwide an opportunity to compose and publish original poems \nthat convey their sense of place and vision of life in rural America. \nBeginning with local programs led by writing project sites, the contest \nculminates in a national reading event at the Library of Congress. \nHopefully, this contest will inspire students nationwide to use the \npower of poetry to explore their lives, communities, and futures as \nrural Americans.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to read the other poems written by \nthese young people as they offer a profound vision of life in \ncontemporary rural America.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \nsalute the achievement of four Des Moines police officers who received \nrichly earned recognition from the National Association of Police \nOrganizations last week at the TOP COPS Awards here in Washington.\n  Every year for the past 13 years, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations has presented awards to outstanding law enforcement \nofficers across the country for their actions above and beyond the call \nof duty. This year, Captain Kelly Willis, Sergeant Jeff Edwards, and \nOfficers Chris Hardy and Robert Clark, all of the Des Moines Police \nDepartment, were recognized for their professionalism and valor in \nsaving the life of a teenage robbery suspect.\n  Last winter, when officers attempted to stop a stolen vehicle being \ndriven, the suspect, a teenager from Nebraska, abandoned the vehicle \nand attempted to swim across the icy waters of the Des Moines River. \nSergeant Edwards and Officer Hardy realized the teen was in trouble \nwhen the suspect grew tired and his head went under water. They \nunderstood the risks of entering the frigid river; nonetheless, they \njumped in after the teen and attempted to pull him ashore. Captain \nWillis and Officer Clark also entered the river to assist with the \nrescue. After pulling the teenager to shore, Officer Clark performed \nCPR on the unconscious teen, who was taken to the hospital in critical \ncondition but eventually recovered.\n  I congratulate these four public servants for their courageous \nactions last winter. Law enforcement officers are often required to \nmake life-or-death decisions in a split second. This requires superb \ntraining and excellent judgment, which these four officers clearly \npossess in abundance. The people of Des Moines are very fortunate to be \nserved by such outstanding professionals. I thank these four officers \nfor their service, and I congratulate them on their well-deserved \nrecognition by their peers at the TOP COP Awards program last \nweek.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4616-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n                         TRUANCY COURT PROJECT\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Each of them has improved attendance, improved their \nrelationships with their teachers, and most importantly learned the \nvalue of education.\n  It gives me great pleasure to rise with the citizens of Rapid City \nand Ellsworth in congratulating the Truancy Court Project students for \ntheir successful participation in the program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4616-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4616-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4616-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 4:00 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby one of its clerks, announced that the Speaker has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4297.

A bill to amend the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of \n1977 to improve the safety of mines and mining; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions I am pleased to announce today \nthe introduction of comprehensive legislation designed to make our \nNation's mines and miners safer--the Mine Improvement and New Emergency \nResponse Act of 2006, the MINER Act. I am particularly pleased to note \nthat the MINER Act is the product of a truly bipartisan effort that \nincludes Senator Kennedy, the committee's ranking member, Senators \nIsakson and Murray, the chair and ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Workplace Safety, and Senators Rockefeller and Byrd. \nThey have all worked tirelessly to make this bill a reality, and I am \ngrateful for their leadership on this issue and their co-sponsorship of \nthe MINER Act.\n  Mining, and coal mining in particular, is vital to our national and \nlocal economies, and to our national energy security. No aspect of \nmining is more important than protecting the health and safety of those \nwhose hard work fuels the industry.\n  This year our Nation has experienced tragic losses in the coal mines \nof West Virginia. Following the accident at the Sago mine, Senators \nIsakson, Kennedy, Rockefeller, and I traveled to West Virginia to meet \nwith the families of those miners whose lives were lost. We were all \ndeeply moved by that experience, and committed to do our best to ensure \nthat such tragedies will not be repeated. To further that commitment, \nwe have sought the views of experts and stakeholders on a wide range of \nmine safety issues and have conducted hearings and roundtables on such \nissues as mine safety technology. In the MINER Act, we have done much \nto reach our common goal of safeguarding the lives of all those who \nwork in our Nation's mines.\n\n  The legislation we introduce today addresses the issue of mine safety \nin a variety of ways. First, the MINER Act would require the \ndevelopment of mine-specific emergency response plans that incorporate \nsafety and technology provisions designed to enhance miner safety. In \nthe area of technology, in particular, the MINER Act recognizes that as \nsafety technology evolves, so, too, must our approach. Thus, the plans \nthat are initially developed must be periodically modified to reflect \nsuch changes.\n  Second, the MINER Act recognizes the critical role of mine rescue \nteams, and those who serve on them, in enhancing the safety of miners. \nThe legislation directs the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations \nthat will make new provisions for mine rescue teams, and it creates \nliability protection for those who serve on those teams and their \nemployers.\n  Third, the MINER Act recognizes that in emergencies the ability to \ncraft a prompt response is dependent upon prompt notification. Thus, \nthe MINER Act provides that in the case of serious life-threatening \naccidents notification must be made to Federal Mine Safety officials \nwithin 15 minutes.\n  Fourth, the legislation recognizes that despite all efforts, \naccidents may occur in the future, and that in those instances MSHA \nshould be prepared to provide assistance to and communicate with the \nfamilies of those affected. Accordingly, the MINER Act requires MSHA to \nestablish a policy to meet both of these objectives.\n  Fifth, the legislation recognizes the key role of technology in \nimproving mine safety and the key role of the National Institute of \nOccupational Safety and Health in advancing such technological \ndevelopment. The MINER Act establishes an Office of Mine Safety within \nNIOSH, a NIOSH-administered grant and contract program designed to \nfoster the development and manufacture of new mine safety equipment, \nand a NIOSH-chaired interagency working group designed to facilitate \nthe transfer of technology that may be adaptable to mine usage from \nsuch other Federal sources as the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, NASA, the Department of Defense. The bill also contains \nprovisions to streamline the testing of new technologies.\n  Sixth, the MINER Act recognizes there are some areas regarding \ntechnology and engineering and mining practice about which uncertainty \nremains. The MINER Act recognizes that such issues are better addressed \nwith the informed assistance of experts. Thus, the MINER Act creates a \ntechnical study panel to review the belt air issue and directs further \nNIOSH study and testing regarding refuge chambers. It also requires the \nSecretary to utilize the regulatory process to issue final regulations \nregarding the strength of seals used in abandoned mining sections. \nThese directives do not prejudge the issues or dictate any result or \naction. They do, however, provide an important means of developing a \nbody of expert opinion with regard to these Issues.\n\n  Seventh, throughout the development of this legislation my long-held \nview that the vast majority of mine operators take their safety \nresponsibilities with great seriousness has been reinforced. The \nconscientious efforts of mine operators throughout the country have \nbeen the principal reason behind our continual improvement in mine \nsafety over the years. We must recognize this essential fact even as we \nmust also recognize that there are a handful of operators who do not \nfall in this camp. In the instance of these ``bad actors,'' the MINER \nAct provides tools MSHA can use to more readily deal with those who \nfail to pay civil penalties. The MINER Act codifies a tenfold increase \nin the available criminal penalties, and it creates an increased \nmaximum for flagrant violators in line with the administration's \nproposal and creates minimum penalties for the most serious types of \ninfractions.\n  Lastly, the legislation recognizes that training and education play a \ncritical role in the effort to make mines and miners safer. Therefore, \nthe legislation contains scholarship provisions to address the \nanticipated shortages of trained miners and MSHA personnel as well as \nfostering the skills of those who will work on the next generation of \nmine safety technology. It also contains provisions for the \nestablishment of a program to provide a full range of mine safety \ntraining grants.\n  These steps, when taken together, will help make our nation's mines a \nsafer workplace today and in years to come.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my honor today to join \nwith several of my distinguished colleagues to introduce S. 2803, the \nMine Improvement and New Emergency Response,\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\nMINER Act of 2006. This is the first time Congress has taken a critical \nlook at mine safety since the 1970s. It will be the first significant \nupdate of statutory mine safety standards in a generation. The advances \nin this legislation represent long overdue health and safety \nimprovements for our Nation's miners. The MINER Act will affect every \nmine and every miner in the country. When fully implemented by the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration, MSHA, and coal operators, the MINER \nAct will make the men and women who work in our Nation's coal mines \nsafer than they have ever been.\n  Like many Americans, I was transfixed by the coverage of the tragic \nevents at the Sago Mine in Upshur County, WV, this past January. My \nheart went out to the families of the miners as they waited and prayed \nfor--and were cruelly denied--a happy ending. Except for the brief \nelation when we learned of Randal McCloy's miraculous survival, we were \nall heartbroken by the devastating outcome. Because these were miners \nand families in my State of West Virginia and because for years I lived \nand worked in nearby Buckhannon, the tragedy at Sago hit very close to \nhome for me. For current and retired miners and their families across \nthe country, the deaths of the Sago miners were very much the deaths of \nbrothers.\n  When two more miners went missing after a fire in the Alma No. 1 mine \nnear Melville, in Logan County, WV, I knew my place was there with the \nfamilies. There was little that could be done to ease the anxiety of \nthe miners' families while they waited and prayed together in the \nchurch in Melville, having themselves lived through the Sago tragedy. \nThat day, I was standing with Governor Manchin at the mine mouth and we \ngot the news that no one wanted to hear. We returned to the church to \nbe with the families when they heard the words that crushed their hopes \nfor another miracle. No parent or spouse should have to live through a \nmoment like that ever again. It was clear that better mine safety \nregulation was essential.\n  One positive consequence of the broad news coverage of the Sago and \nAlma tragedies was that the world got a glimpse of West Virginia at its \nbest: people who work hard, love their families, and trust in their \nGod. My trip to Upshur County to meet with the families--and then the \nimmensely sad and too-familiar repeat 2 weeks later to sit and to \ngrieve with families of the Alma miners in Logan County--inspired what \nI hope will be a more lasting and tangible result. It became my mission \nto substantially improve and make more rigorous health and safety \nstandards in American coal mines. I believe the MINER Act is \nlegislation that will fulfill those goals and is the very least we can \ndo as we recall the Sago and Alma miners, as well as those who lost \ntheir lives at the Longbranch No. 18, Black Castle, Candice No. 2, and \nJacob No. 1 mines in West Virginia and at other mines in Kentucky, \nUtah, Alabama, and Maryland just this year.\n  The MINER Act amends the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 \nto do the following:\n  Requires companies to submit to MSHA emergency preparedness and \nresponse plans, including requirements to deploy state-of-the-art \ntechnologies for two-way communications, miner tracking, improved \nbreathing apparatuses, and lifelines. These improvements must be made \nimmediately wherever feasible and no later than 3 years after \nenactment. Each miner must have enough breathable air accessible to \nlast for a sustained period of time.\n  Requires coal operators to supply miners with additional supplies of \nbreathable air, both in working sections of coal mines and at intervals \non escapeways so miners can walk out in the event of a disaster.\n  Increases training on self-rescuers to make sure that technologies \nare properly deployed in the mine as soon as they become available.\n  Requires operators to notify MSHA within 15 minutes of a disaster or \nface up to $60,000 in penalties.\n  Improves the overall safety of miners by strengthening mine rescue \nteam requirements for all underground mines. Now at least one miner per \nshift will have to be sufficiently familiar with the mine's operations \nto serve as a coordinator in the even of an accident, more miners will \nbe rescue-trained, and response time will be cut in half--down to 1 \nhour.\n  Requires NIOSH to conduct research, including field testing, of \nrefuge chambers and could result in the Secretary issuing a new \nregulation to require them.\n  Creates an Office of Mine Safety in NIOSH to distribute mine safety \nresearch and development grants and to coordinate with other Government \nagencies on technology they use that might be adapted for mine safety \npurposes.\n  Establishes a family liaison position for post-accident assistance to \nminers' families.\n  Creates for the first time a schedule of higher minimum penalties for \nthe most egregious health and safety violations--essentially doubling \nfines for serious violations.\n  Tightens up MSHA fine collection procedures and gives MSHA new \nauthority to shut down mines for failure to pay persistent violations.\n  Requires the Secretary of Labor to improve standards for seals in \nabandoned areas of underground coal mines.\n  Establishes a technical study panel made up of scientists and health \nand safety experts to review and report to the Secretaries of Labor and \nHealth and Human Services on the use of ``belt air'' and the \nreplacement of worn belts with fire-resistant materials.\n  Creates three scholarship programs: for community college study in \nbasic safety and mine skills for new miners; for college-level study \nleading toward employment with MSHA; and college and graduate study in \nmining-related disciplines.\n\n  Creates the Brookwood-Sago Mine Safety Grants Program in the \nDepartment of Labor to fund education and training programs designed to \nidentify, avoid, and prevent unsafe working conditions in and around \nmines.\n  While television allowed the entire globe to look in on the 24-hour-\na-day vigils at Sago and then Alma, I received a number of calls of \nsupport and condolences from around the country and around the world. \nAmong the first were calls from Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, HELP, Committee chairman Mike Enzi and his ranking Democrat \nmember, Ted Kennedy. Chairman Enzi comes from a coal community in \nWyoming and understands the bond between miners and their families. He \nalso understands the hazards of mining coal, and he has been determined \nfrom the beginning to put out a good bill that can pass this Congress. \nI have known and admired Mike Enzi since he was the mayor of Gillette, \nWY, and I, while Governor of West Virginia, was serving as chairman of \nPresident Carter's Coal Commission. He is a fine and honest man, and it \nhas been a pleasure to work with him on this vitally important \nlegislation.\n  As for Senator Kennedy, with the exception of his home State of \nMassachusetts, there can be few places where his long career in the \nSenate has had more positive impacts than in my State of West Virginia. \nBoth Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi expressed to me their heartfelt \nsorrow and their unshakable commitment to work with me on mine safety \nlegislation in this Congress.\n  That commitment had its first demonstration when Chairman Enzi, \nSenator Kennedy, and HELP Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee \nchairman Johnny Isakson joined me on a trip to Upshur County so they \ncould sit with the families of the Sago miners, as well as with \nsurvivors of the accident and company officials. Few meetings that I \nhave attended in my public career were as powerful as the more than 2 \nhours we spent with the Sago families. But the commitment has been \nproven beyond all doubt as Chairman Enzi and Senators Kennedy, Isakson, \nMurray, and Byrd have worked with me to negotiate the MINER Act over \nthe course of the last several months.\n  We have had some differences of opinion and worked through issues in \nwhich we were all trying to accomplish the same goal but from \noccasionally different angles. The good will and conscientiousness that \nChairman Enzi and Senator Isakson have shown in this process give me \nhope for greater bipartisan cooperation in the future. I am extremely \ngrateful to them for their willingness to work through our honest \ndifferences.\n  While I believe the MINER Act will result in greatly improved safety \nin\n\n[[Page S4621]]\n\nour mines, it is not the last word in health and safety protections for \nthe men and women who work underground. More aggressive measures on \nmine safety may be needed. Chairman Enzi has produced a very good bill, \nbut I would have included more definitive language to push the \nintroduction of emergency refuge chambers in mines, and I would have \nprevented the use of belt air anywhere its use presents an unreasonable \nhazard to miners. In any event, miners should not have to wait much \nlonger for Congress to act. Legislating can be a slow process, but in \ntimes of crisis--and I believe we are in a time of crisis in our \nmines--Congress must act.\n  As we work to move this legislation through Congress, we must commit \nwith equal dedication to ongoing oversight. I believe I have that \ncommitment from the chairman of the HELP Committee. But we need to ask \nmore of the administration also: in resources--real dollars; in a \nrenewed dedication to an inspector workforce weakened by retirements \nand attrition; and in more vigilance on the part of mine inspectors, \nwho must be willing to spend the time in those mines where safety \nconcerns go unabated today. On the front lines, I believe our coal \ncompanies understand that safe mines are productive mines, and our \nminers come to work each day ready and willing to do their jobs in the \nsafest way possible.\n  I commit to work with my cosponsors and all in Congress and the \nadministration who care about miners to get this bill enacted this year \nand to continue to improve mine safety even after the MINER Act \npasses.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Carper, Mr. Talent, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. \n        Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Conrad, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2810.

A bill for the relief of Claudia Marquez Rico; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today private relief \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Claudia \nMarquez Rico, a Mexican national living in Redwood City, CA\n  Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Claudia was brought to the United States by \nher parents 16 years ago. Claudia was just 6 years old at the time. She \nhas two younger brothers, Jose and Omar, who came to America with her, \nand a sister, Maribel, who was born in California and is a U.S. \nCitizen. America is the only home they know.\n  Six years ago that home was visited by tragedy. As Mr. and Mrs. \nMarquez were driving to work early on the morning of October 4, 2000, \nthey were both killed in a horrible traffic accident when their car \ncollided with a truck on an isolated rural road.\n  The children went to live with their aunt and uncle, Hortencia and \nPatricio Alcala. The Alcalas are a generous and loving couple. They are \nU.S. citizens with two children of their own. They took the Marquez \nchildren in and did all they could to comfort them in their grief. They \nsupervised their schooling, and made sure they received the counseling \nthey needed, too. The family is active in their parish at Buen Pastor \nCatholic Church, and Patricio Alcala serves as a youth soccer coach. In \n2001, the Alcalas were appointed the legal guardians of the Marquez \nchildren.\n  Sadly, the Marquez family received bad legal representation. At the \ntime of their parents' death, Claudia and Jose were minors, and \nqualified for special immigrant juvenile status. This category was \nenacted by Congress to protect children like them from the hardship \nthat would result from deportation under such extraordinary \ncircumstances, when a State court deems them to be dependents due to \nabuse, abandonment or neglect. Today, their younger brother Omar is on \ntrack to lawful permanent residence status as a special immigrant \njuvenile. Unfortunately, the family's previous lawyer failed to secure \nthis relief for Claudia, and she has now reached the age of majority \nwithout having resolved her immigration status.\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\n  I should note that their former lawyer, Walter Pineda, is currently \nanswering charges on 29 counts of professional incompetence and 5 \ncounts of moral turpitude for mishandling immigration cases and appears \non his way to being disbarred.\n  I am offering legislation on Claudia's behalf because I believe that, \nwithout it, this family would endure an immense and unfair hardship. \nIndeed, without this legislation, this family will not remain a family \nfor much longer.\n  Despite the adversity they encountered, Claudia and Jose finished \nschool and now work together in a pet grooming store in Redwood City, \nwhere Claudia is the store manager. They support themselves, and they \nare dedicated to their community and devoted to their family. In fact, \nlast year Claudia became the legal guardian of her 14-year-old sister \nMaribel, who lives with her and Jose at their home in Redwood City. \nOmar, now 17 years old, continues to live with the Alcalas so as not to \ninterrupt his studies at Aragon High School in San Mateo. Again, \nMaribel is a U.S. citizen, and Omar is eligible for a green card.\n  Claudia has no close relatives in Mexico. She has never visited \nMexico, and she was so young when she was brought to America that she \nhas no memories of it. How can we expect her to start a new life there \nnow?\n  It would be a grave injustice to add to this family's misfortune by \ntearing these siblings apart. This is a close family, and they have \ncome to rely on each other heavily in the absence of their deceased \nparents. This bill will prevent the added tragedy of another wrenching \nseparation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord along with a letter from Claudia and Jose Marquez Rico.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2813\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR CLAUDIA MARQUEZ \n                   RICO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Claudia Marquez Rico shall be eligible for issuance of \n     an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of an \n     alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon filing \n     an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act or for adjustment of status to lawful \n     permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Claudia Marquez Rico enters \n     the United States before the filing deadline specified in \n     subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered and \n     remained lawfully and, if otherwise eligible, shall be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees not later \n     than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant VISA Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Claudia \n     Marquez Rico, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by 1, during the current or next \n     following fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of the \n     alien's birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of the alien's birth under section \n     202(e) of such Act.\n       (e) Denial of Preferential Immigration Treatment for \n     Certain Relatives.--The natural parents, brothers, and \n     sisters of Claudia Marquez Rico shall not, by virtue of such \n     relationship, be accorded any right, privilege, or status \n     under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et \n     seq.).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  January 3, 2005.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing to request your \n     assistance in introducing a private bill in the United States \n     Senate on our behalf. We are currently in deportation \n     proceedings before the Immigration Court in San Francisco, \n     California. We are twenty-one and eighteen years old \n     respectively. We have two other siblings, Omar, sixteen, and \n     Maribel, twelve.\n       Our parents entered the United States without documents in \n     1990. We were very young at the time and don't remember \n     entering the United States or ever living in Mexico. Our life \n     in the United States is the only thing we have ever known, it \n     is where our family, friends, and community are and have \n     always been.\n       In October 2000 our parents were both killed in a terrible \n     car accident. We were so sad to suddenly not have our parents \n     and scared about what our future would bring. After the \n     accident we went to live with our aunt and uncle, Hortencia \n     and Patricio Alcala, in San Mateo, California and they became \n     our legal guardians. It was difficult to adjust to life \n     without our parents. We lived in a new home, in a new \n     environment, and attended different schools with new people. \n     Everything in our lives had changed.\n       Before their deaths, our parents had a case before the \n     Immigration Court in San Francisco, California and we were \n     included in that case. Our youngest sister Maribel was born \n     here in the United States and so she is a citizen and not \n     part of the case. We know that despite the deaths of our \n     parents that case continues and that we may be deported to \n     Mexico. We have a lawyer who is trying to help us with our \n     case, Angela Bean. She said she will be able to help our \n     brother Omar in his case because he is still a minor but that \n     there are few options for us to remain in the United States \n     legally. We are trying to find a solution for our case but \n     are scared we may be deported before we are able to do so.\n       Our parents came to this country because they wanted a \n     better future for us and all we want is the chance to have \n     the kind of opportunities they sought for us. Jose Elvis \n     wants to study mechanics and then open his own shop and \n     Claudia wants to go to college. All of our dreams would be \n     lost if we had to return to Mexico. We have no family there \n     and no way of supporting ourselves. Even though we were born \n     there, we came to the United States at such a young age it's \n     as if we have never been there before.\n       We not only worry about our future, but about our sister \n     Maribel if we were forced to go back to Mexico. She is the \n     youngest and we want to be here for her as she grows up and \n     to protect her and teach her things. All we have is each \n     other now and we don't want to be separated from the family \n     we have left.\n       We ask for your help so that we can remain in the United \n     States and so we can continue to grow and be surrounded by \n     the people and places we know and love, Our lives have been \n     very difficult since the deaths of our parents and we hope \n     that we can remain in this country where we have the \n     opportunities our parents wanted for us and the family \n     support that we need.\n           Sincerely,\n     Claudia Marquez-Rico.\n     Jose Elvis Marquez-Rico.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2815. A bill to establish the Commission on Economic Indicators to \nconduct a study and submit a report containing recommendations \nconcerning the appropriateness and accuracy of the methodology, \ncalculations, and reporting used by the Government relating to certain \neconomic indicators; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to improve the \nway we measure the condition of America's economy. My bill, the \nEconomic Indicators Commission Act of 2006, would establish a \nnonpartisan commission of experts to make recommendations concerning \nthe appropriateness and accuracy of the methodology, calculations, and \nreporting of the government's economic statistics. I am joined in this \neffort by Representative Emanuel in the other body.\n  The statistics that describe our economy provide essential \ninformation and guidance for private market actors and public \npolicymakers. Statistics like Gross Domestic Product, GDP, the \ninflation rate, and the unemployment rate help investors decide how to \nallocate their money, help entrepreneurs decide whether to start a new \nbusiness, and help job-seekers decide where to look for new \nopportunities. Policymakers ranging from central bankers to elected \nofficials rely on the same statistics to make informed decisions about \nmonetary and fiscal policy and public sector investments.\n  Yet while we rely on these indicators, we know that they paint an \nimperfect picture. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, for example, \nreports two separate measures of employment, which, as many of us may \nremember, created some controversy in 2003 and 2004 when they provided \nconflicting assessments of our economy's health. The BLS's two series \nnever match up perfectly, but at one point, one measure showed a loss \nof 1 million jobs since the recession's official end in November 2001, \nwhile the other reported an increase of 1.4 million. The 2004 Economic \nReport of the President called such a large and sustained divergence \n``unprecedented.''\n  Ben Bernanke, now Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\ndescribed well the challenge of relying on imperfect indicators in a \n2004 speech to the National Economists Club in Washington, DC. In the \nspeech, Dr. Bernanke made light of a common analogy used to describe \nAmerican monetary policy, which compares the Federal Reserve's Federal \nOpen Market Committee to the driver of a car--the U.S. economy--who \nmust decide whether to tap the accelerator or the brake in order to \nmaintain proper speed. Dr. Bernanke offered a slightly modified \ncomparison: ``[I]f making monetary policy is like driving a car,'' he \nsaid, ``then the car is one that has an unreliable speedometer, a foggy \nwindshield, and a tendency to respond unpredictably and with delay to \nthe accelerator or the brake.''\n  While our economic statistics will likely never provide perfect, \nreal-time gauges of our economy's performance, that does not mean we \nshould cease seeking to improve them. Chairman Bernanke's predecessor \nat the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, was known for his search for \ninsight not only by reading economic data, but also by knowing its \nlimitations and pushing for better ways to measure what was happening \nin the national and global economies. As Chairman Greenspan recognized \nin a speech to the American Economic Association on January 3, 2004, \n``the economic world in which we function is best described by a \nstructure whose parameters are continuously changing.''\n  Chairman Greenspan makes an important point. As our economy evolves, \nso too should our methods for measuring it. In a recent Business Week \ncover story, reporter Michael Mandel outlines one example of how modem \nfeatures of the 21st century economy may be challenging the accuracy of \ntraditional economic indicators. America's economy, Mandel argues, has \nbecome increasingly ``knowledge-based,'' driven by intangible \ninvestments in addition to the production of tangible goods. \nIntangibles, however, are notoriously difficult to measure, so as a \nresult, our traditional indicators may be leaving out a growing portion \nof the economic picture. If intangibles truly are growing in \nimportance, our statistics must better account for them in order to \nprovide a full and accurate measure of economic activity.\n  Intangibles aren't the only economic factor that our current \nindicators may not capture accurately. Researchers in academic and \npublic policy institutions have also questioned the way we measure \npoverty in America. They suggest that the government's use of \n``reported household income'' as the primary measurement tool does not \nproperly account for regional differences in the cost of living or \nnoncash items such as food stamps. As a result, we may be \nsystematically undercounting the number of Americans living in poverty, \nespecially those living in high-cost areas. Mr. President, if we as a \nNation are going to effectively fight the scourge of poverty, we must \nknow where to aim and have the ability to measure our progress.\n  Properly accounting for intangibles and developing more realistic \nstandards of poverty represent only two of the many challenges we face \nin improving the way we measure our economy. Public servants at each of \nour government statistical agencies, along with independent \nresearchers, are working continuously and diligently to better the \ntechniques for collecting and reporting information. But the challenge \nis to bring these efforts together in a larger, coordinated context, \nwith the mission to fundamentally re-examine the way we measure \neconomic activity and our progress as a society.\n  The legislation I introduce today, the Economic Indicators Commission \nAct of 2006, will achieve this goal. It establishes a nonpartisan panel \nof eight experts appointed by Senate and House leadership, in \nconsultation with the chairman and ranking members of the Banking and \nFinance Committees in the Senate, the Financial Services and Ways and \nMeans Committees in the House, and the Joint Economic Committee. The \nbill directs the Commission to consult with both users and reporters of \ndata, such as the Federal Reserve and Council of Economic Advisers and \nthe Commerce and Labor Departments, and report its findings and \nrecommendations to the Congress within 12 months.\n  In order to formulate effective policy and improve market efficiency, \nwe need a full and accurate picture of the economy. Our economic data \nhas the power to literally move markets; it influences billions of \ndollars worth of investment and public policy decisions. The \nlegislation I introduce today will help Americans make more informed \ndecisions by improving these statistics. Going back to Chairman \nBenanke's joke about the analogy of the economy as a difficult-to-drive \ncar, this bill will help drivers de-fog the windshield and upgrade the \nspeedometer, for the benefit of all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan income tax credit for the manufacture of flexible fuel motor \nvehicles and to extend and increase the income tax credit for \nalternative fuel refueling property, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Today, I am introducing, along with Senators Lugar, \nJohnson, Dorgan and Biden, tax legislation that is designed to \ncomplement the Biofuels Security Act of 2006, also being introduced \ntoday. I will walk through these provisions very briefly.\n  The legislation amends the existing tax credit for installing \nalternative fueling infrastructure, such as E85 fueling pumps and tanks \nwhich was enacted as part of last year's energy bill. That existing \nprovision allows a tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of \ninstallation, with a maximum credit of $30,000. Our bill modifies this \ncredit in three ways. First, we would eliminate availability of the \ncredit for the large oil companies that would be required to install \nsuch E85 pumps under the companion Biofuels Security Act. These \ncompanies have the financial wherewithal to install these pumps without \nthe need for a tax credit. Second, for retailers who would not be \nrequired to install E85 pumps and tanks under our proposed legislation, \nour bill would enhance the tax credit to 50 percent of the cost of \ninstallation, with a maximum credit of $30,000. Third, for small \nretailers, that is, those with 5 or fewer stations, our bill would \nincrease the credit to 75 percent of the cost of installation, up to a \nmaximum credit of $45,000.\n  This tax legislation would also create a new consumer tax credit for \nthe purchase of flexfuel vehicles if the vehicles have no fuel \nefficiency loss from the use of E85 as compared to regular gasoline. \nCurrent flex-fuel models do have some mileage loss. We understand that \nthere is technology available--for example, a Saab ``biofuel'' flex-\nfuel E-85 vehicle on the market in parts of Europe--allowing vehicles \nto have no fuel efficiency loss when burning E85 in comparison to \ngasoline, and perhaps even some mileage gain. The tax incentive we \npropose here will help foster further development of biofuels-related \ntechnology and promote better fuel efficiency as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join Senators Harkin, Lugar, and \nDorgan in introducing a broad package of initiatives to jump-start the \ndistribution of renewable fuels, empower consumers, and achieve our \nlong-standing goal of displacing foreign sources of energy.\n  The Biofuels Security Act of 2006 stakes out three broad approaches \ntoward increasing production of renewable fuels and connecting the \ninfrastructure required to deliver biofuels to a new fleet of flexible \nfuel vehicles. In combination these policies can extend home-grown \nrenewable fuels to a predominate place in America's energy mix.\n  The Biofuels Security Act of 2006 moves forward to aggressively \nincrease the amount of renewable fuels used in the marketplace to a \nrequirement of 60 billion gallons in 2030. Our approach is phased \nthrough a realistic and technically feasible glide path beginning with \na 10 billion gallon requirement in 2010, escalating to 30 billion \ngallons in 2020 and doubling that standard in the final decade. \nExisting ethanol capacity is anticipated to grow by approximately 30 \npercent in 2006, from 4.4 billion gallons to 6.3 billion gallons by the \nend of 2006. Domestic ethanol production is meeting demand and ethanol \nfrom corn has the capability of producing upwards of another 10 to 15 \nbillion gallons in the next decade. As ethanol production from corn \nmatures, new feedstocks, such as switch grass will compliment corn as a \ndriver toward ethanol production. Setting benchmarks and creating long-\nterm market stability through a demand-driven standard will ensure a \ncompetitive biofuel market and help drive down the cost of gasoline and \nother refined products that pinch consumer budgets.\n  Tying together future demand are 2 sets of standards and incentives \nthat will transform the availability of higher blends of ethanol fuels. \nOur bipartisan approach requires auto manufactures to produce vehicles \nthat can run on higher blends of renewable fuels. Flexible fuel \nvehicles are capable of optimal performance with high ethanol blended \nfuels, such as E85--a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent \ngasoline. Auto manufacturers are gradually\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\nmoving toward production methods that can inexpensively modify trucks \nand cars to perform at the highest standards on E85 fuel. The Nation \nlacks, however, a long-term policy that sets benchmarks and targets to \nmanufacture dual-fueled vehicles. Today, there are approximately 6 \nmillion dual-fueled vehicles in the United States, a small fraction of \nthe 230 million gasoline an diesel-fueled vehicles filling our roads. \nThrough introducing this bill we are committing to the public that a \ndecade after enactment of the Biofuels Security Act all vehicles sold \nin the in the United States will be dual-fueled vehicles providing \nmaximum performance on all fuel blends.\n  The second basket of requirements and incentives is targeted toward \nensuring that as Americans purchase dual-fueled vehicles that the \nfueling infrastructure is in place to meet the demand. Retail gasolene \nstations that market E85 and B20--diesel fuel mixed with biodiesel and \npetroleum diesel fuel--are few and far between. Fuel distributors and \nretail station owners who want to market E85 are often locked out \nthrough contractual agreements with big oil companies offering certain \nfuel blends. Accordingly, most gasoline marketers offering E85 are \nindependent distributors and station owners that understand the \ncompetitive advantage from distributing alternative fuels. The Biofuels \nSecurity Act ties together dual-fueled vehicles with refueling \ninfrastructure through an enhanced tax credit of 75 percent capped at \n$45,000 for the installation of refueling equipment for small business \ngas station owners. The credit is phased-back to 50 percent and capped \nat $30,000 for larger retail gasoline station owners. Our goal is that \nin a decade at least 40 percent of all retail gasoline stations include \nan alternative fuel pump.\n  The Biofuels Security Act of 2006 builds upon the strong consumer \ndemand pushing our country toward portfolio of biofuels--ethanol, \nbiodiesel--from diversified feedstocks grown and refined throughout the \ncountry. Combining a long-term renewable fuel requirement to \ninfrastructure and vehicle preference can decrease our reliance on \nimported energy sources and lower consumer energy costs. All 3 of these \npieces need to move in concert in order to maximize the transition from \na hydrocarbon-based society to a more balanced and sustainable model.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, \n        and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 2817. A bill to promote renewable fuel and energy security of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, high prices for gasoline, diesel fuel and \nother petroleum-based energy continue to cause pain for millions of \npeople, in Iowa and all across the country. Our dependence on foreign \noil is a clear and present danger to our national security.\n  If we are serious about national security, we need a bold national \ncommitment to renewable energy--a commitment on par with the Apollo \nmoon-shot program in the 1960s. Today, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar in proposing a major component of \nsuch a program--the Biofuels Security Act--a comprehensive plan to \nramp-up ethanol and biodiesel production, and to make it available and \nusable at the pump in every State in America.\n  Perhaps Senator Lugar said it best earlier this year when he \ncommented that energy is the albatross around the neck of U.S. national \nsecurity. The distinguished senior Senator from Indiana has been a \nthoughtful, prescient thinker about the national security implications \nof our addiction to foreign oil, and I am delighted to be joining with \nhim, today.\n  Senators Johnson, Dorgan and Biden are also original cosponsors of \nthis legislation, for which I am grateful. The Senators have been \noutspoken champions of biofuels for many years now, and strong \nadvocates for their home States.\n  The goal of this legislation is to help restore America's energy \nsecurity--which, in this day and age, is synonymous with national \nsecurity. Transportation fuels, accounting for two-thirds of our oil \nimports, are the place to start this transition.\n  Our plan has three key components. First, we are proposing a \nsubstantially higher, but achievable, renewable fuels standard or RFS, \nrequiring that our Nation blend into the gasoline supply 10 billion \ngallons of renewable fuel annually by the year 2010, 30 billion gallons \nof renewable fuel annually by the year 2020 and 60 billion gallons \nannually in the year 2030. The current RFS is 7.5 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuels in 2012. At the time we enacted the present RFS in last \nyear's energy bill, many of us believed this was a reasonably ambitious \nschedule. However, it is now evident that biofuels growth will outpace \nthis figure within the next couple of years--well in advance of the \n2012 target date. This is very good news.\n  Second, our plan would make E85--the blend of gasoline and 85 percent \nethanol--available at gas stations all across America. Major oil \ncompanies would be required to increase the number of E85 pumps at \ntheir stations by 5 percentage points annually. Within a decade, \napproximately 25 percent of gas stations nationwide would be required \nto have E85 pumps.\n  The major oil companies have the financial wherewithal--and the \nability--to provide E85 infrastructure at a growing percentage of \ngasoline stations over the next decade. This is a reasonable, \nresponsible reinvestment of a fraction of their recent earnings in the \nmany billions of dollars. The bottom line is that our domestic oil \ncompanies have a shared responsibility to help enhance our energy \nsecurity, and this is one excellent way for them to contribute.\n  Third, our plan would make flex-fuel vehicles nearly universal in the \nUnited States. Automakers would be required to increase the production \nof flex-fuel vehicles--capable of using both gasoline and 85 percent \nethanol blends--by 10 percentage points annually, until nearly all new \nvehicles sold in the U.S. are flex-fuel within a decade. Our \nlegislation calls for all of the auto manufacturers to produce \nincreasing numbers of FFVs, rising to 100 percent of vehicles 10,000 \npounds or less over the next decade. This is eminently achievable, and \nprobably easy enough to do much sooner than that.\n  Recent estimates for the extra cost of manufacturing an FFV are as \nlow as $30. It is a matter of modifying the engine, fuel line and \nadding a fuel sensor, which most vehicles have anyway. That is less \nexpensive than many other federal requirements for the auto industry. \nAir bags are more expensive, for instance. And the bottom line is FFVs \nare being sold for the same price as regular cars.\n  America's dependence on foreign oil is the source of so many of our \nproblems, today. We are transferring vast amounts of wealth to regimes \nthat are not friendly to our interests. We are vulnerable to price \nhikes and embargoes. Millions of petrodollars are finding their way \ninto the hands of terrorists and other extremists. And we are \naccelerating the pace of global warming.\n  Substituting biofuels for oil in the transportation sector won't \nsolve these problems overnight, but it will make a difference, and a \npotentially dramatic one in the longer run.\n  Let me mention a few eye-opening facts and figures to illustrate \nthese points. The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's \npopulation, but we consume 25 percent of the world's oil. If crude oil \nprices remain above $60 a barrel this year, we will spend well over \n$300 billion on oil imports. Projections indicate that, over the next \n25 years, world demand for energy will grow by 50 percent. All of this \ngrowth in energy use, of course, contributes to dangerously rising \nlevels of greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The reality is that gasoline is much more costly than most Americans \nrealize, even at $3 a gallon. According to a recent study entitled the \n``The Hidden Cost of Oil,'' gas really costs more than $10 a gallon. \nThis is because of all the costs we don't factor into its price at the \npump, including wars, other military expenses, subsidies, and so on.\n  There is no question that the ambitious goals set forth in this bill \nare achievable.\n  Several decades ago, Brazil committed itself to a similar course. \nRenewable fuels have played a big part in Brazil's achieving energy \nindependence. Currently, ethanol production in\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nthe U.S. is increasing by 25 percent annually. If we sustain that rate \nof increase, we will be able to reach the aggressive renewable fuels \nstandard in the Harkin-Lugar plan. In fact, we will be able to beat it.\n  For example, Brazil, years ago directed that all gasoline stations \ncarry ethanol as an alternative fuel. Our legislation would require the \nmajor oil companies to do their share by installing E85 pumps over the \nnext decade. This should not pose too much of a challenge or burden.\n  Another key to Brazil's success is the fact that, in just 3 years' \ntime, nearly 70 percent of new vehicles sold there are flex-fuel \nvehicles. We are asking the auto companies to accomplish a similar goal \nof nearly universal production, only we are giving them a decade to \nphase in the production and sale of flex-fuel vehicles. Most of the \ncompanies that sell vehicles in the United States also sell them in \nBrazil. If they can produce flex-fuel vehicles for Brazil, they can \nalso produce them for the United States.\n  Let me explain in more detail why what Senator Lugar and I are \nproposing can be accomplished.\n  The 10 billion gallon goal can certainly be met by 2010. The ethanol \nindustry will produce more than 4.5 billion gallons this year. There \nare 97 ethanol plants in operation, with 35 more coming on-line in the \nnear future. Biodiesel production is growing remarkably, as well, at \nmore than 60 plants nationwide.\n  The 30-billion-gallon and 60-billion-gallon targets are attainable, \nas well. A joint study by the Department of Agriculture and the \nDepartment of Energy found that biofuels could supply 60 billion \ngallons of renewable fuels a year--30 percent of current U.S. gasoline \nconsumption--on existing lands without any disruption to our food or \nfeed supply.\n  The key to ramping-up production will be commercializing ethanol made \nfrom feedstocks in addition to corn and other grains, including corn \nstover, straw from wheat and other crops, switchgrass or even trees. \nThere are a host of provisions that I and others authored in the energy \nbill-- ranging from loan guarantees to increased biomass research and \ndevelopment--to make cellulosic ethanol production a reality.\n  Currently, at least three companies are planning commercial-scale \ncellulosic ethanol plants. They could be operating within the next 2 to \n3 years. One company, Iogen, has the backing of Shell Oil. Just 2 weeks \nago, according to reports, Iogen received a cash infusion from Goldman \nSachs. By setting an ambitious new RFS, with a sufficient lead time, I \nbelieve the 60-billion-gallon threshold is not only attainable, but \nbeatable.\n  In any case, should something unexpected happen to interfere with \nreaching these benchmarks, the Environmental Protection Agency has, \nwithin the existing RFS, authority to waive the requirement in whole or \nin part based on a finding of insufficient supply.\n  If we take bold actions to guarantee the fuel supply, if we increase \nthe number of flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on E85, and if we \nincrease the infrastructure ofE85 pumps, we will be poised to usher in \na new era of energy security much sooner than previously imagined. That \nis the foundation we lay in this legislation.\n  This bill would also require that 100 percent of new vehicles \npurchased for federal fleets be alternative-fueled vehicles, which \ncould include flex-fuel vehicles. The current requirement is 75 \npercent. I do not see why we shouldn't expect the federal government to \nbe as aggressive as possible in this area.\n  Last year's energy bill closed a loophole in the purchasing \nrequirement that had allowed agencies to buy alternative-fuel vehicles \nbut not use alternative fuels such as E85. That was a step forward. \nRequiring all the federal fleet to be alternative fueled is yet another \nstep forward in having the Federal Government lead by example when it \ncomes to alternative fuels.\n  We also update the Gasohol Competition Act of 1980, legislation \ndesigned many years ago to ensure the reasonable availability of \nethanol at the pump, so it applies to high blends such as E85 and so \nthat oil companies cannot prevent a franchisee from installing E85 \npumps.\n  The concern back then, and still today, is that petroleum companies \nwere unreasonably preventing or prohibiting ethanol-blended fuels from \nbeing offered at gasoline stations. The Gasohol Competition Act did two \nthings. First, it made it unlawful to charge additional credit card \nfees for gasohol. Second, it prohibited unreasonable discrimination \nagainst the sale of gasohol.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The origin of the United States is that of a land of \n     refuge. Many of our Nation's founders fled here to escape \n     persecution for their political opinion, their ethnicity, and \n     their religion. Since that time, the United States has \n     honored its history and founding values by standing against \n     persecution around the world, offering refuge to those who \n     flee from oppression, and welcoming them as contributors to a \n     democratic society.\n       (2) The right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution is \n     a universal human right and fundamental freedom articulated \n     in numerous international instruments endorsed by the United \n     States, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     as well as the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of \n     Refugees and its 1967 Protocol and the Convention Against \n     Torture. United States law also guarantees the right to seek \n     asylum and protection from return to territories where one \n     would have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of \n     one's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular \n     social group, or political opinion.\n       (3) The United States has long recognized that asylum \n     seekers often must flee their persecutors with false \n     documents, or no documents at all. The second person in \n     United States history to receive honorary citizenship by Act \n     of Congress was Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, in \n     gratitude for his issuance of more than 20,000 false Swedish \n     passports to Hungarian Jews to assist them flee the \n     Holocaust.\n       (4) In 1996, Congress amended section 235(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, to authorize immigration \n     officers to detain and expeditiously remove aliens without \n     proper documents, if that alien does not have a credible fear \n     of persecution.\n       (5) Section 605 of the International Religious Freedom Act \n     of 1998 subsequently authorized the United States Commission \n     on International Religious Freedom to appoint experts to \n     study the treatment of asylum seekers subject to expedited \n     removal.\n       (6) The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security fully \n     cooperated with the Commission, which reviewed thousands of \n     previously unreleased statistics, approximately 1,000 files \n     and records of proceeding related to expedited removal \n     proceedings, observed more than 400 inspections, interviewed \n     200 aliens in expedited removal proceedings at 7 ports of \n     entry, and surveyed 19 detention facilities and all 8 asylum \n     offices. The Commission released its findings on February \n     8, 2005.\n       (7) Among its major findings, the Commission found that, \n     while the Congress, the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service, and the Department of Homeland Security developed a \n     number of processes to prevent bona fide asylum seekers from \n     being expeditiously removed, these procedures were routinely \n     disregarded by many immigration officers, placing the asylum \n     seekers at risk, and undermining the reliability of evidence \n     created for immigration enforcement purposes. The specific \n     findings include the following:\n       (A) Department of Homeland Security procedures require that \n     the immigration officer read a script to the alien that the \n     alien should ask for protection--without delay--if the alien \n     has any reason to fear being returned home. Yet in more than \n     50 percent of the expedited removal interviews observed by \n     the Commission, this information was not conveyed to the \n     applicant.\n       (B) Department of Homeland Security procedures require that \n     the alien review the sworn statement taken by the immigration \n     officer, make any necessary corrections for errors in \n     interpretation, and then sign the statement.\n       The Commission found, however, that 72 percent of the time, \n     the alien signs his sworn statement without the opportunity \n     to review it.\n       (C) The Commission found that the sworn statements taken by \n     the officer are not verbatim, are not verifiable, often \n     attribute that information was conveyed to the alien which \n     was never, in fact, conveyed, and sometimes contain questions \n     which were never asked. These sworn statements look like \n     verbatim transcripts but are not. Yet the Commission also \n     found that, in 32 percent of the cases where the immigration \n     judges found the asylum applicant were not credible, they \n     specifically relied on these sworn statements.\n       (D) Department of Homeland Security regulations also \n     require that, when an alien expresses a fear of return, he \n     must be referred to an asylum officer to determine whether \n     his fear is ``credible.'' Yet, in nearly 15 percent of the \n     cases which the Commission observed aliens who expressed a \n     fear of return were nevertheless removed without a referral \n     to an asylum officer.\n       (8) The Commission found that the sworn statements taken \n     during expedited removal proceedings were reliable for \n     neither enforcement nor protection purposes because \n     Department of Homeland Security management reviewed only the \n     paperwork created by the interviewing officer. The agency had \n     no national quality assurance procedures to ensure that paper \n     files are an accurate representation of the actual interview. \n     The Commission recommended recording all interviews between \n     Department of Homeland Security officers and aliens subject \n     to expedited removal, and that procedures be established to \n     ensure that these recordings are reviewed to ensure \n     compliance.\n       (9) The Commission found that the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) issued policy guidance on \n     December 30, 1997, defining criteria for decisions to release \n     asylum seekers from detention. Neither the INS nor the \n     Department of Homeland Security, however, had been following \n     this, or any other discernible criteria, for detaining or \n     releasing asylum seekers. The Study's review of Department of \n     Homeland Security statistics revealed that release rates \n     varied widely, between 5 percent and 95 percent, in \n     different regions.\n       (10) In order to promote the most efficient use of \n     detention resources and a humane yet secure approach to \n     detention of aliens with a credible fear of persecution, the \n     Commission urged that the Department of Homeland Security \n     develop procedures to ensure that a release decision is taken \n     at the time of the credible fear determination or as soon as \n     feasible thereafter. Upon a determination that the alien has \n     established credible fear, identity and community ties, and \n     that the alien\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\n     is not subject to any possible bar to asylum involving \n     violence, misconduct, or threat to national security, the \n     alien should be released from detention pending an asylum \n     determination. The Commission also urged that the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security establish procedures to ensure \n     consistent implementation of release criteria, as well as the \n     consideration of requests to consider new evidence relevant \n     to the determination.\n       (11) In 1986, the United States, as a member of the \n     Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees, noted that in view of the hardship which it \n     involves, detention of asylum seekers should normally be \n     avoided; that detention measures taken in respect of refugees \n     and asylum-seekers should be subject to judicial or \n     administrative review; that conditions of detention of \n     refugees and asylum seekers must be humane; and that refugees \n     and asylum-seekers shall, whenever possible, not be \n     accommodated with persons detained as criminals.\n       (12) The USCIRF Study found that, of non-criminal asylum \n     seekers and aliens detained, the vast majority are detained \n     under inappropriate and potentially harmful conditions in \n     jails and jail-like facilities. This occurs in spite of the \n     development of a small number of successful nonpunitive \n     detention facilities, such as those in Broward County Florida \n     and Berks County, Pennsylvania.\n       (13) The Commission found that nearly all of the detention \n     centers where asylum seekers are detained resemble, in every \n     essential respect, conventional jails. Often, aliens with no \n     criminal record are detained alongside criminals and criminal \n     aliens. The standards applied by the Bureau of Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement for all of their detention facilities \n     are identical to, and modeled after, correctional standards \n     for criminal populations. In some facilities with \n     ``correctional dormitory'' set-ups, there are large numbers \n     of detainees sleeping, eating, going to the bathroom, and \n     showering out in the open in one brightly lit, windowless, \n     and locked room. Recreation in Bureau of Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement facilities often consists of unstructured \n     activity of no more than 1 hour per day in a small outdoor \n     space surrounded by high concrete walls.\n       (14) Immigration detention is civil and should be \n     nonpunitive in nature.\n       (15) A study conducted by Physicians for Human Rights and \n     the Bellevue/New York University Program for Survivors of \n     Torture found that the mental health of asylum seekers was \n     extremely poor, and worsened the longer individuals were in \n     detention. This included high levels of anxiety, depression, \n     and post-traumatic stress disorder. The study also raised \n     concerns about inadequate access to health services, \n     particularly mental health services. Asylum seekers \n     interviewed consistently reported being treated like \n     criminals, in violation of international human rights norms, \n     which contributed to worsening of their mental health. \n     Additionally, asylum seekers reported verbal abuse and \n     inappropriate threats and use of solitary confinement.\n       (16) The Commission recommended that the secure but \n     nonpunitive detention facility in Broward County Florida \n     Broward provided a more appropriate framework for those \n     asylum seekers who are not appropriate candidates for \n     release.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To ensure that personnel within the Department of \n     Homeland Security follow procedures designed to protect bona \n     fide asylum seekers from being returned to places where they \n     may face persecution.\n       (2) To ensure that persons who affirmatively apply for \n     asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection and \n     noncriminal detainees are not subject to arbitrary detention.\n       (3) To ensure that asylum seekers, families with children, \n     noncriminal aliens, and other vulnerable populations, who are \n     not eligible for release, are detained under appropriate and \n     humane conditions.\n\n     SEC. _03.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Intercountry Adoption \n     Reform Act of 2006'' or the ``ICARE Act''.\n\n     SEC.  02. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) That a child, for the full and harmonious development \n     of his or her personality, should grow up in a family \n     environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and \n     understanding.\n       (2) That intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her country of origin.\n       (3) There has been a significant growth in intercountry \n     adoptions. In 1990, Americans adopted 7,093 children from \n     abroad. In 2004, they adopted 23,460 children from abroad.\n       (4) Americans increasingly seek to create or enlarge their \n     families through intercountry adoptions.\n       (5) There are many children worldwide that are without \n     permanent homes.\n       (6) In the interest of children without a permanent family \n     and the United States citizens who are waiting to bring them \n     into their families, reforms are needed in the intercountry \n     adoption process used by United States citizens.\n       (7) Before adoption, each child should have the benefit of \n     measures taken to ensure that intercountry adoption is in his \n     or her best interest and that prevents the abduction, \n     selling, or trafficking of children.\n       (8) In addition, Congress recognizes that foreign-born \n     adopted children do not make the decision whether to \n     immigrate to the United States. They are being chosen by \n     Americans to become part of their immediate families.\n       (9) As such these children should not be classified as \n     immigrants in the traditional sense. Once fully and finally \n     adopted, they should be treated as children of United States \n     citizens.\n       (10) Since a child who is fully and finally adopted is \n     entitled to the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as \n     a biological child, the law should reflect such equality.\n       (11) Therefore, foreign-born adopted children of United \n     States citizens should be accorded the same procedural \n     treatment as biological children born abroad to a United \n     States citizen.\n       (12) If a United States citizen can confer citizenship to a \n     biological child born abroad, then the same citizen is \n     entitled to confer such citizenship to their legally and \n     fully adopted foreign-born child immediately upon final \n     adoption.\n       (13) If a United States citizen cannot confer citizenship \n     to a biological child born abroad, then such citizen cannot \n     confer citizenship to their legally and fully adopted \n     foreign-born child, except through the naturalization \n     process.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to ensure that any adoption of a foreign-born child by \n     parents in the United States is carried out in the manner \n     that is in the best interest of the child;\n       (2) to ensure that foreign-born children adopted by United \n     States citizens will be treated identically to a biological \n     child born abroad to the same citizen parent; and\n       (3) to improve the intercountry adoption process to make it \n     more citizen friendly and focused on the protection of the \n     child.\n\n     SEC.  03.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 481, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 481) relative to the death of Jacob \n     Chic Hecht, former United States Senator for the State of \n     Nevada.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday morning in Las Vegas Chic Hecht \ndied. Chic Hecht was a former Senator and a fellow Nevadan. On behalf \nof the entire Senate family, I extend condolences to Chic's wife, Gail, \nand their daughters, Leslie and Lori.\n  Chic was a man very small in stature, but his life has left a big \nshadow on the State of Nevada and the entire United States. Chic's \npolitical career was outstanding, and I consider it a privilege that I \ncould serve with and know him.\n  When I was Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, Chic served in the Nevada \nState Senate. When I was elected to the Congress in 1982, he was \nelected to the Senate. A few years later, I had the good fortune of \njoining him here.\n  Chic was someone who had no guile. He made it through his political \ncareer recognizing that he was never going to be a dynamic speaker. He \nspoke with a distinct lisp. But this is something that people in Nevada \ncame to admire and appreciate. People had great affection for him, as \nyou can tell from his first Senate race.\n  Chic's election to the Senate is described as being the biggest \npolitical upset in the history of the State of Nevada. He beat a man \nwho had served in the Senate 24 years, Senator Howard Cannon, a man who \nhad been chairman of the Rules Committee, Commerce Committee and Armed \nServices Committee. It was a tremendous upset.\n  Chic was rightfully proud of that election. ``Only in America could \nthis happen,'' he said the night that he beat Howard Cannon. ``Put that \ndown. That is what makes America great.''\n  Even Chic's opponents liked and respected him.\n  In 1988, Chic was beaten by Senator Richard Bryan. But as Senator \nBryan said, they were good friends during the race and continued being \ngood friends after. That was Chic Hecht.\n  As successful as he was in the political field, he was even more \nsuccessful as an entrepreneur. He made his money in a number of \ndifferent ways. One was selling women's clothing. The other was in the \nbanking business. He was extremely successful.\n  But public service called him. In addition to his Nevada legislature \nand Senate experience, he also served as Ambassador to the Bahamas from \n1989 to 1994.\n  During the 1950s, Chic was a member of the Army. At that time, Chic \nwas an undercover person--a spy. He was known for this his entire life. \nDuring some of his campaigns, people checked to find out if, in fact, \nthis man of small stature really was a spy because if that was not the \ncase, they planned to use it against him in the campaign. But they \ncouldn't, because it was true. He served with distinction in the \nmilitary.\n  Here's another example of the kind of man Chic was.\n  We had today, as we have for many decades, our Tuesday caucuses. \nDuring the time Senator Hecht served in the Senate, he attended the \nRepublican Tuesday caucus. Well, one Tuesday, John Kerry was late \ncoming to the Democratic caucus, and he came across Chic Hecht, who was \nin a state of distress because while eating lunch with the Republican \ncaucus, he had some food lodged in his throat. He couldn't breathe. He \nstaggered out of the Republican conference and, fortuitously, John \nKerry recognized that something was wrong. Senator Kerry applied the \nHeimlich maneuver, and the food came out. Chic Hecht was told by the \ndoctors that he had a matter of a few seconds to live.\n  Now, to show the kind of man Chic Hecht was, every Christmas, even \nthough he was proud of his Jewish faith, every Christmas thereafter, \nrecognizing that that was a day of celebration for Senator Kerry, \nSenator Hecht called John Kerry to tell him that he appreciated his \nhaving saved his life.\n  And what a life it was.\n  Nevada has had a great loss. I hope that Chic's family recognizes the \ngreatness of this man. I know there are many in Nevada who do.\n  As strongly as I feel about Chic Hecht, his friends run deep in our \nstate. My good friend Art Marshall, who is a good, strong Democrat and \nhas helped me on everything that I have ever done, spoke with \nadmiration of his deep friendship with Chic Hecht. They were from \ndifferent political parties, but always had a very good relationship. \nArt called me nearly every day to tell me how Chic was doing while he \nwrestled with cancer.\n  Today, Chic's suffering is over. He will be missed.\n  In time, the pain of his loss will pass, but never our memories and \nappreciation for this man. Chic Hecht, Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. FRIST.

I remind everyone again that we still have many amendments to \nconsider and, therefore, I hope Senators will be reasonable and agree \nto short time agreements.\n  As a reminder, Senators who have amendments to offer should be \nworking with the bill managers in order to have their amendments \ndebated and considered. Senators can expect a full day tomorrow, with \nvotes throughout the day. I would also say it will be necessary to \nschedule sessions into the night to consider additional amendments.\n  I hope we can make great progress during the daylight hours. But if \nwe consume a lot of time on each amendment, it will be necessary to \ncontinue into the evening with votes. As we have talked about now for \nseveral weeks, it is important that we consider a large number of \namendments, a broad range of amendments, many to each section of this \nbill. It will require the cooperation of all of our colleagues with \nthis goal in mind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/16/senate-section/article/S4646-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:15 A.M.
