We need to remain in session this \nevening in case those conference reports do become available. When we \nare certain one way or the other on the timing of the Defense \nconference reports, we will make a decision on the length of the \nsession. Certainly if the conference report will not be available \nbefore midnight, then I do not anticipate a late evening. We should \nknow something about that within the next couple of hours.\n  We cannot rule that in or out at this point. Therefore, we will \nmonitor the timing closely and then make further announcements.\n  For tomorrow, we continue to try to set votes on seven district \njudges who are on the calendar. If we are not able to reach an \nagreement for that shortly--I hope we can set those votes for a time \ncertain so we can alert Members. I will be discussing this shortly with \nthe Democratic leader. Again, we will be doing our best to get word to \nthe Senators shortly as to the schedule for this evening and tomorrow.\n  People have worked through last night and throughout today on these \nconference reports and there has been a lot of activity in the last \nhour or hour and a half. Shortly, I will come back to the floor with \nsomething more certain in terms of the schedule for later tonight as \nwell as tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/18/senate-section/article/S13972-1", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have said on previous occasions how much I \ncare about this institution, but I have trouble expressing how \ndisappointed I am as to what is going on. The arrogance of power of the \nRepublicans in the House and the Senate is beyond my ability to \ncomprehend. The Republican leadership now is attempting to impose the \nmost cynical and I believe abusive practice in this pending conference \nreport that, if successful, has the potential of changing the way this \nbody operates forever. We will become another House of Representatives.\n  Any conference report can set the tone of debate, the hours of \ndebate, the parameters of debate. If the Senate does that, it will no \nlonger be the Senate that was led by some of the greats such as \nMansfield and Dirksen. I say this respectfully. I do not know how \nanyone would allow this to happen, those who have the ability to do it. \nThere have been issues I felt strongly about, but I always played \nwithin the rules. That is not what is happening here. The game is being \nchanged, the rules of the game are being changed in the middle of the \ngame.\n  In the Senate and the House, the rules are that the conferees are not \nallowed to include in the conference report any matter that was not \nsubmitted to the conference by either House. This avoids the \npossibility of conferees including legislation that would not pass \neither one House or the other on its own and forces the Congress to \nreach a consensus on controversial legislation. This process has served \nthe Senate well for more than 200 years.\n  But the Republicans in Congress and the White House simply do not \ncare about rules and they break them when it suits their interests. \nThis conference report violates Senate rules on scope and is a cynical \nattempt to leverage support for funding our troops at war in order to \ninclude numerous extraneous items for special interests that could not \npass the Senate on their own.\n  They have included--and we all know what this is about--the authority \nfor oil companies to drill in the Alaska Wildlife Refuge, I say to the \nAmerican people, that this year are making $100 billion. But that is \nnot enough. This abuse of power will have long-term ramifications in \nthis body and is as bad or worse than anything ever attempted before, \nincluding the nuclear option. But in the future, if this goes forward, \nany matter, including nominations of a Secretary of State--you could \nlimit debate for our giving consent on a Secretary of State to 20 \nminutes equally divided. All you have to do is stick it in a conference \nreport.\n  There has never been an attempt in the Senate like this to similarly \nabuse our practices. When they have occurred, they have been ruled out \nof order or the leaders of the respective parties in this body have \nsaid you are going too far. The Senate has a series of precedents \nprohibiting bootstrapping a procedural fix in the same bill that \nviolated the particular rule. Those precedents should be applied here \nto prevent this abuse of practice. If this practice is allowed to \nstand, then the Republican majority, or any majority, can change the \nrules in the Senate procedure prospectively in a conference committee \nwithout any say by the minority party by a simple majority vote on an \nunrelated conference report.\n  To show the cynicism of this whole charade, in the same conference \nreport they reverse the rule. Now, try that one on. These rules mean \nnothing. It is like a game of Monopoly with grade school kids. But this \nis the Senate. It is not a Monopoly game.\n  This next few days is going to take longer than a Monopoly game, and \nsome of those take a long time. If the rules are going to be played \nwith--and they are being played with--then they are going to have to \nfollow every rule. If you want a vote on a nomination, then invoke \ncloture on it.\n  This is a dark day in the history of the American constitutional form \nof government.\n  We become the House of Representatives. The Founding Fathers didn't \nwant two House of Representatives. They wanted a bicameral legislature. \nBut we become the House of Representatives, and the possibilities are \nendless in an institution that exists to forge a consensus and not act \non the whims of whichever majority party is in control at the time. We \nbecome similar to the House of Commons. Whoever has the most votes \nwins. We haven't worked that way for 216 years.\n  This abusive practice will allow any majority to alter any rule at \nany time for the consideration of any measure to advance its short-term \npolitical interests and will change the very nature of the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/12/18/senate-section/article/S13972-3", "month": "12", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR MONDAY, \n                           DECEMBER 19, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
