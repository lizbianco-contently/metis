I thank the distinguished President pro tempore, my friend \nof over 30 years. The debate has worked out well by going back and \nforth, showing the usual comity here in the Senate.\n  I began my discussion of Judge Alito's nomination for a lifetime \nappointment to the Nation's highest Court with the same issue I began \nmy questions to Judge Alito and, before that, to now Chief Justice \nRoberts: That is the issue of checks and balances on Government power. \nObviously, the answers given by Chief Justice Roberts I found \nsatisfactory. I voted for him. The answers by Judge\n\n[[Page S146]]\n\nAlito, as I will explain further, I did not find satisfactory.\n  It is important because we are at a pivotal point in our Nation's \nhistory. This is a time of unprecedented governmental intrusion into \nthe lives of ordinary Americans. The President has attempted to justify \nsecret warrantless wiretapping of Americans, the evasion of legal bans \nagainst torture, and the detention of American citizens without due \nprocess of law. The Bush administration is making extraordinary claims \nof essentially unlimited power. There are troubling signs that this \nnomination is part of that effort by the President and Vice President \nto uphold Presidential claims of unchecked power and to upset the \ncareful balance of our system of government, a system of government \nthat was so carefully crafted by the Framers in our national charter, \nthe Constitution. I have said I do not believe that Judge Alito would \nbe that kind of a careful check and balance against Presidential \noverreaching. Because of that, I said I would not support his \nnomination.\n  I don't take this position lightly. There are nine members of the \nSupreme Court, seven of them nominated by Republican Presidents. I have \nvoted for eight of those nine, but I will not for this one. I feel that \nthe judge's record, his missed opportunities during the hearings to \nanswer concerns about his record, leaves me to wonder whether he \nappreciates the role of the Supreme Court as a protector of Americans' \nfundamental rights and liberties. It is a test he failed. The Supreme \nCourt has to be a source of justice. It has to be an institution where \nthe Bill of Rights and human dignity are honored. It must be an \ninstitution dedicated to the mission embodied in the words etched in \nVermont marble above the entrance to the Court where it says ``equal \njustice under the law.'' It must be an institution which carries on the \nspirit enshrined in our Constitution, refined following the Civil War, \nand realized further over the course of landmark decisions in Brown v. \nBoard of Education and Baker v. Carr. Judge Alito's record and \ntestimony demonstrate that he does not understand the vital role of the \ncourts in implementing the constitutional guarantees of equal \nprotection and equal dignity for all Americans.\n  A stark example of his failing the test took place during his \nconfirmation hearing when I asked him a question Senator Specter had \nasked then Justice Rehnquist at his hearing to become the Chief \nJustice. I know; I was at the hearing. The question was a basic one: \nwhether the Supreme Court can be stripped of jurisdiction to protect \nfundamental constitutional rights. I asked Judge Alito whether the \nSupreme Court could be stripped of jurisdiction to hear first amendment \ncases involving freedom of the press or freedom of religion or freedom \nof speech. The First Amendment is probably the greatest part of our \nBill of Rights. I told him Senator Specter had previously insisted on \nan answer from Justice Rehnquist and that Justice Rehnquist had \nanswered that it would not be constitutional to strip the Court of its \njurisdiction, its vital function to protect fundamental rights. Unlike \nthe late Chief Justice, Judge Alito responded as though it were merely \nan academic question. He said that there are scholars on both sides. He \nrefused to state his view. This is a basic and fundamental issue for \nanybody aspiring to be a member of the Supreme Court. Justice Rehnquist \ngot it right. For that matter, Judge Bork got it right. Judge Alito got \nit wrong.\n  When he failed to respond to my question, Senator Specter revisited \nit, but Judge Alito still failed the straightforward test. I asked the \nsame question with respect to the fourth amendment, the fifth \namendment, and the sixth amendment. Again, there was no answer. These \nare the constitutional amendments that guarantee our privacy rights, \nour protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, our right to \ndue process, our right against self-incrimination, our protection \nagainst Government takings, and our right to public trial and to \ncounsel. These are basic American rights that help to define us as a \nfree people. They control the intrusiveness of Government power.\n  Judge Alito has shown through his answers that he does not appreciate \nthe constitutional role of the Supreme Court as the protector of \nAmerica's fundamental rights. In fact, in our system of checks and \nbalances, the Supreme Court has to be the ultimate defender of \nAmericans' constitutional rights. Judge Alito's refusal to acknowledge \nthat in his answers is more than deeply troubling; it is stunning. It \nis stunning that anybody up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States would not answer such basic questions. \nSuppose if by legislative act we could remove the constitutional right \nto freedom of religion or free speech how quickly we could remove our \nfreedoms as Americans. Again, Justice Rehnquist and Judge Bork had it \nright. Judge Alito had it wrong.\n  I even gave him a concrete example. I asked whether in the early \n1950s, Congress could have stripped the courts, including the Supreme \nCourt, of jurisdiction to hear cases involving racial segregation in \nschools. This historical hypothetical raised the question whether the \nSupreme Court could have been prevented from deciding Brown v. Board of \nEducation and enforcing the equal protection clause of the Constitution \nand calling for an end to unconstitutional racial segregation. His \nanswer was no better. He was clearly stumped.\n  No Senator who truly cares about civil rights, equal rights, freedom \nof religion and speech and the press can have any confidence that Judge \nAlito understands the critical role of the Supreme Court in protecting \nthose rights.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from civil rights organizations \nin opposition to Judge Alito's nomination be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Washington Bureau, National Association for the \n           Advancement of Colored People,\n                                      Washington, January 9, 2006.\n     Re NAACP urges thorough review of Judge Samuel Alito's \n         troubling record on civil rights & civil liberties during \n         Judiciary Committee hearing\n\n     Members,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As you are aware from earlier correspondence, \n     the NAACP is opposed to the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito \n     to the United States Supreme Court based on our thorough \n     review of his dismal record on upholding civil rights and \n     civil liberties protections. As such, we would urge you, as a \n     member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to use your \n     position and your Constitutionally-mandated responsibility to \n     thoroughly review Judge Alito's record on civil rights and \n     civil liberties and to try to determine the extent to which \n     Judge Alito is likely to preserve the civil rights of \n     Americans if he is confirmed to our Nation's highest court.\n       The Supreme Court is, in many cases, the last opportunity \n     for many Americans to assert their rights and ensure the \n     protection of their liberties. Many of the civil rights gains \n     that have been made over the past 50 years are a result of \n     Supreme Court rulings. Thus, the NAACP feels that it is of \n     the utmost importance that any nominee to the Court is clear \n     about his or her intentions to protect the civil rights gains \n     that have been made over the past 5 decades and have always \n     been promised to us by the US Constitution.\n       Of specific concern to us from Judge Alito's past history \n     is:\n       In a 1985 job application for a position with the Reagan \n     Administration, Judge Alito disagreed in writing with the \n     Warren Court's reapportionment decisions now known as ``one \n     man, one vote'', which are among the Court's most widely \n     accepted decisions on civil rights and equal representation. \n     The ``one man, one vote'' theory is also one of the basic \n     tenets of Voting Rights that the NAACP has fought for;\n       In the 1993 case Grant v. Shalala Judge Alito ruled against \n     a class action alleging racial and other bias by an \n     Administrative Law Judge when determining Social Security \n     benefits, arguing that the Court of Appeals lacked the \n     authority to conduct a trial and make independent findings on \n     actions taken by an Administrative Law Judge for the Social \n     Security Agency. In a strongly worded dissent to the Alito \n     ruling, Judge Leon Higginbotham said that the decisions is \n     ``. . . effectively have courts take a back seat to \n     bureaucratic agencies in protecting constitutional liberties. \n     This . . . is a radical and unwise redefinition of the \n     relationship between federal courts and federal agencies.''\n       In the 1997 case Bray v. Marriot Hotels, Judge Alito \n     strongly dissented from a Third Circuit ruling and made it \n     clear that he supports impossibly high barriers for victims \n     of discrimination to have their cases heard;\n       In a separate 1997 case, Riley v. Taylor, Judge Alito held \n     that a prosecutor was not motivated by race in striking all \n     African Americans from the jury of a death-penalty case \n     involving an African American defendant. When the defendant \n     produced statistical evidence showing the prosecution \n     repeatedly\n\n[[Page S147]]\n\n     striking African Americans from juries, Judge Alito contended \n     that this was irrelevant and likened it to a study showing \n     that a disproportionate number of recent Presidents have been \n     left-handed.\n       In a 2004 case, Doe v. Grady, Judge Alito dissented from a \n     ruling against police officers who had strip-searched a woman \n     and her 10-year-old daughter while executing a search warrant \n     authorizing the search of her husband and their home.\n       In short, during the course of the NAACP's investigation \n     into Judge Alito's past we became convinced that he is unfit \n     to sit on the United States Supreme Court because race and \n     gender are still a real problem in the United States; a fact \n     he appears to neither recognize nor appreciate.\n       Accordingly, as I said earlier, I hope you will ask tough \n     questions, and demand thorough answers, during the hearings \n     that begin today on Judge Alito to try to determine even \n     further the extent to which he is, or is not, committed to \n     upholding and protecting the civil rights and civil liberties \n     of all Americans. On behalf of the NAACP, I would also like \n     to further express our strong opposition to the nomination \n     and our hope that you urge your Senate colleagues to oppose \n     and defeat Judge Samuel Alito's nomination. Please contact \n     me, or my Bureau Counsel, Crispian Kirk, at (202) 463-2940 \n     soon to let me know your position on this matter, and to let \n     me know what I can do to work with you to ensure that \n     President Bush nominates, and the Senate confirms, moderate, \n     not extremist, judicial candidates to the federal bench.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        National Urban League,\n\n                                                 January 10, 2006.\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: As you know, the National Urban League, Inc. \n     (``Urban League'') is the oldest community-based civil rights \n     organization in the country. Through our 102 professionally-\n     staffed affiliates, located in 34 states and in the District \n     of Columbia, the Urban League works to ensure, in a non-\n     partisan way, economic and social parity and full civil \n     rights for African-Americans and other people of color.\n       Nominations to the United States Supreme Court are of \n     particular concern to the Urban League Movement because of \n     the high Court's tremendous power and impact on the issues \n     relevant to our mission of securing civil rights and economic \n     empowerment for African Americans. Since the President \n     nominated Judge Samuel Alito, Jr. to be an Associate Justice \n     of the United States Supreme Court, the National Urban League \n     has carefully and exhaustively reviewed his judicial record, \n     judicial philosophy, and professional qualifications. Our \n     study found that Judge Alito has a long and unambiguous \n     history of opposition to critical and established voting \n     rights protections, civil rights remedies and social justice \n     guarantees. Our examination also established that Judge Alito \n     frequently injects this philosophy into his judicial \n     decision-making, often in direct contravention of well-\n     settled law. A copy of our report is attached.\n       Based upon this review, it is our conclusion that Judge \n     Alito's stated opposition to reasonable and established civil \n     rights remedies and voting rights protections, and his \n     consistent record of injecting these views into his decision-\n     making to the degree that it undermines basic civil rights \n     protections make him unsuitable for a seat on our nation's \n     highest court.\n       Therefore, we urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject \n     the nomination of Judge Alito to be a Supreme Court Justice \n     and look forward to working with you to ensure the nomination \n     and confirmation of judges who will uphold fundamental civil \n     rights protections.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                   Marc H. Morial,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           NAACP Legal Defense Fund Opposes Alito Nomination\n\n\nReport details hostility to civil rights and warns of tipped balance on \n                               High Court\n\n       On December 15, 2005, the NAACP Legal Defense and \n     Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) announced opposition to the \n     nomination of Samuel Alito, Jr. to the U.S. Supreme Court, \n     citing his hostility to strong enforcement of civil rights \n     laws. LDF warned that confirmation of Judge Alito would \n     threaten to shift significantly the Supreme Court's \n     jurisprudence relating to affirmative action, voting rights, \n     employment and criminal justice issues.\n       At a press conference in Washington, D.C., LDF released a \n     10-page report detailing what it called an ``extreme'' \n     judicial approach by Judge Alito that would demonstrably \n     impact important future decisions of the High Court. The LDF \n     report cites cases in which Alito has attacked congressional \n     legislative authority in a manner that his colleagues viewed \n     as extreme. As a Justice Department lawyer, he argued to \n     uphold police use of deadly force and undermine the rights of \n     criminal defendants. In the area of affirmative action, LDF \n     highlighted ``troubling signals'' that Alito would tip the \n     delicate Court balance to unravel policies ``at the epicenter \n     of the modern struggle for racial equality.''\n       ``We can predict with substantial certainty that Judge \n     Alito will very likely vote in a manner that, given the \n     current composition of the Court, will cause a substantial \n     shift in the Court's civil rights jurisprudence with \n     devastating effects,'' the LDF report cautioned.\n       Judge Alito is scheduled to appear before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee in early January for confirmation \n     hearings.\n       LDF Director-Counsel and President Theodore M. Shaw \n     stressed that the organization does not relish opposing a \n     nomination to the Supreme Court and does so only when the \n     nominee's record is contrary to the goals of equal justice \n     that are the hallmark of LDF's work.\n       With the announcement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's \n     retirement last summer, LDF called upon President Bush to \n     nominate a successor who is not ideologically rigid and \n     predictable, but who is fair and open-minded, and committed \n     to protecting advances in civil rights. LDF emphasized that \n     Justice O'Connor's successor should not be a mission-driven \n     ideologue but, even if a conservative, should maintain the \n     balance on the Court with respect to civil rights issues.\n       To analyze Alito's record, LDF reviewed published and \n     unpublished opinions in cases decided by Judge Alito as well \n     as documents released by the White House and the National \n     Archives. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 1990, Alito spent \n     his entire legal career at the Department of Justice.\n       LDF's report also reveals:\n       Unquestionably, Justice O'Connor cast pivotal votes in \n     civil rights cases coming before the Supreme Court. While \n     Justice O'Connor did rule against civil rights litigants, at \n     least her vote on important issues such as affirmative action \n     was ``always in play.'' In contrast, a review of Samuel \n     Alito's tenure at the Justice Department reveals that he was \n     directly involved in the Reagan Administration's frontal \n     attacks on affirmative action, arguing against affirmative \n     action in three significant cases before the Court. In his 15 \n     years on the bench, he has ruled against African Americans on \n     this issue.\n       Judge Alito's record should be extremely troubling to \n     minority workers, women and others who depend on equal \n     opportunity protections in the workplace. Although he has \n     heard dozens of cases, Judge Alito has almost never ruled in \n     favor of an African-American plaintiff in an employment \n     discrimination case; he has never authored even one opinion \n     favoring an African-American plaintiff on the merits in such \n     a case.\n       Judge Alito's criticism of the Warren Court's \n     reapportionment decisions is extremely troubling. These cases \n     ``set into motion a process that led to the dismantling of a \n     political system infected both by prejudice and other forms \n     of patent electoral manipulation.'' In his only opportunity \n     on the bench to interpret the Voting Rights Act, Alito voted \n     to uphold an at-large system of electing members to a \n     Delaware school district, perpetuating an electoral system \n     that diluted the voting strength of racial minorities.\n       In the criminal justice area, Judge Alito has repeatedly \n     parted ways with his colleagues and failed to heed Supreme \n     Court precedent in important cases regarding race \n     discrimination in jury selection, the right to effective \n     assistance of counsel, and search and seizure issues.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Lawyers' Committee for Civil\n\n\n                                             Rights Under Law,\n\n         Washington, DC, January 5, 2006.\n     Hon.

Alito as an Associate \n     Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States'' on behalf \n     of the 114 individual members of the Board of Directors and \n     Trustees who subscribe to the Statement.\n       These members of our Board oppose Judge Alito because the \n     record demonstrates that his views are in direct conflict \n     with the core civil rights principles to which the Lawyers' \n     Committee is dedicated, and that as a member of the Supreme \n     Court, Judge Alito would cast votes and write opinions that \n     would set back the cause of civil rights in our country and \n     impede our progress toward the goal of equal justice for all. \n     It is worth noting that in the Lawyers' Committee's 42-year \n     history, its Directors and Trustees have opposed a Supreme \n     Court nominee on only two previous occasions.\n       We also enclose a Final Report that analyzes Judge Alito's \n     legal philosophy pertaining to civil rights and \n     constitutional interpretation. This in-depth Report serves as \n     the basis for the conclusions contained in the Statement and \n     provides extensive analysis of Judge Alito's background. If \n     Judge Alito's testimony during confirmation hearings or other \n     evidence justifies a change in the conclusions we have drawn, \n     we will so inform you.\n       We hope the Statement and Report are of assistance to you \n     and your staff. For the reasons noted in them, we strongly \n     urge the Ju-\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\n     diciary Committee to vote not to confirm this nominee.\n           Respectfully,\n     Marjorie Press Lindblom,\n                                                         Co-Chair.\n     Robert E. Harrington,\n     Co-Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                       for Affirmative Action,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2006.\n     Re Nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., as Associate \n         Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chair,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: The American \n     Association for Affirmative Action (AAAA), an association of \n     equal employment opportunity (EEO), diversity and affirmative \n     action professionals founded in 1974, respectfully urges you \n     to oppose the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito, nominated to \n     serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       AAAA has reached this conclusion based on Judge Alito's \n     very troubling record on equal employment opportunity and \n     affirmative action. In his 1985 application to be the Reagan \n     Administration's Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the \n     Office of Legal Counsel, Samuel Alito expressed his support \n     of the ``same philosophical views'' that he believed were \n     central to the Administration. In this application, Alito \n     highlighted his work as Assistant Solicitor General on \n     affirmative action and reportedly wrote that he was \n     ``particularly proud'' of his ``contributions in recent cases \n     in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court that \n     racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed. . . .'' To \n     use Judge Alito's ``Hank Aaron'' analogy, affirmative action \n     requires not moving the fence in but opening the gate. After \n     that, it is up to the player to demonstrate his or her \n     abilities. Whoever selected Hank Aaron, Secretary Rice or \n     Justice O'Connor understood that the essence of affirmative \n     action is opportunity, not favoritism or quotas.\n       Judge Alito's application described the efforts of the \n     Reagan Justice Department to restrict affirmative action and \n     court-awarded remedies for discrimination as ``quota'' \n     litigation. In one such case, Alito signed a brief arguing \n     for restricting affirmative action remedies, even in cases \n     where discrimination was intentional, egregious, and \n     longstanding. In Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers' \n     International Ass'n v. EEOC, the Solicitor General's brief \n     advanced the extraordinary theory that relief in Title VII \n     cases could be granted only to ``identifiable victims of \n     discrimination,'' contradicting an earlier view of the EEOC \n     itself. The Supreme Court rejected this argument.\n       In Local Number 93, International Association of \n     Firefighters, AFL-CIO v. City of Cleveland, Alito signed on \n     to an amicus brief seeking to reverse a consent decree that \n     included numerical goals for the promotion of black firemen. \n     By a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court again rejected the Solicitor \n     General's argument and upheld the affirmative action plan.\n       In the months before Alito applied for a job with Attorney \n     General Edwin Meese, Meese waged a fierce campaign to have \n     President Reagan abolish Executive Order 11246, signed by \n     President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The Order requires that \n     federal contractors not discriminate in employment and that \n     they use affirmative action. Ultimately, two-thirds of the \n     Reagan cabinet repudiated the extreme views of the Justice \n     Department and a coalition of corporations, members of \n     Congress and civil rights organizations successfully defeated \n     Meese's campaign against affirmative action.\n       There is nothing subsequent to Mr. Alito's tenure in the \n     Reagan Administration or his testimony before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee to suggest persuasively that he has \n     moderated his views on equal opportunity law enforcement. In \n     civil rights cases he has often argued for higher barriers \n     that victims of employment discrimination would have to \n     overcome to secure remedies for such discrimination. For \n     example, in Bray v. Marriott Hotels, Judge Alito's colleagues \n     said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ``would be \n     eviscerated'' if Judge Alito's approach were followed. In \n     Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, Judge Alito \n     dissented in a disability rights case where the majority \n     said: ``Few if any Rehabilitation Act cases would survive'' \n     if Judge Alito's view were the law.'' And in Sheridan v. \n     DuPont, he was the only one of 11 judges on the court who \n     would apply a higher standard of proof in a sex \n     discrimination case.\n       According to a report of the NAACP Legal Defense and \n     Educational Fund, Inc., Judge Alito has almost never ruled \n     for an African-American plaintiff in employment \n     discrimination cases and has never written a majority opinion \n     for the Third Circuit in favor of an African-American \n     plaintiff on the merits of a claim of race discrimination in \n     employment. In each majority opinion authored by Judge Alito \n     and addressing such a claim, he has ruled against the \n     African-American plaintiff.\n       This is not the time for the Judiciary, a longstanding \n     refuge for victims of discrimination, to reverse fifty years \n     of progress. The record emerging suggests that Judge Samuel \n     Alito is not prepared to interpret the laws on behalf of all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Shirley J. Wilcher,\n                                       Interim Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Judge Alito missed opportunities during the hearings on a \nnumber of issues. I am left with a deep and abiding concern about Judge \nAlito's understanding of the role of the courts and their \nresponsibility to protect the constitutional rights of individuals, \nespecially the less powerful and especially where the political system \nhas failed to do so.\n  Despite Judge Alito's attempts to retreat from several of the more \noutrageous statements in his 1985 job application for a political \nposition in Edwin Meese's Justice Department, his testimony at the \nhearing has done little to dispel my concerns. The consequences for all \nAmericans of Judge Alito putting the beliefs he expressed in that job \napplication into practice on the Supreme Court are too great.\n  In his job application, Samuel Alito wrote, as a 35-year-old, \npracticing lawyer, that:\n\n       In college, I developed a deep interest in constitutional \n     law, motivated in large part by disagreement with Warren \n     Court decisions, particularly in the area[] of . . . \n     reapportionment.\n\n  This was a startling statement to make in 1985, just two decades ago. \nHe was 35 years old and had been practicing law for almost a decade \nwhen he wrote that statement about his disagreement with Warren Court \ndecisions on reapportionment. Even after being asked about this \nstatement several times at the hearing, Judge Alito failed to \nadequately answer why he would seek to highlight a disagreement with \nthe landmark equal protection cases by which the Supreme Court made \nelections fairer for all Americans and established the principle of \n``one person, one vote.''\n  The Warren Court's reapportionment decisions were among the central \nachievements of the civil rights era. They ensured that voting \ndistricts which had been grossly mal-apportioned, often to the \ndetriment of minority voters, would be fairly revised so that \neveryone's vote was weighed equally. It is clear from looking at the \nRepublicans' partisan redistricting in Texas that these cases did not \nsolve all the problems. However, reapportionment cases like Baker v. \nCarr, 1962, and Reynolds v. Sims, 1964, are landmarks because they \nestablished that courts have a responsibility to make certain that \nvoting districts meet constitutional standards.\n  It was Justice William Brennan of New Jersey who wrote the Court's \nopinion in Baker. Two years later, in Reynolds, the Court established \nthe ``one person, one vote'' standard because, as stated by Chief \nJustice Warren in his opinion in that case:\n\n       As long as ours is a representative form of government, and \n     our legislatures are those instruments of government elected \n     directly by and directly representative of the people, the \n     right to elect legislators in a free and unimpaired fashion \n     is a bedrock of our political system.\n\n  At his hearing, Judge Alito was in retreat and had to concede that \nthe concept of one person, one vote is well-settled and should not be \nreexamined. It was equally well-settled in 1985 when he made the \nstatement in his job application. More importantly, Judge Alito's \ntestimony calls into question whether he truly understands that the \ncourts have a responsibility in our constitutional system to intervene \nto ensure that constitutional guarantees of equal access to the \npolitical system are met. This is important in situations where the \npolitical system is corrupt or where the political branches lack the \nwill to fight against entrenched power or to reform themselves.\n  In response to a question from Senator Kohl, Judge Alito sought to \nretreat from the unqualified disagreement with the reapportionment \ncases expressed in his 1985 application. He told the Committee that his \ndisagreement was based only on certain details of later Warren Court \ndecisions like the 1969 case, Kirkpatrick v. Preisler. Not only is this \nnarrow objection to certain Warren Court decisions not a credible \nexplanation for why he made his sweeping assertions of disagreement in \n1985, but Judge Alito also contradicted it later in his testimony when \nhe suggested that his disagreement with the Warren Court's \nreapportionment decisions was based on Alexander Bickel's ideas about \njudicial self-restraint. Professor Bickel was not\n\n[[Page S149]]\n\nconcerned merely with later applications of one person, one vote. \nRather, his theory was critical of the courts having any role at all in \nhelping to guarantee that access to the political system is fair and \nequal.\n  In fact, one of the justices whom Judge Alito described as among his \nfavorites, Justice Harlan, applied Bickel's theories in dissenting from \nevery landmark Warren Court reapportionment case establishing one \nperson, one vote, starting with Baker v. Carr. In Justice Harlan's \ndissenting opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, as in all of Justice Harlan's \nreapportionment dissents, he argued that there is no constitutional \nbasis for one person, one vote and that courts should restrain \nthemselves from ``usurping'' the state legislatures' self-serving \napportionment decisions. In his dissent in Reynolds, Justice Harlan \nwrote: ``It is difficult to imagine a more intolerable and \ninappropriate interference by the judiciary with the independent \nlegislatures of the States,'' and ``[w]hat is done today deepens my \nconviction that judicial entry into this realm is profoundly ill-\nadvised and constitutionally impermissible.'' This dissent, described \nas one of Judge Alito's favorites, hardly sounds like a disagreement \nonly with certain aspects of later reapportionment decisions.\n  The effects of the Court's decisions to intervene were dramatic. Were \nthe Supreme Court to have followed the dissents of Justice Harlan or \nthe theories of Alexander Bickel that Judge Alito embraced in 1985, the \nmassive disparities in the size of voting districts would not have been \ncorrected in the 1960s. Nor would the underrepresentation of voters \nfrom urban areas, minority voters, have been corrected. Had the Court \nnot acted we might still have poll taxes and other barriers to the \nability of minorities to vote.\n  At the hearing we heard testimony from pioneering civil rights \nattorney Fred Gray, who spent a lifetime fighting for those who were \ndenied the rights to equal protection and equal dignity under the law \nguaranteed by our Constitution. After he graduated from law school, Mr. \nGray immediately went to work defending Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr., in the Montgomery bus boycott. He has a real-life \nappreciation for the role of courts as providing a check to protect \nindividual rights and liberties. In the late 1950s, after the Alabama \nlegislature changed the city limits of Tuskegee, excluding all but \nthree or four African Americans who were registered to vote in the \ncity, Mr. Gray brought before the Supreme Court the case of Gomillion \nv. Lightfoot. This unanimous decision securing the right to vote for \nAfrican Americans laid the foundation for Baker v. Carr and the cases \nestablishing one person, one vote.\n  I asked Mr. Gray what the consequences would have been had the courts \nfollowed the lead of Justice Harlan and Alexander Bickel, views with \nwhich Samuel Alito apparently agreed, and not involved itself in \nreapportionment. He testified:\n\n       The difference is then, prior to these decisions, and even \n     prior to Brown v. Board of Education, and prior to Gomillion \n     v. Lightfoot and Browder v. Gayle, the case that desegregated \n     the buses, we had very few African Americans and other \n     minorities registered. We had little or no African Americans \n     in public office. For example, in my state, in 1957 we had \n     none. Now my State has approximately the same number of \n     persons in our State legislature. It mirrors the population. \n     We now have thousands of African Americans and other \n     minorities who are holding public office, and an additional \n     thousand that those public office holders have appointed to \n     elected office.\n\n  Judge Alito did not adequately explain his disagreement with the \nWarren Court reapportionment decisions. He refused to say that he \nchanged his views. He did not repeat what he had suggested in some \nprivate meetings--that he was merely saying what he thought people in \nthe Reagan White House wanted to hear and that it was just a job \napplication. Candidly, his testimony on this critical point makes no \nsense. This is too fundamental a matter to be left without a solid, \ncredible explanation. The equal protection rights and voting rights of \nall Americans are the fulcrum for realizing the promises of our \ndemocratic republic.\n  Judge Alito's sweeping disagreement with the Warren Court's \nreapportionment decisions is not the only part of his 1985 job \napplication which has caused me to doubt his understanding of the \nresponsibility for the courts to intervene where the political process \nis broken down, corrupt or entrenched. Judge Alito also stated in that \napplication that he believes in ``the supremacy of the elected branches \nof government.'' In the hearing, Judge Alito tried to retreat from this \nstatement, describing it as ``inapt'' and ``very misleading and \nincorrect.'' However, he refused to disavow it, telling Senator \nKennedy: ``I haven't changed my mind.''\n  The Supreme Court's decisions to intervene in the reapportionment \ncases in the 1960s had a tremendous effect on the ability of millions \nof Americans to participate in the political process. Yet I am \nconcerned that his 1985 written statement reveals that he will be too \ndeferential to the President as ``supreme'' even when needed to be a \ncheck on the Government.\n  The elected branches have no claim to being legitimate, let alone \n``supreme,'' if they are controlled by entrenched political corruption. \nAfter listening to several days of his testimony, I am left with \nserious questions and concerns about Judge Alito's appreciation for \nthis critical role of the courts. These concerns are heightened by his \napparent adherence to the so-called doctrine of the ``Unitary \nExecutive.''\n  Judge Alito has failed to grasp the importance of the courts in \nproviding a venue for all Americans to assert their rights. One of the \nclearest examples of this is Judge Alito's distressing record in cases \nin which individuals allege discrimination based on race, gender, or \ndisability. Judge Alito has consistently found ways to keep the \n``little guy'' from having a day in court. For example, he has held \nindividuals trying to prove discrimination to an excessively high \nstandard of proof, rendering their cases almost un-winnable. From the \nbench, he has favored the government and big companies accused of \ndiscrimination. He seems to view these cases not as examples of regular \nAmericans struggling for equal treatment but, instead, as technical \nlegal exercises.\n  Judge Alito's supporters--and many on the other side of the aisle \nwere lined up to support him well before the hearings--have cherry \npicked individual cases to try to show that Judge Alito was fair to \naverage Americans. Judge Alito told us to look at his whole record and \nwe did. In fact, a study of Judge Alito's decisions by Knight Ridder \nnewspapers found that Judge Alito was consistently skeptical of \ndiscrimination plaintiffs, generally setting high standards of proof \nand finding that the plaintiffs before him did not meet those \nstandards. The study found that he was similarly dismissive of criminal \ndefendants alleging discrimination by the government and of immigrants \nfighting deportation. Noted law professors Cass Sunstein and Goodwin \nLiu studied the cases where Judge Alito dissented from his colleagues \nand reached the same conclusion.\n  In several cases, the Third Circuit criticized Judge Alito for taking \npositions which would make it almost impossible for people to prove \ndiscrimination. In Bray v. Marriott Hotels, Judge Alito would have \ndenied an African-American worker the chance to show that her employers \ndenied her a promotion based on race. The majority criticized Judge \nAlito's dissent saying that a key discrimination statute ``would be \neviscerated if our analysis were to halt where the dissent suggests.''\n  The case of Pirolli v World Flavors, Inc., is a particularly poignant \nexample of the kind of case that gives me great concern about whether \nJudge Alito would uphold the rights of ordinary Americans seeking equal \ntreatment. In that case, Kenneth Pirolli, a mentally retarded employee, \nbrought a claim for hostile work environment based on sex and \ndisability, alleging a pattern of sexual abuse and harassment that can \nonly be described as disgusting. Judge Alito dissented from the Third \nCircuit's decision that Mr. Pirolli's case should go to a jury, not \nbased on the merits of the claim, but essentially because he thought \nMr. Pirolli's lawyer's legal brief was poorly drafted. Senator Durbin \nasked Judge Alito about this matter and gave him every opportunity to \nexplain. It remains another example of Judge Alito focusing on \ntechnical details rather than on the rights of real people.\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\n  As a former prosecutor, I am sensitive to the need for a fair process \nand a fair jury in all criminal cases, particularly the most serious \nones. I am troubled that in Riley v. Taylor, Judge Alito dissented from \nan en banc decision in a capital case in which the Third Circuit \ngranted a new trial because the prosecutor had improperly dismissed \nBlack jurors. Judge Alito denigrated the defendant's use of statistical \nevidence to show improper exclusion of Black jurors, comparing it to a \nstatistical analysis of the disproportionate number of recent left-\nhanded U.S. Presidents. The majority criticized Judge Alito's \ninappropriate analogy, writing, ``To suggest any comparability to the \nstriking of jurors based on their race is to minimize the history of \ndiscrimination against prospective Black jurors and Black defendants''.\n  In response to the many cases in Judge Alito's record in which he has \nruled against victims of discrimination, victims of government \nintrusion, and immigrants, Judge Alito's Republican supporters searched \nhard to find a small set of cases to show Judge Alito has not always \nruled against the ``little guy.'' What is notable about these efforts \nis that even in the cases they have trumpeted, Judge Alito often denied \nany meaningful relief to the average American.\n\n  Several Republicans have raised the case of United States v. \nKithcart. They incorrectly suggest that in Kithcart, Judge Alito ruled \nin favor of an African American in a racial profiling case. Mr. \nKithcart was pulled over by the police because he was African American \nand searched and arrested. When the case came before Judge Alito, he \nsent it back to the trial court to give the government a second chance \nto prove that the stop and search of an African American were \nconstitutional and were not motivated by race. Judge McKee dissented \nfrom the remand saying, ``just as this record fails to establish that \nOfficer Nelson had probable cause to arrest any Black male who happened \nto drive by in a black sports car, it fails to establish reasonable \nsuspicion to justify stopping any and all such cars that happened to \ncontain a Black male.'' When the case came back to Judge Alito on \nappeal, Judge Alito upheld the search and affirmed the conviction. So \nwhile he remanded the case back to the trial court, he then upheld the \nsearch and conviction in his final decision and afforded Mr. Kithcart \nno relief.\n  Judge Alito's supporters have pointed to Fatin v. INS as an example \nof a case in which Judge Alito sided with powerless immigrants and did \nnot defer to the Government. This is another bad example because he \nultimately ruled against the immigrant, Parastoo Fatin, and she was \ndeported.\n  Ms. Fatin was an Iranian woman whose family had opposed the Ayatollah \nKhomeini and who had come to the United States as a student. She was \nfighting deportation and requested asylum, arguing that she would be \nsubjected to harsh treatment as a former opponent of Iranian regime, as \nsomeone who did not practice a strict form of Islam, and as a woman--\nwho would have to wear a veil and live under great restrictions in \nIran. As his supporters have noted, Judge Alito ruled in the case that \ngender-based persecution could be a basis for asylum. But Judge Alito \nwent on to rule against Ms. Fatin anyway. So he denied her petition for \nreview and sent her on to be deported.\n  Judge Alito and Republican Senators seeking to bolster Judge Alito's \nrecord cited Leveto v. Lapina as an example of a case in which he \nprotected the rights of individuals against government intrusion. It is \ntelling about Judge Alito's record in the area of individual rights \nprotection that in a case he trumpeted for his protection of the rights \nof individuals, he threw the Levetos out of court and denied them any \nremedy.\n  The facts of this case are egregious. In the course of an IRS tax \nfraud investigation of the Levetos, armed agents ``rushed'' Dr. Leveto \nat the veterinary hospital where he worked when he arrived at 6:30 \na.m., patted him down, and then held him in a small room for over an \nhour, not allowing him to speak to anyone or make any calls. They then \naccompanied Dr. Leveto to his home where they patted down Mrs. Leveto, \nwho was still in her nightgown, and then detained and interrogated her \nfor 6 hours.\n  Meanwhile, other agents took Dr. Leveto back to the hospital where \nthey held him in a closed room for 6 more hours. During this 6 hours, \nhe was not permitted external communications, was accompanied on \nbathroom breaks, and was interrogated without Miranda warnings, while \nother agents searched the hospital. During the course of the search IRS \nagents sent hospital employees home and turned away clients in the \nparking lot, informing them that the hospital was closed until further \nnotice.\n  Despite acknowledging numerous violations, Judge Alito dismissed the \nLevetos' appeal and their case based on ``uncertainty'' in the case \nlaw, and threw them out of court.\n  Supporters of Judge Alito have cited the case of Brinson v. Vaughn as \nan example of a case in which Judge Alito sided with a victim of \ndiscrimination, reversing a conviction because Black jurors had been \nimproperly excluded from the jury pool. This was an easy case given the \nextraordinary facts involved. In Brinson, the prosecutor dismissed 13 \nof 14 prospective Black jurors and had previously made a training video \nin which he urged prosecutors to dismiss Black prospective jurors from \nthe jury pool. This does not reassure me about my concern that Judge \nAlito will only give credence to claims of discrimination in extreme \ncases. Indeed, in Riley v. Taylor, when an en banc majority of the \nThird Circuit found that Black jurors had been improperly dismissed \nfrom the jury pool, Judge Alito disagreed and denigrated the \ndefendant's use of statistical evidence to show improper exclusion of \nBlack jurors, comparing it, as has been previously noted, to a \nstatistical analysis of the disproportionate number of recent left-\nhanded U.S. Presidents.\n  The role of courts should be to protect and make sure there is a fair \nforum for the powerless and even the unpopular. This is the reason the \ncourts are the one undemocratic branch. I am concerned that rather than \ndemonstrating an understanding of the effect of the law on the lives of \nreal Americans as Justice O'Connor has shown, Judge Alito would close \nthe courthouse doors to those Americans most in need of the courts to \nprotect their rights.\n  In the next few years, the Supreme Court will hear many challenges to \npolitical entrenchment. Critical provisions of the Voting Rights Act, \nVRA, Congress's part in guaranteeing equal access to voting, the \nfundamental machinery of democracy, were upheld by the Warren Court in \nSouth Carolina v. Katzenbach, 1966, by an 8 to 1 vote. The VRA will \nneed to be reauthorized before it expires in 2007. Subsequent court \nchallenges will be critical to fairness to minority voters.\n  The Supreme Court will soon hear a challenge to Texas Republicans' \npartisan mid-Census redrawing of congressional districts. There are \nquestions before the Supreme Court this term about campaign finance \nlaws. We are seeing exposed in the news every day a culture of \ncorruption through money and access that has taken root in Washington, \nby which one political party has sought to entrench itself as a \npermanent majority.\n  The cost to Americans is high if we in the Senate get it wrong. I go \nback to the central question I asked at the outset of Judge Alito's \nhearing: Will this nominee serve to protect the fundamental rights and \nliberties of all Americans? Based on Judge Alito's record, I have no \nconfidence that he will provide a check against either an overreaching \nPresident or entrenched political power, nor that he will serve to \nprotect Americans' fundamental rights and liberties.\n  I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nand I thank the Chair.\n  I come to the floor to offer my reasons for opposing Judge Alito. Let \nme begin with this: If the Supreme Court's decisions were simply \nmathematical computations of legal points, our job would be easy and \nall of the Court's decisions would be 9 to 0. But the legal philosophy \nand views of each individual Justice do play a role in decisionmaking \non the Court. Perhaps not the\n\n[[Page S151]]\n\nmajority of the time, when the question before the Court is not \ncontroversial; but certainly when the question is controversial and \ndivisive, legal views and philosophies do play a role.\n  We just had a recent example. Last week the Supreme Court upheld \nOregon's Death with Dignity Act by a 6-to-3 decision in a case called \nGonzales v. Oregon. When then-Judge Roberts came before the Senate, I \nand others questioned him on his end-of-life views. He then replied \nthat the Government should not enter the arena. When discussing my \npoint that he would not want the Government telling him what to do, he \nsaid:\n\n       The basic understanding that it's a free country and the \n     right to be left alone is one of our basic rights.\n\n  He gave us the impression that he believed there was, in fact, a \nright to die. However, just last week, Chief Justice Roberts joined the \ntwo most conservative members of the Court, Justices Scalia and Thomas, \nin an opinion that, if it had carried the day, would have allowed the \nadministration to invalidate the end-of-life initiative twice supported \nby Oregon voters in State elections, once when it was enacted and once \nwhen it was reaffirmed.\n  Secondly, history reveals that legal views and philosophies have been \nthe rationale for the rejection of at least 12 Presidential nominees \nfor the Supreme Court. Members on the other side of the aisle often say \nthese legal views and philosophies are not a bona fide consideration. \nBut what I say is these have been used as the rationale for the \nrejection of at least a dozen Presidential nominees in history.\n  Let me mention a few of them. It began with President George \nWashington when he nominated John Rutledge in 1795. Rutledge was \nrejected by a vote of 10 to 14 because he made a speech denouncing the \nJay Treaty between the United States and Great Britain.\n  Fifteen years later, President James Madison's nomination of \nAlexander Wolcott was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 9 to 24, in \npart, based of his policies while a U.S. collector of customs and his \nactions strongly enforcing controversial embargoes.\n  President Andrew Jackson, in 1835, nominated Roger Taney to the \nSupreme Court. He had served as the Secretary of Treasury, and he \nremoved the Government's deposits from the Bank of the United States. \nSenators who were opposed to that move offered a motion postponing his \nnomination indefinitely, which passed 24 to 21.\n  President James Polk, nominated George Woodward in 1845, and \nallegations arose that as a delegate to the 1837 Constitutional \nConvention, he introduced an amendment that would have prohibited any \nforeigners who came to Pennsylvania after 1841 from voting or holding \noffice.\n  President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Ebenezer Hoar in 1869, who had \nserved as Attorney General. Senators were upset by the fact that he \nrecommended nominees to the circuit courts without taking into \nconsideration Senators' preferences. His nomination was defeated 24 to \n33.\n  The same thing happened in 1881, when President Rutherford Hayes \nnominated Stanley Mathews. He was defeated because of his close ties to \nrailroad and financial interests.\n  President Warren Harding, in 1922, nominated Pierce Butler. His \nnomination was blocked from consideration on the Senate floor because \nof an alleged procorporation bias and his previous advocacy for \nrailroad issues that were coming before the Court.\n  In 1930, President Herbert Hoover's choice of John Parker was \nrejected because he made statements opposing the participation of \nAfrican Americans in politics and because of his labor record while \nchief judge of the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Marshall Harlan II was nominated by Dwight Eisenhower in 1954. The \nnomination was never reported out of committee because some members \nfelt he was ``ultraliberal'' and hostile to the South and dedicated to \nreforming the Constitution by ``judicial fiat.''\n  In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to be elevated \nto Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. His nomination was defeated \nafter the Senate failed to invoke cloture 45 to 43. One Senator is \nreported as saying that Fortas' ``judicial philosophy disqualifies him \nfor this high office.''\n  It went on for two of President Nixon's nominees. Clement F. \nHaynsworth, Jr. was rejected in 1969 by a vote of 45-55. At that time, \nfive senators issued a joint statement that expressed ``doubts about \nhis record on the appellate bench,'' and one senator opposed the \nnomination on the basis of his record on civil rights issues.\n  The other, G. Harrold Carswell, was rejected by a vote of 45-51, in \npart based on his judicial philosophy. A statement issued by four \nsenators at the time stated they opposed his nomination because his \n``decisions and his courtroom demeanor had been openly hostile to the \nblack, the poor and the unpopular.''\n  And, of course, one of President Ronald Reagan's nominees, Judge \nRobert Bork, whose views and legal philosophy were of great concern. \nJudge Bork believed Americans had no constitutional right to use \ncontraception. He argued that in guaranteeing one man, one vote, the \nCourt ``stepped beyond its boundaries as an original matter.'' And he \nhad a broad view of Executive power. He once asserted that a law \nrequiring the President to obtain a court order before conducting \nsurveillance in the United States, and against U.S. citizens was ``a \nthoroughly bad idea and almost certainly unconstitutional.''\n  Most recently, White House Counsel Harriet Miers was withdrawn even \nbefore consideration by the Judiciary Committee due to the rightwing's \nobjections.\n  So it is abundantly clear that judicial philosophy and legal views \nhave been evaluated by senators from both sides of the aisle throughout \nhistory, and they are valid reasons to reject a nominee for the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  To now argue that evaluating one's judicial philosophy is setting a \nnew precedent is simply turning a blind eye to history. So while none \nof us can predict how any person will act in the future, we do have to \nthoroughly consider information available that provides insights into a \nnominee's judicial philosophy and legal reasoning. I want to make \nclear.\n  Secondly, many of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have \nargued that the nomination of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer have set a \nprecedent for how Supreme Court nominations should be handled, that no \none questioned their judicial philosophy, and that they swept through \nby large votes. I want to take a moment to answer that.\n  The fact of the matter is that there was real advice and consent in \nthe nominations of Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Senator Hatch, in his \nbook ``Square Peg: Confessions of a Citizen Senator,'' who was then the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, gave the following account \nof the Ginsburg nomination:\n\n       It was not a surprise when the President called to talk \n     about the appointment and what he was thinking of doing.\n\n  So President Clinton told Senator Hatch what he was thinking of \ndoing. Senator Hatch goes on:\n\n       President Clinton indicated he was leaning toward Bruce \n     Babbitt . . . Clinton asked for my reaction.\n       I told him the confirmation would not be easy. I explained \n     to the President that although he might prevail in the end, \n     he should consider whether he wanted a tough, political \n     battle over his first appointment to the Court. I asked \n     whether he had considered Judge Stephen Breyer of the First \n     Circuit Court of Appeals or Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the \n     District of Columbia Court of Appeals.\n\n  Both were confirmed with relative ease. So since the ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee--the minority ranking member--had \nrecommended these nominees, it is not surprising that they moved \nthrough the confirmation process relatively easy. I am confident that \nif President Bush had decided to nominate any of the candidates \nsuggested by the current ranking member of the committee, Senator \nLeahy, the process could have been smooth this time as well. But he \ndidn't. With that said, I also believe that today is a very different \nday than the time when Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer were before \nthe Senate. Let me point out some of the differences. There was not the \npolarization that there is within America today. There was not the \nclear effort to upset the current balance of the Court and move it far \nto the right.\n  When Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were before the Senate, it had been\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\nmore than 50 years since any statute had been struck down by the \nSupreme Court on commerce clause grounds.\n  It wasn't actually until April 26, 1995, after both Justices had been \nconfirmed, that the Supreme Court began to revisit an area that had \nbeen well settled since the New Deal in the mid-1930s in its decision \non a case known as Lopez. In U.S. v. Lopez, the Court struck down the \nGun-Free School Zones Act that had been passed by the Congress, which \nessentially prohibited the possession of a firearm within a thousand \nfeet of a school. It was this decision that signaled the beginning of \nthe Rehnquist Court's federalism ``revolution.'' In the next decade, \nfrom 1995 to 2005, the Rehnquist Court struck down all or portions of \n30 congressionally enacted laws, 10 of them on federalism grounds. Here \nthey are on this chart. I will point out some of them to you:\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, the Federal Election Campaign Act, \nthe Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, the Communications Decency Act, the \nBrady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, the Water Resources Development \nAct, the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act, section 316 of the \nCommunications Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act, the Violence Against Women Act, the \nTelecommunications Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, section \n2511 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, the FDA \nModernization Act, the Child Pornography Act, the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act, the Child Online Protection Act and on and on and on, using \nvarious sections of the Constitution to hold impermissible \ncongressional actions in these areas.\n  Now, this is a major thrust of the Court, and it is a serious thrust. \nIt is one that this body and the other body ought to understand \nbecause, with these actions, the Court was essentially declaring that \nthe Congress cannot legislate in many important areas, areas that are \nvery important to me and to my constituents.\n  When Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer were before the Senate, we \nwere not in the midst of a war with Iraq, nor was our country faced \nwith a war on terror that could last for our lifetime and, for all we \nknow, for our children's lifetime. Few would have predicted that the \nPresident would authorize the use of torture in defiance of the Geneva \nConvention and the Convention Against Torture and Military Law; that \nthe President would argue that he had inherent plenary authority to \ndetain Americans without due process; and that the President would \nauthorize the electronic surveillance of Americans in direct violation \nof the law, a law passed by this body, the other body, and signed by \nPresident Carter in 1978.\n  In addition, when Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were before the \nSenate, Planned Parenthood v. Casey had just recently been decided. \nCasey made it clear that Roe v. Wade remained controlling precedent; it \naffirmed a woman's constitutional right to privacy; it clarified that \nStates have an interest to protect viable unborn life; and it held that \nmany State laws relating to abortion were valid.\n  With the Casey decision, there was a general acceptance that a \nwoman's right to choose was secure. There had been a clear and direct \nchallenge to Roe--as a matter of fact, it has been challenged at least \nthree dozen times--and the Court had affirmed in Casey Roe's central \nholding.\n  Finally, as I noted when discussing Senator Hatch's book ``Square \nPeg,'' at the time Justices Ginsburg and Breyer were before the Senate, \nwe didn't have an administration that was bent on moving the Court \ndramatically in one direction. Yet today, when we are evaluating a \nnominee to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor--a pivotal Justice, a \nJustice who was the fifth vote in 148 out of 193 decisions--the \nPresident continues to assert that he will only nominate those who view \nthe Constitution through a lens of strict constructionism and \noriginalism.\n  I think we must remember what these terms mean. I want to take a \nmoment to do so. It is widely accepted among legal scholars that strict \nconstructionists and originalists look to evaluate the Constitution \nbased on what the words say as written and what the Framers intended \nthose words to mean at the time they were written.\n  If we examine what these terms could mean when applied to actual \nconstitutional questions today, it becomes clear why most legal \nscholars view the Constitution as a living document, able to adjust to \nthe differences of the country today. Remember, in colonial times, \nthere were 13 colonies and around 3 million people. Today we are close \nto 300 million people and we are 50 States.\n  Justice Brennan wrote in 1986 about this, and I quote him:\n\n       During colonial times, pillorying, flogging, branding, and \n     cropping and nailing of the ears were practiced in this \n     country. Thus, if we were to turn blindly to history for \n     answers to troubling constitutional questions, we would have \n     to conclude that these practices would withstand challenge \n     under the cruel and unusual clause of the eighth amendment.\n\n  He wrote that in the Harvard Law Review in December of 1986.\n  If an originalist analysis were applied to the 14th amendment, women \nwould not be provided equal protection under the Constitution, \ninterracial marriages could be outlawed, schools could still be \nsegregated, and the principle of one man, one vote would not govern the \nway we elect our representatives.\n  My concerns about confirming a strict constructionist or originalist \nto the Court are best demonstrated by what this legal reasoning could \nmean in three important areas: congressional authority to enact \nlegislation, checks on Presidential powers, and individual liberty and \nprivacy interests. I want to talk about these for a minute in the \ncontext of Judge Alito.\n  It is my conclusion that Judge Alito would most likely join Justices \nThomas and Scalia in the originalist and strict constructionist \ninterpretations of the Constitution. And those are the interpretations \nthat have been used by the Rehnquist Court in the past decade to \noverthrow all or portions of the 30 laws to which I just referred. I \nhave come to this conclusion based on Judge Alito's record in the \nReagan administration and on the bench.\n  In 1986, Congress passed what seemed to me a pretty simple law. It \nwas called the Truth in Mileage Act. It basically forbid anyone from \ntampering with odometers in automobiles. As a deputy at the Office of \nLegal Counsel, Judge Alito recommended that President Reagan veto this \nbill because it violated principles of federalism.\n  Judge Alito also drafted a statement for President Reagan to make \nwhen he vetoed the bill, asserting ``it is the States and not the \nFederal Government that are charged with protecting the health, safety, \nand welfare of their citizens.''\n  It is the States, not the Federal Government. The implication is the \nFederal Government does not have a role in protecting the health, \nsafety, and welfare of our citizens.\n  Judge Alito's restricted views of congressional authority later \nsurfaced in his decisions while on the Third Circuit. For me, a prime \nexample is the case of U.S. v. Rybar. This case is significant because \nit was a case where Congress clearly had the authority to enact \nlegislation, and yet Judge Alito wrote a separate opinion, a dissent, \nto argue against the law. He was the sole dissenter, and he was \noutvoted.\n  In his opinion, he used a legal technicality that would have thrown \nout the conviction of a man who had illegally possessed and sold fully \nautomatic machine guns in the State of Pennsylvania.\n  In reaching his conclusion, he seemed to ignore past precedents, \nclearly establishing congressional authority to regulate firearms, such \nas the Miller case of 1939.\n  He also dismissed previous statutes that had already outlined the \nobvious impact guns have on interstate commerce, even when sold within \na State. To me, that was a major indication of his thinking.\n  The facts in this case make this point even more obvious: one gun was \nfrom China, the other was a military M3 submachine gun made during \nWorld War II by General Motors. Clearly, both guns had traveled through \ninterstate commerce before reaching Pennsylvania where the arrest took \nplace.\n  Judge Alito's views on congressional power could also limit \nCongress's ability to protect the environment. In the next few years, \nthe Supreme Court is likely to hear a number of cases challenging \nCongress's authority to pass\n\n[[Page S153]]\n\nlaws protecting the environment, such as the Clean Water Act and the \nEndangered Species Act. In fact, later this term, the Supreme Court \nwill hear two cases. One is Carabell v. Army Corps of Engineers, and \nthe other Rapanos v. U.S.\n  The issue in both is whether the Congress has the authority to \nregulate nonnavigable waterways under the Clean Water Act. Both are \nbrought to the Court on the basis that Congress could not regulate \nenvironmental control in nonnavigable waterways. If the Supreme Court \nwere to strike down this provision, the Federal Government would lose \nits primary tool to protect wetlands.\n  If confirmed, Judge Alito could be the decisive vote in these \nenvironmental cases, and his record on the environment, in this regard, \nis not reassuring. Let me give an example.\n  In the case Public Interest Research Group v. Magnesium Elektron, it \nwas undisputed that a chemical company had committed 150 different \nviolations of the Clean Water Act by illegally dumping chemicals into a \nriver. The plaintiffs in the case were members of an environmental \ngroup and had stopped using the river because of the pollution.\n  Judge Alito voted in a 2-to-1 decision to throw the case out. He \nadopted a narrow reading of both the Clean Water Act and the legal \nconcept of standing. In doing so, his conclusion would have gutted the \nprovision that allows individual citizens to enforce the law.\n  Three years later, the Supreme Court in a 7-to-2 decision in Friends \nof the Earth v. Laidlaw rejected Judge Alito's expansive view of the \nstanding requirement, making it easier for individuals to sue to stop \nviolations of the Clean Water Act.\n  So this is a serious concern--Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, \nEndangered Species Act. Our ability to legislate in these areas is very \nmuch at stake with this judge.\n  Judge Alito's views on the scope of Presidential powers are deeply \nconcerning to me at this point in American history. The Constitution \ngives both the President and the Congress critical roles in the defense \nof our Nation. The Constitution specifically provides in article I, \nsection 8:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To . . . provide for the \n     common Defense and general Welfare of the United States . . .\n       To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and \n     make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;\n       To raise and support Armies . . .\n       To provide and maintain a Navy;\n       To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the Land \n     and Naval Forces . . .\n       To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the \n     Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel \n     Invasions;\n       To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the \n     Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Services of the United States, reserving to \n     the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and \n     the Authority of training the Militia according to the \n     discipline prescribed by Congress . . . and\n       To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \n     carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers. . . .\n\n  In other words, we are responsible to give the powers to the \nPresident for him to execute in these areas. That is a very important \narticle, and it is the heart of congressional authority and the balance \nof power at a time of crisis.\n  Our national security and constitutional liberties suffer when either \nbranch oversteps its bounds. Today our Nation is in a very different \nplace than it was 10 years ago. We face new challenges to our \nconstitutional framework of checks and balances.\n  This President has asserted unprecedented authority in many areas \nwhich has raised profound constitutional questions. They include:\n  May the President authorize torture?\n  Does the Constitution permit the President to order the arrest and \ndetention of individuals inside the United States without due process \nor access to counsel?\n  Does the Constitution allow the President to violate laws based on \ninherent plenary power?\n  Is it constitutionally permissible for the President to authorize \nelectronic surveillance of Americans without a warrant in violation of \nFederal law?\n  Given the critical importance of these questions to both our national \nsecurity and our constitutional democracy, I asked Judge Alito a \nvariety of questions to get a sense of his vision of the balance of \npower between the President, the Congress, and the courts.\n  Rather than engage in a productive discussion about the issues, he \nsimply repeated obvious truisms, such as ``nobody is above or below the \nlaw,'' or agreed to the unsurprising proposition that the Constitution \nand the laws of the Nation are supreme. He did not answer whether the \nPresident had to follow these laws.\n  His answers were inadequate, so I was left to evaluate his views \nbased on his prior record.\n  At the Department of Justice, Judge Alito was part of the effort to \npress for expanded Presidential power, and there is no doubt about \nthat.\n  While serving in the Department of Justice, he wrote a memo on \nPresidential signing statements, and here is what he argued:\n\n       From the perspective of the executive branch, the issuance \n     of interpretive signing statements would . . . increase the \n     power of the Executive to shape the law.\n\n  ``The power of the Executive to shape the law.'' Do we believe this \nis correct, or do we believe that the ability to make and shape the law \nrests with the Congress, and the President can sign it or veto and \nindicate his reasons for so doing, but not shape the law to his \nspecific demand? Then when speaking before the Federalist Society in \nNovember of 2000, Judge Alito expressed his support for the unitary \nexecutive theory. In 1988, this unitary executive theory was rejected \nby the Supreme Court in a decision called Morrison v. Olson. It was \nrejected overwhelmingly. The majority was 7 to 1. The opinion was \noffered by Justice Rehnquist. The Court rejected Justice Scalia's \nargument that the independent counsel must be under the executive \nbranch and report to the President. That took care of what is called \nthe theory of the unitary executive.\n  Yet more than a decade later, Judge Alito declared:\n\n       I still think that this theory best captures the meaning of \n     the Constitution's text and structure.\n\n  Clearly, this is a statement for expanded Presidential authority and \nfor the unitary executive.\n  Judge Alito's vague answers at the hearing, coupled with the specific \nstatements made a few years ago, lead me to conclude that he is a \nstrong proponent of expanded Presidential authority and that he is not \ncommitted to a proper system of checks and balances, which brings me to \nmy third point.\n  If one is pro-choice in this day and age, with the balance of the \nCourt at stake, one cannot vote to confirm Judge Alito. I, for one, \nreally believe there comes a time when you just have to stand up, \nparticularly when you know the majority of people stand as you do. And \nI don't make that statement simply based on my gut instincts. It is \nreflected in the polls we see.\n  A Gallup poll released earlier this week, January 24, stated that 63 \npercent of Americans do not want to see Roe overturned. And that is \nbacked up by other polls.\n  A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released earlier this month, January 9, \nsaid a majority of Americans, 56 percent, do not believe Judge Alito \nshould be confirmed if his confirmation hearings reveal he would vote \nto overturn a woman's right to have an abortion.\n  Around here when it comes to the issue of abortion the tail wags the \ndog. The minority is the dominant voice, while the majority of people \nout there feel very differently on the question. A majority of people, \nit is clear, in the United States of America believe that a woman \nshould have certain rights of privacy--privacy that is limited by the \nState's interest to protect potential life, but a certain right to \nprivacy. If you know this nominee is not going to respect those rights \nbut holds differing views, then you have to stand up.\n\n  I am very concerned about the impact Judge Alito could have on \nwomen's rights, including a woman's right to make certain reproductive \nchoices as limited by State regulation.\n  When the issues of Roe and precedent came up during the hearings for \nChief Justice Roberts, he engaged in a conversation with me and other \nSenators. He acknowledged that Roe is well settled. He discussed the \ndifferent factors the Court considered when Casey affirmed the central \nholding of Roe. In\n\n[[Page S154]]\n\nfact, during Judge Alito's hearings, I read part of the Roberts \ntranscript to him and I gave him an opportunity to review it. I then \nasked him to tell me where he differed from Chief Justice Roberts and \nif he, too, believed Roe is well settled. He responded this way:\n\n       I think that depends on what one means by the term well \n     settled.\n\n  That was after reading an explicit and full description of what the \nnow Chief Justice had said before us. His response clearly indicated, \nat least in my view, that he didn't regard precedent that highly.\n  I next tried to talk to him about his legal views and what he meant \nwhen he said ``precedent is not an inexorable command.'' I specifically \nstated:\n\n       Those are the words that Justice Rehnquist used arguing for \n     the overturning of Roe. So my question is did you mean it \n     that way?\n\n  The most Judge Alito would say is this:\n\n       The statement that precedent is not an inexorable command \n     is a statement that has been in the Supreme Court case law \n     for a long period of time. And sitting here, I can't remember \n     what the origin of it is. . . .\n\n  In providing nothing more than this for an explanation, Judge Alito \nspoke volumes about his view on Roe. I listened carefully to the \ntestimony of many legal scholars, including professors in \nconstitutional law. One I want to quote, and I quoted it in the \ncommittee as well because it meant a great deal to me, is a professor \nof constitutional law at Harvard, Professor Larry Tribe. He said that, \nwith the addition of Judge Alito:\n\n       The Court will cut back on Roe v. Wade, step by step, not \n     just to the point where, as the moderate American center has \n     it, abortion is cautiously restricted, but to the point where \n     the fundamental underlying right to liberty becomes a hollow \n     shell.\n\n  It is important to remember that Roe, as modified by Casey, is in \nfact a moderate compromise that considers both sides of the question. \nTogether, Roe and Casey protect women's privacy interest but also allow \nStates to pass regulations to restrict that interest postviability.\n  If you look carefully at Judge Alito's decisions in three cases--\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, Blackwell v. Knoll, and Planned Parenthood \nv. Farmer--you will see in his writing where serious questions of his \nviews arise. While sustaining Roe in these cases, Judge Alito's \nopinions also raised serious questions indicating if Judge Alito was \nnot bound by precedent, or there was a gray area, he would weaken Roe \nby narrowly interpreting what constitutes an undue burden. Since in his \ndissent in Casey, Judge Alito argued that spousal notification was not \nan undue burden--a position rejected by the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Alito may have a different interpretation of when life begins \nthat could dramatically alter the Court's rulings and impact women's \naccess to contraception. This concern was highlighted when in Alexander \nv. Whitman, Judge Alito wrote a separate opinion to clarify that he \ndisagreed with the Court's ``suggestion that there could be `human \nbeings' who are not `constitutional persons.'''\n  Judge Alito may not agree with the Supreme Court's holding in Roe \nthat a woman's health must be protected for a law to be constitutional. \nThis issue was raised in Planned Parenthood v. Farmer where Judge Alito \nagreed with the decision of the Court to strike down a New Jersey \nabortion law. However, he asserted that the Court's opinion, including \nthe discussion about the lack of a health exception, was ``never \nnecessary.''\n  In addition, I was deeply troubled by Judge Alito's 1985 job \napplication. Let me tell you where he was in 1985. He was not a \nyoungster. Senator Durbin pointed this out in the Judiciary Committee. \nHe had already clerked at a New Jersey law firm. He had already clerked \nfor a Federal court of appeals judge. He had spent 4 years as an \nassistant U.S. attorney, and he had spent 4 years as Assistant to the \nSolicitor General in the Department of Justice, and he had argued 12 \ncases on behalf of the Federal Government before the Supreme Court and \nnumerous other cases before the Federal courts of appeals. So this was \nnot some naive ingenue coming down the pike, trying to get a job in the \nadministration. He filled out the job application and gratuitously \nadded these words, that he believed ``the Constitution does not protect \na right to an abortion.'' He was not asked the question; he simply \nadded those words. Why would you do that if you have argued 12 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court, if you spent 4 years as an assistant U.S. \nattorney, if you have argued before Federal circuit courts, you have \nclerked for judges--why would you do it unless it was a deeply held \nview of yours that you wanted to express?\n  I asked him about this privately in my office and he said that he was \nattempting to get a political appointment. But he also told me that the \napplication speaks for itself and he did not disavow what he wrote. \nThat spoke volumes about where he is today. It is pretty clear to me \nthat, given a chance, he would vote to overthrow Roe.\n  He also wrote in that same application:\n\n       In college, I developed a deep interest in constitutional \n     law, motivated in large part by disagreement with Warren \n     Court decisions, particularly in the areas of criminal \n     procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.\n\n  The Warren Court's reapportionment decisions established the \nprinciple of one man, one vote, and they stopped the abhorrent practice \nof diluting votes by making some voting districts larger than others. \nFor example, prior to these decisions some voting districts in the same \nState were 41 times the size of others.\n  As an attorney with the Solicitor General's Office of the Department \nof Justice, Judge Alito argued three affirmative action cases, each \ntime urging the Supreme Court to strike down affirmative action \nprograms. The arguments he made in these cases are contrary to the \nSupreme Court's subsequent decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, another 5-\n4 decision where Sandra Day O'Connor was the decisive fifth vote. In \nGrutter, the Court held that the University of Michigan and other \ncolleges and universities receiving Government funding could consider \nrace, ethnicity, and gender in school admissions policies in order to \nencourage a diverse student body.\n  Judge Alito encouraged the Senate to judge him on his 15-year record \non the Third Circuit. An examination of this record reveals a judge who \ntends to rule against civil rights more often than his colleagues. A \nreview of Judge Alito's opinions by Yale Law School professors \nconcluded that in the area of civil rights law, he consistently used \nprocedural and evidentiary standards to rule against female, minority, \nage, and disability claimants. Similarly, a review of 311 published \nopinions by Knight-Ridder found that, although his opinions were rarely \nwritten with obvious ideology, he seldom sided with an employee \nalleging discrimination.\n  Here again, there is a case, Riley v. Taylor, that is particularly \ntroubling. This case took place in Delaware, where prosecutors had \nexcluded every African-American juror in all four of its first-degree \nmurder trials that had taken place in a Delaware county that year. A \nmajority of the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, concluded that \nexcluding every Black juror in four State murder trials was evidence of \nrace-based discrimination. I would conclude that, too. The Court noted \nthat it is not ``necessary to have a sophisticated analysis by a \nstatistician to conclude that there is little chance of randomly \nselecting four consecutive all white juries.''\n  Judge Alito dissented. In contrast, he argued that ``there is little \nchance of randomly selecting left-handers in five out of six \nPresidential elections. But does it follow that the voters cast their \nballots based on whether a candidate was right- or left-handed?''\n  This dissent demonstrates a failure to grasp the critical point. \nLeft-handed individuals have not suffered the long history of \ndiscrimination in this country the way African Americans have. I think \nto use that, as a Federal appellate court judge, as a bona fide \nargument to say that you can have four consecutive murder trials in a \ncounty and exclude every African American from the jury shows you have \na mode of thinking that is not in the mainstream of American legal \nthinking.\n  So, bottom line, based on all of the information before me, I have \ndecided to vote against Judge Alito's confirmation. Mine is a vote that \nis made with the belief that a person's legal reasoning and judicial \nphilosophy, especially at a time of crisis, at times of\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\nconflict, and at times of controversy, do mean a great deal. It is my \nbelief that this nominee's legal philosophy and views will essentially \nswing the Court far out of the mainstream, toward legal philosophy and \nviews that do not reflect the majority views of this country. I will \nvote no. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \nCalifornia organizations that oppose Judge Alito's confirmation and a \nset of letters from pro-choice organizations following my full remarks, \nand I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     California Organizations That Oppose Judge Alito's Nomination\n\n       ACLU of Northern California; ACLU of Southern California; \n     AFSCME California; Alliance for Justice; Asian Pacific Law \n     Caucus; Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern \n     California; California Church Impact; California National \n     Organization for Women; California Nurses Association; \n     California State Conference of NAACP Branches; Coalition for \n     Economic Equity; California Women's Agenda; Committee for \n     Judicial Independence; Disability Rights Education and \n     Defense Fund; Ella Baker Center; Equal Justice Society; Equal \n     Rights Advocates; Greenlining Institute.\n       Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay \n     Area; Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund; \n     MoveOn.org; NARAL Pro-Choice California; NAACP Legal Defense \n     and Educational Fund; National Council of Jewish Women \n     California; National Health Law Program; People For the \n     American Way West; Planned Parenthood Affiliates of \n     California; Planned Parenthood Golden Gate; National Lawyers \n     Guild California; Planned Parenthood Los Angeles; Progressive \n     Jewish Alliance; Public Advocates Inc.; Rainbow Push \n     California; SEIU California State Council; Sierra Club; \n     Women's Employment Rights Clinic; and Women's Leadership \n     Alliance.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Catholics for a Free Choice,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2006.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman,\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Dear Chairman Specter, Ranking Member Leahy and Members of \n     the Judiciary Committee: I write to you today as president of \n     Catholics for a Free Choice, an organization that shapes and \n     advances sexual and reproductive ethics that are based on \n     justice and reflect a commitment to women's well being, to \n     express our opposition to the nomination of Judge Samuel A. \n     Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n       Our decision to ask the U.S. Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary to reject this nomination and not to send this \n     nominee for an up-or-down vote by the entire Senate is not \n     one that we take lightly. Indeed, Catholics for a Free \n     Choice, after examining his record an carefully following \n     Chief Justice John Roberts' confirmation hearing did not \n     oppose his nomination.\n       Based on public documents released by relevant government \n     agencies and from published interviews and statements with \n     and from the nominee himself during the first days of the \n     confirmation hearing, it is evident that Judge Alito is a \n     vastly different nominee from Chief Justice John Roberts. \n     These differences, however are not only manifested in \n     judicial philosophy, but sadly in critical aspects of his \n     character and integrity.\n       Our reasons for oppose this nomination go far beyond Judge \n     Alito's personal and legal opposition to reproductive health \n     services including abortion--but center on the underlying \n     principles of the qualifications necessary to serve on the \n     Supreme Court.\n       In our view, serving on the highest court in the land takes \n     a fundamental commitment to the individual rights enshrined \n     in the Constitution. These include the rights of women to \n     make decisions about their bodies; the rights of employees to \n     seek judicial relief when they feel they have been \n     discriminated against based on race or gender; a belief in \n     the ``one person, one vote'' doctrine that has been a \n     pillar of American democracy; and an understanding that \n     all citizens of the United States have equal standing \n     under the law regardless of which religious tradition they \n     identify with, if any. Throughout his time on the federal \n     bench, Judge Alito has not shown an allegiance to these \n     principles and has in fact, in many cases, shown hostility \n     to them.\n       Equally important is the integrity and character of the \n     mail or woman being nominated. This integrity includes a \n     consistent view of the law and a guarantee that the principle \n     espoused by the nominee are based on sound legal reasoning \n     and conscience--and not based upon which political \n     appointment or job they are applying for at the time. Judge \n     Alito has an unfortunate mate and well-documented history of \n     changing his positions on key personal rights based upon \n     which position in government he is being considered for. To \n     us, this suggests a nominee whose values in public service \n     are not grounded in principles, integrity and respect for \n     individual rights, but in the politics and personal ideology \n     of the moment.\n       Judge Alito has also demonstrated through his words and his \n     actions that what he pledges during confirmation hearings \n     does not necessarily reflect his actions once confirmed and \n     behind the bench. During his 1990 confirmation hearings for \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Alito \n     promised to rescue himself from any cases involving Vanguard \n     Group Inc. and Smith Barney Inc., companies which have \n     handled some of his personal investments. Despite this \n     promise, Alito ruled on a case involving Smith Barney in 1996 \n     and Vanguard Group in 2002. When pressed about this major \n     lapse, Alito responded that the 1990 promise applied only to \n     his first few years on the bench. This is a clearly troubling \n     example of either a major ethical lapse on the part of Judge \n     Alito or yet another example of the nominee saying one thing \n     to get the job, and then playing by different rules when he \n     wins confirmation.\n       Of critical importance to Catholics for a Free Choice is \n     the outright hostility to and the politicization of \n     reproductive rights by this nominee. Unlike Chief Justice \n     Roberts who was well known to be personally opposed to \n     abortion before he was confirmed to the Court, but pledged to \n     separate those views and respect the law of the land nominee \n     Alito has made both his personal and legal views on this \n     subject a hallmark of his career advancement.\n       Throughout his career, Judge Alito has shown that he \n     believes--both personally and legally--that the right to \n     choose, to make decisions about the most private and profound \n     aspect of a woman's life, i.e. when and whether to have \n     children, is not protected under the Constitution. There are \n     several examples of this, including his 1985 application \n     letter to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III in which \n     Alito wrote that he was, ``particularly proud'' of his \n     personal contributions to legal views endorsed by the \n     administration including ``that the Constitution does not \n     protect a right to an abortion,'' and his integral role as an \n     attorney in the Reagan Justice Department where he sought \n     ``opportunity to advance the goals of overruling Roe v. Wade \n     and, in the meantime, of mitigating its effects.\n       We were not convinced by his claim during his confirmation \n     hearings that he has an open mind on the right to choose as \n     embodied in Roe. Given his belief that the Constitution does \n     not protect a right to an abortion and his personal view that \n     abortion is morally untenable, it would be foolhardy to \n     accept his claim of open mindedness.\n       During opening statements of the Alito hearings, Senator \n     Edward Kennedy asked the defining questions for the entire \n     hearings. He began, ``So the question before us in these \n     hearings is this: Does Judge Alito's record hold true to the \n     letter and the spirit of equal justice? Is he committed to \n     the core values of our Constitution that are at the heart of \n     our nation's progress? And can he truly be evenhanded and \n     fair in his decisions?''\n       Through his words, his legal actions and his \n     incontrovertible actions to date, the simple answer is no. \n     Judge Alito cannot be counted on to issue rulings and to \n     write opinions based upon sound legal philosophy and the \n     proper consideration of past landmark rulings by the Court. \n     Judge Alito cannot be counted on to protect the individual \n     rights and freedoms of Americans who count on the federal \n     judiciary to protect them from undue burdens imposed by \n     ideologically driven governments and administration \n     officials. And lastly, Judge Alito cannot be counted on to \n     deliver justice in a manner that does not commingle \n     previously stated strongly held personal and legal viewpoints \n     that will be of serious detriment to members of our society.\n       I urge you to vote no on this nomination and by doing so to \n     save the rights to privacy and the individual freedoms and \n     choice to which all Americans--regardless of race, gender, \n     religion or sexual orientation--are entitled.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Frances Kissling,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     NARAL Pro-Choice America,\n\n                                                 January 11, 2006.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of NARAL Pro-Choice America, I am \n     writing to express our opposition to the confirmation of \n     Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. During his career, \n     Alito has consistently demonstrated hostility toward \n     fundamental reproductive rights. If he is confirmed as an \n     Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, women will likely \n     lose critical protections that Roe v. Wade established.\n       At the Department of Justice in the 1980s, Alito actively \n     worked to limit and ultimately overturn Roe v. Wade. As an \n     assistant to the Solicitor General, he wrote a lengthy, \n     detailed strategy memorandum in which he recommended that the \n     Reagan administration intervene in a significant abortion-\n     related case before the Supreme Court in order to advance the \n     administration's anti-choice agenda. In the memo, Alito \n     detailed his legal strategy to dismantle the protections of \n     Roe v. Wade, while pushing toward the ultimate goal of \n     overturning the landmark decision altogether. He supported \n     even the most intrusive and unreasonable restrictions on \n     reproductive freedom. Perhaps most disturbingly, he saw \n     nothing wrong with the government forcing doctors to tell \n     patients that their use of birth control may\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\n     cause abortion--an utterly inaccurate statement that defies \n     scientific definitions endorsed by the medical community and \n     the federal government.\n       Far from claims to the contrary, Alito's work at the \n     Department of Justice was hardly that of a government \n     functionary. According to a then-colleague in the Solicitor \n     General's office, Alito sought out the opportunity to work on \n     the administration's friend-of-the-court brief in the case, \n     the colleague has explained that Alito was instrumental in \n     crafting the brief, providing ``the research, the thinking, \n     as well as the legal research and analysis.'' In application \n     for another job in the Department of Justice, Alito later \n     boasted that he was ``particularly proud'' of his \n     contribution in the case ``in which the government has argued \n     in the Supreme Court that. . .the Constitution does not \n     protect a right to an abortion.'' He emphasized that this was \n     a ``legal position'' in which he personally believed ``very \n     strongly.''\n       It was my hope that, during his Senate hearings, Alito \n     would explain further these writings and share with senators \n     and the American public whether he still holds these legal \n     opinions about a woman's right to choose. Unfortunately, thus \n     far, he has failed to do so. Alito admitted that his 1985 \n     statement accurately reflects his views at the time, but then \n     flatly, repeatedly, refused to answer whether he continues to \n     believe that ``the Constitution does not protect the right to \n     an abortion.'' Especially given his willingness to state his \n     legal views in other areas, we have no choice but to conclude \n     that he in fact continues to hold this extremely troubling \n     view of women's fundamental freedom, and that he will vote to \n     dismantle and ultimately overturn Roe v. Wade should he be \n     confirmed.\n       Again, turning back to Alito's career: After his \n     appointment to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, \n     Alito tried, in the single case before him affording an \n     opportunity to shape the contours of reproductive-rights law, \n     to allow states the greatest latitude for restricting \n     women's's right to choose. As a member of the three-judge \n     panel that heard Planned Parenthood of Southeastern \n     Pennsylvania v. Casey before the case went to the Supreme \n     Court, he wrote a dissent in which he voted to uphold every \n     restriction on the right to choose at issue in the case. He \n     argued in favor of a statute that would have forced married \n     women to notify their husbands before seeking abortion care, \n     even though the statute would endanger and coerce women who \n     may fear abuse if forced to notify their husbands. Just a \n     year later, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor cast the decisive \n     vote to strike down the law. Justice O'Connor, along with her \n     coauthors, wrote, ``Women do not lose their constitutionally \n     protected liberty when they marry.''\n       Alito and his defenders sometimes cite other: abortion-\n     related decisions he has issued as claimed evidence that his \n     legal philosophy does not predispose him against a woman's \n     right to choose. But the claim is baseless. Planned \n     Parenthood of Central New Jersey v. Farmer was squarely \n     controlled by a Supreme Court case that dealt with a \n     virtually identical statute. Elizabeth Blackwell Health \n     Center for Women v. Knoll was decided on administrative law \n     grounds and tells us nothing about how Alito will rule on a \n     woman's constitutional right to privacy and choice. \n     Regrettably, pro-choice Americans can take no comfort in \n     these decisions. At every meaningful opportunity Alito has \n     sought to restrict our constitutional freedom of choice.\n       Because Samuel Alito's record is rife with hostility toward \n     women's reproductive freedom, NARAL Pro-Choice America must \n     oppose his confirmation to the Supreme Court. I urge you to \n     vote ``no'' on this nomination.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           My best,\n                                                     Nancy Keenan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Planned Parenthood, Federation of America, Inc. and \n           Action Fund, Inc.\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2006.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: On behalf of the \n     Planned Parenthood, the world's largest and most trusted \n     voluntary reproductive health care provider, we urge you to \n     oppose the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be Associate \n     Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Planned \n     Parenthood has a long-standing history of working to ensure \n     the protection of reproductive rights, as well as working to \n     advance the social, economic, and political rights of women. \n     Because the United States Supreme Court wields the ultimate \n     and unreviewable power to define the contours of women's \n     rights, the right to privacy, reproductive freedoms, and \n     other basic civil rights, Planned Parenthood believes that \n     justices appointed to this Court must demonstrate an \n     affirmative commitment to safeguarding these fundamental \n     rights and freedoms.\n       We believe that not only has Samuel Alito, Judge for the \n     Third Circuit Court of Appeals, failed to demonstrate a \n     commitment to protecting these rights, he has revealed \n     himself to be actively hostile toward them. Indeed, his \n     record is one of open antagonism toward constitutional \n     protections for reproductive rights and freedoms. Therefore, \n     PPFA strongly opposes his nomination to the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       Alito has made clear on repeated occasions his hostility \n     toward the right to choose. In 1985, while serving as an \n     Assistant to the Solicitor General in the Department of \n     Justice, Alito devised and promoted a legal strategy to bring \n     about the eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade, and, in the \n     meantime, to ``mitigate its effects.'' In an application he \n     submitted to become a Deputy Assistant U.S. Attorney General, \n     he wrote that he was ``particularly proud'' of his work on \n     cases where the government argued that ``the Constitution \n     does not protect a right to an abortion.''\n       His hostility continued as an appellate judge. Indeed, \n     Judge Alito's judicial record reflects and advanced the very \n     legal strategy he laid out years earlier to undermine the \n     right to choose. Judge Alito was the lone dissenter in \n     Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey when \n     the case was before the Third Circuit. Writing separately \n     from his colleagues, Alito voted to uphold a state law that \n     forced married women to notify their husbands prior to \n     obtaining an abortion. On review, a majority of the Supreme \n     Court--including Justice O'Connor--emphatically rejected \n     Alito's interpretation as one based on outdated notions of \n     women's role in marriage and society and held the husband \n     notification provision unconstitutional.\n       Judge Alito's record demonstrates hostility to women's \n     equality in general and reproductive rights specifically. \n     Judge Alito has been nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day \n     O'Connor, who has for over a decade played a crucial role in \n     protecting these fundamental rights. If permitted to take \n     Justice O'Connor's seat on the High Court, Judge Alito would \n     have the power to advance his ``closely held'' personal view \n     that Roe should be overturned, to work to unravel settled law \n     and to influence adversely the course of the Constitution's \n     basic protections for access to reproductive health care for \n     more than a generation. Judge Alito's record suggests that, \n     if confirmed, he would do just that.\n       On behalf of the millions of women and men who count on us \n     to protect their reproductive health, we urge you to oppose \n     the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to Associate Justice and \n     protect the right to choose.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Karen Pearl,\n     Interim President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            [Jan. 11, 2006]\n\n               RMC Opposes Judge Alito for Supreme Court\n\n       The Republican Majority for Choice (RMC) regrettably \n     announces its opposition to the nomination of Judge Samuel \n     Alito to the Supreme Court.\n       RMC is an organization whose core mission is to protect the \n     right to choose as outlined in Roe v. Wade and to represent \n     the millions of Republicans who strongly support this right. \n     After much research and analysis of Mr. Alito's own record \n     and statements on this issue of individual freedom it is \n     clear that he is an advocate for further restricting this \n     right.\n       Judge Alito seems by all measures to be an experienced and \n     capable jurist, but one who is out of step with mainstream \n     Americans on the issue of abortion and maintaining the legal \n     right to choose.\n       There is no crystal ball to predict how a Justice Alito \n     would rule in future cases; therefore we have closely \n     monitored the confirmation hearings with the hope that Judge \n     Alito would offer some clarifying statements that would allay \n     our concerns about his record. Instead, he side-stepped the \n     issue of whether or not the right to privacy in the \n     Constitution extends to reproductive choice. He avoided \n     answering whether Roe was settled law and existing precedent \n     required a health exception to statutes limiting a woman's \n     access to abortion.\n       Without such assurances, we can only calculate his judicial \n     philosophy on reproductive rights through the prism of his \n     past actions and statements. As the replacement for the \n     architect of the ``undue burden'' standard, the stakes are \n     too high for RMC to support an appointee who outlined a \n     blueprint to dismantle that very standard.\n       The reality is that Judge Alito would not have to vote to \n     overrule Roe in order to be the architect of the denial of a \n     woman's right to choose. He could give lip service to \n     respecting Roe while upholding the numerous legislative \n     efforts to chip away at reproductive freedom. The cumulative \n     result is that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are rendered \n     meaningless.\n       But Judge Alito's position on choice, however, is not the \n     only disappointment surrounding his nomination. The selection \n     of Judge Alito sends a very clear message from the Bush \n     Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress that \n     they are willing to continue steering the party into a \n     marginalized corner that puts it at odds with most voters.\n       Sadly, we have come to a point at which average Republicans \n     are beginning to abandon the GOP policy and candidates. We \n     have seen this in the public outcry concerning President \n     Bush's opposition to stem cell research; we saw it last \n     November in the Virginia gubernatorial race, and we will see \n     it again this year if Republican candidates continue to \n     promote extremist views. We pledge to continue our mission to \n     promote common\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\n     sense solutions to help lessen the incidence of abortion \n     while ensuring that women and families maintain the safe and \n     legal right to choose. We will no longer stand by while \n     women's rights are used as a political soapbox for either \n     party.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 national Abortion Federation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2006.\n     Senator Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: On behalf of the \n     National Abortion Federation and our members, I am writing to \n     express our opposition to the nomination of Judge Samuel A. \n     Alito to the United States Supreme Court. If confirmed, Alito \n     would shift the Court to the right and would be a vote to \n     overturn Roe v. Wade, thereby jeopardizing women's lives and \n     health.\n       Alito has made no secret of his opposition to abortion and \n     a woman's constitutional right to privacy. Alito has argued \n     that the ``Constitution does not protect abortion,'' and has \n     touted his work to overturn Roe v. Wade as an early highlight \n     of his career. Although some have tried to downplay these \n     statements as evidence only of an advocate applying for a \n     job, Alito was not merely expressing his personal views or \n     advocating for a client. Instead, Alito was offering his own \n     legal philosophy and legal opinion that the Constitution does \n     not protect the right to choose.\n       Additionally, Alito has actively volunteered to work on \n     cases arguing for a reversal of Roe v. Wade. For example, \n     Alito volunteered to draft the legal strategy and framework \n     for the government's brief in Thornburgh v. American College \n     of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In that case, the \n     government's brief sought to mitigate the effects of Roe for \n     the short term while launching a ``back-door assault'' on Roe \n     for the long term. Alito's work on the brief was deemed \n     ``instrumental'' by one of his colleagues and central to the \n     drafting of the brief.\n       Judge Alito's hostility to Roe v. Wade is not only evident \n     from his tenure as a government lawyer, but also from his \n     work as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \n     Circuit. While serving on that court, Judge Alito supported \n     restricting access to abortion and limiting the right to \n     privacy in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. His opinion on \n     spousal notification was ultimately rejected by the Supreme \n     Court. In the 2000 case, Planned Parenthood of Central New \n     Jersey v. Farmer, Alito refused to join the majority opinion \n     in striking down a ban on abortion because it lacked an \n     exception to protect women's health. Instead, he wrote his \n     own opinion making clear he joined the decision only because \n     he was required to follow the Supreme Court precedent of \n     Stenberg v. Carhart, a case he no longer would be required to \n     follow as a Supreme Court justice.\n       Rather than nominating a moderate, consensus candidate to \n     the Supreme Court, President Bush chose to bow to the \n     pressures and demands of his far-right base and nominate \n     Samuel Alito, a jurist whose judicial philosophy is clearly \n     out of the mainstream. The fact that the President chose such \n     an extreme candidate to replace Justice O'Connor, who cast \n     the swing vote in many reproductive rights cases, is \n     unacceptable. For these reasons, the National Abortion \n     Federation calls on the United States Senate to defeat the \n     nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme \n     Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Vicki A. Saporta,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this morning in support of the \nnomination of Samuel Alito to the position of Associate Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I have had an opportunity over the past couple of \ndays, and certainly in this past hour, sitting in the chair as you are, \nMr. President, to listen to the discussions on both sides of the aisle \nabout the nominee before us, Judge Alito. I have been listening very \ncarefully to the comments that have been made and the discussion of \ncertain issues. But when it comes to the issue of Judge Alito's \ncredentials, I do not hear a debate about them. I do not hear a hue and \ncry that this is a man who does not have the credentials to serve in \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. I believe, and I believe many of my colleagues \nwould agree, that Judge Alito's credentials are exemplary. No President \nshould be denied the prerogative of appointing a person who is as \nqualified as Judge Alito to the Court.\n  Judge Alito, after 3 very long days of responding to over 700 \nquestions, emerged from these nomination hearings the same person who \nmany of us who met with him understood him to be--quite simply, a \nseasoned jurist who has the intellect, the temperament, and the \nreverence for the law which is required for service on the Nation's \nhighest Court. So it is not surprising that Judge Alito has received \nthe American Bar Association's highest rating for any nominee. It was a \nunanimous ``well qualified'' rating.\n  For those who are not familiar with how the American Bar Association \nscores or does the rating of the judges, the criteria that are looked \nto are criteria such as the judicial qualifications--the resume, the \ncredentials; whether or not the individuals have presented themselves \nor conducted themselves free from bias, operating in a fair and \nimpartial manner as a fair and impartial decisionmaker; and also \nlooking to judicial temperament.\n  The bar association, through its rating process, couldn't keep a \nscorecard as to whether the individual has ruled more times in favor of \nthe big guy over the little guy. It is a process where truly judicial \ntemperament, the qualification, the credentials, and the free-from-bias \nand fair decision-making, is the criteria that is looked at.\n  We have heard over the course of days and in the committee hearings \nabout Samuel Alito's background. He has a very moving and a very \nAmerican personal story. Born to immigrant parents, Judge Alito is \nprobably the first one to say that the person he admires most is his \nfather--his father who battled barriers of prejudice until he became \nboth a teacher and the first director of the New Jersey Office of \nLegislative Services.\n  Judge Alito excelled at his studies. He received degrees from two Ivy \nLeague institutions. But I sense--I certainly picked this up in my \nmeeting with him--that Judge Alito is not one to forget where he came \nfrom or forget his modest roots.\n  His testimony in the hearings was unassuming, unpretentious. He \nthoughtfully listened, and I believe sincerely responded, to the \ncommittee's questions, recognizing that there are certain limitations \nin terms of predicting outcomes or sticking to the issues that might be \nbefore the Court should he be confirmed.\n  By all accounts, including those of many Democrats who have served \nwith him, Judge Alito scrupulously lets the facts and the law--the \nfacts and the law, not the politics--dictate his decisions.\n  What struck me during the nomination process in the hearing was the \ntestimony of so many of his colleagues--and not just Republican \ncolleagues but a wide range of individuals, self-professed liberals, \nand conservatives--who all spoke very highly of and who acclaimed Judge \nAlito.\n  I would like to mention a couple of the comments that were made in \nthe course of the testimony. The testimony of the Third Circuit Court's \nsenior judge, Judge Aldisert, had this about Judge Alito:\n\n       We who have heard his probing questions during oral \n     arguments, of being privy to his wise insightful comments in \n     our private conferences; we who have observed at firsthand \n     his impartial approach to decision-making and his thoughtful \n     judicial temperament and know his carefully crafted opinions; \n     we--who are his colleagues--are convinced that he will also \n     be a great Justice.\n\n  Here is another statement from one of his colleagues, from Judge \nEdward Becker, who serves on the Third Circuit, and who sat with Judge \nAlito on over 1,000 cases. He described the judge as:\n\n       Brilliant . . . highly analytical, and meticulous and \n     careful . . . The Sam Alito that I have sat with for fifteen \n     years is not an ideologue. He is not a movement person. He is \n     a real judge, deciding each case on the facts and the law, \n     not on his personal views whatever they may be. He \n     scrupulously adheres to precedent.\n\n  Still another colleague, Judge Leonard Garth, described him as ``an \nintellectually gifted and morally principled judge . . . he will always \nvote in accordance with the Constitution and laws as enacted by \nCongress.''\n  I believe these qualities are critical; for when Judge Alito is \nconfirmed, as I believe he will be, he will have giant shoes to fill. \nThe legacy that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor will leave is one of fair-\nmindedness, open-mindedness, and lack of an ideological agenda. Justice \nO'Connor once described her approach to cases in this way:\n\n       It cannot be too often stated that the greatest threats our \n     constitutional freedom comes in times of crisis . . . The \n     only way\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\n     for judges to mediate these conflicting impulses is to do \n     what they should do anyway: stay close to the record in each \n     case that appears before them, and make their judgments based \n     on that alone.\n\n  Based on my conversations with Judge Alito, his testimony before the \ncommittee, and the statements of so many of his colleagues who know his \nwork best, I am confident that Judge Alito will have that open- and \nfair-mindedness. He told the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Good judges are always open to the possibility of changing \n     their minds . . . Result-oriented jurisprudence is never \n     justified because it is not our job as judges to try to \n     produce particular results.\n\n  In his opening statement, Judge Alito recalled the oath that he made \nat the time he was sworn as a judge of the court of appeals. He stated \nthat he would ``administer justice equally, both to the rich and the \npoor'' and that he would ``carry out the laws and the Constitution'' to \nthe best of his ability.\n  I believe Samuel Alito has done that for nearly two decades as a \nFederal judge. I will certainly look to him to do that in his new \nrole--again, without agenda, without prejudgment, without bias.\n  I join many of my colleagues on the Senate floor this morning in \nsupporting the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President. I rise to announce my intention to vote in \nfavor of Judge Samuel A. Alito's nomination to be an Associate Justice \nof the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee and others have thoroughly scrutinized \nhis background and credentials. Hundreds of documents and memos he \nproduced as a lawyer have been reviewed, along with hundreds of \njudicial opinions he authored or participated in during his 15 years as \na Federal court of appeals judge. Those documents have revealed a \nstrong intelligence and a deep respect for the law and the \nConstitution.\n  Earlier this month, the Judiciary Committee held several days of \nhearings on Judge Alito's nomination. Everything in those hearings \nreinforced my impressions of Judge Alito from my meeting with him in \nNovember. He was forthcoming during the committee members' questioning, \ncandidly answering hundreds of questions regarding specific cases, the \nlaw, and his judicial philosophy. His judicious temperament during the \nhearings was apparent.\n  During the hearings, I was also impressed by the comments of seven \ncurrent and former Third Circuit Court of Appeals judges. They \ntestified in support of Judge Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. \nThis support by the individuals most familiar with Judge Alito's skills \nand judgments carries great weight.\n  Finally, last month, the American Bar Association unanimously rated \nJudge Samuel Alito as ``well qualified'' for his appointment as \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court. This is the highest rating that \ncan be given to a judicial nominee. Given Judge Alito's performance at \nthe hearings and the strong support for his nomination, no one should \nbe surprised by this top ABA rating.\n  I enthusiastically endorse and support Judge Alito's nomination. I \nbelieve he will bring a solid base of legal and judicial experience to \nthe Court. The President has chosen wisely, and I encourage my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in voting for this exceptional nominee.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nvote to confirm Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., as an Associate Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Before I discuss my reasons for supporting Judge Alito, I would like \nto make a few remarks about the judicial confirmation process. Judge \nAlito is the second nominee to the Supreme Court since I was elected to \nthe Senate. I have been pleased with how his nomination has been \nhandled by both the White House and the Judiciary Committee.\n  I wish to compliment Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for the \nexcellent job they have done in handling the confirmation hearings for \nJudge Alito. The hearings were fair and orderly. These hearings gave \nthe country an important opportunity to see what type of person Judge \nAlito is: one with a long history of service to his country and with a \ntrue love of the law. As was the case with the confirmation hearings \nfor Chief Justice Roberts, the ``advice and consent'' process gave the \ncountry a valuable lesson in constitutional law, showing that each \nbranch of Government plays a valuable role in our democracy.\n  The President has nominated another fine candidate to the Supreme \nCourt. History will look back on the nomination of Judge Alito, \ncombined with President Bush's nomination of Chief Justice Roberts, as \none of the most important legacies of the Bush administration.\n  A Supreme Court nominee must have two qualities. First, a nominee \nmust have an exceptional intellect. Second, a nominee must be committed \nto the rule of law. I am very pleased to say that based on everything I \nhave seen and heard, Judge Alito has demonstrated both of these \nqualities.\n  It is difficult to see how Judge Alito could have more impressive \nprofessional credentials. From his academic record to his almost 30 \nyears in government service, including 15 years on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit, Judge Alito has accumulated a remarkable \nrecord of achievement.\n  As my colleagues have previously noted, Judge Alito graduated from \nPrinceton University, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and was selected \nas a Scholar of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International \nAffairs. Judge Alito then attended Yale Law School where he served as \nan editor of the Yale Law Journal.\n  Since his start as a young lawyer, Judge Alito has shown a commitment \nto public service in the Jeffersonian ideal of the citizen-lawyer. \nJudge Alito served as a law clerk to Judge Leonard Garth of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit. After completing his clerkship, \nJudge Alito began his legal career as an Assistant U.S. Attorney \nbriefing and arguing cases before the Third Circuit. I hope that Judge \nAlito's commitment to public service is noted by law students and young \nlawyers around the country as they think about their career choices. \nJudge Alito's experience stands as a model of public service and has \nled him to the opportunity to obtain one of the highest honors a lawyer \ncan hope to achieve, a chance to serve his country as an Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In 1987, Judge Alito was nominated and approved by unanimous consent \nas the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. As U.S. attorney, \nJudge Alito prosecuted a wide variety of cases, including those \ninvolving white collar and environmental crimes, drug trafficking, \norganized crime, and violations of civil rights. Judge Alito's \nextensive experience as a Federal prosecutor will add a unique \nperspective to the Court's decisionmaking process.\n  In 1990, Judge Alito was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to serve \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Throughout his 15 \nyears as a judge on the Third Circuit, Judge Alito has developed a \nreputation as a methodical, gracious, even-tempered jurist with a \nhistory of fairness for all who appear before him. Judge Alito is also \nknown for producing well-written and well-reasoned opinions. His 15 \nyears on the Third Circuit give Judge Alito a unique and seasoned \nperspective on, and appreciation for, the courts.\n  His impressive educational and professional background makes Judge \nAlito well prepared to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. As \nhe displayed during his confirmation hearings, he has an encyclopedic \nknowledge of the Supreme Court and of constitutional law. Yet he also \nhas diverse, real-world experience in government and in how law \ninteracts with the actual day-to-day operation of government. Judge \nAlito has the ideal balance of academic and practical experience.\n  Given his professional achievements, it is not surprising that the \nAmerican Bar Association has given Judge Alito its highest rating. Mr. \nStephen L. Tober, the chairman of the American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, noted in his statement, \nthe ABA unanimously concluded that Judge Alito is ``well qualified'' to \nserve as Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The ABA noted \nthat ``[Judge Alito's] integrity,\n\n[[Page S159]]\n\nprofessional competence, and judicial temperament are indeed found to \nbe of the highest standing. Judge Alito is an individual who, we \nbelieve, sees majesty in the law, respects it, and remains a dedicated \nstudent of it to this day.''\n  Judge Alito has shown a commitment to the rule of law. Now, no two \npeople will agree on how to interpret every provision of the \nConstitution or of every statute. Nevertheless, Judge Alito's statement \nthat ``there is nothing that is more important for our republic than \nthe rule of law'' is an important testament to his commitment to \nensuring that the rule of law, and not individual preferences of \nJustices, remains supreme. It is essential that any nominee displays a \nconscious commitment to deciding cases based on the law, rather than on \nhis or her own personal views.\n  During Judge Alito's confirmation hearings, I was struck by how \ndedicated he is to the law and to correctly applying the law as a \njudge. As Judge Alito noted, ``The judiciary has to protect rights, and \nit should be vigorous in doing that, and it should be vigorous in \nenforcing the law and in interpreting the law . . . in accordance with \nwhat it really means and enforcing the law even if that's unpopular.'' \nHe went on to state, ``A judge can't have any agenda. A judge can't \nhave any preferred outcome in any particular case. And a judge \ncertainly doesn't have a client. The judge's only obligation--and it's \na solemn obligation--is to the rule of law, and what that means is that \nin every single case, the judge has to do what the law requires.''\n  I observed Judge Alito's demeanor and conduct during this \nconfirmation process, as he refused to abandon his judicial \nindependence for the sake of political expediency. As Judge Alito \nnoted, ``We shouldn't decide those questions, even in our own minds, \nwithout going through the whole process. If we announce--if a judge or \na judicial nominee announced before even reading the briefs or getting \nthe case or hearing the argument what he or she thought about the \nultimate legal issue, all of that would be rendered meaningless, and \npeople would lose all their respect for the judicial system, and with \njustification, because that is not the way in which members of the \njudiciary are supposed to go about the work of deciding cases.''\n  Accordingly, I have every confidence that parties who appear before \nJudge Alito will encounter a judge who is committed to viewing each \ncase without bias and to reaching a decision that is dictated by the \nrule of law alone.\n  Finally, I want to offer some personal observations about Judge \nAlito. Too often we view executive and judicial nominees through \npolitical or ideological glasses and not as human beings. Nominees \nquickly get labeled as being a ``Republican nominee'' or a ``Democratic \nNominee'' or as belonging to a particular school of thought or being a \nfollower of a particular thinker or politician. This is unfortunate as \neach nominee's character gets overlooked and we fail to see this \nimportant aspect of each nominee. It is, however, a nominee's character \nthat can have the biggest impact on his or her work.\n  In Judge Alito, I believe the Senate has before it not only a nominee \nwho has the capability to be a great Associate Justice but also a \nnominee who is simply a wonderful person.\n  I share Judge Alito's appreciation of the great and wonderful \nopportunities for all Americans. I was moved by Judge Alito's \nsentiments about his father, as he recalled how a ``small good deed'' \nfrom a local Trenton area person allowed his father the chance to \nattend college and how this act of kindness eventually led to Judge \nAlito's presence before the U.S. Senate. I can relate to the story of \nJudge Alito's father because my own father was strongly influenced by \nhis high school principal and a history teacher to stay in school \nrather than take a laborer's job. With the strong encouragement from \nthese two individuals, my father completed high school and attended \nCarnegie Tech on a Kroger's Scholarship. Such stories are familiar to \nmany descendants of immigrants and they show that the American Dream is \nstill alive and well.\n  During my meeting with Judge Alito, he displayed a gracious manner \nand humble attitude. He is clearly very smart and engaging, and it was \na pleasure to hear him explain his view of the Supreme Court and the \nrule of law. But he is also a very openminded person who listens to \nothers with sincerity and a willingness to hear their views. For such a \nbrilliant and successful person, I did not detect a hint of arrogance. \nHe is a dedicated family man with a good sense of humor whom I believe \nall Americans will be able to respect and admire.\n  I have also been pleased to hear that my impressions of Judge Alito \nhave been echoed by so many others during the hearings. I point \nparticularly to the testimony of Professor Nora Demleitner, a self-\nprofessed ``left-leaning Democrat,'' who served as a law clerk with \nJudge Alito after graduating from Yale Law School. Professor Demleitner \ndescribed Judge Alito as ``a man of great integrity, decency and \ncharacter.'' Professor Demleitner also noted that Judge Alito is one of \nher role models and that he has one of the most brilliant legal minds \nof our generation.\n  In short, Judge Alito displays the openmindedness, humility and \ncommitment to serving the public interest that should serve as the \nparadigm of judicial temperament for members of our highest Court.\n  In reviewing Judge Alito's academic and professional record, his firm \ncommitment to the rule of law, and his strong character, it is clear \nthat Judge Alito is eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. \nIt would be truly unfortunate if we allow this nomination to fall \nvictim to the partisanship that has been growing in the Senate.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Judge \nAlito to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as a member of the majority and sitting as \nthe President of the Senate yesterday, I was able to hear several hours \nof debate on the nomination of Judge Sam Alito, Jr.\n  I heard time and again dire predictions that Judge Alito is going to \ngive the executive branch complete authority over our Government, \nincluding himself on the Supreme Court. Those who oppose him never \nmentioned one single case where Judge Alito ruled in favor of the \nPresident or expanded Executive power--not once. They think if they \njust keep repeating the same far-left smear--one dreamt up by far-left \ngroups such as Ralph Neas' People for the American Way and Nan Aron's \nAlliance for Justice--the American people will fall for it.\n  It is disturbing to me that those who oppose Sam Alito are taking \ntheir cues from people such as Nan Aron and the Alliance for Justice \nwho, even before the hearings began, before we had any hearings \nwhatsoever, bragged, ``You name it, we'll do it,'' to sink Judge Alito.\n  I think the American people and their elected representatives would \nrather base their views on the lawyers and judges from across the \npolitical spectrum who had actually known Judge Alito.\n  Former Third Circuit Judge Gibbons explained his faith in Judge \nAlito's ability to fairly judge cases in which the government is \nasserting its executive power. He said: ``The committee members should \nnot think for a moment that I support Judge Alito's nomination because \nI am a dedicated defender of that administration. On the contrary, I \nand my firm have been litigating with that administration for a number \nof years over its treatment of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, \nand elsewhere, and we are certainly chagrined at the position that is \nbeing taken by the administration with respect to those detainees. I am \nconfident, however, that as an able legal scholar and a fair-minded \njustice, he will give the arguments, legal and factual, that may be \npresented on behalf of our clients careful and thoughtful consideration \nwithout any predisposition in favor of the position of the executive \nbranch.''\n  Defense lawyers who litigated against Judge Alito confirm that when \nJudge Alito was part of the executive branch, he had a modest view of \nits power.\n  The New York Times reported that one defense attorney, Dan Ruhnke,\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\nsaid that Judge Alito lacked the ``cop mentality'' of many career \nprosecutors and was ``never a cheerleader for law enforcement.''\n  Another defense attorney, Drew Barry, said that Judge Alito was ``not \na bloodthirsty United States attorney,'' and that he was ``a vigorous \nprosecutor who went after a wide variety of bad guys, but his \nreputation was not someone who would ask for the heaviest sentences.''\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee and in my time in the Senate, \nthis is a sorrowful time for me.\n  The politics of personal destruction were all too evident in the \nSenate hearing and continue on the floor of this body.\n  The ``guilt by association'' standard of those who oppose Sam Alito \nwould disqualify anybody who would be nominated no matter who the \nPresident is.\n  The idea that politics guides the Supreme Court nominations process \nin the Senate is new. The idea of the ``results only in my eyes \nqualification'' proves that those who challenge the integrity of Sam \nAlito require standards that they themselves could never live up to.\n  To be critical is fair to the process of confirmation, but \ndestruction and absolute mischaracterization of one's record the way we \nhave seen reaffirms the lack of fairness and conscience of those who \ncarry out such tactics.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I spent 4 days listening, \nquestioning, and watching--not only Sam Alito but all those who came to \ntestify for him and those who came to testify against him.\n  Here is what I observed--not as a lawyer, not as a Senator, but as a \nphysician trained in the art of observation and the art of listening.\n  Sam Alito is a man of high moral character. You do not hear the \ndirect words challenging that, but you hear everything indirectly.\n  He is also a man of intellectual brilliance, impressing everyone who \ncomes in contact with him.\n  He is a man of dedication to the law, to equal justice under the law.\n  He is a man who has shown dedicated commitment to the things that are \nimportant in our country.\n  He is a man who is completely sold out to one thing, and one thing \nonly: His record and his life has demonstrated equal justice under the \nlaw.\n  What I also observed was a great diversity of political background of \nthose who support him, those who know him, those who have worked with \nhim for the last 15 years, regardless of their political views, either \nliberal or conservative, regardless of their gender or their color, \nregardless of their view on abortion.\n  Those who know him uniformly support him as a great jurist, a man of \nintegrity and conscience, and one who is completely sold out to the \nidea that everyone in this country has equality under the law.\n  Those who know him, those who testified, of all stripes, of all \npolitical persuasions, would and are challenging what we have been \nhearing on the floor by those who oppose him--the mischaracterization \nof his rulings, the mischaracterization of his beliefs, the \nmischaracterization of his actions.\n  What I also observed, which concerns me even more, was that those who \ndon't know him but have a political agenda to keep the Court activist \nand beyond its constitutional bounds oppose him. They do not know him. \nBut what they do know is judicial activism, making law where none \nexits, which they put before a judiciary committed to equal justice \nunder the law.\n  That is why he is being opposed. Their greatest fear is the Court \nwill return to a place where the Constitution, the statutes, and \ntreaties are interpreted, but personal political agendas are left at \nthe door.\n  They fear the battles lost in the legislatures will no longer be \ncarried out by judicial fiat. The former Soviet Union is the great \nexample. They had a constitution but there was not equal justice under \nthat constitution.\n  During Chief Justice Roberts' opening statement to the Judiciary \nCommittee, he referenced the fact that the most powerful entity in the \nworld, the U.S. Government, deferred to the rule of law when the Court \nwas convinced that a private client was right on the law and the \nGovernment was not. He referenced President Reagan's speeches about the \nSoviet Constitution and how it purported to grant wonderful rights of \nall sorts to people, but those rights were empty promises because that \nsystem did not have an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law \nand enforce those rights. Roberts concluded:\n\n       We do, because of the wisdom of our founders and the \n     sacrifices of our heroes over the generations to make their \n     vision a reality.\n\n  Under our law, the mighty can be defeated by the meager.\n  We heard yesterday the philosophy of those who oppose this great \njurist. Let me quote it exactly because it is very dangerous. This \nquote is from the Senator from Rhode Island:\n\n       . . . in truth the Supreme Court is the Constitution.\n\n  If that is so, we are no longer a nation of laws but rather a nation \nof judges. That is not America. That is not freedom. That creates nine \nkings, the exact opposite of what our Founders intended. That is the \nvery thing the American people rejected in the election of 2004. It was \nabout judges.\n  Finally, let's talk about the real issue that will cause most people \nto oppose him. They fear he may truly believe in liberty for all. That \nis their fear. Let me explain. Senator Kennedy had a very eloquent \nquote during the hearing. I would like to repeat it:\n\n       America is noblest when it is just to all of its citizens \n     in equal measure. America is freest when the rights and \n     liberties of all are respected. America is strongest when we \n     can all share fairly in its prosperity. And we need a court \n     that will hold us true to these guiding principles today and \n     into the future.\n\n  But he did not mean ``all,'' he meant all those except the truly \ninnocent and truly weak, the preborn child. Behind me are two pictures, \none of a 26-week-old preterm infant in a neonatal IC unit, smaller than \nyour hand; and the other picture is of a 26-week preborn child's face \nseen by ultrasound.\n  The Declaration of Independence states:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . . .\n\n  So, America, ask yourself, how did we get to the point that the \naccidental killing of a 26-week unborn infant is a felony but taking of \nthat same life by abortionists is legal? It is schizophrenic. Why \nshould your liberty be based on your location inside the womb or out?\n  The Court's jurisprudence on liberty and privacy interests is \nfundamentally flawed. They fear a correction in that flaw.\n  To quote Robbie George of Princeton University:\n\n       On what constitutional basis can we say that abortion is \n     protected by ``due process'' but a right to assisted suicide \n     . . . is not? Why is sodomy protected and prostitution \n     unprotected? Why does the right to privacy not extend to \n     polygamy or the use of recreational drugs?\n\n  That is the kind of justice you have when you are a nation of judges \nand not law. Hopefully, someone of Sam Alito's character can steer the \nship back to liberty for all, including the weakest and most innocent \nof all. Sam Alito was sold out to this document, the U.S. Constitution. \nHe sold out to equal justice under the law. We need to speak truthfully \nabout the opposition to him. We need to speak truthfully about the \nproblems that have been created by an activist Court, and about the \nopposition to bring back and steer the ship to where the judges make \njudgment based on the Constitution, laws, and the treaties of this \ncountry, not their political philosophies.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to spend a few \nminutes visiting with the Senate about Judge Alito. Based on my study \nof his record and my discussions with him, I believe, if confirmed, he \nwill turn out to be one of our best Supreme Court Justices.\n  I do not know that anybody on the floor has contested his \nprofessional qualifications. He is certainly exceptionally qualified, \nat least based on\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\nthat, to serve on the Nation's highest Court. He has the experience, \nthe temperament, and integrity that America expects in a Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  Judge Alito has more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court \nnominee in more than 70 years. He has served for 15 years as a judge on \nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He participated in the \ndecisions of more than 1,500 Federal appeals. He wrote more than 350 \nopinions. I think his clerks probably have to work pretty hard, he has \nbeen so busy. This is why I wonder why some people say they do not know \nenough about what he might do. I do not know how any judge, how any \ncandidate could qualify on that basis, if Judge Alito does not.\n  He served as the top Federal prosecutor in one of the Nation's \nlargest Federal districts. He was an appellate advocate for the United \nStates in the Office of Solicitor General. He was a Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel. He received his \nbachelor's degree from Princeton. I would not hold that against him. He \nwas elected Phi Beta Kappa at the time. He went to Yale Law School, \nwhere he served as an editor on the Yale Law Journal. That is quite a \nrecord.\n  During last week's hearing, Judge Alito answered over 700 questions \nfor more than 18 hours. He was thoughtful and thorough in answering the \ntough questions. He was humble throughout the process, which is \nsomething I personally look for when considering anybody who is seeking \na life appointment and particularly a judicial appointment. I think a \nbig dose of ``humble'' is important if you want to be a judge because \nyou are in the position, as a judge, to be rude to people and they \ncannot be rude back to you. I think you ought to have a temperament \nwhere you are not tempted to do that.\n  What does the record and the process reveal about this nominee? \nSimply that he is one of the finest nominees ever to come before the \nSenate. We learned a lot about him as a person during this process as \nwell. He is certainly brilliant and hard working. He went before the \nJudiciary Committee without a note. He is a man of integrity. He is \nhonest. He is devoted to his family. These are all qualities we want in \nthe men and women who serve our Nation on the high Court. These are the \nkinds of qualities that will move America forward and move the judicial \nbranch forward.\n  He has proven beyond any doubt that he has the qualifications, the \ntemperament, the knowledge, and the understanding of the Constitution \nto serve on the United States Supreme Court. I do not know how you can \nprove it, if he has not proven it. I would imagine even those who are \ngoing to oppose his nomination for other reasons would agree he has the \nright kind of temperament and qualifications. He wants to be on the \nCourt because he loves the law. And he is a judge because he wants to \nserve the United States. Those are the right reasons to want to be on \nthe Supreme Court.\n  I made a point on other occasions about judicial nominations that I \nthink is relevant here. It is, in a way, misleading to talk about a \njudicial nominee being in or out of the mainstream of American \njurisprudence because the truth is there is more than one mainstream. \nLawyers are divided over which jurisprudential theory ought to guide \njudges in interpreting the statutes and in interpreting the \nConstitution. Just as we in the Senate disagree, legitimately, about \npolitical philosophy, lawyers also disagree about jurisprudential \nphilosophy.\n  Oftentimes, there is not any one completely correct answer when you \nare interpreting a vague provision of the Constitution, but that does \nnot mean there are no incorrect answers. Because reasonable people \nlooking at the history and the text of the document might disagree as \nto what is exactly the right answer in a given case does not mean there \nare no wrong answers. And a wrong answer, as Judge Alito said so \nclearly in his introductory remarks before the Judiciary Committee and \nthroughout his testimony, is an answer that does not respect the rule \nof law.\n  Here is what Judge Alito said:\n\n       The judge's only obligation--and it's a solemn obligation--\n     is to the rule of law, and what that means is that in every \n     single case, the judge has to do what the law requires.\n\n  A wrong answer is one that is based on an idea of the judicial role \nthat allows the judge to do whatever he or she thinks they would want \nto do if they were in control of the policy involved in an issue. \nWhatever their theory of interpreting the Constitution is, they should \nbe consistent in applying it. Judges should not work for a particular \noutcome or agenda.\n\n  Here is what Judge Alito said on this issue:\n\n       Results-oriented jurisprudence is never justified because \n     it is not our job to try to produce particular results. We \n     are not policy makers and we shouldn't be implementing any \n     sort of policy agenda or policy preferences that we have.\n\n  As Chief Justice Roberts said when he was testifying before the \nJudiciary Committee: Judges are umpires. They are not the rule-makers. \nThe people are the rulemakers, through their representatives, in their \nlaws and in their Constitution.\n  In another statement Judge Alito said:\n\n       I don't think a judge should be keeping a scorecard about \n     how many times the judge votes for one category of litigant \n     versus another in particular types of cases. That would be \n     wrong. We are supposed to do justice on an individual basis \n     in the cases that come before us. But I think that if anybody \n     . . . looks at the cases that I have voted on in any of the \n     categories of cases that have been cited, they will see that \n     there are decisions on both sides.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       In every type of employment discrimination case, for \n     example, there are decisions on both sides.\n\n  Because of this respect for the rule of law, the individuals who know \nJudge Alito best--and that includes Republicans and Democrats, his \ncolleagues on the bar and on the bench--have overwhelmingly supported \nhis elevation to the Supreme Court. I think it is important, when you \nlook at nominees, to make certain they have support from people from \nall parts of the political spectrum and all parts of the \njurisprudential spectrum.\n\n  Let me quote a couple people.\n  Nora Demleitner is the vice dean for academic affairs and professor \nof law at Hofstra University School of Law. And to this point I have \nnot cited anybody from Missouri supporting Judge Alito, but I am going \nto vote for him anyway. She said:\n\n       Now, since the very early days of my clerkship, I must \n     admit that Judge Alito has really become my role model. I do \n     think he is one of the most brilliant legal minds of our \n     generation, or of his generation, and he is a man of great \n     decency, integrity and character. And I say all of this as \n     what I would consider to be a left-leaning Democrat; a woman, \n     obviously; a member of the ACLU; and an immigrant.\n\n  This is Dean Demleitner speaking.\n  In addition, Judge Aldisert, who has served with Judge Alito on the \nThird Circuit, had the following to say:\n\n       In May 1960, I campaigned with John F. Kennedy in the \n     critical Presidential primaries of West Virginia. The next \n     year, I ran for judge . . . and I was on the Democratic \n     ticket, and I served eight years as a State trial judge. As \n     the Chairman indicated, Senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania \n     was my chief sponsor when President Lyndon Johnson nominated \n     me to the Court of Appeals, and Senator Robert F. Kennedy \n     from New York was one of my key supporters. Now, why do I say \n     this? I make this as a point that political loyalties become \n     irrelevant when I became a judge. The same has been true in \n     the case of Judge Alito, who served honorably in two \n     Republican administrations before he was appointed to our \n     court. Judicial independence is simply incompatible with \n     political loyalties, and Judge Alito's judicial record on our \n     court bears witness to this fundamental truth.\n\n  I could go on with other quotes. I am not going to. I suppose \neverything really has been said about Judge Alito in the Senate, \nalthough not everybody said it, so the debate is going to go on for a \nwhile. But I do think the first and most basic right we all have as \npolitical actors--in the sense that every person who lives in this \ncountry shares in running the Government--the first and most basic \nright we have is the right to govern ourselves through the processes \nset up in our Constitution. It is not out of a desire to avoid \ndifficult decisions but out of a respect for that right that Judge \nAlito talked about the rule of law.\n  I want to say this. Whether your views about social policy are on the \nright side of the political spectrum or whether they are on the left \nside of the political spectrum, I believe we can all rest easily in \nleaving the development of our culture and our society to the wisdom \nand the decency of the American people. The center in this country\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\nhas held in the past, and it will hold in the future.\n  As President Franklin Roosevelt said: This Nation will endure as it \nhas endured, and not because of the courts, not because of the \nCongress, not because of the President but because of the people. They \nwill move us in an orderly and decent direction, as they have for 200 \nyears. We do not need to be governed by guardians or dictators, whether \nthey are in the form of judges or anybody else. That is what Judge \nAlito meant when he was talking about the rule of law.\n\n  I have said from the beginning of this debate--and I withheld my \ndecision about the judge until I had a chance to meet him and watch the \nhearings and get a feel for who he is--he deserved a fair and \nrespectful confirmation process, ending in a timely up-or-down vote on \nthe Senate floor. I hope he will receive that. I believe, if confirmed, \nhe will respect the Constitution, he will apply a consistent \njurisprudence, without imposing his personal views on the law. For that \nreason, I am pleased to vote to confirm Judge Alito. I am hopeful the \nfull Senate will give this highly qualified nominee a fair up-or-down \nvote and then send him to service on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back whatever remains of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJudge Samuel A. Alito to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. I am supporting Judge Alito's nomination because he is, No. 1, \nsuperbly qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, and, No. 2, and as \nimportant, he possesses the right view of the role of a judge, the \nright judicial philosophy, which I think is essential in terms of \ntaking a seat on that high Court.\n  The appointments clause, article II, section 2, clause 2, of the \nConstitution gives the President the plenary power to nominate certain \nhigh-level officials and, as important, bestows on the Senate a crucial \nrole, a crucial constitutional role, of advice and consent.\n  Like, I hope, every Member of this body, I take that constitutional \nduty of advice and consent very seriously. I owe it as high as any duty \nto the Louisiana people I represent. In line with that, I will neither \nprovide a rubberstamp of approval for all of President Bush's nominees \nnor will I automatically disapprove any Democratic President's nominees \nfor the Supreme Court or any other Federal court.\n  I think I have shown my seriousness of purpose in that regard in my \nshort time in the Senate. I have studied the qualifications and legal \nwritings of all nominees to see whether they possess a consistent and \nwell-grounded judicial philosophy and have the right credentials and \nqualifications.\n  I was very upfront about being mindful of that responsibility when \nHarriet Miers was nominated. I looked very carefully at her \nqualifications and her judicial philosophy and, quite frankly, I \nexpressed some real reservations about that.\n  That is why, after Judge Alito was nominated, I focused on those \nqualifications and that judicial philosophy just as hard. I met him \npersonally. I watched his confirmation hearings. I read his record. \nThat is the process I used to reach this conclusion, that, No. 1, he is \neminently qualified in terms of credentials and background, and, No. 2, \nhe has the right judicial philosophy, the right view of the role of a \njudge in our society.\n  Let's talk, first, about those basic legal qualifications. Again, \nJudge Alito is superbly qualified. His academic achievements and his \ndistinguished career make that clear.\n  He has a bachelor's degree from Princeton University and a J.D. from \nYale Law School. After graduating from law school, Judge Alito began \nhis career in public service as a clerk for Judge Leonard Garth on the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals and is now a colleague of his on that \ncourt. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney, Assistant to the U.S. \nSolicitor General, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and U.S. attorney \nfor the District of New Jersey. He has argued specifically before the \nU.S. Supreme Court 12 cases, at least two dozen court of appeals cases; \ndirect, relevant and impressive experience in terms of that sort of \nhigh-level litigation.\n  In 1990, President George H.W. Bush nominated Judge Alito for the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals, and he was confirmed by unanimous \nconsent in this body because of his strong credentials and clear and \noverwhelming qualifications. Of course, today those qualifications are \neven greater because he has served as a judge on that circuit court for \nthe past 15 years.\n  After being nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, the ABA rated Judge \nAlito as ``well qualified.'' That is the highest rating possible. \nEveryone recognizes the ABA is not some conservative political group by \nany stretch of the imagination. If its membership has a slant, it is \nprobably to the left. That is the gold standard, that rating of \njudicial qualifications and credentials. Again, Judge Alito received \nthe highest rating.\n  Then he had his confirmation hearings. Despite some ugly questioning, \nfrankly, and some smear tactics, in my opinion, he had an impressive \nperformance. He demonstrated clear humility and indepth understanding \nof legal matters. And perhaps most impressive in terms of what he faced \nfrom the minority side, he maintained his composure in an unfortunately \npartisan atmosphere.\n  As I said at the beginning, those credentials and qualifications, \nthat legal background is the first important matter I look to. But it \nis not the only matter. The second equally important matter I look to \nis a person's judicial philosophy. Do they understand the correct role \nof a judge in society? I have thought a lot about that regarding all \nnominees who have come before this body. I thought Judge Roberts \nexpressed that role precisely right when he talked about being an \numpire and not a pitcher or a batter. Judge Alito has that same view of \nthe appropriate role of a judge.\n  Throughout the debate over judicial nominees, this notion of whether \na nominee possesses the right judicial philosophy has been asked a lot. \nSome may ask what this term means and why it is important. Again, it is \nimportant because it goes to the heart of the role of a judge and how \nthis democracy works. I believe what it means is a commitment to the \nrule of law, a commitment to the Constitution as written, and a \ncommitment not to let one's personal political views or personal \npolitical leanings or prejudices enter into any of those important \ndecisions on the Court. It requires a judge to be openminded, to \nanalyze the law carefully, to analyze the facts of each case based on \nthe Constitution and the law. It requires a judge not to do what can be \ntempting--intoxicating in terms of the power a judge can hold--not to \nmake new law based on personal opinion, not to play legislator but to \nfollow the law as enacted by the Congress or the State legislature.\n  Judge Alito has demonstrated that right judicial philosophy. He has \ndemonstrated his unwillingness to change the law to fit his personal \nbeliefs. He stated clearly:\n\n       There is nothing that is more important for our Republic \n     than the rule of law. No person in this country, no matter \n     how high or powerful, is above the law, and no person in this \n     country is beneath the law.\n\n  What is vital and embedded in the concept of the rule of law is the \napplication of the law as written, not judges becoming kings or \nlegislators and imposing their views and legislating from the bench. I \nbelieve this is the second and crucial matter we must look to in the \nconfirmation of judges, particularly those who would be Justices of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I have great confidence in Judge Alito's correct \nunderstanding of the role of a judge.\n  It has troubled me that throughout this confirmation process, some of \nmy colleagues and many outside interest groups, many members of the \npress, have demonstrated a different view of the role of a judge. One \nway they have demonstrated that is by treating Judge Alito more akin to \na candidate for political office than a nominee for the highest Court. \nThey have talked about judges taking sides, being on this side\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\nversus that side, taking the side of labor versus management, taking \nthe side of environmentalists versus business groups, taking the side \nof the little guy versus the big guy. In talking in those terms, many \nMembers of this body and many liberal interest groups and many members \nof the press have demonstrated a completely different view of the role \nof a judge which is inappropriate. Other than the fact that many of \ntheir characterizations of Judge Alito in these terms are false-- for \ninstance, he has decided in favor of employment discrimination \nplaintiffs in 22 percent of the cases, whereas the national average is \n13 percent--it troubles me that the public is being led to believe that \nwe should think of judges as legislators, that it should be a results-\noriented discussion.\n\n  This goes to the heart of the confirmation process. The role of the \njudiciary is to interpret the law and to apply it to the facts of each \ncase. It is not to elect legislators, politicians to go on the bench \nand vote certain interests or certain political philosophies.\n  I believe Judge Alito has the correct view, the opposite view, quite \nfrankly, as has been demonstrated by some Members of this body and \ncertainly by the liberal press and liberal interest groups. In his \nconfirmation hearing, the judge made this clear. He described his \ndisagreement with keeping a scorecard of how many times a judge rules \nfor or against a particular party. He stated:\n\n       I don't think a judge should be keeping a scorecard about \n     how many times that judge votes for one category of litigant \n     versus another in particular types of cases. That would be \n     wrong. We are supposed to do justice on an individual basis \n     in the cases that come before us.\n\n  I wish to touch on one other specific type of case because I believe \nJudge Alito has been smeared in this category, and that is with regard \nto his strong record and experience in the area of civil rights. I have \nbeen disappointed that some of my Democratic colleagues have chosen to \npaint Judge Alito as having anything less than the stellar record on \ncivil rights that he has. In doing so, they don't really cite any \nevidence for this accusation. They think if they just keep repeating \nthis smear, one dreamt up by far-left groups such as Ralph Neas' People \nfor the American Way and the Alliance for Justice, if they keep \nrepeating the lie over and over, the American people will fall for it. \nThe American people are smarter than that. The American people are \nlistening to some distinguished people, including distinguished African \nAmericans, with whom Judge Alito has served.\n  To cite a couple of examples, the late Judge Leon Higginbotham, the \nfirst African American to serve on the Federal District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania and whom the L.A. Times called ``a \nlegendary liberal and scholar of U.S. racial history,'' had said of \nJudge Alito:\n\n       Sam Alito is my favorite judge to sit with on this court. \n     He is a wonderful judge and a terrific human being. Sam Alito \n     is my kind of conservative. He is intellectually honest. He \n     doesn't have an agenda. He is not an ideologue.\n\n  Former Third Circuit Judge Timothy K. Lewis, an African American, \ntestified in support of Judge Alito. He joked that it was no \ncoincidence he was sitting on ``the far left'' of the panel. He said:\n\n       I was then--as I am now--a committed and active Democrat. I \n     learned in my year with Judge Alito that his approach to \n     judging is not about personal ideology or ambition. He is not \n     result oriented. He is an honest conservative judge who \n     believes in judicial restraint and judicial deference.\n\n  And Judge Lewis emphasized:\n\n       If I sensed that Sam Alito during the time that I served \n     with him or since then was hostile to civil rights as a \n     justice of the United States Supreme Court, I absolutely \n     would not be here today.\n\n  I hope the smear tactics will end, particularly on an issue as \nimportant and sensitive as civil rights. I am confident the American \npeople are hearing from those sound voices, including African-American \nvoices, who have served directly with Judge Alito, many of them are \npolitically liberal. Many of them are Democrats who say Judge Alito is \nfair. He is impartial. He is not results oriented.\n  That returns me to the central factor I have focused on in this \nprocess: Does Judge Alito have the right view of the role of a judge? \nDoes he have the right judicial philosophy? Is he committed to the \nConstitution as written, to the rule of law as it is written not by him \nbut by legislatures and the Congress? Is he committed to that and is he \ncommitted to not legislating from the bench? I believe his record and \ntestimony and all of the evidence supports a firm conclusion that he is \ncommitted to that proper role of a judge. For that reason, I am proud \nto be supporting the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito. I am confident \nhe will serve as a very distinguished member of the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at this moment in our history, our country \nfaces a spectrum of challenges broader than any we have ever faced \nbefore, both at home and abroad. However great the storm we face today, \nI am confident that our Nation, founded on the architecture of our \nConstitution, will prevail. The checks and balances established among \nthe Congress, the President, and the courts are the true arsenal of \nfreedom. In the end, these checks and balances in the hands of the \nAmerican people will prove greater than any assault on the precious \nfreedoms and liberties our forefathers fought to establish.\n  For the officials of our Federal Government, the protection of the \ninstitutions of our American democracy is a duty that both transcends \nand supersedes all others, especially for members of the Supreme Court \nwho must interpret the Constitution of our Nation as a living \nfoundation for the freedom and liberty of our people.\n  From confiding the power of the Federal Government in three co-equal \nbut separate branches of government, to guaranteeing the civil \nliberties that bless our Nation, the Constitution enshrines principles \nthat are as relevant today as they were when it was first penned \ncenturies ago.\n  These cherished principles are the backbone of our Nation, and they \ncomprise the final yardstick for taking the mettle of any man or woman \nwho would aspire to our Nation's highest Court. I have studied the full \nrecord of President Bush's nominee, Samuel A. Alito, Jr., and carefully \nmeasured it against the sworn duties of the Supreme Court. Regretfully, \nI conclude that Judge Alito falls short.\n  From his writings on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to his public \nspeeches, I discern a man who would fundamentally rewrite the \ninterpretation of our Constitution and leave in doubt the legacy of \nfreedom it was meant to preserve.\n  For many, this will mean his record on civil rights, reproductive \nchoice, or the death penalty. Let there be no mistake, I share these \nconcerns, and I have spent my life fighting for these rights.\n  For me, however, the greatest area of doubt lies in Judge Alito's \nconsistent preference for expanding the power of the President by \nrelaxing the checks and balances the Constitution places on the \nexecutive branch of Government.\n  In 1989 and 2000, Judge Alito gave speeches to the Federalist Society \nin which he embraced an obscure legal doctrine called the ``unitary \nexecutive theory.'' This so-called ``unitary executive theory'' places \nthe President almost above the law.\n  Under this theory, independent counsel appointed to investigate \nPresidential misdeeds would be unconstitutional. Similarly, the theory \nholds that enforcement agencies independent of the President, such as \nthe Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications \nCommission, and the National Labor Relations Board, would also be \nunconstitutional because they are not under the President's control.\n  The theory also justifies a President who would overstep Acts of \nCongress and the Constitution when acting as Commander in Chief.\n  How Judge Alito might actually apply this ``unitary executive \ntheory'' on the Supreme Court is, of course, an open question.\n  Separated by a span of 11 years, however, his own speeches in 1989 \nand 2000\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\nsuggest that Judge Alito's views on the powers of the President are \nlong-held and strong.\n  A memo he generated early in his career with the Reagan \nadministration amplifies this impression. In that memo, Judge Alito \nwrote on a President's authority to modify an act of Congress by making \na ``signing statement''--a written document issued by a President on \nsigning an act of Congress into law.\n  In the memo, Judge Alito wrote, that ``the President's understanding \nof the bill should be just as important as that of Congress.'' This \nstatement suggests that Judge Alito believes the President has a role \nin the legislative process not contemplated under the Constitution's \nexclusive grant of legislative power to the Congress.\n  Judge Alito's writings and speeches show how he personally believes \nthat the Congress should have less power to check and balance the \nPresident.\n  His judicial opinions, issued in his official capacity as a judge on \nthe Third Circuit, demonstrate a parallel conviction that the Congress \nshould have less authority in general.\n  In United States v. Rybar, Judge Alito wrote a minority opinion \nasserting that the Congress had no authority to pass laws to regulate \nmachine guns. The majority opinion criticized Judge Alito's narrow and \nrestrictive view of Congressional authority.\n  In Chittister v. Department of Community and Economic Development, \nJudge Alito ruled that the Congress had no authority to allow State \nemployees to sue for damages under the Family Medical Leave Act. Judge \nAlito's restrictive view on Congress's authority was later invalidated \nby the Supreme Court when it considered the same issue in a later case.\n  Our Supreme Court shoulders the solemn task of discovering how the \nConstitution applies to the unique problems of the day. Through dialog, \nstudy, and diligent inquiry, the Justices bring to bear the collected \nexperiences of the Nation, and forge justice from the Constitution by \ntempering its words with human compassion, wisdom, and integrity.\n  Judge Alito's record suggests that he holds his personal beliefs on \nexpanding the President's power so strongly that they might come before \nthe call of justice. Accordingly, I have concluded that I must oppose \nhis nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Asian American Justice Center, dated January 10, \n2006, and a letter from the Japanese American Citizens League, dated \nJanuary 8, 2006. Both letters refer to the nomination of Judge Alito.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Asian American Justice Center,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf \n     of the Asian American Justice Center (formerly National Asian \n     Pacific American Legal Consortium), a national civil rights \n     organization dedicated to advancing and defending the civil \n     rights of Asian Americans, we are writing to express our \n     concern opposition to the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to \n     be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States. Judge Alito's record demonstrates hostility and poses \n     grave risks to constitutional and legal rights and \n     protections that are core to the advancement of the \n     communities we represent.\n       Supreme Court decisions continue to have an immense impact \n     on the lives of Asian Americans, ranging from Gong Lum v. \n     Rice (1927), an unsuccessful challenge to school segregation \n     that would later be overturned by Brown v. Board of Education \n     in 1954, to United States v. Korematsu (1944), where the \n     Court upheld the internment of Japanese Americans. Often, \n     cases where the rights and liberties of minorities are at \n     question are decided by a very narrow 5-4 margin. Based upon \n     materials produced by Judge Alito as well as his judicial \n     record, we believe that he would fail to demonstrate a clear \n     understanding of key issues important to the civil rights \n     communities.\n       In 1986 Alito wrote a letter in his capacity as Deputy \n     Assistant Attorney General to former FBI Director William \n     Webster in which he suggested that ``illegal, aliens have no \n     claim to nondiscrimination with respect to nonfundamental \n     rights,'' and that the Constitution ``grants only fundamental \n     rights to illegal aliens within the United States.'' Alito \n     makes no mention of Plyer v Doe in this letter, which ruled \n     that a state could not discriminate against undocumented \n     children in public education, even though education is not \n     considered a fundamental constitutional right. This raises \n     questions about whether he would adequately protect \n     undocumented immigrants from unconstitutional forms of \n     discrimination.\n       Judge Alito's opinions in cases involving racial \n     discrimination and voting rights lead us to believe that he \n     will fail to champion civil rights in a manner that would \n     ensure that all communities will be full participants in the \n     rights and liberties that our constitution promises. For \n     example, in Bray v. Marriot Hotels, a racial discrimination \n     case, the majority concluded that Alito's dissenting view \n     would protect employers from suit even where the employer's \n     belief that it had selected the best candidate ``was the \n     result of a conscious racial bias.'' As majority pointed out, \n     ``Title VII would be eviscerated if out analysis were to halt \n     where the dissent suggest.'' In his 1985 application to \n     the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, Judge \n     Alito raised opposition to the Supreme Court decisions \n     that first articulated the fundamental civil rights \n     principle of ``one person, one vote.'' Those decisions \n     later paved the way for major strides in the effort to \n     secure equal voting rights for all Americans and greater \n     representation of racial and ethnic minorities at all \n     levels of government.\n       Of great concern to us is Judge Alito's record on \n     immigration law. In asylum cases, it appears that Judge Alito \n     has a tendency to rule against individuals who are seeking \n     protection in the United States, even where evidence show \n     that they have been or would have been persecuted in their \n     own countries. In Chang v. INS, Judge Alito disagreed with \n     the court's decision to grant asylum despite the fact that \n     Chang had presented evidence that his wife and son already \n     faced persecution and he was threatened with prison if he \n     returned to China. In Dia v. Ashcroft, Judge Alto dissented \n     from a majority opinion granting asylum to an immigrant from \n     the Republic of Guinea whose house was burned down and wife \n     raped in retaliation for his opposition to the government.\n       For the above reasons, we must oppose his confirmation as \n     Associate Justice.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Ranking Minority Member, Senate Judiciary \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Japanese American Citizens League \n     (JACL), the nation's oldest and largest Asian American civil \n     rights organization, wishes to express our strong opposition \n     to the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       Judge Alito's legal opinions and writings over the past \n     several years have left a clear record of an individual whose \n     legal views could have serious negative impact on the \n     nation's Asian American communities. As a civil rights \n     organization, we are not only troubled by Judge Alito's \n     ideological brand of conservatism, but also by his judicial \n     leanings that would make tenuous the constitutional \n     protections of American citizens.\n       The record shows that Judge Alito once stated proudly his \n     opposition to affirmative action; as a lawyer for the \n     government, he has argued that immigrants can be denied basic \n     protections and rights guaranteed by the Constitution; he has \n     shown little regard for individuals who have sought sanctuary \n     in the U.S. through the political asylum appeal process; he \n     has expressed a legal opinion that would support racial \n     discrimination in employment cases; he has written an opinion \n     that would have denied a gender discrimination case to be \n     heard by the court; he has raised serious concerns about the \n     ``one person one vote'' concept of democracy; he has shown a \n     proclivity to undermine due process and privacy protections.\n       The Supreme Court is in many instances the final arbiter in \n     protecting the rights of Americans and therefore should not \n     be a vehicle for those who would push for a political agenda, \n     be it from the left or the right of the political spectrum. \n     Given the early pronouncements in his career and his legal \n     opinions either as a government attorney or from the bench, \n     we are not convinced that Judge Alito can serve the interests \n     of the people as a member of the highest court of the land.\n       The Japanese American Citizens League urges you, as a \n     member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to vigorously \n     question Judge Alito on his past record and to carefully \n     examine his current legal positions. The JACL strongly \n     opposes Judge Alito's nomination and does not believe that \n     his confirmation as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court \n     serves the best interest of all the people of this great \n     nation.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                    John Tateishi,\n                                      National Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S165]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Samuel Alito to replace Justice O'Connor on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Of all of the issues we consider in the Senate, perhaps \nno issue raises such deep and fundamental questions as the nomination \nof a Supreme Court Justice.\n  The issues that come before the Supreme Court are not abstract legal \nconcepts; rather, they involve the very values that define who we are \nas a nation. They ask us to think about what kind of society we want to \nbe. I believe strongly that we want to be a society which strives for \njustice, protects the powerless, provides meaningful protections to \nworkers, and allows those who have suffered discrimination to seek \nrecourse and affirm their rights in Federal court.\n  I believe that a nominee to the Supreme Court needs more than just \nexcellent legal qualifications. He or she must possess a true passion \nfor justice, an understanding that the law cannot be viewed with cool, \nanalytical dispassion, but with the acknowledgement of its role in \nmolding a fairer and more just society. He or she must understand and \nbelieve in the critical role the Federal courts play in protecting the \ncivil rights of all Americans, including the 54 million Americans who \nlive every day with a disability. A thorough review of Judge Alito's \nrecord and of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing has convinced me \nthat he falls far short of that measure and, as a result, I oppose his \nnomination.\n  One of the things I found most troubling about Judge Alito was his \nstatement that one of the factors that motivated him to study \nconstitutional law was his disagreements with the Warren Court \ndecisions in the areas of criminal procedures and voting rights. \nFrankly, I find this to be a stunning admission. I know there are many \nwho often decry the decisions of the Warren Court as inappropriate \nliberal judicial activism.\n  I strongly disagree with that characterization. So many of the \ndecisions of the Warren Court, beginning with the 1954 unanimous \ndecision in Brown v. Board of Education--that decision that separate is \nnot equal--are not just liberal values, they are American values--\nAmerican values that each person's vote should have the same weight; \nthat legislative districts should contain equal population; that the \nfreedom to marry a person of another race is a fundamental civil right; \nthe decision that broadcasters are required to provide programming that \nserves the public interest and to provide for a diversity of \nviewpoints; the decision that illegally seized evidence cannot be used \nin a trial; the decision that poor people are entitled to have lawyers \nin criminal cases; the decision that the wearing of symbols of protest \nis protected speech; the decision that suspects have the right to \nremain silent; the decision that you have a right to an attorney; the \ndecision that you have the right to be informed of these protections \nand the charges against you.\n  These were all Warren Court decisions, and these decisions, far from \nevidencing an extreme view of the Constitution, are decisions that the \nvast majority in this country believe are fair and correct and give \nmeaning to our Constitution's promise of individual liberty and \ndignity.\n  Yet Judge Alito chose to cite his disagreement with these very \ndecisions as his motivation for studying law. He chose to cite his \ndisagreements with these decisions as his reason for working to narrow \nor overturn the rulings in the Reagan Justice Department.\n  I find this very troubling. I cannot help but wonder what other laws \nJustice Alito might seek to narrow if he is granted lifetime tenure on \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Another law that gives meaning to our Constitution's promise of \nliberty and dignity is the Americans with Disabilities Act. Fifteen \nyears ago--now approaching 16--I championed the ADA, as it is now \nknown, because I had seen discrimination against the disabled \nfirsthand, growing up with my brother Frank who was deaf. Throughout \nhis life, Frank experienced active discrimination at the hands of both \nprivate individuals and the government, and this served to limit the \nchoices before him.\n  Frank's experience was by no means unusual, as Congress documented \nextensively prior to enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act. As \npart of the writing of that bill, we gathered a massive record of \nblatant discrimination against those with disabilities.\n  We had 25 years of testimony and reports on disability \ndiscrimination. Fourteen congressional hearings and 63 field hearings \nby a special congressional task force were held in the 3 years prior to \nthe passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We received boxes \nloaded with thousands of letters and pieces of testimony gathered in \nhearings and townhall meetings across the country from people whose \nlives had been damaged or destroyed by discrimination against people \nwith disabilities. We had markups in five different committees. We had \nover 300 examples of discrimination by States--by States--against \npeople with disabilities.\n  I know this. I was there. I was the chairman of the Disability Policy \nSubcommittee and the lead sponsor of the bill.\n  Yet since enactment of the ADA, the Court has repeatedly questioned--\nor I should say a minority of the Court has repeatedly questioned--\nwhether Congress had the authority to require States to comply with the \nADA and, amazingly, whether Congress adequately documented \ndiscrimination. For example, in 2001, the Court narrowly held that an \nexperienced nurse at a university hospital, who was demoted after being \ndiagnosed with breast cancer because her supervisor did not like being \naround sick people, was not covered by the ADA because she had the \nmisfortune to work for a State hospital. If she had worked for a \nprivate hospital, she would have been covered, according to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  In contrast, in 2004, again by a narrow margin, 5 to 4, with Justice \nO'Connor in the majority, the Court held that Congress did have the \nauthority to require States to make courthouses accessible.\n  Over the next few years, the Court will likely look at whether other \nState and locally owned facilities are required to be accessible. And \nin case anyone doubts that accessibility is still a day-to-day issue \nfor the disabled in this country, I want to point out two stories \nrecently in the Des Moines Register in the last week.\n  First, the fire alarm went off in the State capitol, and there was no \nway for people in wheelchairs, including a State legislator who was \nrecently injured in a farming accident, to exit the building.\n  Another example is before that, a woman in a wheelchair had no way to \nget onto the stage to speak at a Martin Luther King, Jr., Day tribute.\n  But there is no guarantee that the Court will continue to require \nthat facilities be made accessible. Instead, we could end up with a \ncrazy patchwork where courthouses are accessible but maybe libraries \nare not; prisons are accessible but maybe employment offices are not.\n\n  When we passed the ADA, we in Congress did not forbid employment \ndiscrimination against the disabled unless they work for the State. We \ndidn't say some services must be accessible. But that is what the Court \nhas been saying. Talk about judicial activism.\n  To put a fine point on it, the ADA is at the mercy of the Supreme \nCourt and of the nominee who assumes this seat. Based on his record, I \nam gravely concerned that Judge Alito does not believe that Congress \nhas the authority to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans. \nInstead, his record is one that values the rights of the State over the \nrights of people.\n  In the two instances where Judge Alito has been required to interpret \nrecent Supreme Court cases limiting the power of Congress to pass \nnational legislation under the 14th amendment or under the commerce \nclause, he has gone further than the Court itself.\n  First, consider a case involving the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nthe law that allows Americans to take unpaid leave from work to care \nfor a newborn child, a sick child, or an ailing parent.\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\nOver 50 million Americans have taken unpaid family and medical leave \nsince its passage, including 5 million State workers. Yet confronted \nwith a case challenging whether State and local employers were required \nto grant unpaid family and medical leave, Judge Alito held in \nChittister v. Department of Community and Economic Development that \nCongress lacked the authority to order State and local employers to \nabide by the law.\n  Imagine that, Judge Alito on the Third Circuit said that we didn't \nhave the authority to pass the family and medical leave bill. He was \nopposed to it.\n  Fortunately, that holding was affirmatively rejected by the Supreme \nCourt in 2004 when the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 in favor of the FMLA. \nChief Justice Rehnquist was the author of that opinion. He was joined \nby Justice O'Connor.\n  Think about this. Would that case have been decided the same way if \nChief Justice Roberts had been there in place of Chief Justice \nRehnquist? And if Justice Alito had been there instead of Justice \nO'Connor? I am afraid it would not.\n  Secondly, again in 2004, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision \nthat held similarly that Congress could order State courthouses to \nabide by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Justice O'Connor was in \nthe majority, a 5-to-4 decision, Lane v. Tennessee. This is where a \nperson with a disability had been cited for speeding and was given a \nticket. He used a wheelchair. He showed up at the courthouse, and guess \nwhat. The court was on the second floor. There was no elevator. So they \nsaid: OK, we will carry you up. The first time he appeared in court \nthey carried him up into the courtroom. Then the case was put over to \nanother day. The second time Lane showed up, they said: We will carry \nyou up again.\n  He said: I'm not going to be carried up. I have too much dignity for \nthat.\n  They said: OK, you are going to have to crawl. Get out of your \nwheelchair and crawl up the steps or, of course, the court will fine \nyou because you did not appear in the courtroom.\n  This is a real case. This really happened. It went to the Supreme \nCourt. A 5-to-4 decision held that courthouses must be accessible under \nthe ADA.\n  If Justice Alito had been there instead of Justice O'Connor, given \nhis limited view of congressional authority, it would be foolish to \nthink that we would have had the same outcome, and Mr. Lane would, \nindeed, have to crawl up the steps of the courthouse or be carried up.\n  I want to digress here a moment. There may be those who say maybe it \nwas an old courthouse and they couldn't put in an elevator. The ADA \ndoes not require that. It says that services must be accessible. The \njudge can hold court wherever he wants. The judge could have gotten out \nof that second floor room and gone down to a room on the first floor \nand held court there, and Mr. Lane could have wheeled his wheelchair \ninto that room.\n  Services must be accessible, and that is what we said in the ADA. But \nMr. Alito does not see it that way. His failure to recognize the role \nof the Federal courts in protecting victims of discrimination can be \nseen even more directly.\n  In 1995, the Third Circuit, on which Mr. Alito sat, ruled that people \nwith disabilities should be allowed to live in the community, not \nwarehoused in institutions, whenever it was possible. The Third \nCircuit's opinion was consistent with Justice Thurgood Marshall's \nopinion in the Cleburne case. Justice Marshall wrote that persons with \ndisabilities, and I quote Justice Thurgood Marshall:\n\n       . . . have been subject to a ``lengthy and tragic history'' \n     of segregation and discrimination that can only be called \n     grotesque. [In the early 20th Century] a regime of state-\n     mandated segregation and degradation emerged that in its \n     virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed paralleled, the \n     worst excesses of Jim Crow. . . .[L]engthy and continuing \n     isolation of the retarded has perpetuated the ignorance, \n     irrational fears, and stereotyping that long have plagued \n     them.\n\n  The Third Circuit agreed that people should not be warehoused. They \nshould be allowed to live in the community whenever possible. Yet after \nthree judges on the circuit court ruled that such institutionalization \nwas a form of discrimination under the ADA, Judge Alito argued that the \nThird Circuit should reconsider the opinion.\n  When asked about this issue at his Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge \nAlito suggested that his desire to rehear the case did not suggest he \nhad a disagreement with the outcome. Frankly, I find this response \ndifficult to believe. I think most lawyers would agree that judges do \nnot vote to rehear cases unless they disagree with the outcome or \nunless other factors, factors that were not present here, require such \na rehearing.\n\n  Fortunately, Judge Alito's desire to reconsider the Helen L. case was \ndenied. The Supreme Court shortly after that held, in the landmark \nOlmstead decision, that unnecessary institutionalization is, in fact, a \nform of discrimination. Once again, Justice O'Connor sided with the \nmajority in the Olmstead decision. Given Judge Alito's judicial record, \nwe can safely assume that he would have come down on the opposite side \nof this landmark ruling and might even have steered the Court in a \ndifferent direction, and years of progress toward equal rights for the \ndisabled might have been erased.\n  In case after case on the Third Circuit, Judge Alito seems to have \nbeen immune to the real-life struggles of the people in the cases \nbefore him. It is like: This is the legal theory. Don't bother me with \nthe facts. Don't bother me with what is actually happening. There is \nsome legal theory out there that I believe in, and somehow this legal \ntheory trumps, overcomes the real-life travails of ordinary people. As \nI said--immune to the real-life struggles. The fact that the police \nstrip-searched a 10-year-old girl, the fact that a mentally disabled \nworker was sexually assaulted, the fact that a farm family was \nthreatened at gunpoint by U.S. Marshals without any resistance during \nan eviction process--all of this failed to sway him that these ordinary \nAmericans even deserve to be able to present their cases against the \nGovernment. It failed to persuade the judge that they should even be \nallowed to present their cases against the Government. This is real \nlife, real people, and real situations. But, no, Judge Alito had some \nother philosophy, some other theory that overcame this.\n  In the past few days, I have heard a number of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle express alarm or dismay that so many Democratic \nSenators have expressed their opposition to this nominee. In light of \nthe record that I just outlined, I find it alarming that more Senators \non the Republican side have not expressed their opposition to this \nnominee. I thought it was my friends on the other side who so loudly \nproclaimed individual liberty, individual dignity of the person. Yet \nJudge Alito dismisses this under some rubric of a judicial philosophy \nor some theory that he has.\n  I must say, my alarm becomes more pronounced when I consider Judge \nAlito's record on Executive power. At a time when the President of the \nUnited States is illegally spying on American citizens, at a time when \nthe President believes that he can ignore the clear intent of \nCongress--including a vote of 90 Senators--and continue the use of \ntorture in the interrogation of criminal suspects, at a time when the \nPresident believes he can indefinitely detain American suspects without \ncharges and without access to a lawyer, it is more important than ever \nthat Justices on the Supreme Court recognize the need to protect and \npreserve the balance of power envisioned by our Founding Fathers.\n  Judge Alito is not that Justice. He is, instead, an adherent of a \nlegal theory that Presidential powers should be wholly unchecked. In \nfact, he is the author of the very strategy used by President Bush \nearlier this month when he essentially said to 90 Senators: I signed \nthe amendment that says no torture but I hereby declare that I can \nignore it if I feel like it.\n  After reviewing Judge Alito's record, it is not difficult to wonder, \nif Judge Alito had been on the Supreme Court during its consideration \nof Marbury v. Madison, would he have voted the other way? Would we have \nan imperial President today and not a Court that has the role as final \narbiter? That strikes at the very heart of our Democratic form of \ngovernment and our checks and balances.\n  But don't take my word for it. Consider the words of the Justice whom\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\nJudge Alito seeks to replace, Justice O'Connor, who wrote in the \nSupreme Court's recent decision in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that it is:\n\n        . . . clear that a state of war is not a blank check for \n     the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's \n     citizens.\n\n  I agree with Justice O'Connor. It is clear under the Constitution of \nthe United States that our President does not have unfettered powers. \nIt is clear that the Supreme Court has the authority, the duty to serve \nas a check on that power. And it is clear to me that Judge Alito is not \ncommitted to providing that check.\n  As recently as 2000, in a speech before the Federalist Society, Judge \nAlito said in his speech:\n\n        . . . the President has not just some executive powers, \n     but the executive power--the whole thing.\n\n  What does that mean?\n\n        . . . the President has not just some executive powers, \n     but the executive power--the whole thing.\n\n  What does Judge Alito mean by that? I find this to be a frightening \ntheory, in someone getting life tenure on the Supreme Court.\n  In closing, the new Supreme Court Justice will have a tremendous \nimpact on our society. The decisions before the Court will determine \nwhether we are true to our fundamental national values of fairness and \njustice and dignity for all. In Judge Alito, we have a nominee whose \nhistory, record, and testimony make clear that he holds an unduly \nrestrictive view of the power of Congress to enact laws to protect \nworkers, to protect public safety, to protect victims of \ndiscrimination, and that he holds a dangerous view of the Court's \nproper role in providing a necessary check on Executive powers. Indeed, \nif Judge Alito is confirmed, I fear that many of the core protections \nprovided to people with disabilities under the Americans With \nDisabilities Act and other laws simply disappear. For these reasons, I \nstrongly oppose his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to state my intention to \nvote against the nomination of Judge Alito to be the next Associate \nJustice of the Supreme Court. Let me start by saying I certainly do not \ndoubt Judge Alito's qualifications, his integrity, his temperament. He \nhas served on the Federal bench for over 15 years, and he has \ndemonstrated during that time that he is, indeed, a very capable \njurist. Nonetheless, after carefully looking at his judicial record and \nlistening to his answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is also \nclear to me that if confirmed, Judge Alito will move the Court in what \nI believe is the wrong direction for our country.\n  Judge Alito has been nominated to replace Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor. She is a moderate who has been a critical fifth vote in cases \nimpacting privacy rights, disability rights, civil rights, the \nenvironment, consumer protections, discrimination laws, access to the \ncourts and campaign finance reforms, among others. It has taken us \nyears to enact legislation aimed at protecting the rights of all \nAmericans in these areas I have mentioned. Other Justices on the Court, \nparticularly Justices Scalia and Thomas, have pressed to reverse many \nof the advances the Congress has made in these areas. They have pressed \nto limit congressional power under the commerce clause and the ability \nof Congress to enact Federal civil rights legislation. I fear that \nJudge Alito will join Justices Scalia and Thomas in this regard.\n  Justice O'Connor's vote has also been instrumental in ensuring that \nwe do not surrender our civil liberties in times of war. Justice \nO'Connor's statement in the Hamdi decision was just quoted by my \ncolleague from Iowa. It was a resounding reaffirmation that the \nPresident could not indefinitely detain a U.S. citizen without \nproviding adequate due process. The quote which was just made, and has \nbeen made by many of my colleagues, is that:\n\n       We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a \n     blank check for a President when it comes to the rights of \n     our Nation's citizens.\n\n  At a time when the President has asserted expansive powers with \nregard to imprisoning U.S. prisoners without charges, with regard to \nwiretapping without warrants, with regard to using interrogation \ntechniques that amount to torture, it is essential that we have \nJustices on the Supreme Court who are willing to provide a check on the \nauthority of the executive branch. Judge Alito's record indicates that \nhe may not be the right person to provide this important check.\n  For example, he stated his support in varying degrees for this so-\ncalled unitary executive theory. This relatively obscure legal theory \nhas very little support in the mainstream legal community, but it has \nprofound implications for our understanding of the Constitution.\n  Just recently, Congress passed a law reiterating the prohibition on \nthe use of torture. In signing the legislation, the President issued a \nstatement reserving the right to take whatever action he deems \nnecessary as Commander in Chief--in effect reserving the right to \nignore the very law which he was at that time signing. The President \ncited this unitary executive theory as the legal basis for his power to \ndisregard the plain text of the legislation.\n  We need to have a Supreme Court that is prepared to provide the \nnecessary checks and balances crucial to our democratic system of \ngovernment. I believe Justice O'Connor charted a moderate course in \nterms of the authority of Congress to enact legislation aimed at \nprotecting the welfare of Americans and with regard to upholding the \nrights of citizens vis-a-vis their own government, and I believe it is \nimportant to maintain that same course.\n  This is not to say that I have agreed with all of Justice O'Connor's \ndecisions. But her swing vote has helped to maintain a balance on the \nCourt that has kept many decisions within the mainstream, and I believe \nJudge Alito's confirmation will sway the existing balance on the Court \nin a manner that will jeopardize many of the protections afforded to \nthe American public, many of which have been the result of many years \nof struggle. For this reason, I am not able to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to state my opposition to \nthe nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court.\n\n  After thoroughly reviewing Judge Alito's record during his time on \nthe Federal bench, I am left with grave and serious concerns about his \nviews on the power and scope of executive branch authority, the lack of \ndiscrimination against parents in the workplace, his general \ndisposition toward cases involving civil rights, and his views on the \nscope of voter rights.\n  Because of these concerns, I cannot in good conscience support his \nnomination to the Supreme Court to replace Sandra Day O'Connor, the \nhighest Court in the land with tremendous ability to exercise judgment \nover the people of this Nation.\n  Over the course of Judge Samuel Alito's career and his tenure on the \nFederal bench, he has compiled a troubling record of personal \nstatements and court decisions that signal his willingness to defer \nauthority to the executive branch when questions of presidential powers \nare deliberated before the Supreme Court.\n  I strongly believe that our Constitution calls for an independent and \nco-equal judicial branch that provides a check on the government's \npower to encroach upon our individual rights of Americans.\n  At a time when many Arkansans have expressed concerns over the \nPresident's legal authority to eavesdrop on Americans without court \nsupervision and detain U.S. citizens without judicial review or due \nprocess, I cannot support a Supreme Court nominee who has repeatedly \nfailed to uphold reasonable limits of presidential authority at the \nexpense of constitutional liberties.\n  This issue is especially significant because Judge Alito would \nreplace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who recently ruled in a 2004 case \non executive authority that ``a state of war is not a blank check for \nthe President when it comes to the rights of the nation's citizens.''\n\n[[Page S168]]\n\n  While the legislative and executive branches of government are, by \ntheir very nature, political, we demand our judicial branch be above \nthat.\n  When one party controls both of the political branches, the \nindependence of the judiciary is especially important.\n  It is not just important to keep in check but also to maintain the \nconfidence of the American people that their government is balanced and \nthat it is there to serve them and not the politicians.\n  Our Founders created our country and its government with the memories \nof tyranny still fresh in their minds.\n  The judicial branch was given exceptional authority for the specific \nreason that it provides a critical check on the two political branches \nof our government.\n  This is not to say that the judicial branch is charged with \ncorrecting the perceived wrongs of the party in power. It is simply \ncharged with upholding the Constitution and the rights guaranteed to \ncitizens under it. Upholding this requirement is the most important \nduty the court is given.\n  If a potential nominee to the Supreme Court cannot or will not uphold \neither part of this solemn duty, his or her appointment will serve to \nundermine the fundamental system of checks and balances on which our \ngovernment depends.\n  Of equal concern is Judge Alito's record on the issue of \ndiscrimination in the workplace.\n  In Chittister v. Department of Community and Economic Development, \nJudge Alito's statement that the Family Medical Leave Act was a \n``disproportionate solution'' to the problem of workplace \ndiscrimination is deeply troubling.\n  In an opinion rejecting the position of Judge Alito, Chief Justice \nRehnquist explicitly noted that common workplace practices had been \ndiscriminatory toward both men and women by reinforcing the role of \nwomen as the sole domestic caregiver.\n  I fear that Judge Alito' s inability to recognize this type of \ndiscrimination threatens dire consequences for rights hard won by women \nover the last few decades.\n  The majority of our Nation's families depend on income from both \nparents just to get by. The future and strength of our Nation depends \non the strength of the fabric that our families are made of.\n  I cannot in good conscience vote to allow any of the gains that have \nallowed women to become an integral part of our Nation's workforce \nwhile remaining exceptional mothers to their children to be rolled \nback.\n  As his record points out, Judge Alito has consistently set an \nunfairly high burden of proof in discrimination cases leading him to \nrule consistently against Americans who are merely attempting to assert \ntheir basic constitutional rights.\n  Judge Alito's philosophy of deferring to the government and those in \npositions of authority threatens to undermine many of the laws \nestablished by Congress to ensure that discrimination does not prevent \nanyone from realizing his or her full potential--not just as an \nAmerican, but as a human being.\n  Also of concern are Judge Alito's comments on voter rights. He has \nstated his interest in constitutional law was motivated largely by his \ndisagreements with the Supreme Court reapportionment decision that \nestablished the principle of ``one person, one vote.''\n  This landmark case became a cornerstone of our democracy by ensuring \nthat everyone's vote would be weighted equally, regardless of an \nindividual's economic background, their address, or the color of their \nskin.\n  If an individual is prevented from seeking a fair remedy at the \nballot box by denial of his basic right to vote, the only avenue he has \nleft is our judicial system.\n  Judge Alito's skepticism of established principles of voter rights \ncoupled with his skepticism of claims relating to discrimination is a \ndangerous combination that threatens to exclude many Americans from \nfull and equal participation in their government and society.\n  I remind my colleagues that the strength of our Nation comes from the \ninput of the diversity of individuals who make up this great land. We \ncannot diminish that.\n  Equal access to the ballot box is a right guaranteed to every \nAmerican that is the very foundation of democracy.\n  These rights came after much work and incredible sacrifice and to me \nthey are too important to put at risk.\n  As I stated during the debate on Chief Justice Robert's nomination, \nconsidering a Supreme Court nomination is one of the most important \nduties we are called upon as Senators to fulfill.\n  I did not come to my decision on Judge Alito' s nomination lightly.\n  Ultimately, I supported the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts \nbecause I sincerely believed he cared more about the rule of law and \nour Nation's judicial system than he did about ideology or politica1 \nparties.\n  I sincerely regret I cannot draw the same conclusion about Judge \nAlito.\n  For me, this nomination is not about a single issue or controversy. \nIt is much more important than that.\n  This nomination is about the rights and freedoms we cherish as \nAmericans.\n  It is about the future course of our Nation and the impact the \ndecisions of the Supreme court will have on the citizens of this great \nland.\n  I feel government has a commitment to those amongst us who face \nincredible challenges to ensure that the values we all hold dear as \nAmericans apply equally to them.\n  I have real doubts about Judge Alito's views on the role of \ngovernment in protecting those rights. I respect the opinions of my \nconstituents and colleagues on both sides of this issue. But in the \nend, after great prayer and research--and certainly after listening to \nall the principles I learned growing up as a farmer's daughter in east \nArkansas in the rural part of this Nation--I made the decision that I \nbelieve is in the best interests of my State and of my country.\n  I appreciate the time attention of my colleagues. I yield the floor. \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do I have 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may use as much of the next hour \nas he pleases.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I support the nomination of Samuel Alito. President \nBush has made a very excellent choice in picking Alito. He has the \nintellect, judicial temperament, and integrity to be an excellent \nJustice.\n  He seems to have a very clear understanding of the proper role of the \njudiciary in our government. That came out very clearly in the \nhearings.\n  He commands the respect of his colleagues on the Third Circuit, as \ntheir testimony before our committee demonstrated.\n  He also has the respect of the lawyers who practice before him and \nthe employees who have worked with him. That was demonstrated in \ntestimony before our committee as well.\n  But we can't always accurately predict how an individual ultimately \nwill make decisions once he or she gets on the bench. But we do have a \nconstitutional process in place, and we have to use our judgment within \nthat process and trust the confirmation process.\n  I would say the 225-year history of our country succeeding as it has \nis an affirmation that the process has worked well.\n  We have confirmed many outstanding individuals to the Supreme Court, \nand the process has worked well thus far and will continue to work well \nwith Judge Alito.\n  Judge Alito was very impressive in the hearings. He did an excellent \njob under a great deal of fire. He was thorough, he was candid, and he \nwas forthright with all 18 of us on the committee, and demonstrated a \ndeep understanding of the law and a deep understanding of the law and \nour Constitution.\n  Contrary to the claims of some of my colleagues from whom we have \nbeen hearing this morning and yesterday, Judge Alito's testimony was \nvery substantive, and he was responsive.\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\n  Let me quantify that. Judge Alito answered more than 650 questions \nduring nearly 18 hours of testimony. Compared to the performances of \nJustice Ginsburg who answered 307 questions at her hearing, and Justice \nBreyer, who answered 291 questions, one can hardly swallow what we hear \non the other side--that Judge Alito was not forthcoming with the \nCommittee.\n  I easily conclude, as I think the public concludes, that he has been \none of the most forthcoming nominees to come before the Judiciary \ncommittee.\n  The Constitution provides the President with the power to nominate \nSupreme Court Justices. And it provides the Senate with advise and \nconsent duties, presumably ending up in an up-or-down vote.\n  In Federalist No. 66, Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n       It will be the office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part of the \n     Senate. They may defeat one choice of the executive, and \n     oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice he may have \n     made.\n\n  That is Alexander Hamilton commenting on the role of the President \nand the Senate in the judicial confirmation process. I have been on the \nJudiciary Committee for more than 25 years. I take this constitutional \nresponsibility very seriously. Our work in committee allows us to \nevaluate whether a nominee has the requisite judicial temperament, \nintellect, and integrity. We also evaluate throughout that process \nwhether the nominee understands the proper role of a Justice in our \ndemocratic system of government; mainly, but not limited to, respect \nfor the rule of law and respect for the Constitution, all over any \npersonal agenda the nominee might have. A Justice, to do justice, \ncannot have a personal agenda.\n  Specifically, a Supreme Court nominee should clearly understand that \nthe role of a judge under the Constitution is a limited role, to say \nwhat the law is, rather than make the law.\n  I quote Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper No. 78:\n\n       The courts must declare the sense of the law, and if they \n     should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the \n     consequences would equally be the substitution of their \n     pleasure to that of the legislative body.\n\n  In fact, most Americans want judges who will confine their job to \ninterpreting the law and the Constitution, rather than making policy \nand societal choices from the bench. But what we have seen lately is a \ntrend where the courts have expanded the role of the judiciary far \nbeyond what was originally intended in the Constitution and by the \nFramers. The courts have taken on a role that is much more akin to what \nwe do in Congress, the legislative branch, making law, which is to make \npolicy choices and to craft laws based on those choices.\n  As a consequence of this power grab by the courts, the judicial \nconfirmation process also, unfortunately, has become extremely \npoliticized. That is because when judges improperly assume the role of \ndeciding essentially political questions rather than legal questions, \nthe judicial confirmation process also devolves into one focused less \non whether a nominee can impartially and appropriately implement the \nlaw. Instead, the process devolves into one focused on whether a \nnominee will implement a desired political outcome from the bench, \nregardless of what the law says, regardless of what the Constitution \nrequires.\n  But Judge Alito understands the proper role of a judge. Judge Alito \nunderstands the judicial branch plays a limited role in our system of \ngovernment--but not surprisingly so because that is what the \nConstitution intended. Judge Alito testified:\n\n       The judiciary has to protect rights, and it should be \n     vigorous in doing that, and it should be vigorous in \n     enforcing the law and interpreting the law . . . in \n     accordance with what it really means and enforcing the laws \n     even if that's unpopular.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       But although the judiciary has a very important role to \n     play, it is a limited role. . . . It should always be asking \n     itself whether it is straying over the bounds, where it is \n     invading the authority of the legislature, for example, and \n     whether it is making policy judgments rather than \n     interpreting the law. And that has to be a constant process \n     of re-examination on the part of the judges.\n\n  Judge Alito's record is clear that he will not make law, but rather \nhe will strictly interpret the law we write. His record is clear that \nhe will do his very best to remain faithful to the actual meaning of \nthe Constitution, rather than mold it into what he would like that \nConstitution to say.\n  Judge Alito said, along that line:\n\n       Judges do not have the authority to change the \n     Constitution. The whole theory of judicial review we have, I \n     think, is contrary to that notion. The Constitution is an \n     enduring document and the Constitution does not change. It \n     does contain some important general principles that have to \n     be applied to new factual situations that come up. But in \n     doing that, the judiciary has to be very careful not to \n     inject its own views into the matter. It has to apply the \n     principles that are in the Constitution to the situations \n     that come before the judiciary.\n\n  Judge Alito possesses a knowledge of and respect for the Constitution \nthat is necessary for all Supreme Court Justices. Judge Alito, in his \ntestimony, demonstrates an understanding of the proper role of a \nJustice. He understands and respects the separate functions of the \njudicial branch as opposed to the functions of the legislative branch \nand the executive branch, the political branches of government.\n  Judge Alito explained that a judge's role is not one of an advocate. \nHe testified:\n\n       The role of a practicing attorney is to achieve a desired \n     result for the client in a particular case at hand, but a \n     judge cannot think that way. A judge can't have any agenda. A \n     judge can't have any preferred outcome in a particular case. \n     And a judge certainly does not have a client. The judge's \n     only obligation, and it's a solemn obligation, is to the rule \n     of law, and what that means is that in every single case, the \n     judge has to do what the law requires.\n\n  For all of his opponents, when we hear things such as that and they \nfit in with what the Constitution's writers intended for the judiciary \nto do, how can we find fault with Judge Alito's approach? Why would we \nfear him at all?\n  Judge Alito also believes in justice for all, as afforded by the laws \nand the Constitution of our great nation. He told the 18 members of the \nJudiciary Commitee:\n\n       No person in this country, no matter how high or powerful, \n     is above the law, and no person in this country is beneath \n     the law.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Our Constitution applies in times of peace and in times of \n     war, and it protects the rights of Americans under all \n     circumstances.\n\n  Another very important position Judge Alito takes:\n\n       Results-oriented jurisprudence is never justified because \n     it is not our job to try to produce particular results. We \n     are not policy makers and we shouldn't be implementing any \n     sort of policy agenda or policy preference that we have.\n\n  Contrary to the claims of his opponents, Judge Alito understands the \nJudiciary has an important role in our system of checks and balances. \nHe understands the importance of the independence of the judicial \nbranch. Judge Alito will not shirk from that responsibility and he will \nsee that the Judiciary is an effective check on abuses of power, both \nby the executive and the legislative branches of government. In fact, \nas Judge Aldisert, who served with Judge Alito on the Third Circuit \ntestified:\n\n       Judicial independence is simply incompatible with political \n     loyalties, and Judge Alito's judicial record on our court \n     bears witness to this fundamental truth.\n\n  Let me quote former Judge Gibbons, who also served with Judge Alito \nand who now is litigating with the Bush administration over the \ntreatment of detainees held at Guantanamo. He believes Judge Alito will \nnot shy away from checking Government abuses. He does not believe Judge \nAlito will rubberstamp any administration's policies if they run \ncounter to the law and the Constitution. And he certainly did not have \nany concern about Judge Alito's judicial independence.\n  Judge Gibbons testified:\n\n       It seems not unlikely that one or more of the detainee \n     cases that we are handling will be before the Supreme Court \n     again. I do not know the views of Judge Alito respecting the \n     issues that may be presented in those cases. . . . I'm \n     confident, however, that as an able legal scholar and a \n     fairminded justice, he will give arguments, legal and \n     factual, that may be presented on behalf of our clients \n     careful and thoughtful consideration, without any \n     predisposition in favor of the position of the executive \n     branch.\n\n  I agree. I believe Judge Alito will be that independent judge who \nwill apply\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\nthe law and the Constitution, not just to Congress, but to every branch \nof government, and every person, because Judge Alito knows no one, \nincluding the President, is above the law.\n  Not only is Judge Alito an intelligent and experienced jurist, he is \nalso an openminded and fair judge. I am telling everyone that, but \nanyone that saw the hearing knows that, from the 18 hours he testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago. He is an openminded and \nfair judge. He told the committee:\n\n       Good judges develop certain habits of mind. One . . . is \n     the habit of delaying reaching conclusions until everything \n     has been considered. Good judges are always open to the \n     possibility of changing their minds based on the next brief \n     that they read or the next argument that is made by an \n     attorney who is appearing before them, or a comment that is \n     made by a colleague when the judges privately discuss the \n     case.\n\n  How much more appropriate is that approach to the law than just \nyesterday the Supreme Court decided to hear an execution case of a \nperson in Florida when they got the decision made and the word down as \nthey were strapping him in to inject the lethal chemical into him: \nWait, don't make a decision until all the facts are in. So that person \ndid not die last night.\n  In fact, Judge Alito acknowledged he has changed his opinion in the \nmiddle of the judicial process because he is waiting for all the facts, \nthose motions, those debates, to be done before he finally concludes. \nHe testified:\n\n       There have been numerous cases in which I've . . . been \n     given the job of writing an opinion . . . and in the process \n     of writing the opinion, I see that the position that I had \n     previously was wrong. I changed my mind. And then I will \n     write to the other members of the panel and I will say, I \n     have thought this through and this is what I discovered and \n     now I think we should do the opposite of what we agreed, and \n     sometimes they'll agree with me and sometimes they won't.\n\n  Now, what do you hear from the people opposed to Judge Alito? His \ncritics have tried to paint him out to be an extremist. An activist \njudge with some agenda hostile to individual rights and to what his \ncritics have called the ``average American.''\n\n  We were presented with analyses on how outside the mainstream Judge \nAlito's opinions were. But that is not what we heard from the American \nBar Association. This group of men and women unanimously voted to award \nJudge Alito its highest possible rating: ``well qualified.'' We have \nheard from the Democrats that this ABA rating is the ``gold standard'' \nabout how to make any judgment about who is qualified to serve on the \njudiciary.\n  But that is also not what we heard from the panel of four sitting and \ntwo former Third Circuit judges who have worked with Judge Alito for \nmore than 15 years. They did not think Judge Alito was out of the \nmainstream, as certain people on the floor are trying to claim, or an \nextremist, as you have heard often argued by the other side. We heard \nquite to the contrary.\n  I have to say the committee received absolutely extraordinary \ntestimony from these appellate judges, which included nominees from--\njust think, these different Presidents nominated these people who \ntestified before us, who said Judge Alito will make a great Justice--\nPresident Lyndon Johnson, President Richard Nixon, President Ronald \nReagan, President George H.W. Bush, and President Bill Clinton, these \nPresidents appointed the people who came to us and said Samuel Alito \nwill make a good Justice.\n  There is disagreement on the floor of the Senate as to whether he \nwill be a good Justice. These are individuals we have heard from who \nhave had the opportunity to witness the interworkings of Samuel Alito \nas a judge during their private conferences, on a daily basis, behind \nclosed doors, when all the hair is let down. They saw his deliberative \nprocess. They know the ``real deal'' Sam Alito. And these witnesses--\nall respected and accomplished judges in their own right--each of them \nonly had glowing comments about Judge Alito. Their support was \nunqualified.\n  As Judge Aldisert told the committee:\n\n       We who have heard his probing questions during oral \n     argument, we who have been privy to his wise and insightful \n     comments in our private decisional conferences, we who have \n     observed at first hand his impartial approach to decision-\n     making and his thoughtful judicial temperament and know his \n     carefully crafted opinions, we who are his colleagues are \n     convinced that he will also be a great justice.\n\n  Let's go to Judge Becker:\n\n       The Sam Alito that I have sat with for 15 years is not an \n     ideologue. He's not a movement person. He's a real judge \n     deciding each case on the facts and the law, not on his \n     personal views, whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres \n     to precedent.\n\n  Judge Becker said:\n\n       I have never seen him exhibit a bias against any class of \n     litigation or litigants. . . .His credo has always been \n     fairness.\n\n  Chief Judge Scirica said:\n\n       Despite his extraordinary talents and accomplishments, \n     Judge Alito is modest and unassuming. His thoughtful and \n     inquiring mind, so evident in his opinions, is equally \n     evident in his personal relationships. He is concerned and \n     interested in the lives of those around him. He has an \n     impeccable work ethic, but he takes the time to be a \n     thoughtful friend to his colleagues. He treats everyone on \n     our court, and everyone on our court staff, with respect, \n     with dignity, and with compassion. He is committed to his \n     country and his profession. But he is equally committed to \n     his family, his friends, and his community. He is an \n     admirable judge and an admirable person.\n\n  Judge Barry said:\n\n       Samuel Alito set a standard of excellence that was \n     contagious--his commitment to doing the right thing, never \n     playing fast and loose with the record, never taking a \n     shortcut, his emphasis on first-rate work, his fundamental \n     decency.\n\n  So contrary to what his misguided critics have alleged, Judge Alito \nis fair and open-minded, and will approach cases without any bias and \nwithout a personal agenda.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Alito's record--as you have heard for the last 2 \ndays and as you heard 2 weeks ago in the hearing--has been wildly \ndistorted. Contrary to these critics' claims, Judge Alito has ruled for \nplaintiffs as well as defendants in civil rights, ADA, and employment \ndiscrimination cases. I think a statistical analysis of how many times \na certain kind of plaintiff wins or loses is not the best way to judge \na judge's record. It is wrong to think there should be a scorecard on \nhow often plaintiffs or defendants should win, like some basketball \ngame. Who should win depends upon the facts presented in the case and \nwhat the law says, just as it should be in a country based on the rule \nof law.\n  What is important to Judge Alito is that he rules on the specific \nfacts in the case and the issue before his court, in accordance with \nthe law and the Constitution. Judge Alito does not have a predisposed \noutcome in a case. He does not bow to special interests, but sticks to \nthe law regardless of whether the results are popular or not.\n  Similar to Chief Justice Roberts, Judge Alito rules for the ``big \nguy'' when the law and the Constitution say the ``big guy'' should win. \nHe rules for the ``little guy'' when the law and the Constitution say \nthe ``little guy'' should win. That is precisely what good judging is \nall about, and that is precisely the kind of Justices who ought to be \non the Supreme Court and, for most of the time in our history, have \nbeen on the Supreme Court--I think it will be 110 of them when Alito \ngets there.\n  The claims that Judge Alito is somehow hostile to civil rights, \nminorities, women, and the disabled are really off the mark, and those \narguments are intellectually dishonest. It is easy to cherry-pick cases \nand claim that a judge is out of the mainstream. His fellow colleagues \non the Third Circuit, though, give you a completely different picture \nof Judge Alito than what you have seen painted here in the last 2 days. \nFellow colleagues on the Third Circuit testified about Judge Alito's \nfairness and impartiality with respect to all plaintiffs.\n\n  For example, Judge Garth testified:\n\n       I can tell you with confidence that at no time during the \n     15 years that Judge Alito has served with me and with our \n     colleagues on the court and the countless number of times \n     that we have sat together in private conference after hearing \n     oral argument, has he ever expressed anything that could be \n     described as an agenda. Nor has he ever expressed any \n     personal predilections about a case or an issue or a \n     principle that would affect his decisions.\n\n  Judge Higgenbotham, Jr., a liberal judge, said:\n\n       Sam Alito is my favorite judge to sit with on this court. \n     He is a wonderful judge and a terrific human being. Sam Alito \n     is my kind of conservative. He is intellectually honest. He \n     doesn't have an agenda.\n\n  Kate Pringle, a former Alito law clerk and Democrat who has known the \njudge since 1994, testified that:\n\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\n\n       [Judge Alito] was not, in my personal experience, an \n     ideologue. He pays attention to the facts of cases and \n     applies the law in a careful way. He is conservative in that \n     sense. His opinions don't demonstrate an ideological slant.\n\n  I found Judge Lewis's testimony to be particularly compelling. Judge \nLewis described himself to the committee this way. These are his words: \n``openly and unapologetically pro-choice'' and ``a committed human \nrights and civil rights activist.'' That is how he described himself, \nJudge Lewis.\n  He testified about Judge Alito:\n\n       [I]t is in conference, after we have heard oral argument \n     and are not propped up by law clerks--we are alone as judges, \n     discussing the cases--that one really gets to know, gets a \n     sense of the thinking of our colleagues.\n\n  Judge Lewis continued:\n\n       And I cannot recall one instance during conference or \n     during any other experience that I had with Judge Alito, but \n     in particular during conference, when he exhibited anything \n     remotely resembling an ideological bent.\n\n  Judge Lewis further said:\n\n       If I believed that Sam Alito might be hostile to civil \n     rights as a member of the United States Supreme Court, I \n     guarantee you that I would not be sitting here today. . . . \n     My sense of civil rights matters and how courts should \n     approach them jurisprudentially might be a little different. \n     . . . But I cannot argue with a more restrained approach. As \n     long as my argument is going to be heard and respected, I \n     know that I have a chance. And I believe that Sam Alito will \n     be the type of justice who will listen with an open mind and \n     will not have any agenda-driven or result-oriented approach.\n\n  Judge Lewis concluded:\n\n       I am here as a matter of principle and as a matter of my \n     own commitment to justice, to fairness, and my sense that Sam \n     Alito is uniformly qualified in all important respects to \n     serve as a justice on the United States Supreme Court.\n\n  So who do you believe has accurately depicted Judge Alito's \nqualifications and record? The speeches of opponents today and \nyesterday? Or the people who have worked with the judge, day in and day \nout for years, who know him personally, and who have seen him up close \nand in the trenches? I will pick those people who have worked with \nJudge Alito for 15 years, particularly because they come from different \npolitical backgrounds and different approaches to the law and the \nConstitution, as opposed to the partisan, liberal outside interest \ngroups that have probably never even met Judge Alito. I, then, know \nwhom I believe.\n  Not only that. If one wipes away the distorted and deceptive \ncharacterizations, as well as the false insinuations and calculated \nsmears, Judge Alito's record plainly shows that he is a dedicated \npublic servant who practices what he preaches: integrity, modesty, \njudicial restraint, devotion to the law, and devotion to the \nConstitution.\n  Let me briefly address this issue which has been brought up that \nsomehow Judge Alito's appointment is going to upset the balance of the \nCourt. As I said before, history will take care of the proper \n``balance'' on the Court. But some of my colleagues--or maybe speaking \nfor their outside liberal interest groups--have taken the position that \nJudge Alito has to share Justice O'Connor's judicial philosophy and \nvoting record in order to take her seat on the Court. They argue that \nJudge Alito should not be confirmed, regardless of whether he is \nqualified or not, because he does not appear to be Justice O'Connor's \njudicial philosophy ``soul-mate'', and he would change the ideological \nbalance of the Court.\n  Well, the last time I checked, the Supreme Court does not have seats \nthat are reserved for a conservative or a liberal or a moderate or a \nCatholic or a Jew or a Protestant, one philosophy or another \nphilosophy--no! The Senate has never taken the position, moreover, that \nlike-minded individuals should replace like-minded Justices leaving the \nCourt. And until just recently, I never heard the argument from the \nother side of the aisle. That kind of reasoning is completely \nantithetical to the proper role of the judiciary in our system of \ngovernment.\n  The reality is that the Senate has historically confirmed individuals \nto the Supreme Court who are determined to be well qualified to \ninterpret and apply the law. It has not been the Senate's tradition to \nconfirm individuals to promote special interests or represent certain \ncauses. That is not what the Constitution says for the Senate to do. In \nfact, the Court's composition has changed with the elected branches \nover the years. Almost half of the Supreme Court Justices have been \nreplaced by individuals appointed by a President of a different \npolitical party.\n  The truth is that the Senate has not ever understood its role as \nmaintaining any perceived ideological balance on the Court. In fact, \nthe Senate outright rejected that kind of thinking when Ruth Bader \nGinsburg came before us. She was a known liberal, a former general \ncounsel for the ACLU, and she was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate \nby a vote of 96 to 3. She replaced whom? A conservative justice, \nJustice Byron White. Yet there were not any arguments from the other \nside of the aisle or from this side of the aisle that she would upset \nthe balance of the Court. And she did--change the balance of the Court, \nradically swinging it to the left.\n  I certainly did not agree with Justice Ginsburg's liberal judicial \nphilosophy, but I voted for her. The fact is that the Senate confirmed \nJustice Ginsburg because President Clinton won the election. He made a \npromise in that election who he was going to appoint to the Supreme \nCourt. He had a right to nominate who he wanted based upon the results \nof that election--the same thing for George Bush in the 2000 election \nand the 2004 election. Moreover, and more importantly, though, Justice \nGinsburg had the requisite qualifications to serve on the Court, and \nshe was not a political hack. So she was confirmed.\n  This was the same for Justice Breyer. I knew that Breyer was a \nliberal and that I probably would not agree with his judicial \nphilosophy, but he was qualified. So I voted for him. The Senate \nconfirmed Justice Breyer by a vote of 87 to 9. The President had made \nhis choice. The Senate found him to be qualified, and we confirmed him. \nRepublicans certainly did not put up any roadblocks to the Ginsburg and \nBreyer nominations. I would say that Judge Alito is no more out of the \nmainstream than Justices Breyer and Ginsburg.\n  The Democrats and liberal outside interest groups are intent on \nchanging the rules of the game because they did not win at the ballot \nbox in 2000 and 2004, or maybe over the last 10 years. The way the \nDemocrats want to operate now is not the way we have operated in the \npast. But the truth is, by politicizing and degrading the nominations \nprocess, and the nominees themselves, we will end up driving away our \nbest and brightest minds from volunteering for public service. It is \ndisappointing to me to see a decent man and his family have to endure \nhurtful allegations and insinuations which are just plain false and, \nmoreover, mean-spirited.\n  It is disappointing to me that so many of my colleagues are going \ndown this path, creating a standard that can only harm the independence \nof the judiciary, and severely distort our system of government.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I want to quote from a letter I \nreceived from an Iowa constituent. I will only quote it in part, but I \nwill include it for the Record. Her name is Joan Watson-Nelson, and she \nwrote about her very personal impressions of Judge Alito when they \nattended high school together in the late 1960s in New Jersey. I don't \nknow exactly how she got to Iowa. But she is there and she wanted me to \nknow how she remembered Sam Alito.\n  She wrote:\n\n       I remembered [Samuel Alito] because he stood out in his \n     class and in the school. He was one of the leaders of the \n     school. . . . I remembered him being very bright, well \n     prepared, and brilliant. He appeared to be an individual with \n     vision. . . . . He stood out as a young man with a great deal \n     of integrity. Many of his teachers from high school are gone \n     now. But I know if they were here and could write letters on \n     his behalf, they would have many stories to tell about the \n     kind of student he was both inside and outside the classroom.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       I am not a very political person. I have some issues that I \n     believe in deeply and others that I do not have a deep \n     commitment about. I am sure that Sam and I do not agree on \n     all the issues that will be placed before him. The abortion \n     issue is likely to be one of those, as I understand from the \n     media that he may be against abortion. However, I do strongly \n     believe that he will listen to the arguments placed before \n     him, research the law, and decide honorably.\n\n  She concludes her letter this way:\n\n       It has been nearly 40 years since he graduated from high \n     school.\n\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\n\n  I think the implication is she hasn't even talked to him in the last \n40 years. She says:\n\n       And although I have a good memory for details, the specific \n     details of my involvement with Sam are not as clear as I \n     would like to have them be in my endorsement for him. What is \n     left, however, is the internalized memory of Sam. That memory \n     tells me that he will make an excellent Supreme Court \n     justice. I hope that with your hearings on his appointment, \n     you and the others will be able to make that clear to any who \n     may wish to try to discredit him for political reasons. What \n     I learned about the Supreme Court branch of government--\n\n  Talking about when she was in school--\n\n     is that this part of the ``checks'' in our system is to be \n     devoid of politics. I believe that Sam has what it takes to \n     fulfill that role.\n\n  I think this is a very nice testimonial about the man we are going to \nvote on and hopefully confirm to become the next member of the Supreme \nCourt. I appreciate Ms. Watson-Nelson's letter letting us know about \nher personal experience with Sam Alito. She hit the nail on the head. \nThe Supreme Court needs to get out of the business of politics, and we \nneed to stop discrediting good nominees for political reasons. She, \nlike most Americans, knows what is going on.\n  So, it is clear to me, the people who know Judge Alito personally \nbelieve, without any reservation, that he is a judge who follows the \nlaw and the Constitution without preset outcomes in mind. They believe \nhe is a man of great intellect and insight. They believe he is a fair \nand open-minded judge committed to doing what is right, rather than \ncommitted to implementing a political agenda or a personal agenda. They \nbelieve he is a man of integrity, modesty, and restraint.\n  I am pleased to support Judge Alito's nomination. Judge Alito will be \na great Justice, not a politician on the bench. He won't impose his \npersonal views or be a judicial activist, but will make decisions as \nthey should be decided--in an impartial manner, with the appropriate \nrestraint, in accordance with the laws and the Constitution. Judge \nAlito will carry out the responsibilities of a Justice in a principled, \nfair, and effective manner. I am proud to cast my vote in support of \nthis decent and honorable man.\n  I wish this story would end with qualifications, integrity, and \njudicial restraint, because only those considerations should matter. \nBut it looks as though the most partisan and political among us won't \nlet that happen. There may be some who will vote against Judge Alito's \nconfirmation, not because of qualifications or integrity, and not even \nbecause they want somebody to legislate from the bench or treat the \nConstitution as a blank slate that judges can freely draw upon.\n  No, it appears some Senators will vote against this nominee because \nthey think doing so is a good political issue. Instead of applying the \nsame standard we Republicans applied when the Senate overwhelmingly \nconfirmed Justice Ginsburg, the most liberal Justice on the Court, \nthese partisans will change the rules in the middle of the game once \nagain. They will vote against Judge Alito with an eye toward the next \nelection and the demands of their most extreme and activist supporters.\n  The Washington Post had it right when it editorialized on January 15:\n\n       A Supreme Court nomination isn't a forum to refight a \n     presidential election.\n\n  I would go a step further than that editorial. A Supreme Court \nnomination is not a forum to fight any election. It is the time to \nperform one of our most important constitutional duties and decide \nwhether a nominee is qualified to serve on the Nation's highest court.\n  I hope my colleagues will cast their vote based on Judge Alito's \noutstanding qualifications, rather than on the distorted claims of \nliberal outside-interest groups. I urge my colleagues to rise above \npartisan politics and support this worthy nominee, Samuel Alito. Samuel \nAlito deserves our overwhelming vote of approval, and it would be a \ngreat shame if he doesn't get it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letter from which \nI quoted.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I spoke with you briefly at the Iowa \n     Farm Bureau annual meeting on November 30th regarding Sam \n     Alito. You requested that I follow up our discussion with a \n     letter about how I felt about him.\n       He graduated from Steinert High School (AKA Hamilton High \n     School-East) in 1968 and I graduated from Steinert in 1969. I \n     remember well that he was one of 4 Valedictorians that year, \n     a first for the school. There were 2 men and 2 women. I knew \n     one of the women well and I remembered him because he stood \n     out in his class and in the school. He was one of the leaders \n     of the school. He was student council president at Steinert \n     his senior year, and I think he was also student council \n     president at Reynolds Jr. High as well. I had worked with him \n     on the school newspaper staff my Junior year, the year he was \n     the editor of the paper.\n       I remember him as being very bright, well prepared, and \n     brilliant. He appeared to be an individual with vision. His \n     high school ``crowd'' of kids were the leaders of the school \n     and his class. I knew some of his crowd well during my high \n     school years. He stood out as a young man with a great deal \n     of integrity.\n       Many of his teachers from high school are gone now. But I \n     know if they were here and could write letters on his behalf, \n     they would have many stories to tell about the kind of \n     student he was both inside and outside the classroom. The \n     teachers at Steinert at the time Sam and I were in high \n     school were a family and they viewed the student body as part \n     of that family. His first principal at Steinert was my \n     father, Richard F. Watson. When we discussed that Sam was up \n     for the Supreme Justice opening, he remembered him and hoped \n     that he would be approved.\n       I am not a very political person. I have some issues that I \n     believe in deeply and others that I do not have a deep \n     commitment about. I am sure that Sam and I do not agree on \n     all of the issues that will be placed before him. The \n     abortion issue is likely to be one of those, as I understand \n     from the media that he may be against abortion. However, I do \n     strongly believe that he will listen to the arguments placed \n     before him, research the law, and decide honorably.\n       The best summary of the type of person that I believe Sam \n     to be is that I believe that he has many of the same \n     qualities that I have observed in you, Senator, over the \n     years that you have been our State senator. Those qualities \n     and values are the reason that I continue to vote for you and \n     support you. I think that this is the best endorsement that I \n     can give to Sam. It has been nearly 40 years since he \n     graduated from high school. And although I have a good memory \n     for details, the specific details of my involvement with Sam \n     are not as clear as I would like them to be in my endorsement \n     for him. What is left, however, is the internalized memory of \n     Sam. That memory tells me that he will make an excellent \n     Supreme Court Justice.\n       I hope that with your hearings on his appointment, you and \n     the others will be able to make that clear to any who may \n     wish to try to discredit him for political reasons. What I \n     learned about the Supreme Court branch of our government is \n     that this part of the ``checks'' in our system that is to be \n     devoid of politics. I believe that Sam has what it takes to \n     fulfill that role.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joan Watson-Nelson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry before I begin: I know \nwe have a balance, going back and forth in this debate. Have any prior \narrangements been made with regard to others proceeding, or may I go at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed until 2.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nnomination of Judge Samuel Alito for Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Before I proceed to my discussion of my views of Judge Alito, I take \na moment to thank Senator Arlen Specter for the good work he has done \non the Judiciary Committee over the last few months. He has had a \nloaded calendar, a lot of important legislation, important hearings, \nand the process of confirming two Supreme Court Justices. It has been a \nwhile since any chairman of the Judiciary Committee or any committee \nhas had this kind of workload over just a few months. Senator Specter \nhas done an excellent job in the way he has handled it.\n  I also recognize Senator Grassley and his participation on the \ncommittee and the statement he just gave. It is obvious he has done his \nhomework. He handled himself well in the hearings, and he has even \ndeveloped what seems to be a personal affinity for Judge Alito. That \nwill affect a lot of other Senators' thinking about this, and a lot of \nthe American people.\n  I commend those on the committee who have treated this process with \nthe dignity and respect it certainly deserves. The Chair will note, I \nsaid to ``those,'' meaning not necessarily all of the members of the \ncommittee.\n  There is not a lot I can say here today that others won't say about \nhis\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\nrecord or about this issue. But I believe this is one of the most \nimportant functions we have in the Senate; that is, our advice and \nconsent, the confirmation process for our Federal judiciary. There is \nno question that it was intended we have three equal branches of \nGovernment: the judiciary, the executive, and the legislative. We all \nhave responsibilities under the Constitution and under the law, and \nthose have evolved over the years. Separation of power should not mean \nwe become the body or the part of Government that becomes \nobstructionist or is always looking for a way to take on the executive \nor the judiciary. This is an important responsibility, and it is \nimportant every Senator have a chance to express his or her views on \nthis topic.\n  This is such an important issue that it is good for the country, \nanytime we have a debate about the judiciary and what is the role of \nthe Congress, the executive branch, the judiciary, the whole process: \nHow should judges be selected and how should the hearings be held and \nwhat should they do when they get on the Court. This is good for the \ncountry, and we should look at it that way.\n  I do know that it has been a constant topic of discussion in much of \nthe country since last summer with the process that led to the \nconfirmation of Chief Justice Roberts and now the discussion about \nJudge Alito. I had a call from a constituent in Jackson, MS. She \nexpressed her support for the fact that the Judiciary Committee \nreported out this nomination and thought we were going to vote today, \nwhich we should be voting today on his confirmation as an Associate \nJustice. It said to me, once again, this is not a person involved in \nthe judiciary, but people are paying attention to what we say and what \nwe do. We should not trivialize in any way this important process.\n  Over the years I have asked myself, what should I do in analyzing \nFederal judicial nominations, particularly the Supreme Court, since \nthey clearly can have a long-term effect. When we confirm these men and \nwomen for life terms, it is serious. We need to always be thinking \nabout it. When I first came to the Senate after years in the House, I \nasked my senior colleague from Mississippi, a respected member and now \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, to talk with me about what \nshould be the criteria in debates for confirming judges. He gave me \ngood advice, and it was pretty simple. He basically said that under our \nadvice and consent responsibility, we should look to see if the nominee \nis qualified by character, education, experience, and temperament. Then \nif the nominee meets the basic criteria or qualifications in those \nareas, he or she should be confirmed. End of discussion. Not a ruling \non a particular case, not a personal view on any subject, not one based \non religious faith or any number of other issues. Are they qualified by \ncharacter, which means do they have good integrity and ethics, are they \neducated for the job, do they have good experience, and do they have \nthe right temperament to serve. That is the way it should be.\n  When I have looked at the issue, I am absolutely satisfied we have \none of the most qualified nominees for the Supreme Court, probably one \nof the most qualified in at least 70 years, when we look at all he has \ndone. I have applied this principle during Democratic administrations \nand Republican. Have I occasionally voted against nominees? Yes, for \ngood and valid reasons. I voted against one because I thought he had a \nconflict of interest. I voted against one because I thought he had been \na recess appointment inappropriately. I don't think Federal judges \nshould, generally get recess appointments, although it has been done in \none case where I clearly felt it was fair. But it is not something I \nwould want us to make a practice of.\n  I voted for Justice Ginsburg. A lot of people in my State said: Why? \nI voted for other so-called liberal judges I philosophically had \nproblems with, but in the case of Justice Ginsburg, I thought she was \nqualified by character, education, experience, and by her temperament. \nI am sure I don't agree with an awful lot of the decisions she has made \non the Supreme Court, but she is qualified.\n  There is one other thing. It is called elections. When we elect a \nPresident, we should know what is going to be their position on \nappointing people to the Federal judiciary. This President, George W. \nBush, made it clear he was going to be looking for strict \nconstructionists, men and women of good character who would not write \nthe laws but would interpret the laws. He talked about it. Nobody in \nAmerica should be surprised that he would nominate a candidate such as \nJudge Alito. He certainly is experienced. He is a strict \nconstructionist. He is qualified.\n  Some people are offended that the President would suggest what \nappears to be a conservative for the Supreme Court. Why? What did they \nexpect? That is why I voted for Justice Ginsburg and a lot of President \nClinton's nominees for the Federal judiciary, because he won the \nelection. These were his choices. While I might disagree with him \nphilosophically, I couldn't disagree with him as far as their \nqualifications. Even the very active Democratic Governor of \nPennsylvania, Mr. Rendell, has talked about elections and their meaning \nin this process. This President has selected this nominee and he is \nentitled to that and, basically, this judge should be confirmed. That \nwas an interesting comment for a former chairman of the Democratic \nNational Committee. But he took the right position, and I appreciate \nthe fact that he would do that.\n  When you look at Judge Alito's background, it becomes clear he is \nhighly qualified. He is a graduate of Princeton and Yale Law School. \nSome people might try to use that against him. I guess he couldn't get \ninto Vanderbilt or the University of Mississippi, but Princeton and \nYale are not bad institutions.\n  He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He was an editor of the Yale Law \nReview. He clerked for Judge Leonard Garth of the Third Circuit. He was \nan assistant U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. He was \nAssistant to the Solicitor General of the United States beginning in \n1981 where he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court on behalf of the \nFederal Government. After serving as Deputy Assistant Attorney General \nin the Office of Legal Counsel, he was nominated for U.S. attorney for \nthe District of New Jersey. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. \nThen, of course, he was nominated by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 \nto the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  So he has good character. I think most people would agree to that. He \nis clearly well educated. It is hard to disagree with that. He clearly \nis brilliant. Maybe sometimes he is too smart for a lot of us; he knows \nthe law, and he can talk about cases by name without reference to \nnotes. He clerked and has worked as a Federal judge in the Third \nCircuit. He was on the prosecution side as assistant U.S. attorney and \nas U.S. attorney. So these are all good qualifications.\n  Then he went on the Third Circuit, a very important and active \ncircuit, where he has served 15 years. He cast approximately 5,000 \nvotes, and he participated in the decisions of more than 1,500 Federal \nappeals and has written more than 350 opinions--a lot of work and a lot \nof good work.\n  If there was a problem with this judge and his opinions, do you \nreally think the Judiciary Committee could not have found some cases or \nmore phrases when he participated in all of these votes and wrote 350 \nopinions? I have been very impressed by the willingness of his \ncolleagues, but not just from New Jersey, not just those who served \nwith him in previous administrations, but six current and former \nFederal judges with all kinds of backgrounds and philosophies--people \nwho admit, I am a Democrat, a liberal, but I know this man, his \ndemeanor, how he handles himself when we were in conference--where \njudges come out with these mystical decisions they develop in those \nquarters. That is where you see the real man. When you have people who \nhave spoken up and made it clear about the quality of this nominee, I \nthink that is very important.\n  The ``holy grail,'' the American Bar Association, has rated him well \nqualified. There again, a lot of people used to say that is the most \nimportant thing of all. Well, he got their top rating. Surely, that \nwould affect us. Regardless of ideological, philosophy, or positioning, \nthe people who know him best have spoken up very aggressively in his \nsupport. That is very convincing to me.\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\n  I thought during the hearings he handled himself quite well. He \nanswered over 600--maybe 700 questions, when he was given a chance. The \nstatements and questions were a lot longer than the answers were \nallowed to be. I thought his responses were good and studied. He met \nthe so-called Ginsburg standard. He would not say how he might rule on \na particular case. How can you do that? You have to know the facts and \nyou have to look at precedents and you have to go through all these \nhoops that lawyers enjoy wrestling with and judges have to comply with. \nI watched it. My wife thought I was strange for sitting there watching \nthese committee hearings, but I felt it was part of my responsibility. \nI wanted to see what the Senators asked him and how he responded. I \nthought he handled himself well on his answers and how he responded on \nsubstance.\n  I was upset, quite frankly, when it turned from substance to what got \nclose to character assassination, smear. It really got personal and \nugly. I was embarrassed about that. I was ashamed, quite frankly. I \nrealize that sometimes our spouses have to put up with a lot for those \nof us who are in government and politics and on the judiciary. But I \nthought it was a defining moment when the judge's wife was driven to \ntears.\n  I have appreciation for the fact that one of the Senators was saying, \nWe are sorry that you had to put up with this. We know you are a man of \ncharacter and integrity. I don't think it needs to go that far.\n  Do we get carried away around here sometimes on both sides of the \naisle? Sure. It is a tough, political, and partisan political place. \nBut how much is enough? How low will we sink? Every year I have been in \nthe Senate we have drifted further and further down in how we deal with \nthese Federal judicial appointments. Hopefully, we will finally reach \nthe bottom and we will go back up.\n  There is no good reason to vote against this good man to be on the \nSupreme Court, even if you might disagree with him on some of his \ndecisions. But he will be careful and studied and he will pay attention \nto the precedents--more so than I probably would like him to. But it is \ntime to begin to try to go back and approach these nominations \ndifferently. Again, I am not absolving any of us for having misbehaved \nsometimes in the way we handle these issues.\n  The American people are watching, and they have to feel for this man. \nThey were unhappy with what they saw from a lot of Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee. They felt that he went through more than he should \nhave, in terms of personal attacks. They would like for us not to go \nquite so far.\n  I was encouraged, frankly, when we had the vote on Judge Roberts, to \nbe the Chief Justice. I was pleased that it was as bipartisan as it \nwas, and he received 78 votes. But now I see that slipping away in this \ncase.\n  Some say: Wait a minute, this is extraordinarily important because \nthis may tip the balance, and that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor became \nsomewhat of a swing vote and probably would be interpreted by some \npeople as being a moderate in some respect.\n  Well, it may tip the balance. From my standpoint, I sure hope so. But \nI was not paying any attention to balance when I voted for Justice \nGinsburg. I was voting on the merits of that particular individual.\n  I don't think it is fair to Judge Alito to oppose him because he is \nconservative and may tilt the balance of the Supreme Court. These \nthings swing back and forth. The pendulum has been way over there in \nthe Supreme Court for a long time and, finally, it has become more \nmoderate. Maybe it will become more conservative.\n\n  I think I have told the story in the Senate before about how I was \ntalking to a personal friend, now a Federal judge. He was inquiring in \nbemusement, and incredulously:\n\n       Why is it that the Federal judiciary is held in such low \n     regard?\n\n  I could not believe he even asked. I said:\n\n       Your Honor, it is because of the dumb decisions that you \n     all quite often make.\n\n  The people are outraged with decisions such as the Kelo v. City of \nNew London case, dealing with eminent domain.\n  Time and time again, people see what is happening in Supreme Court \nrulings. They get in here when they should not and don't get in there \nwhen they should. In many instances, they interpret the law wrongly or \nstart to try to make laws. And it is not just the Supreme Court. I \nthink over the years--recently, at least--if you look at the Supreme \nCourt, they have been pretty good. But the eminent domain decision just \nabsolutely floored me. We have to correct that mistake. When you get \ndown to the rest of the Federal judiciary, they are into all kinds of \nstuff all the time--social engineering, intervention when they have no \nbusiness intervening, and they have lost a lot of respect from the \nAmerican people.\n  That said, I want the Federal judiciary and the Congress and the \nPresident to be respected for the special institutions they are. So \nthis is an important decision.\n  I am pleased the President nominated Judge Alito. I think that his \nexperience over these years has clearly qualified him for it. He has 30 \nyears of experience, and he went though 18 hours of questioning. He is \na good man with a great background, with an American dream story, a \nfirst generation American from another country. He is everything I \nthought we should be looking for. So I am pleased and honored to be \nable to come and speak on behalf of his nomination and urge his \nconfirmation, and I will vote for him.\n  In conclusion, let me say again that there are some who say we may \nstill have a filibuster. We should not do that. We cannot do that. That \nis not fair to the process, not fair to this nominee, not fair to the \nPresident. I hope our colleagues will not impose a filibuster here and \nforce action by the Senate to stop that sort of thing from happening.\n  I also want to say again that I think we have sort of lost our grip \non how we treat these nominees. We need to find a way to pull back. It \nhas gotten too ugly, too personal, and I think it undermines the \ncredibility of the judiciary and those of us who sit in judgment on \nthese men and women. I repeat again that we have all been a party to \nthis, including me--I don't deny it--over the years. But at some point \nthere comes a time when you say to each other, regardless of philosophy \nor region or party, let's see if we cannot do a better job, with more \ndignity and decorum, and that is more focused on the qualifications and \ncharacter of the men and women and not on politics, partisanship, or \nideology. I would like to be a part of making that happen.\n  Every now and then, I have colleagues say: What can we do about the \natmosphere? Well, it begins with us. It begins with making up our minds \nthat we are going to be more communicative and we are not going to be \nquite so partisan. I have been as partisan as anybody around here. I \nserved in the House, and it tends to make you a partisan warrior when \nyou have been in the minority. Some people say maybe you get to be kind \nof arrogant and mean when you get to be in the majority. We can make a \ndifference. I hope we find a way to do it, and do it soon.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding at this time that \nthere is an allocation of time reserved for the Senator from Virginia, \nand I shall proceed, although we are slightly off schedule. I don't \nwish to encroach on others, but I will proceed and watch the floor very \ncarefully.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend for a moment. I have \nbeen advised there are only 2 minutes left of the majority time for \nthis allocation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I will proceed, if I may, and ask unanimous consent \nto speak for not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we \ncertainly hope there will be no objection. My friend and colleague from \nConnecticut is roughly scheduled on the hour, but that seems to be a \nreasonable request.\n\n[[Page S175]]\n\nWe could add the other 5 minutes at the end of the hour if that would \nbe agreeable to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think that would work out. Perhaps the \nintervening hour will be such that we won't need that additional 5 \nminutes because I think the managers and leadership have tried to \ncarefully manage the time. I am just able to get started now because my \ncolleagues gave very good speeches, and we all enjoyed it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Virginia \nis recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, article II, section 2 of the U.S. \nConstitution explicitly provides for the responsibilities of the \nexecutive branch and Government and the Senate with respect to judicial \nnominations. The Constitution reads in part that the President ``shall \nnominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint judges of the Supreme Court and all of the officers of the \nUnited States.'' Thus, the Constitution provides the President of the \nUnited States with the responsibility of nominating individuals to \nserve on our Federal bench.\n  The Constitution provides the Senate with the responsibility of \nproviding advice to the President on those nominations and with the \nresponsibility of providing and withholding consent on those \nnominations. In this respect, article II, section 2 of our Constitution \nplaces our Federal judiciary in a unique posture with respect to the \nother two coequal branches of our Federal Government.\n  Unlike the executive branch and unlike the Congress, the Constitution \nplaces the composition and continuity of our Federal judiciary entirely \nwithin the coordinated exercise and responsibilities of the other two \nbranches of the Government. Only if the President and the Senate fairly \nand objectively and, if I may say, in a timely manner exercise their \nrespective constitutional powers can the judicial branch of Government \nbe composed and maintained so that our courts can function and serve \nthe American people.\n  For this reason, in my view, a Senator has no higher duty than his or \nher constitutional responsibilities under article II, section 2--the \nadvise and consent clause.\n  With respect to the Senate's advice responsibilities under article \nII, section 2, I believe our Founding Fathers explicitly used the word \n``advice'' in our Constitution for a reason. This was to ensure \nconsultation between a President and the Senate prior to the forwarding \nof a nominee to the Senate for consideration. Adequate consultation \nprior to the forwarding of a nominee is of utmost importance. And, I \ncompliment our distinguished President for recognizing that in the case \nof now, Justice John Roberts, and with respect to this nomination.\n  But, let's not forget that while the Constitution calls for the \nSenate to provide advice to a President on whom he should nominate, the \ndecision of whom to nominate solely rests with the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Alexander Hamilton made this point crystal clear in the Federalist \nPaper No. 66 when he wrote:\n\n       It will be the office of the President to nominate, and, \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint. There \n     will, of course, be no exertion of choice on the part of the \n     Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and \n     oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves \n     choose--they can only ratify or reject the choice of the \n     President.\n\n  That is precisely why we are here in these closing days of a very \nprolonged procedure with regard to Judge Alito.\n  I am privileged to indicate that I shall strongly support him at the \ntime the vote is taken and cast my vote for him.\n  With respect to the issue of consent, I believe it is imperative that \nwhen a Senator considers whether to grant or withhold consent, he or \nshe should recognize article II, section 2 and Alexander Hamilton's \nstatement in Federalist No. 66. Accordingly, during the course of my 28 \nyears in the Senate, I have always tried to fairly and objectively \nreview a judicial nominee's credentials prior to deciding whether I \nwill vote to provide consent on a nomination. I look at a wide range of \nfactors, primarily: character, professional career, experience, \nintegrity, and temperament for lifetime service on our courts. While I \ncertainly recognize political considerations, it is my practice not to \nbe bound by them.\n  These same fair and objective factors that I have used during my 28 \nyears in the Senate have guided my consideration of Judge Alito's \nnomination.\n  When Judge Alito's nomination was first announced, I wasn't overly \nfamiliar with the nominee. But over the past few months, I have \nreviewed his record thoroughly. I met with the nominee twice--the first \ntime prior to his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and the second time after the hearings. Each time I asked him \na number of indepth questions. I have also reviewed a number of his \njudicial opinions and followed the confirmation hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee. In addition, many people have written, emailed, \ncalled my office, or spoken to me personally about this nominee, and I \nhave respectfully considered their views.\n  Having now completed my review of Judge Alito's nomination, I can \nsay, without equivocation, that of the numerous judicial nominees I \nhave reviewed during my nearly three decades in the Senate, Judge \nAlito's credentials and qualifications place him as very well \nqualified.\n  Judge Alito has an impressive record of legal accomplishments.\n  He received his bachelor's degree from Princeton University and \nattended Yale Law School. While at Yale, he served as an editor on the \nYale Law Journal. Following graduation from law school, he worked as a \nlaw clerk for a Federal circuit court judge, Judge Leonard Garth of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  Subsequent to his clerkship, Samuel Alito worked as an assistant U.S. \nattorney, as an assistant to the Solicitor General of the United \nStates, and in the Office of Legal Counsel in the U.S. Department of \nJustice. In 1987, Mr. Alito was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to \nserve as the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey. Three years \nlater he was nominated and unanimously confirmed by voice vote to serve \nas a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and he \nhas served on this court for the last 15 years.\n  Without a doubt, Judge Alito has the requisite legal and professional \nexperience to serve on the Supreme Court. Indeed, the American Bar \nAssociation, whose rating system of Federal judges is often referred to \nas the gold standard in the Senate, recently awarded Judge Alito a \nrating of well qualified--its highest rating.\n  But in addition to his impressive record of legal accomplishments, \nJudge Alito has also demonstrated--during his confirmation hearings and \nover the past 15 years on the Federal bench--a deep respect for legal \nprecedent and for the constitutional responsibility of the legislative \nbranch to write our laws. These qualities of Judge Alito were confirmed \nby the remarkable testimony before the Judiciary Committee of several \ncurrent and retired Federal judges, appointed by both Republican and \nDemocratic Presidents, who worked closely with Judge Alito on the \nFederal bench.\n  In my view, Judge Alito's strong record and experience, coupled with \nhis appearance before the Judiciary Committee, eliminate any question \nof the existence of ``extraordinary circumstances'' that would justify \ndenying him an up-or-down vote.\n  Judge Alito is an outstanding judicial nominee who I am proud to \nsupport for confirmation. I believe he will serve on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt with distinction, and I commend our President on making such a \nfine nomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to the understanding between \nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Massachusetts, I now ask \nunanimous consent that there be an extra 5 minutes added at the end of \nthis hour for this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S176]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of Samuel Alito to be \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court. This is the sixth opportunity I \nhave had as a Senator to consider a President's nominee to the High \nCourt. It is surely one of the most awesome and important \nresponsibilities of Members of this body because of the uniquely \npowerful and autonomous role the Supreme Court has in our governmental \nsystem and because, once confirmed, Supreme Court Justices serve for \nlife, with accountability only to the Constitution, as they read it.\n  Similar to most of my colleagues, I judge the nominees based on four \nfactors: their intellect and ability, their experience, their \ncharacter, and their judicial philosophy.\n  On the first three factors--intellect, experience, and character--I \nconclude that Judge Alito more than passes the test. But on the fourth \nfactor, judicial philosophy, I am left with too many doubts to vote to \nconfirm this nominee for a lifetime of service on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Let me now go over these four areas of consideration.\n  First, intellect and ability. From the meeting I had with Judge \nAlito, the legal quality of his opinions, over 15 years as a judge, and \nhis testimony before the Judiciary Committee, I believe Judge Alito has \nshown that he is a person of considerable intellect and ability.\n  Second, experience. Judge Alito's curriculum vitae itself depicts his \nexcellent and relevant experience as a law clerk, a Federal Government \nattorney, a U.S. attorney, and an appellate judge on the Third Circuit.\n  Third, his character. Judge Alito, I know, was questioned \naggressively at the Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearings and \nelsewhere with regard to his character, but I thought he emerged with \nhis integrity and honor intact. The ABA standing committee confirmed \nthat judgment when it concluded that ``he is an individual of excellent \nintegrity,'' and that was based on more than 300 interviews with \nprofessional colleagues.\n  Fourth is judicial philosophy, and here is where, for me, the \nproblems with this nomination begin and, in some sense, ends. Judge \nAlito brings to this nomination process a more lengthy record of \njudicial opinions than any of the previous five nominees to the U.S. \nSupreme Court whom I have had the privilege to consider. In his 15 \nyears on the Third Circuit Court, Judge Alito has written more than 350 \nopinions. Together, these opinions leave me with profound doubts about \nwhether Judge Alito would protect and advance the special role the \nConstitution gives the Supreme Court as the single institution in our \nGovernment that our Founders freed forever from popular political \npassions so that it could protect the rights our founding documents \ngave to every American.\n  Personal freedom and equal opportunity are America's core ideals, and \nour courts have been and must be the great advancers and protectors of \nthose ideals. To me, that work defines the vital mainstream of American \njurisprudence.\n  Based on his personal statements during the 1980s when he was a \nGovernment attorney, and particularly on his 15 years of judicial \nopinions, I am left with profound concerns that Judge Alito would \ndiminish the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate guarantor of \nindividual liberty in our country.\n  This is not about a single issue but about an accumulation of his \nopinions that leads me to a preponderance of doubts. For example, in \ncivil rights cases, Judge Alito has repeatedly established a very high \nbar, an unusually high bar for entrance to our courts for people who \nbelieve they have been denied equal opportunity and fair treatment \nbased on race or gender.\n  In one case, Bray v. Marriott Hotels, the majority of his colleagues \non the court said:\n\n       Title VII of the Civil Rights Act would be eviscerated if \n     our analysis were to halt where the dissent of Judge Alito \n     suggests.\n\n  Judge Alito's narrow reading of the commerce clause, as exemplified \nby his dissent in the case of United States v. Rybar, casts a shadow on \nFederal legislation passed to protect the rights of individual \nAmericans which has been and will be based on the commerce clause. When \nasked at his confirmation hearings about the question of personal \nprivacy, Judge Alito accepted the 1965 decision of Griswold v. \nConnecticut as settled law. But when asked over and over, he refused to \nsay the same about the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade.\n\n  On that most divisive and difficult question of abortion, I \npersonally believe that Roe achieved a just balance of rights and \nreflected a societal consensus that has continued and deepened in our \ncountry for more than three decades. I was left with serious concerns \nthat Judge Alito would not uphold the basic tenets of Roe, and that is \na very troubling conclusion.\n  Every time I have voted to confirm a nominee to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, as I have with Justices Souter, Breyer, Ginsburg, and Roberts--\ntwo appointed by Republican Presidents and two appointed by a \nDemocratic President--I did so knowing, as we all do, that I was taking \na risk because I could never know exactly how the particular Justice \nwould rule on the many cases that would come before him or her in a \nlifetime on the bench. But I ultimately concluded, based on their \nrecords and their testimony, that those four Justices would more likely \nthan not uphold the unique responsibility the Supreme Court has as the \nmost important guardian of freedom, opportunity, and privacy for every \nsingle American.\n  Unfortunately, I have not been able to reach the same conclusion \nabout Judge Alito, and so I will respectfully vote ``no'' on his \nnomination.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis excellent statement.\n  I spoke on this issue yesterday. I wish to include in the Record some \nletters that I have received from the representatives of the working \ncommunity. I will include them in the Record. The first letter I am \ngoing to include in the Record is a letter I received from the AFL-CIO. \nIncluded in the comments are these words:\n\n       As the enclosed memorandum explains more fully, Judge \n     Alito's decisions and dissents show a disturbing tendency to \n     take an extremely narrow and restrictive view of laws passed \n     by Congress to protect workers' rights, resulting in workers \n     being deprived of wage and hour, health and safety, anti-\n     discrimination, pension, and other important protections. On \n     a number of occasions, Judge Alito's colleagues on the Third \n     Circuit have criticized his opinions for their excessively \n     narrow view of worker protection and civil rights statutes. \n     Judge Alito holds federal agencies to an unrealistically high \n     standard when they seek to enforce worker protection laws, \n     often reversing them on hypertechnical grounds and depriving \n     workers of important protections as result.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       Working families are struggling mightily against an assault \n     on our hard-won gains in the legislative arena and at the \n     bargaining table. Wages are being cut, pensions and health \n     benefits are being drastically reduced or eliminated, and job \n     security is vanishing. Now more than ever, workers need the \n     protections offered to them under the laws passed by Congress \n     to protect their pay, benefits, retirement security, and \n     health. Working families need and deserve Supreme Court \n     Justices who understand and respect the importance of hard-\n     fought rights and protections, not Justices who take an \n     unduly narrow view of the law, and of our rights. Judge \n     Alito's judicial philosophy is one that appears at odds with \n     workers' interests. Given the current composition of the \n     Supreme Court, and the absence of even a single Justice with \n     a worker advocacy background, we cannot afford to have the \n     Court further skewed against working families' interests.\n       In recent years, many cases have been decided in the \n     Supreme Court by a one-vote margin. The Supreme Court, \n     decided, by one-vote margins, two cases involving the \n     question of whether certain groups of workers were protected \n     under the National Labor Relations Act. Millions of state \n     employees were deprived of their ability to seek relief in \n     court under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act because of decisions decided by a one-vote \n     margin. The Court issued a decision restricting States in \n     their ability to adopt their own workplace safety laws, \n     again by a one-vote margin. By a one-vote margin, the \n     Supreme Court excused employers from having to pay backpay \n     when they are found to have discriminated against union \n     supporters who happen to be undocumented workers. The \n     importance of this nomination to the rights and \n     protections of working families is clear.\n\n  There is an excellent letter I received from AFSME. It points out:\n\n       As a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in \n     Philadelphia, Lilts's extreme views can be seen in his \n     rulings where he consistently limits Congress' authority to \n     enact\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\n     laws that protect the rights of workers and individuals. . . \n     .\n\n  Then it says:\n\n       In one such case, Alito denied a female police officer's \n     sexual harassment claims despite overwhelming evidence that \n     she had indeed been victimized.\n       Public employees also have not been spared under Judge \n     Alito. He wrote an opinion in a Pennsylvania case where he \n     stated that the Family and Medical Leave Act did not apply to \n     state employees. Rightfully so, the Supreme Court ruled in \n     disagreement with Alito, upholding the family care provision \n     of the FMLA. Several courts since then, including the very \n     conservative Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, have concluded \n     that state employees shall have access to the entire range of \n     protections under the FMLA, thus rejecting Alito's earlier \n     ruling.\n       Perhaps most disturbing about Judge Alito's judicial \n     philosophy is his narrow reading of our civil rights laws, \n     notably Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. . . .\n\n  It continues:\n\n       While Alito's 15 years as a Judge raises major concerns, \n     the time he spent as Presidential appointee in the Reagan \n     White House is equally disturbing. When Alito was a Justice \n     Department lawyer in the 1980s he urged President Reagan to \n     veto legislation that would have protected consumers from \n     crooked car dealers. . . .\n       Alito wrote that protecting Americans is not the federal \n     government's job. He said in his memo, ``After all, it is the \n     states, and not the federal government, that are charged with \n     protecting the health, safety and welfare of their citizens. \n     This philosophy is extremely harmful to state employees who \n     deserve to have federal worker protections apply to them as \n     well.\n\n  That is a letter from Mr. Gerald W. McEntee.\n  There is a similar letter from the United Auto Workers.\n  I ask unanimous consent those letters be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Whoever is confirmed to succeed Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor will have enormous power to affect Americans' daily lives. We \nhave a constitutional duty to ensure Justice O'Connor's successor has \ndemonstrated a core commitment to upholding the fundamental rights and \nfreedoms on which our Nation was founded.\n  Our decision whether to confirm a Supreme Court nominee affects the \nrights and freedoms not only of our generation, but those of our \nchildren and grandchildren as well.\n  The Court's decisions affect whether employees' rights will be \nprotected in the workplace. I have just referred to three letters that \nI have received. I have received many others that have been quite \nspecific, pointing out the different areas where the judge has \nbasically turned his back on the employees' rights and workers' rights.\n  They will affect the ability of Americans to be secure in their homes \nfrom unwarranted searches and seizures. They affect whether families \nwill be able to obtain needed medical care under their health insurance \npolicies. And they affect whether people will actually receive the \nretirement benefits they were promised. They affect whether people will \nbe free from discrimination in their daily lives. They affect whether \nAmericans' most private medical decisions will remain a family matter \nor will be subject to government interference. And they affect whether \nstudents will be given fair consideration when they apply to college. \nThey affect whether persons with disabilities will have access to \npublic facilities and programs. They affect whether we will have \nreasonable environmental laws that keep our air and water clean.\n  There they are. These are the issues which the Supreme Court has \nruled on very recently. We wonder about the Supreme Court Justices, \nwhat judgments and decisions are they making that are so important to \nthe average family. Why should an average family in America who is \nwatching this debate think this nominee and his decisions are going to \naffect them? That is a reasonable question.\n  Here you are. Employees, if you are a worker, you may question \nwhether employees' rights will be protected in the workplace. I have \njust outlined several examples where there have been Supreme Court \nJustices who have denied workers fair consideration.\n  The ability of Americans to be secure in their own homes from \nunwarranted searches and seizures, we went through the Groody case, \nJustice Alito permitting the strip-searching of a 10-year-old girl who \nwas clearly not included in the warrant that was approved by the judge. \nHe was criticized, not by those of us who have expressed reservations \nabout the nominee, but criticized by a judge on the Third Circuit, \ntalking about how Judge Alito's actions were out of order.\n  They affect whether families will be able to obtain medical care \nunder their health insurance policies. Remember the debates we had on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights? We had legislation that passed here, \npassed the House. We came very close to getting legislation--doesn't \neach HMO have to provide the types of coverage they have committed \nthemselves to or do they not? Does that violate ERISA or doesn't it \nviolate ERISA? These are important judgments. But it comes down to \nwhether individuals are going to get the health care coverage they \nthought they were going to get. That is going to be decided by the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  They affect whether people will actually receive the retirement \nbenefits they were promised. The retirement pensions are in free fall \nin the United States of America at the present time; absolutely free \nfall. They say for retirement you need to have your savings--that is \npart of it--you need the Social Security and Medicare, and you need to \nhave your retirement. Those are the three legs on the stool for a \ndignified retirement.\n  These are the issues involving pensions. We have now seen 700 pension \nfunds collapse over the period of the last 4 years, and $8 billion that \nworkers had put aside has effectively been lost. These issues will come \nup. What are the obligations of companies in order to pay back workers? \nThose issues eventually come before the Supreme Court--whole lifeline \nsavings. Those issues come up before the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from West Virginia who had been \nscheduled during this time. I have had an opportunity to speak \npreviously. There are some additional comments I would like to make, \nbut certainly the Senate looks forward to the words of the Senator from \nWest Virginia. I yield at this time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: The AFL-CIO, a federation of 53 national and \n     international unions representing over nine million working \n     women and men, has reviewed Judge Samuel Alito's record on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in cases of \n     importance to working families. Based on this review, we are \n     compelled to oppose his nomination to be an Associate Justice \n     on the United States Supreme Court.\n       As the enclosed memorandum explains more fully, Judge \n     Alito's decisions and dissents show a disturbing tendency to \n     take an extremely narrow and restrictive view of laws passed \n     by Congress to protect workers' rights, resulting in workers \n     being deprived of wage and hour, health and safety, anti-\n     discrimination, pension, and other important protections.

It is critical that Senators explore these and \n     other areas thoroughly at Judge Alito's upcoming confirmation \n     hearings in order to understand his views and his judicial \n     philosophy on these important issues.\n       Working families are struggling mightily against an assault \n     on our hard-won gains in the legislative arena and at the \n     bargaining table. Wages are being cut, pensions and health \n     benefits are being drastically reduced or eliminated and job \n     security is vanishing. Now more than ever, workers need the \n     protections offered to them under the laws passed by Congress \n     to protect their pay, benefits, retirement security, and \n     health.

Judge \n     Alito's judicial philosophy is one that appears to be at \n     odds with workers' interests. Given the current \n     composition of the Supreme Court, and the absence of even \n     a single justice with a worker advocacy background, we \n     cannot afford to have the Court\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\n     further skewed against working families' interests.\n       In recent years, many cases have been decided in the \n     Supreme Court by a one-vote margin.

The importance of this \n     nomination to the rights and protections of working families \n     is clear.\n       The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose Judge Alito's nomination \n     and to insist on a more moderate nominee with a record \n     demonstrating greater respect for workers' rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John J. Sweeney,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: Next month the Senate is expected to consider \n     the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate \n     Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Based on our review of his \n     past writings and judicial decisions, the UAW opposes his \n     confirmation.\n       While serving on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge \n     Alito's opinions have consistently reflected a narrow, \n     constricted interpretation of statutes protecting worker \n     rights. In particular, his opinions have excluded state \n     employees from coverage under the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act, denied overtime to newspaper reporters, vacated OSHA \n     citations, absolved corporate officers from liability for \n     unpaid wages, and exempted a company from having to notify \n     workers about an impending plant closing. He even issued a \n     solitary dissenting opinion that would have criminalized ``no \n     docking'' rules that have been a common industrial practice.\n       In addition, Judge Alito's opinions in race and gender \n     employment discrimination cases have reflected a restrictive \n     interpretation of civil rights laws that would make it much \n     more difficult for women and minorities to obtain remedies \n     when they are the victims of discrimiation. We are especially \n     troubled by Judge Alito's statement in a 1985 job application \n     that he was ``particularly proud'' of his work in the Reagan \n     Administration to restrict affirmative action and limit \n     remedies for racial discrimination. We are also disturbed by \n     his 1985 writings disagreeing with the concept of ``one man, \n     one vote''.\n       The UAW believes that nominees to the Supreme Court must \n     demonstrate that they hold views that are within the judicial \n     mainstream, and are committed to supporting the rights of \n     workers, minorities and women. Unfortunately, we believe that \n     Judge Alito fails to meet this essential test. Accordingly, \n     the UAW urges you to oppose his nomination to the Supreme \n     Court.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 2005.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.7 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), I am writing to announce our opposition to the \n     nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice \n     on the U.S. Supreme Court. We have reviewed his record and \n     determined that his views are far too extreme and out of the \n     mainstream of judicial philosophy. His presence on the \n     Supreme Court therefore would further divide the country and \n     disenfranchise even more average citizens and working \n     Americans.\n       We believe that working people who are already seeing their \n     rights and protections under attack would not fare well if \n     Judge Alito was elevated to the Supreme Court. Judge Alito \n     has authored a number of decisions and dissenting opinions \n     contrary to the rights of employees and individuals. Of \n     particular concern to our members is Judge Alito's \n     established practice of ``closing the court-room door'' to \n     victims of civil rights violations by substantially \n     increasing the burden of proof placed on plaintiffs prior to \n     their cases ever getting to a jury of his or her peers. In \n     evaluating plaintiffs' discrimination claims, he has also \n     repeatedly taken a high-handed approach in dismissing the \n     merit and weight of their evidence and has been chastised by \n     his colleagues on the Third Circuit for doing so.\n       As a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in \n     Philadelphia, Alito's extreme views can be seen in his \n     rulings where he consistently limits Congress' authority to \n     enact laws that protect the rights of workers and \n     individuals, including the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA) and the National Labor Relations Act. And, although the \n     majority of his fellow judges disagreed with him, Alito set a \n     standard so high that victims of sex discrimination would \n     find it virtually impossible to prove their case. In one such \n     case, Alito denied a female police officer's sexual \n     harassment claims despite overwhelming evidence that she had \n     indeed been victimized.\n       Public employees also have not been spared under Judge \n     Alito. He wrote an opinion in a Pennsylvania case where he \n     stated that the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) did not \n     apply to state employees. Rightfully so, the Supreme Court \n     ruled in disagreement with Alito, upholding the family care \n     provision of the FMLA. Several courts since then, including \n     the very conservative Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, have \n     concluded that state employees should have access to the \n     entire range or protections under the FMLA, thus rejecting \n     Alito's earlier ruling.\n       Perhaps most disturbing about Judge Alito's judicial \n     philosophy is his narrow reading of our civil rights laws, \n     notably Title VII of the Civil Right Act of 1964, which bars \n     various forms of discrimination in employment. Even when \n     plaintiffs in these cases come forward with substantial \n     evidence of title VII violation, Judge Alito voted--often in \n     dissent--to deny relief without even letting juries decide \n     whether discrimination occurred. In addition, in reviewing a \n     plaintiff's evidence, he has on several occasions improperly \n     assumed the role of jury or trial judge by casting judgment \n     on the weight and merits of the evidence and the credibility \n     of a witness' testimony.\n       As U.S. citizens, we are concerned on several other fronts \n     as well. Alito consistently ruled against victims of \n     discrimination based on a disability. His philosophy would \n     restrict Congress' power to enact disability rights laws and \n     few if any such cases would survive under Judge Alito. Also, \n     he ruled to significantly reduce the ability of citizens to \n     bring suit against polluters under the Clean Air Act.\n       While Alito's 15 years as a Judge raises major concerns, \n     the time he spent as a Presidential appointee in the Reagan \n     White House is equally disturbing. When Alito was a Justice \n     Department lawyer in the 1980s he urged President Reagan to \n     veto legislation that would have protected consumers from \n     crooked car dealers by making odometer fraud more difficult. \n     Alito wrote that protecting Americans is not the federal \n     government's job. He said in his memo, ``After all, it is the \n     states, and not the federal government, that are charged with \n     protecting the health, safety, and welfare of their \n     citizens.'' This philosophy is extremely harmful to state \n     employees who deserve to have federal worker protections \n     apply to them as well.\n       Judge Alito clearly is a staunch advocate of the federalism \n     movement which poses a tremendous threat to employees of \n     state governments. State and local governments, like private \n     sector companies and non-profit organizations, are also \n     employers. And, as employers they should be required to \n     adhere to the same laws and regulations that all other \n     employers are subject to. Unfortunately, Judge Alito and the \n     federalism movement seek to limit the power of the federal \n     government to protect individuals who happen to be employees \n     of state governments, in effect, making state employees \n     second class citizens.\n       We strongly urge the Senate to insist that all of the \n     relevant information about Judge Alito be released, \n     particularly the Solicitor General and the Office of Legal \n     Counsel memoranda. We believe that there are underlying \n     reasons why the Administration continues to resist releasing \n     this vital information.\n       Judge Alito's record is extremely troubling to AFSCME and \n     the workers we represent. He is one of the most extreme \n     federal judges in the whole country. If confirmed, Alito \n     would tilt the court further to the right and place in \n     jeopardy decades of progress protecting individual rights and \n     freedoms.\n       For the forgoing reasons, AFSCME strongly urges the Senate \n     to reject Judge Alito's nomination. President Bush should \n     nominate an individual that does not pose such an enormous \n     threat to the rights and freedoms of working men and women.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Gerald W. McEntee,\n                                          International President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, my \ncolleague and my friend, Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the minority is open until 5 \nminutes after 4 p.m. The Senator has 41 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to offer a few \nobservations on the manner in which the Senate has conducted its \ninquiry into the qualifications of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to serve \non the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Regardless of any Senator's particular view of Judge Alito, I think \nwe can all agree that there is room for improvement in the way in which \nthe Senate and, indeed, the Nation have undertaken the examination of \nthis\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\nnominee. Let me be clear. I mean no criticism of the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee or any particular member of that committee.\n  I feel compelled to address this issue, not to point fingers, not to \nscold, not to assign blame, but only to address specific, sincere, \nheartfelt concerns that have been brought to my attention, by the \npeople of West Virginia in particular. Many people, including foremost, \nas I say, the people of West Virginia, in no uncertain terms were, \nfrankly, appalled by the Alito hearings. I don't want to say it, but I \nmust. They were appalled.\n  In the reams of correspondence that I received during the Alito \nhearings, West Virginians--the people I represent--West Virginians who \nwrote to criticize the way in which the hearings were conducted used \nthe same two words. People with no connection to one another, people of \ndifferent faiths, different views, different opinions, independently \nand respectively, used the same two words to describe the hearings. \nThey called them an ``outrage'' and a ``disgrace.''\n  These were not form letters, ginned up by special interest groups on \neither the right or the left. These were handwritten, contemplative, \nold-fashioned letters written on lined paper and personal stationery. \nThey were the sort of letters that people write while watching \ntelevision, in the comfort of their living rooms, or sitting at the \nkitchen table.\n  It is especially telling that many who objected to the way in which \nthe Alito hearings were conducted do not support Judge Alito. In fact, \nit is sorely apparent that even many who opposed Judge Alito's \nnomination also opposed the seemingly ``made for TV'' antics that \naccompanied the hearings.\n  It is not just the Senate as an institution which is to blame. The \nvirulence of some outside groups from both sides of the political \nspectrum added fuel to the fire. Multimillion-dollar advertising \ncampaigns either to proclaim or to denigrate Judge Alito's fitness for \nthe position raged across the airwaves.\n  A solemn constitutional responsibility is not helped when it takes on \nsuch a tone.\n  And then there were the media and the media's contribution to the \ndeterioration of this very important constitutional process.\n  Was it necessary to subject Mrs. Alito to the harsh glare of the \ntelevision klieg lights as she fled the hearing room in tears, fighting \nto maintain her dignity in response to others with precious little of \ntheir own? Have we finally come to the point where our Nation's \nassessment of its Supreme Court nominee turns more on a simple-minded \nsound bite or an exploitive snapshot than on the answers provided or \nwithheld by the nominees?\n  Obviously, something is wrong with our judicial nomination process, \nand we in the Senate have the power to fix it.\n  The Framers of such a great document presumably had something better \nin mind when they vested the Senate with the authority to confirm \nJustices of the Supreme Court. In fact, we know they did. In 1789, \nRoger Sherman of Connecticut defended the role of the Senate in \nconfirming Presidential appointments. He wrote: It appears to me that \nthe Senate is the most important branch in the government . . . The \nExecutive magistrate is to execute the laws. The Senate, being a branch \nof the legislature, will naturally incline to have them duly executed \nand, therefore, will advise to such appointments as will best attain \nthe end.\n  Alexander Hamilton also had high hopes for the Senate's ability to \nrender its advice and consent function. He proclaimed: It is not easy \nto conceive a plan better calculated than this to promote a judicious \nchoice of men for filling the offices of the Union.\n  Exactly what did the Framers mean when they gave the Senate the power \nto ``consent'' to the confirmation of the judicial nominees?\n  Historically, a majority of the Framers anticipated that the Senate's \nconfirmation or rejection of a judicial nominee would be based on the \nfitness of the nominee, not on partisan politics or extraneous matters.\n  Based on these assumptions, the Framers presumably did not expect the \nSenate to spend its allotted time on a nominee staging partisan warfare \ninstead of examining his or her qualifications.\n  Yet the Framers probably also would never have expected that a \nSenator of a nominee's own party would refuse to ask the candidate \nmeaningful questions. They certainly did not intend for Senators of the \nnominee's own party to sit silently in quiet adulation, refusing to \nseek the truth, while smiling indulgently; thus, accomplishing nothing.\n  The Framers expected the Senate to be a serious check--a serious \ncheck--on the power of the President. The Framers clearly thought that \nthe Senate's confirmation process ought to be fair, ought to be \nimpartial, ought to be thorough, and ought to exhibit appropriate \nrespect for solemn duty and the dignity of both the process and the \nnominee.\n  I regret that we have come to a place in our history when both \npolitical parties--both political parties--exhibit such a ``take no \nprisoners'' attitude. All sides seek to use the debate over a Supreme \nCourt nominee to air their particular wish list for or against \nabortion, euthanasia, Executive authority, freedom of the press, \nfreedom of speech, wiretapping, the death penalty, workers' rights, gun \ncontrol, corporate greed, and dozens of other subjects. All of these \nissues should be debated, but the battle lines should not be drawn on \nthe judiciary. They should be debated by the people's representatives \nin the legislative branch.\n  However, too many Americans apparently believe that if they cannot \nget Congress to address an issue, then they must take it to the Court. \nAs the saying goes, ``If you can't change the law, change the judge.''\n  This kind of thinking represents a gross misinterpretation of the \nseparation of powers. It is the role of the Congress--the role of the \nlegislative branch--to make and change the laws. Supreme Court Justices \nexist to interpret laws and be sure that they square with the \nConstitution and with settled law.\n  A better understanding of the Court's role would do much to diminish \nthe ``hype'' that now accompanies the judicial nomination process. The \nrole of the Senate in the Alito debate is not to push legislation or to \nscore points for those who either support or oppose specific \nlegislative proposals. The purpose of the current debate is to evaluate \nthe fitness of Judge Samuel Alito to sit on the highest Court of our \nland, which includes his temperament, his intellectual ability, and his \nrecord.\n  In a perfect world, this heavy constitutional responsibility of the \nSenate would have little to do with party affiliation.\n  Unfortunately, during the first administration of George Washington, \nas far back as 1795, a bruising confirmation battle over the nomination \nof John Rutledge to be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \nestablished that the same Senators would consider not merely the \nqualifications but also the political views of a nominee in deciding \nwhether to support or reject his nomination.\n  I am a Senator who takes this Constitution seriously. I refuse simply \nto toe the party line when it comes to Supreme Court Justices. And I \nwill make up my own mind after careful contemplation. The President of \nthe United States said partly in jest that he wanted to call me to \nlobby me on the nomination. I said: Mr. President, I don't lobby very \neasily. I take my Constitutional duties seriously. I will listen to \nwhat anybody has to say, and then, Mr. President, I will make up my own \nmind.\n  I am a registered Democrat. Everybody knows that. But when it comes \nto judges, I hale from a conservative State. Similar to a majority of \nmy constituents, I prefer conservative judges. I have been saying that \nfor years and years. That is, judges who do not try to make the law.\n  I was once approached by President Richard Nixon to inquire about my \ninterest in being a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. I was proud to be \nconsidered. Whether I would have been nominated, I have no way of \nknowing. But as I said to my wife: I don't think I would like that \nposition. I would not like that kind of cloistered life. I like the \nrough-and-tumble of the legislative branch. She said: Then you had \nbetter let the President know that.\n  I said the same thing to Senator John Pastore, and he responded in \nthe same way. He said: You had better let the President know that.\n\n[[Page S180]]\n\n  I declined so that I might continue to serve the people of West \nVirginia, regardless of what the President may have in his heart and in \nhis mind. This is not to say that I would vote for any judge just \nbecause he is a conservative. No. No, sir. If I think a conservative \njudge is unqualified, I will not vote for him, nor would any other \nSenator vote for a nominee in that situation.\n  I have voted against judges on both sides of the political spectrum, \nwho leaned too heavily on their political views rather than on existing \nlaw, precedents and on the Constitution and who seemed to have a \npolitical agenda.\n  Much has been made of the fact that Judge Alito has expressed support \nof the concept of the ``unitary executive.'' Many are afraid his \nsupport for this concept means that he favors a broad expansion of \nPresidential power. And I shared some of that concern. Judge Alito, \nhowever, has stated repeatedly that his support for the concept of the \nunitary executive does not refer to broadening the scope of the power \nof the President.\n  Instead, Judge Alito says that this theory refers to the way in which \nthe President utilizes his existing power to faithfully execute the law \nas it applies to administrative agencies within the executive branch. \nIn describing the unitary executive in his speech before the Federalist \nSociety, Judge Alito stated article II, section 3 of the Constitution \nprovides that the President ``shall take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed.'' ``Thus,'' he said, ``the President has the power \nand the duty to supervise the way in which the subordinate executive \nbranch officials exercise the President's power of carrying Federal law \ninto execution.''\n  Before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Alito was asked point blank \nwhether he thought the concept of the unitary executive refers to \nexpanding the scope of Presidential power, or instead to the \nPresident's control over the executive branch. As I understood it, \nJudge Alito confirmed he was speaking of the latter.\n\n  Judge Alito was also asked whether he would support an expansion of \nthe scope of Presidential power. Specifically, he was asked if he \nthought the President should have more power than he is expressly given \nunder the Constitution and by law. Judge Alito stated several times \nthat he would not support that point of view, and he noted, again, that \nthe ``scope'' of the power of the President has nothing to do with the \nunitary executive.\n  I met with Judge Samuel Alito. I spent close to 2 hours with him. I \nasked him what he thought about the establishment clause and the free \nexercise clause and the power of the purse and the congressional power \nover the purse. I told him that I believed the Supreme Court has gone \ntoo far in prohibiting the free exercise of religion in this country. \nHe listened respectfully and said that he understood. He did not pledge \nto overrule precedent, but he made it clear that he understood and \nrespected my viewpoint.\n  I also advised him of my view that the executive branch is \ncontinually and improperly seeking to grab power, more power and more \npower, and that the separation of powers requires the judiciary to be \never vigilant in stopping the abuse of power by the President and in \nprotecting the powers of the other two branches.\n  I urged Judge Alito, as I urged Judge Roberts before him, to \nrecognize the importance of maintaining the equality of the three \nbranches of our Government, protected by our Constitution. I stressed \nthat he ought to be a Justice who will not forget the people's branch, \nthe legislative branch, the first branch, the primary branch mentioned \nin the Constitution under article I; the executive is mentioned later \non in article II.\n  I requested he not rule in a way that would expand the authority of \nan already expansionist executive. I reiterated that the Framers did \nnot place the greatest power in the executive but, instead, the Framers \nput the greatest power in the people--the people, like you and me. The \nfirst three words in the preamble of the Constitution are, we all know, \n``We, the People.'' The Framers ensured that the people, through us, \ntheir elected representatives in the Congress, would have the greatest \npower in our Government. In response, Judge Alito told me he respected \nthe separation of powers and would not rule in support of a power-\nhungry President. I liked that answer. I liked Judge Alito. He struck \nme as a man of his word, and I intend to vote for him.\n  I believe strongly that the Senate has a responsibility to provide \nits advice and consent with respect to a particular nominee based on \nthe merits or demerits of that nominee, not on focus groups, celebrity \nendorsements, binders filled with innuendo and slanted analysis or \nWhite House photo opportunities.\n  In truth, there is absolutely no way of knowing what any nominee for \nour Nation's highest Court will do after that nominee is confirmed. One \ncould cite many examples of Justices who surprised the President who \nnominated them, as well as the Members of the Senate who supported or \nopposed their confirmation. Once a man or woman has achieved the high \nhonor of a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court, a \ntransformation may occur. The awesome responsibility of protecting our \nConstitution and preserving the checks and balances for succeeding \ngenerations of Americans must elevate and sharpen one's judicial \ntemperament in profound ways. The duty to preserve the freedom of our \ncitizens as enshrined in our magnificent Bill of Rights must ennoble \neven an already noble mind and character.\n  In the end, the heavy duty borne by Members of the Senate to evaluate \nand reject or approve the President's nominees for the High Court \nshould come down to each Senator's personal judgment of the man or \nwoman before us, augmented, of course, by such judicial records and \nwritings as may exist. I may not know exactly what kind of Justice \nSamuel Alito will be. No one does. No one does. My considered judgment, \nfrom his record, from his answers to my own questions, from his obvious \nintelligence, and from his obvious sincerity, leads me to believe him \nto be an honorable man, a man who loves his country, loves the \nConstitution, and a man who will give of his best. Can we really ask \nfor more?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I will vote \nagainst Judge Samuel Alito's nomination for Associate Justice to the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  After reviewing his record, I believe Judge Alito will move the \nSupreme Court too far to the conservative side of American \njurisprudence. I believe Judge Alito's judicial philosophy will also \ndangerously increase Executive power, injuring the checks and balances \nbuilt into our Constitution that protect all of us. Judge Alito's \nconfirmation may roll back important civil rights protections, \nprotections which were achieved in our country through the sacrifices \nof many and are crucial to the future of the United States.\n  I hope, if Judge Alito is confirmed, history will prove my concerns \nwrong. But given his record, including his extensive written record, I \ncannot in good conscience support him.\n  I thank the Senate Judiciary Committee. It held fair, serious, and \ndignified hearings. Chairman Specter, Ranking Member Leahy, the members \nof the committee, and the majority and minority staff have again earned \nour gratitude.\n  Judge Alito's confirmation vote is particularly important for our \ncountry because this seat on our Supreme Court has been held by a \nchampion of justice and mainstream America for a quarter century: \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor. Our Nation owes Justice O'Connor a great \ndebt of gratitude. Justice O'Connor served as an exemplary role model \nfor all of us, including women succeeding at the very highest level of \nour National Government.\n  Unfortunately, this nomination signals an undesirable retreat from \ndiversity on the U.S. Supreme Court. Women make up more than half of \nthe people of our country. Yet women have been represented in the \nSupreme Court in our entire history for more than two centuries by only \ntwo female Justices--Justice O'Connor and Justice Ginsburg. Now Justice \nGinsburg is left to be the only role model on the Court for the hopes \nand aspirations of women and for all of us in America who believe that \nall men and all women are truly created equal.\n\n[[Page S181]]\n\n  I regret that result, especially after it was the radical right of \nAmerica that derailed the nomination of Harriet Miers. We all know \nthere are thousands of highly qualified women lawyers and judges across \nAmerica, and they could have provided exceptional service to the United \nStates on the Supreme Court. Regardless of the merits or demerits of \nJudge Alito, I am saddened, at the daybreak of the 21st century, that \nthe United States has retreated from a cause that rightfully embraces \nthe inevitability of the equality of women in our society.\n  Beyond the principle of gender diversity, Justice O'Connor \nconsistently defined the center of the Supreme Court on many issues. \nShe used her wisdom and her judgment to advance reasonable, \ncommonsense, and mainstream legal doctrines that affect the lives of \nall Americans. That is why the choice of the replacement for Justice \nO'Connor is so important for our collective future.\n  The confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is a solemn task. It is \namong the most important constitutional duties of the Senate. I have \nevaluated Judge Alito's qualifications using the same criteria I used \nto evaluate Chief Justice John Roberts for whom I voted. I have \nreviewed Judge Alito's record for evidence of his fairness, \nimpartiality, and his proven record of upholding the law. However, I \nhave decided that my concerns require that I vote against him.\n  My concerns with Judge Alito start with the 1985 memorandum he \nincluded with his job application to the White House. Judge Alito was \nthen 35 years old. To me, this document is a very powerful document. It \nis evidence of how Judge Alito the man views the law and the Supreme \nCourt. The document is very carefully written. It is packed full of \nJudge Alito's political and jurisprudential ideas which he has adhered \nto over the years. In that memorandum, Judge Alito declared he strongly \ndisagreed with the opinions of the Warren Court. Those opinions are now \nand then widely accepted. They encompass important constitutional \nprotections such as opinions on reapportionment in Baker v. Carr, the \ncase that established the principle of one person, one vote. They \nconcern well-established rules about the relationship between church \nand state. I find Judge Alito's views to be outside the mainstream of \nlegal thought in 1985.\n  Since that time, based upon his decisions as an appellate judge and \nin his other writings, Judge Alito has ruled consistently with the \nlegal philosophy he described in 1985. I believe that legal philosophy \nis wrong for our Nation. Specifically, I believe Judge Alito's legal \nphilosophy about the structure of our government under our Constitution \nwill harm our country if ultimately adopted by the Supreme Court.\n  The Framers of our Constitution were geniuses. They created a legal \nstructure for our country that has endured and prospered for more than \ntwo centuries. The Framers were not successful because they were \nabstract thinkers; they were successful because they were practical \nthinkers, practical Americans. The Framers knew human nature. Their \nview of human nature focused on the common frailties of people placed \nin positions of great power, human desires to gather more power, human \ntendencies to credit one particular view of the world above all others, \nand a very human unwillingness to understand the perspectives of \nothers.\n  Out of their genius, the Framers created a system of checks and \nbalances. The Framers made rules which require that the power must be \nshared. They created a system with three coequal branches. They then \ndistributed the powers of Government among and within the three \nbranches. They created a system with explicit and implicit limits for \nthe power of each branch. They created a system where the people who \ngovern the United States are in constant tension with and against each \nother, always limiting and checking excesses that are all too human.\n  Judge Alito's judicial philosophy will diminish our system of checks \nand balances. He will expand the powers of the executive branch to an \nextent that is dangerous to us all. I believe Judge Alito would grant \nthe Executive power to overwhelm the congressional and judicial \nbranches.\n  Let me cite a few examples from his record.\n  First, I am troubled by Judge Alito's 1984 brief in the Mitchell case \nin which he asserted absolute immunity for high Government officials \naccused of illegal wiretapping.\n  I am troubled by his support in 1986 for the idea that Presidential \nsigning statements--a President's remarks accompanying the signing of a \nbill--can change the intent of Congress, which debated and passed the \nbill into law. A President executes the law; a President does not \nrewrite or alter the law.\n  I am troubled by Judge Alito's firm belief in a unitary executive--in \nan unwillingness to acknowledge checks and balances that exist within \nthe executive branch itself.\n  I am troubled by Judge Alito's pattern of great deference to the \nexecutive branch. Judge Alito's judicial philosophy in this area is \nparticularly striking against the backdrop of current events. The \ncurrent administration has adopted a widespread, concerted legal \nstrategy to increase Executive power under our Constitution. It is \nwrongly pushing beyond the well-established edges of Executive power in \nmany cases, based on a carefully calculated position that the current \nconcentration of political power allows the executive branch to \ntranscend the rule of law. This is not a ``strict construction'' of our \nConstitution; it is the opposite. It is an activist legal strategy to \nexpand beyond reason our constitutional law that has served our country \nvery well for more than 200 years.\n  Let me be clear. My concerns are not based exclusively on my view of \nthe current President or my ideas about how he would or would not wield \ndominant Executive power. We are talking about changes in the Court \nthat could affect our Government for decades, as Presidents of both \nparties take office and govern.\n  Dominant Executive power is not a ``safe bet'' for anyone, regardless \nof one's views of the current President. When considering a potential \nSupreme Court Justice, we must look beyond the politics of our time and \nwe must protect the basic structure, the system of checks and balances \namong coequal branches. Administrations of varied ideology and vision \nmust recognize that system of checks and balances.\n  I briefly want to turn to civil rights.\n  When I rose on this floor on September 27 of last year to speak on \nbehalf of Chief Justice Roberts, I spoke of the ``age of diversity'' in \nthis country. I spoke of this country's long history of slavery and our \nlengthy struggles--including our own Civil War--to put behind us the \nunequal treatment of our citizens.\n  I talked about Brown v. Board of Education and the central role our \nSupreme Court played to guide our country on to the path of equality \nand equal treatment for all. I spoke of the growing diversity of people \nin our country, and of the need to foster all the powerful strengths \nour diversity brings to our Nation--a richness of cultures and spirit, \na wealth of ideas, and a widely varied community bound together by the \ncommon values of truth, honesty, and fair dealing among ourselves.\n  My life experiences and my years of public service convince me that \nrecognizing and encouraging the strengths of diversity is the true \nconstitutional path for our country. I also believe in the very \npractical wisdom of this approach. In fact, I believe it is the only \nway our country will thrive and prosper over the long run. I will vote \nagainst Judge Alito because I am convinced he is unlikely to support \nthese principles of diversity.\n  Here is only a small part of the evidence that Judge Alito will lead \nour Nation in the wrong direction on issues of equal opportunity and \ndiversity:\n  In Riley v. Taylor, Judge Alito was overturned by the entire Third \nCircuit when he, alone, concluded it was proper to exclude all Black \njurors from sitting in judgment of a Black man.\n  In Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours, Judge Alito registered the \nlone dissent among 13 judges, voting to prevent a woman who had \npresented evidence of employment gender discrimination from going to \ntrial.\n  In PIRG of New Jersey, Judge Alito again denied access to the courts \nfor a group of environmental plaintiffs who had won below.\n  In Doe v. Groody, Judge Alito would have upheld the strip search of a \n10-\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\nyear-old girl, denying her access to relief in the courts.\n  And in Chittester, Judge Alito would have precluded State employees \nfrom seeking damages in court under the Federal Medical Leave Act.\n  Analyses discussed during the Judiciary Committee hearing show Judge \nAlito almost never ruled for African Americans in employment \ndiscrimination cases. Analyses also show Judge Alito rarely sided with \nindividuals in their cases against large and powerful institutions and \ncorporate interests.\n  I believe Judge Alito will continue to rule that way on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. I think that is wrong because it will usher in an era of \ninsensitivity to the weakest and the poorest among us. I hope and I \npray I am wrong.\n  In conclusion, I believe Judge Alito will move the Supreme Court too \nfar to the conservative side of American legal jurisprudence. Judge \nAlito's judicial philosophy will dangerously increase Executive power, \ninjuring the checks and balances built into our Constitution to protect \nus all.\n  And Judge Alito's confirmation will roll back important civil rights \nprotections--protections that were achieved in our country through the \nsacrifices of many and which are critical to our Nation's future.\n  I, therefore, will vote against this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in \nthe Record concerning Judge Alito. One is a letter from the League of \nUnited Latin American Citizens, and the other is a letter from the \nColorado Hispanic Bar Association, in which they raise their opposition \nto the confirmation of Judge Alito.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  League of United\n\n\n                                      Latin American Citizens,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 2006.\n     Re Nomination of Samuel A. Alito to the United States Supreme \n         Court\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We write to you as representatives of the \n     millions of American members of the immigrant, Latino, and \n     faith communities who are extraordinarily concerned about the \n     nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. We \n     believe that all Americans should be able to count on the \n     Supreme Court to uphold their rights, opportunities, and \n     legal protections, and we are worried that Judge Alito's \n     record demonstrates that millions of Americans would not be \n     able to count on him or the Court if he were confirmed.\n       While we have many concerns about Judge Alito's record, we \n     are especially troubled by recent reports that Judge Alito, \n     during his time in the Reagan administration, contended that \n     undocumented immigrants and nonresident aliens from other \n     countries have limited or ``no due process rights'' under the \n     Constitution. Judge Alito advocated this view in a memo he \n     wrote in 1986 regarding FBI activities. In a Nov. 29 \n     Washington Post article that focused on this 1986 document, \n     even the very conservative constitutional analyst Bruce Fein, \n     who served with Judge Alito in the Reagan administration, \n     seemed surprised by how extreme Judge Alito's position was. \n     ``He seems to be saying that there is no constitutional \n     constraints [sic] placed on U.S. officials in their treatment \n     of nonresident aliens or illegal aliens,'' Fein told the \n     Post. ``Could you shoot them? Could you torture them? . . . \n     It's a very aggressive reading of cases that addressed much \n     narrower issues.''\n       This is part of a deeply disturbing pattern of rulings and \n     memos from Judge Alito's record indicating that he gives \n     great deference to the government's police powers and shows \n     little concern for protecting the rights of individuals. He \n     has tried to make it harder for people who believe they have \n     faced discrimination on the job to even have their case heard \n     in court. He has seen no problem in some cases with racial \n     discrimination on juries--or with keeping Spanish speakers \n     off juries in a case where some evidence was in Spanish. He \n     has also tried to undermine the Family and Medical Leave Act, \n     which allows people to keep their jobs and take care of \n     family members in need.\n       Three times, President Bush has passed up the opportunity \n     to nominate a Latino to the Supreme Court. At the very least, \n     we had hoped he would avoid nominating someone hostile to the \n     basic interests of our communities, but it appears Judge \n     Alito may be such a nominee. That Judge Alito has actually \n     expressed views so extreme that they would deprive many \n     immigrants of basic human rights is extremely troublesome. \n     Such views are legally wrong, and they run counter to our \n     basic moral values.\n       Our rights are too important to entrust to someone who has \n     seemingly indicated he thinks they don't exist. We urge you \n     to hold Judge Alito responsible for his views, and to take \n     our strong concerns into account when you vote on whether to \n     confirm him to the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n       Center for New Community.\n       Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.\n       Hispanic Federation.\n       The PRLDEF Institute for Puerto Rican Policy.\n       Latino Caucus in Official Relations with the American \n     Public Health Association.\n       Labor Council for Latin American Advancement.\n       League of United Latin American Citizens.\n       National Farm Workers Ministries.\n       National Hispanic Environmental Council.\n       National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.\n       National Latina-o Law Students Association.\n       National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.\n       National Day Laborers Organizing Network.\n       SisterSong Women of Color.\n       Reproductive Health Collective.\n       United Farm Workers of America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       CHBA, Colorado Hispanic Bar\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                                 January 10, 2006.\n     Senator Ken Salazar,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Salazar: The Colorado Hispanic Bar Association \n     (CHBA), expresses its opposition to the confirmation of \n     Samuel Alito as Associate Justice of the United States \n     Supreme Court. After review of his opinions written during \n     his tenure on the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Third Circuit, the CHBA is concerned that Judge Alito has not \n     displayed sufficient respect for two fundamental legal \n     principles: (1) the role of the jury to resolve disputed \n     questions of fact; and (2) the restraints that stare decisis \n     imposes upon a judge's decision-making. Both of these \n     principles recognize the important--but limited--role that an \n     individual judge plays in our justice system. Judge Alito's \n     resistance to these tenets is troubling and counsels against \n     his confirmation to the highest court in the land. Although a \n     detailed discussion of Judge Alito's writings is beyond, thee \n     scope of this message, the CHBA offers a few examples to \n     illustrate its concerns.\n       In a 1996 case brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964, an employee alleged that her employer had \n     discriminated against her on the basis of sex. Sheridan v. \n     E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 100 F.3d 1061 (3rd Cir. 1996). \n     At issue was the minimum evidentiary showing the plaintiff \n     must make in order to permit the jury to decide her case. All \n     of the reviewing judges agreed that the plaintiff had \n     presented both a prima facie case of illegal discrimination \n     and enough evidence to permit the jury to disbelieve the \n     employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reason (for the \n     adverse employment action) as merely a pretext. In an en banc \n     proceeding, the Third Circuit held, by an 11-to-1 vote, that \n     the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to permit the \n     jury's verdict in her favor to stand. The court emphasized \n     that ``determining whether the inference of discrimination is \n     warranted must remain within the province of the jury . . . \n     not the court.'' Id. at 1071-72. Alone among the 12 judges, \n     Judge Alito dissented and expressed an extreme view of the \n     plaintiff's evidentiary burden, requiring something akin to \n     the largely discredited ``pretext-plus'' requirement. Id. at \n     1070, 1078-88. Rather than defer to the jury's role as \n     factfinder, Judge Alito would have thrown out the jury's \n     verdict and granted judgment as a matter of law to the \n     employer.\n       In another Title VII case, Judge Alito, again in dissent, \n     showed similar disregard for the jury's role, voting to keep \n     the case from the jury. Bray v. Marriott Hotels, 110 F.3d 986 \n     (3rd Cir. 1997). Referring to Judge Alito's analysis of the \n     evidence, the majority of the court explained that a \n     ``factfinder may well agree with that interpretation, but \n     that is not for us to decide.'' Id. at 992. His fellow judges \n     also found that ``Title VII would be eviscerated'' under \n     Judge Alito's analysis of the law. Id. at 993.\n       Moreover, Judge Alito has displayed a tendency to disregard \n     stare decisis (adherence to the rule announced in prior \n     cases). For example, in a death penalty case, the en banc \n     Third Circuit granted the defendant a writ of habeas corpus \n     because the prosecution had violated the Equal Protection \n     Clause by striking black jurors on account of their race. \n     Riley v. Taylor, 277 F.3d 261 (3rd Cir. 2001). The court \n     noted that its analysis was guided by several prior opinions. \n     See id. at 290. Judge Alito dissented again. According to his \n     colleagues, Judge Alito, rather than following precedent, \n     ``accord[ed] little weight to these authorities.'' Id. The \n     court also took issue with Judge Alito's attempt to analogize \n     the statistical evidence of the use of peremptory challenges \n     to strike black jurors to the percent of left-handed \n     presidents. Id. at 292. The Third Circuit found that Judge \n     Alito had ``overlooked the obvious fact that there is no \n     provision in the Constitution that protects persons from \n     discrimination based on whether they are right-handed or \n     left-handed.'' Id. Further, his fellow judges found that \n     Judge Alito had\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\n     ``minimize[d] the history of discrimination against \n     prospective black jurors and black defendants which was the \n     raison d'etre of the [U.S. Supreme Court decision barring the \n     use of peremptory challenges on the basis of race].'' Id.\n       These are but a few examples of Judge Alito's seeming \n     reluctance to recognize the limits of stare decisis and his \n     willingness to invade the jury's province. Judge Alito's \n     opinions reveal a consistent and discomforting inclination to \n     arrogate undue authority to individual judges such as \n     himself. Judge Alito' s activist streak stands in sharp \n     contrast to the cautious pragmatism of Justice Sandra Day \n     O'Connor, whom he would replace on the Court.\n       The CHBA is particularly troubled by the addition of Judge \n     Alito's unrestrained view of judicial authority to a Supreme \n     Court on which Hispanics are not represented. Given that the \n     Hispanic community has no direct voice on the Court, \n     Hispanics should be very concerned if the Court were to \n     embark on an era in which it feels free to upset settled law \n     and to assume new powers within our justice system. Hispanics \n     expect this institution to operate within the well-recognized \n     limits on its authority. Accordingly, unless and until Judge \n     Alito sufficiently addresses the concerns outlined herein, \n     the CHBA opposes his elevation to the United States Supreme \n     Court.\n       Thank you for your kind consideration of our message as you \n     perform the Senate's constitutional duty to evaluate \n     carefully the nominees to the Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Victoria Lovato,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, making a decision on a Supreme Court \nnomination is truly among the most important responsibilities of the \nSenate. I have given the nominations the President has sent to us in \nthe past 6 months serious and careful consideration.\n  The scrutiny to be applied to a President's nominee to the Supreme \nCourt is the highest of any nomination. I have voted for executive \nbranch appointees, and even for court of appeals nominees, whom I would \nnot necessarily vote to put on the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court, alone among our courts, has the power to revisit \nand reverse its precedents, and so I believe that anyone who sits on \nthat Court must not have a preset agenda to reverse precedents with \nwhich he or she disagrees and must recognize and appreciate the awesome \npower and responsibility of the Court to do justice when other branches \nof Government infringe on or ignore the freedoms and rights of all \ncitizens.\n  This is not a new standard. It is the same standard I applied to the \nnomination of Chief Justice Roberts. In that case, after careful \nconsideration, I decided to vote in favor of the nomination. In the \ncase of Judge Samuel Alito, after the same careful consideration, I \nmust vote no.\n  Judge Alito has an impressive background and a very capable legal \nmind, but I have grave concerns about how he would rule on cases \ninvolving the application of the Bill of Rights in a time of war. Some \nof the most important cases that the Supreme Court will consider in the \ncoming years will involve the Government's conduct of the fight against \nterrorism. It is critical that we have a strong and independent Supreme \nCourt to evaluate these issues and to safeguard the rights and freedoms \nof Americans in the face of enormous pressures.\n  Confronted with an executive branch that has jealously claimed every \npossible authority that it can, and then some, the Supreme Court must \ncontinue to assert its constitutional role as a critical check on \nExecutive power. Just how ``critical'' that check is has been made \nclear over the past few weeks, as Americans have learned that the \nPresident thinks his Executive power permits him to violate explicit \ncriminal statutes by spying on Americans without a court order.\n  With the executive and the legislature at loggerheads, we may well \nneed the Supreme Court to have the final word in this matter. In times \nof constitutional crisis, the Supreme Court can tell the executive it \nhas gone too far, and require it to obey the law. Yet Judge Alito's \nrecord and testimony strongly suggest that he would do what he has done \nfor much of his 15 years on the bench: defer to the executive branch in \ncase after case at the expense of individual rights.\n  Although he has not decided cases dealing with the Bill of Rights in \nwartime, he has a very long record on the bench of ruling in favor of \nthe government and against individuals in a variety of contexts. \nIndeed, this is an important distinction between Judge Alito and Chief \nJustice Roberts. Our new Chief Justice had a very limited judicial \nrecord before his nomination. Judge Alito has an extensive record. \nThere is no better evidence of what kind of Justice he will be on the \nSupreme Court than his record as a court of appeals judge. He told us \nthat himself.\n  A whole series of analyses by law professors and news organizations \nhas shown that Judge Alito is very deferential toward the government, \nand one detailed analysis by the Washington Post concluded that he is \nmore deferential than his Third Circuit colleagues and even than \nRepublican-appointed appeals judges nationwide. This vividly \ndemonstrates the concern I have about this nomination. Judge Alito is \nnot simply a conservative judge appointed by a conservative President. \nHis record is that of a jurist with a clear inclination to rule in \nfavor of the government and against individual rights.\n  In particular, Judge Alito's record in fourth amendment cases shows a \nrecurring pattern. In almost every fourth amendment case in which Judge \nAlito wrote an opinion, he either found no constitutional violation or \nargued that the violation should not prevent the illegally obtained \nevidence from being used. In more than a dozen dissents in criminal or \nfourth amendment cases, not once did Judge Alito argue for greater \nprotection of individual rights than the majority.\n  In one case that he was asked about on several occasions at his \nhearing, Judge Alito, in dissent, argued that the strip search of a 10-\nyear-old girl and her mother passed constitutional muster, even though \nthey were not suspected of any crime or specifically mentioned in the \nsearch warrant. Judge Alito's answers to questions at the hearing about \nthis case only reinforced concerns identified by outside scholars that \nhe seems to ignore the serious interests of privacy and personal \ndignity protected by the fourth amendment and instead relies on \ntechnical readings of warrants so that he can authorize the government \naction.\n  Cases challenging government power comprise nearly half of the \ncurrent Supreme Court's docket. A Supreme Court Justice should protect \nindividual freedoms against government intrusion where justified, and, \nspecifically, should appreciate that the fourth amendment serves to \nlimit government power. As Yale Law School Professor Ronald Sullivan \ntestified:\n       In the United States, perhaps no right is more sacred--more \n     worthy of vigilant protection--than the right of each and \n     every individual to be free from government interference \n     without the ``unquestionable'' authority of the law. Judge \n     Alito . . . shows an inadequate consideration for the \n     important values that underwrite these norms of individual \n     liberty--the very norms upon which this constitutional \n     democracy relies for its sustenance. . . . [T]his Senate's \n     decision on whether to consent to Judge Alito's nomination \n     will profoundly impact how liberty is realized in the United \n     States.\n\n  At the hearing, I and many other Senators repeatedly asked Judge \nAlito whether the President can violate a clear statutory prohibition, \nsuch as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the ban on \ntorture. He never answered the question. He returned again and again to \na formulaic response that told us nothing at all: he said that the \nPresident must follow the Constitution and must follow the laws that \nare consistent with the Constitution. Any first-year law student could \ntell you that. That kind of stock phrase, which Judge Alito repeated \nover and over, tells us absolutely nothing about his view of whether \nthe President can, consistent with the Constitution, violate a criminal \nlaw.\n  Judge Alito did point to Justice Jackson's three-part analysis in \nYoungstown. That is an appropriate framework, but merely citing \nYoungstown doesn't tell you anything about how he would apply that \nframework. Even when presented with the alarming hypothetical of \nwhether a President can authorize a murder in the United States, Judge \nAlito would say no more.\n  These practiced and opaque responses gave me no reassurance about \nJudge Alito's views on these issues. What troubled me even more was \nthat he repeatedly, and in some cases gratuitously, raised issues of \njusticiability\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\nand the political question doctrine--that is, he seemed to question \nwhether the courts can even weigh in on these serious legal battles \nbetween the legislature and the executive. Although he said he thought \nthe courts could address questions involving individual rights, Judge \nAlito's instinct in discussing these historic issues was to focus on \nwhether the courts even had a role to play. It wasn't to talk about the \ngravity of the issues at stake for our system of government, but to \nquestion whether he as a judge could even participate in the resolution \nof such critical constitutional conflicts.\n  I found that very disturbing, and it has played a significant role in \nmy decision to vote against him. Judge Alito's record and his testimony \nhave led me to conclude that his impulse to defer to the executive \nbranch would make him a dangerous addition to the Supreme Court at a \ntime when cases involving executive overreaching in the name of \nfighting terrorism are likely to be such an important part of the \nCourt's work.\n  I am also concerned about Judge Alito's record and testimony on cases \ninvolving the death penalty. The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in \ndeath penalty cases. Judge Alito participated in five death penalty \ncases that resulted in split panels, and in every single one of those \nhe voted against the death row inmate. A Washington Post analysis found \nthat he ruled against defendants and for the government in death \npenalty cases significantly more often than other judges. And his \ntestimony gave me no reason to believe that he will approach these \ncases any differently as a Supreme Court Justice.\n  To be blunt, I found Judge Alito's answers to questions about the \ndeath penalty to be chilling. He focused almost entirely on procedures \nand deference to state courts, and didn't appear to recognize the \nextremely weighty constitutional and legal rights involved in any case \nwhere a person's life is at stake.\n  I was particularly troubled by his refusal to say that an individual \nwho went through a procedurally perfect trial, but was later proven \ninnocent, had a constitutional right not to be executed. The \nConstitution states that no one in this country will be deprived of \nlife without due process of law. It is hard to even imagine how any \nprocess that would allow the execution of someone who is known to be \ninnocent could satisfy that requirement of our Bill of Rights. I \npressed Judge Alito on this topic but rather than answering the \nquestion directly or acknowledging how horrific the idea of executing \nan innocent person is, or even pointing to the House v. Bell case \ncurrently pending in the Supreme Court on a related issue, Judge Alito \nmechanically laid out the procedures a person would have to follow in \nState and Federal court to raise an innocence claim, and the procedural \nbarriers the person would have to surmount.\n  Judge Alito's record and response suggest that he analyzes death \npenalty appeals as a series of procedural hurdles that inmates must \novercome, rather than as a critical backstop to prevent grave \nmiscarriages of justice. The Supreme Court plays a very unique role in \ndeath penalty cases, and Judge Alito left me with no assurance that he \nwould be able to review these cases without a weight on the scale in \nfavor of the government.\n  One important question that I had about Judge Alito was his view on \nthe role of precedent and stare decisis in our legal system. At his \nhearing, while restating the doctrine of stare decisis, Judge Alito \nrepeatedly qualified his answers with the comment that stare decisis is \nnot an ``inexorable command.'' While this is most certainly true, his \ninsistence on qualifying his answers with this formulation was \ntroubling. Combined with a judicial record in which fellow judges have \ncriticized his application of precedent in several cases, Judge Alito's \nrecord and testimony do not give me the same comfort I had with Chief \nJustice Roberts that he has the respect for and deference to precedent \nthat I would like to see in a Supreme Court Justice.\n\n  With respect to reproductive rights, Judge Alito said that he would \nlook at any case with an ``open mind.'' That promise, however, is not \nreassuring given his prior denunciations of Roe, his legal work to \nundermine Roe, and his failure to disavow the strong legal views he had \nexpressed in the 1980s when given the opportunity at his hearing. In \nhis 1985 Justice Department job application, Judge Alito wrote that he \nbelieved that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion, \nand, as an Assistant to the Solicitor General, he wrote a memo \nadvocating a strategy for the Reagan administration to chip away at Roe \nv. Wade, with the ultimate goal of overturning that decision. Since he \nrefused to say that he changed his mind, despite numerous chances, one \ncan only think that he still believes what he said in 1985. And his \nopinions as a Third Circuit judge raise a legitimate concern that he \nwill, if given the opportunity, be inclined to narrow reproductive \nrights.\n  I want also to say a brief word about ethics. The Vanguard case could \nhave been disposed of fairly easily if Judge Alito had only admitted \nhis mistake up front. Under questioning, Judge Alito finally admitted \nthat there is no evidence that he followed through on his 1990 promise \nto the Judiciary Committee to recuse himself from any cases involving \nVanguard. He also said that some of the explanations that he and his \nsupporters gave for his failure to recuse from the Vanguard case in \n2002--such as a ``computer glitch'' or the fact that his promise to the \ncommittee was somehow time-limited--were not in fact the true reasons \nthat he failed to recuse himself from the 2002 case.\n  While I am not basing my vote on this matter, it continues to trouble \nme. First, it is not clear to me that Judge Alito took his 1990 promise \nto the Judiciary Committee seriously. Second, Judge Alito failed to \nclear up the inconsistent explanations before or at the outset of his \nhearing, even after documents revealed that those explanations were \nimplausible and even though he knew that they were not the real reasons \nthat he failed to recuse himself in 2002.\n  The concept of recusal, which recognizes that from time to time the \npublic might reasonably believe that judges' biases or interests may \ncast doubt on the integrity of a judicial decision, is part of ensuring \ndue process and protecting the public's confidence in the integrity of \nour system of justice. Despite numerous other reports of Judge Alito's \nhonesty and integrity, I am not satisfied that he appreciates the \nimportance of recusal.\n  His written answer to my question about how he would analyze recusal \nmotions related to the Third Circuit judges who testified on his behalf \nraises concerns about his approach to conflicts of interest. Judge \nAlito wrote that he thinks Supreme Court Justices have ``less latitude \nto err on the side of recusal'' than other judges, because recusal \ncould lead to evenly divided decisions. But when Congress amended the \nFederal recusal law in 1974, it specifically removed any so-called \n``duty to sit'' in favor of a general standard requiring recusal if \nthere is a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality. The \npurpose of that change was to enhance public confidence in the \nimpartiality and fairness of the judicial system. In my view, Supreme \nCourt Justices should have no more latitude in interpreting ethics \nrules than other judges; indeed, the recusal statute specifically \napplies to Supreme Court Justices.\n  I would argue that treating recusal issues seriously is even more \nimportant for Supreme Court Justices since they are solely responsible \nfor their recusal decisions. There is no judicial review of their \ndecisions, no formal procedure for the full Court review of such \ndecisions, and, when a Justice improperly participates, a tainted \nconstitutional decision cannot be undone. That is why it is so \nimportant to have Justices who adhere to the highest ethical standards. \nJudge Alito repeatedly told us that he seeks to carry out his duties in \naccordance with both the letter and spirit of all applicable rules of \nethics and canons of conduct. He wrote in a letter to the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee: ``[M]y personal practice is to recuse myself \nwhen any possible question might arise.'' Unfortunately, his \ndescription of how he would handle recusal motions as a Supreme Court \nJustice does not seem consistent with those statements.\n  It gives me no pleasure or satisfaction to vote against a nominee to \nthe Supreme Court. If confirmed, he may well serve for over 20 years. I \nwould very much like to have confidence that\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\nthis new Justice, who plainly has a keen legal mind, would be the kind \nof impartial, objective, and wise Justice that our Nation needs. But I \ndo not, so I will vote no.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there is no higher legal authority in \nthe United States than the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the final arbiter \non the meaning of laws and the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court \ngives meaning to the scope of the right of privacy; whether Vermont's \nlimits on campaign contributions and spending are constitutional; what \nis an unreasonable search and seizure; how expansive the power of the \nPresident can be; and whether Congress exceeded its power in passing a \nlaw.\n  A Supreme Court Justice could serve for the life of the nominee, thus \nthe consequences of confirming a Supreme Court justice last well beyond \nthe term of the President who makes the nomination, a Senator's term, \nand maybe even the Senator's own life. Therefore, one of the most \nimportant votes a Senator takes is the confirmation of a U.S. Supreme \nCourt Justice.\n  I have carefully considered the appointment of Judge Samuel Alito to \nthe Supreme Court and have concluded I cannot support his nomination.\n  My first step in evaluating a nominee is to consider whether the \nnominee is appropriately qualified and capable of handling the position \nfor which he or she has been nominated. Looking over Judge Alito's \nqualifications, it is clear this minimum standard has been met. Judge \nAlito has served in the U.S. Department of Justice, has been a U.S. \nAttorney, and for the last 15 years has been a judge on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals. However, while I use this minimum standard in \nmy evaluation of executive branch nominees, there are additional \nfactors to be considered in my evaluation of a judicial nominee.\n  The Framers of our Constitution recognized the limits of democracy \nand created three coequal branches of government. They realized that \npassion and whim could cause the elected representatives to enact \nlegislation on the cause of the day, which treads near or on \nconstitutional rights. In addition, while the diversity of Congress can \nstop most of these ideas before they are adopted, no such check exists \non the executive branch of our government. Thus, the third branch of \ngovernment, the judiciary, was created. This branch was to be \nindependent, unaffected by the public's whim and opinion, and serving \nthe law and the public.\n  The Framers split the responsibility of filling the judiciary between \nthe executive and legislative branches. The President nominates an \nindividual to be a judge, while the Senate has the duty to advise and \nconsent on each nominee. This framework was established to ensure that \nthe executive branch could not exercise so much control over the \nnominating process that the judiciary would lose its independence and \nbecome ideologically driven.\n  While the Senate's duty is to evaluate a nominee, the Constitution \nprovides no guidance as to what exactly Senators should take into \naccount. This decision is up to each individual Senator. I have already \ntouched on one factor I consider, ``qualified and capable of handling \nthe duties of the position.''\n  An additional consideration is the judicial philosophy of the \nnominee. Many of my colleagues argue that this factor should have no \npart in the Senate's consideration of a nominee to the Supreme Court. \nHowever, if judicial philosophy is the determining factor in the choice \nthe President makes from a list of many qualified candidates, the \nSenate should also be allowed to consider this factor when deciding \nwhether to approve or disapprove the nominee. Not allowing the Senate \nto consider this factor would shift the careful balance the Framers put \nin our Constitution away from equal partners toward giving the \nexecutive branch an unfair advantage.\n  In addition to considering the individual's judicial philosophy as a \nstand-alone matter, we must also consider the cumulative effect our \napproving a nominee will have on the Supreme Court. In the recent past, \nRepublican Presidents have made 15 of the last 17 nominations to the \nSupreme Court. The Republican stamp on the current Court is undeniable. \nConsider the prospects for the Court in the coming years based on the \nages of the sitting Justices and their years of service:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Justice                   Date of birth        Current age       Years on court    Appointment age\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStevens..........................

Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for \noffering an important resolution on Cambodia yesterday that expressed \nconcern with the systematic campaign by Prime Minister Hun Sen and the \nGovernment of Cambodia to undermine democracy and the rule of law in \nthat country.\n  Scholars can argue when this campaign was initiated--after U.N.-\nsponsored elections in 1993 or before the coup d'etat in 1997--but no \none disputes that it culminated early this year in the arrest of human \nrights leader Kem Sokha and other reformers in Phnom Penh on charges of \ndefaming the Prime Minister.\n  As the resolution points out, no sector in Cambodia has been spared \nin this campaign.\n  Opposition leader Sam Rainsy was stripped of his parliamentary \nimmunity last year and sentenced to 18 months in absentia for defaming \nthe Prime Minister.\n  Radio journalist Mom Sonando was arrested for criminal defamation.\n  Even Rong Chhum, president of the Cambodian Independent Teachers \nAssociation, was similarly charged.\n  To be sure, other champions of freedom in Cambodia have suffered \nworse fates. Former parliamentarian Om Radsady and labor leader Chea \nVichea were brutally murdered by unknown assailants. Justice remains \nsimilarly elusive for a grenade attack against a conference hosted by \nthe Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party in 1995 and a more brutal attack \nagainst a peaceful rally organized by the Khmer Nation Party--headed by \nSam Rainsy--in 1997.\n  The immediate and strong condemnation of the arrest of Sokha and his \ncolleagues by international donors and multilateral organizations, \nincluding the United Nations and the World Bank, is certainly welcomed. \nU.S. Ambassador Joe Mussomeli and Deputy Chief of Mission Mark Storella \ndeserve praise for standing by Sokha throughout the crisis. Assistant \nSecretary of State Christopher Hill's trip to the region succeeded in \nfreeing Sokha from prison, and I know he cringes at Hun Sen's \ncharacterization of Sokha's release as a ``gift''. This may have been \nsimply a poor choice of words, but it serves to affirm the world's \nperception of Hun Sen as a Southeast Asian dictator.\n  The news that Hun Sen will drop charges against Sokha and other civil \nsociety reformers is not a cause for celebration. History shows that \nHun Sen is a habitual offender, and we can expect continued harassment \nand intimidation against those championing freedom and the rule of law.\n  The international community must now turn its attention to the plight \nof Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy and other political prisoners. It is time \nfor His Majesty King Sihamoni to derail Hun Sen's campaign by \nimmediately pardoning Rainsy, Channy, and all other political \nprisoners. Only then will democracy have a chance to get back on track \nin Cambodia.\n  The challenge for Cambodia's many donors is straightforward: hold Hun \nSen and his government accountable for their actions. While this may \nrequire some soul searching by U.S. allies, particularly France, \nGermany, and Japan, the status quo in Cambodia serves only the \ninterests of Hun Sen and the ruling Cambodian People's Party. With a \ndonor's conference approaching in March 2006, the international \ncommunity must demand a return on the significant assistance provided \nto Cambodia.\n  As over $2 billion has been invested in the democratic development of \nthat country since the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, it is not too much for \nthe international community to demand that the Prime Minister and his \ngovernment conduct themselves in a manner that respects the \nconstitutional rights and dignity of the people of the Cambodia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S207-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S207-S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LISTENING TO TEENS ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the 2005 Teen Gun Survey conducted by the \nUhlich Children's Advantage Network, also known as UCAN, produced some \nvery interesting and troubling results. UCAN conducts this survey each \nyear as a way of measuring teens' attitudes about gun violence. For \n2005, the sample included nearly 1,000 teenagers from around the \ncountry who responded to a variety of questions about their exposure to \ngun violence and its impact on their lives.\n  The UCAN survey makes clear that far too many teens are exposed to \ngun violence. According to the survey, nearly half of the respondents \npersonally know someone who has been shot, and more than a third know \nanother teenager who has threatened to kill someone with a gun. Almost \none out of every five teenagers who responded said they heard gunshots \nin their neighborhood at least once a month, and 38 percent believe \nthey could get a handgun if they wanted to. Disturbingly, 39 percent of \nthe respondents fear they will be shot someday.\n  The results of the survey also raise significant concerns about the \nperceived safety of our schools. More than a third of respondents said \nthat they are afraid gun violence might take place in their school, and \n21 percent feel that they are safer away from school than when they are \nin school.\n  These results should be taken seriously. Many teens who are exposed \nto gun violence may turn to violence later in life. A study completed \nlast year by a University of Michigan researcher\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\nfound that adolescents who were exposed to gun violence were more than \ntwice as likely to carry out violent acts within the following 2 years. \nFifty-six percent of the teens surveyed by UCAN said that they believe \nviolent teenagers learn their behavior from their parents. We must do \nmore to break this cycle.\n  Unfortunately, most of those who responded to the UCAN survey believe \nthat the Government doesn't understand the realities of gun violence \nfor teenagers and would not care if they were a victim of gun violence. \nIn addition, 41 percent of the teens surveyed said they would benefit \nfrom more violence prevention programs and resources.\n  We should listen to what teenagers around the country are saying \nabout guns. Their responses to the UCAN survey show that Congress is \nnot doing enough to protect young people from the threat of gun \nviolence. I urge the Senate to do more to help ensure our teenagers do \nnot have to fear guns in their schools and communities by passing \ncommonsense gun safety legislation and by supporting violence reduction \nprograms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S208-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Major Stuart Anderson\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I speak today with deep sorrow, for we \nhave lost a truly brave American and soldier. MAJ Stuart Anderson died \non January 7, 2006, when the Blackhawk helicopter he was in crashed \njust outside Tal Afar in northern Iraq. His helicopter was part of a \ntwo helicopter team providing support for the 101st Airborne Division. \nMajor Anderson was assigned to the 3rd Corps Support Command, Army \nNational Guard. My condolences go out to his wife, Tori; his two \ndaughters, Keely 15, and Kirsten 10; his parents, Claremont and Nancy \nAnderson; and many other family and friends.\n  Major Anderson grew up in Hoffman, MN, and then graduated from Benson \nHigh School in Benson, MN. He attended North Dakota State University. \nMaj. Anderson had been living in Dubuque, IA, for the past 5 years and \nwas scheduled to return home this fall. He was a supply and service \nsupport representative for his Des Moines based unit; he made sure \ncombat troops in some of Iraq's most dangerous areas had the proper \nsupplies.\n  Major Anderson joined the Army Reserve in 1984, became an officer in \n1989, and was serving in his second tour of duty in Iraq. Many of Major \nAnderson's colleagues define him as a trusted and humble leader. LTC \nThomas Nielsen wrote that ``Major Anderson was one of the finest \nofficers I have known in my 28-year career.'' Major Anderson's father \nsaid that ``he was very proud of being in the military . . . he just \nloved it.'' He was known to sprinkle in humor with his training and \nwith his annual Christmas cards. His humor will be missed by all who \nknew him. I ask my colleagues in the Senate and every American to \nremember the sacrifice that Major Anderson gave for our freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S208-2", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               UNI-CAPITOL WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAM\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, each year congressional offices host \nAmerican college students as interns, to help our future leaders learn \nabout public service and see how their Government works firsthand.\n  Today, I would like to let you know about a program that gives \nAustralian students the opportunity to experience our democratic and \nlegislative process. It's called the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship \nProgram.\n  My office is taking part in it right now, along with others in \nCongress. Twelve of Australia's brightest are here, pursuing knowledge \nand understanding. In so doing, we are all finding new reasons to like \nan old friend.\n  The Uni-Capitol was born of the efforts of Eric Federing. Eric worked \nfor more than a decade in the House and the Senate as a senior adviser. \nWhile doing this job, he lectured across Australia on American \nGovernment, politics, and news media. In an effort to forge ties across \nthe Pacific and for the betterment of both societies, Eric put together \nthis idea in Washington in 1999.\n  The selection process for the students is competitive and \nintellectually rigorous, ensuring the highest quality applicant. All \nparticipating students are comprehensively matched with a congressional \noffice and corresponding position. They come from a wide range of \nacademic disciplines and bring as much knowledge and understanding to \nour offices as they take away.\n  For the past 7 years, Mr. Federing's students have approached this \nopportunity with vim and vigor. I am pleased to have Douglas Ferguson \nfrom the University of Canberra working in my office this year. I would \nalso like to submit into the Record the names of other Australian \ninterns participating in this year's program:\n  Andrew Brookes, from Melbourne University, is in Senator Christopher \nDodd's office. Ryan Conroy, from Deakin University, is in \nRepresentative Sam Farr's office. Jenna Davey-Burns, from Melbourne \nUniversity, is in Representative Louis Slaughter's office. Sarah \nDillon, from Deakin University, is in Representative Alcee Hastings's \noffice. Jessica Gurevich, from Melbourne University, is in \nRepresentative Mike Castle's office. Scott Ivey, from the University of \nWestern Australia, is in Representative Loretta Sanchez's office. Saul \nLazar, from Deakin University, is in Senator Chuck Hagel's office. \nAbbie McPhie, from Macquarie University, is in Representative Jerrold \nNadler's office.

Marianna O'Gorman, \nfrom the University of Queensland, is in Delegate Eni Faleomavaega's \noffice. Rachel Thomson, from the University of Western Australia, is \nwith the Joint Economic Committee's minority staff.\n  Australia continues to be one of America's strongest allies. Our \ngreatest gift is the friendship born of shared values. I thank the Uni-\nCapitol Program and these Australian interns for their hard work, and I \nwish the program continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S208-3", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S208-S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ATTACK ON CHASIDIC SYNAGOGUE IN MOSCOW\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on January 11 of this year, at the \nMoscow Headquarters and Synagogue of Agudas Chasidei Chabad of the \nFormer Soviet Union, a so-called ``skinhead'' attacked worshippers with \na knife and wounded eight persons. I know that all Members of this body \ndeplore this terrible crime and send our prayers and best wishes to all \nthose injured during the assault.\n  The victims of this senseless violence include Rabbi Isaac Kogan, who \ntestified before an April 6 Helsinki Commission hearing I convened last \nyear concerning Chabad's ongoing efforts to retrieve the Schneerson \nCollection of sacred Jewish texts from Moscow. The Rabbi is a noted \nrefusenik who was appointed by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. \nSchneerson, to be part of Agudas Chasidei Chabad of the Former Soviet \nUnion. In addition to nurturing Judaism throughout the former USSR, \nthat organization has fought tirelessly to win the return of the \nSchneerson Collection to its rightful owners in the United States. The \nentire U.S. Senate has twice petitioned the Russian leadership to \nrelease those holy texts.\n  As chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have followed closely the \nissue of anti-Semitism and extremism around the world. Unfortunately, \nthe brutal attack at the Agudas Chasidei Chabad synagogue fits what \nappears to be a rising trend of attacks on ethic and religious \nminorities in Russia.\n  Let me present one disturbing statistic. According to an article in \nthe Moscow News last year, the Moscow Human Rights Center reports that \nRussia has up to 50,000 skinheads with active groups in 85 cities. \nThis, as opposed to an estimated 70,000 skinhead activists throughout \nthe rest of the world.\n  To make matters worse, there are indications that the police \nthemselves are sometimes involved in racist attacks. Earlier this \nmonth, a Russian newspaper carried a story about the Moscow police \nassault of a passerby who happened to be from the North Caucasus. \nAccording to persons from the North Caucasus, such beatings are a \ncommon occurance.\n  What was uncommon was the fact that the gentleman in question is a \ncolonel in the Russian Army and an internationally known cosmonaut.\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\n  Let me be clear. Anti-Semitism, bigotry, extremist attacks and police \nbrutality are not found only in Russia. Our own country has not been \nimmune to these challenges to rule of law and human dignity.\n  Nevertheless, as Russia accedes to the chairmanship of the G-8 and \nthe Council of Europe, there will be increased scrutiny of its \ncommitment to internationally recognized standards of human rights \npractices. I urge the authorities in Russia to do everything in their \npower to combat ethnic and religious intolerance and safeguard the \nreligious freedom and physical safety of all it citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S209-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW HOLT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about a \nspecial group of constituents. This April marks the 50th anniversary of \nBoy Scout Troop 89 of Downers Grove, IL. Teenagers move a mile a \nminute. Something that is ``cool'' in the morning may be forgotten by \nthe afternoon. But Scouting is one institution that has maintained a \ncentral role in the lives of many young people in Illinois and around \nAmerica.\n  Boy Scouts learn about and enjoy the outdoors, build friendships for \nlife, and strengthen values such as teamwork, honesty, and respect for \nothers. Downers Grove is a quiet residential village west of Chicago \nand a good place to instill these lessons.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to promote research and development, innovation, and \ncontinuing education; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a legislative \npackage which we refer to as the ``Protecting America's Competitive \nEdge Act of 2006'' or the ``PACE'' Act. This legislation ensures that \nthe United States continues to set the pace in science, and in the \ndevelopment of new technologies.\n  I know my colleagues Senator Bingaman, Senator Alexander, and Senator \nMikulski share my conviction that this legislation addresses one of the \nmost pressing challenges before us today. There are troubling signs \nthat the United States is becoming less competitive in scientific and \nhigh-technology fields. Today, the United States is a net importer of \nhigh technology products. The U.S. share of global high-technology \nexports has fallen over the last two decades from 30 percent to only 17 \npercent.\n  The PACE legislation closely follows the recommendations made in a \nrecent National Academy of Sciences report entitled ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm.'' The metaphorical storm is the challenge to our \nglobal competitiveness in science and technology. I want to \ncongratulate Norm Augustine, who chaired the National Academy \ncommittee, and the members of his committee for producing such a \ncomprehensive, ground-breaking report on this important issue.\n  The Augustine report makes 20 recommendations for U.S. schools, \nuniversities, research and economic policy. Our legislation will enact \neach of the recommendations. For example, our legislation doubles \nauthorizations for basic research in the physical sciences by over the \nnext 7 years. It also requires that at least 8 percent of Federal \nresearch budgets are allocated to high-risk, potentially high pay-off \nresearch. It will strengthen the skills of thousands of math and \nscience teachers by establishing training and education programs at \nsummer institutes hosted at the National Laboratories.\n  We need to take U.S. competitiveness seriously. We need to take \naction to support our standard of living, and ensure we continue to \ngrow and prosper. If we do not, we can expect other nations to rival \nour global competitiveness--and one day to surpass us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of all three bills in the \nfollowing order, the PACE-Energy Act, the PACE-Education Act, and the \nPACE-Finance Act, be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Protecting \nAmerica's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act that will enable us to build on \nour existing strengths to help secure America's continued economic \nprosperity in the twenty-first century.\n  I want to gratefully acknowledge at the outset that I am introducing \nthis legislation with Senator Domenici, Senator Alexander, Senator \nMikulski, and others. This measure is the product of our combined best \nefforts from both sides of the aisle, and our sole focus has been only \non what is in the best interests of the Nation as a whole.\n  For the last 200 years, our investments in science and technology, \nboth public and private, have driven our economic growth and improved \nthe quality of life in America. They have generated new knowledge and \nnew industries, created new jobs, ensured economic and national \nsecurity, reduced pollution and increased energy efficiency, provided \nbetter and safer transportation, improved medical care, and increased \nliving standards for the American people.\n  America's scientists and engineers through their unmatched vitality, \ncreativity, and curiosity have helped us not only imagine but invent \nthe future. In large measure, their contributions have made this new \ncentury before us so full of promise--molded by science, shaped by \ntechnology, and powered by knowledge.\n  One of the bedrock policies of our Nation's economic security must be \nto sustain our investments in science and technology. Today there is no \ndispute that science, and the technology that flows from it, is duly \nrecognized as the piston that drives the economic engine that enriches \nthe quality of our lives. \n  Yet today our preeminence is precarious.\n  Numerous thoughtful leaders in government, industry, and academia who \nare concerned about sustaining U.S. leadership across the frontiers of \nscientific knowledge are expressing growing uneasiness over troubling \ntrends regarding the Nation's future prosperity. They warn we are \nslipping in our world leadership role in science and engineering, and \nlosing sight of the importance of long-term investments in creating the \nconditions of prosperity.\n  Other nations are coming up fast behind us on the scientific track \nand are pouring resources into their scientific and technological \ninfrastructure. There is the distinct possibility that U.S. \ncompetitiveness in key high-tech areas will fall behind the major \nPacific Rim countries of India, China, Taiwan, and South Korea.\n  Moreover, the focus of our fundamental R has shifted away from the \nphysical sciences, mathematics, and engineering--the critical areas of \nR most closely correlated with innovation and economic growth.\n  Many of our foremost research programs that have been curtailed or \ncut back in recent years have been the cornerstone for much of our \neconomic progress and spurred the creation of high paying jobs. Budget \nincreases have been disproportionately concentrated primarily in two \ndepartments--Defense and Homeland Security--leaving other vital R \nagencies with very modest increases, or with an increase for some \nagencies offset by flat funding, or cuts in others.\n  In the name of national security, we have been building a swaying \ntower of insecurity.\n  We are on the brink of a new industrial and commercial world order. \nThe reality of the twenty-first century global economy is that China, \nIndia, and other nations once considered economic backwaters have \ndiscovered how to build strong economies around very sophisticated \ntechnology.\n  On the Pacific Rim, China has increased spending on colleges and \nuniversities almost tenfold in the last decade, and is doubling the \nproportion of GDP invested in that same period on R to promote \ncompetitiveness and growth. India is raising its funding of science \nagencies by 27 percent, and Japan is increasing its investments in life \nscience by 32 percent, while South Korea is upgrading research spending \nby 8.5 percent.\n  As our share of the world's technical graduate workforce slips, \nEuropean and Asian universities are churning out ever greater numbers \nof workers in scientific fields. And while young Americans may shy away \nfrom technical careers because they perceive better opportunities in \nother high-level occupations, there are still sufficient rewards to \nattract ever-increasing numbers of foreign graduate students eager to \npursue science and engineering degrees. \n  All of these signs, granted, are a cause for concern. Yet none of \nthem, however, is a cause for panic. To state the facts frankly is not \nto despair about the future, nor is it to indict the past. Our task \ntoday is not to fix the blame for yesterday, but to set the proper and \nprudent course for tomorrow.\n  These revolutionary changes in the global marketplace for highly \nskilled technical workers are dislodging the long-standing dominance of \nthe U.S. scientific enterprise.\n  That is causing our comparative advantage in high tech production to \nsuffer and, despite the extraordinary power and resilience of our \neconomy, signals a lengthy and difficult period of adjustment for \nAmerican industry, its workforce, and ultimately our strong middle \nclass standard of living which makes this country great.\n  It also flags a pivotal moment in American history--a time of \nnational peril, as well as a time of national opportunity.\n  What should we do about these international challenges? We have \nabsolutely no choice but to emphasize what we do best in this coming \nrivalry. Our most important strengths have always been education and \ninnovation. Our can-do spirit of commercializing technological \ninnovation has always been America's core competence. We do it far \nbetter than anyone else--we have done it before, and we can continue to \nexcel at it. \n  Last May, Senator Lamar Alexander and I asked the National Academy of \nSciences to conduct a study to identify ``specific steps our government \nshould take to ensure the preeminence of America's scientific and \ntechnological enterprise to enable us to successfully compete, prosper, \nand be secure in the global community of the 21st century.''\n  The Academy assembled an extraordinarily distinguished panel of \nAmerica's best scientific minds, including three Nobel Prize winners, \nbusiness executives, and university leaders and reported their findings \nback to us in October in a sobering report entitled, Rising Above the \nGathering Storm.\n  The National Academy's report proposes four broad recommendations: 1. \nIncrease America's talent pool by vastly improving K-12 science and \nmathematics education; 2. sustain and strengthen the Nation's \ntraditional commitment to long-term basic research; 3. make the United \nStates the most attractive setting in which to study and perform \nresearch; and 4. ensure that the United States is the premier place in \nthe world to innovate. \n  First and foremost, we need to fix our math and science education \nsystem from kindergarten through high school. We should establish a \nmerit-based, 4 year undergraduate scholarship program to annually \nrecruit 10,000 students per year to careers teaching math and science \nwho then commit to working for at least 4 years in K-12 public schools.\n  Using incentives and scholarships, our aim should be to quadruple the \nnumber of America students enrolled in advanced math and science \ncourses to four and a half million by 2010.\n  A U.S. high school student has about a 70 percent chance of being \ntaught English by a teacher with an English degree, but only a 40 \npercent chance of being taught chemistry by a teacher with a degree in \nchemistry. And the situation is worse for middle school students: 70 \npercent of them are taught math by a teacher lacking a certificate or \nmajor in math.\n  It takes many years to educate a citizen. There are no short term \nsolutions\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\nto this problem, and workforce issues rarely respond to quick fixes and \noften span generations.\n  That is why there is such a sense of urgency to recruit thousands of \nnew math and science teachers in the years ahead through the award of \ncompetitive scholarships. Additionally, we must strengthen 250,000 \ncurrent teachers' math and science teaching skills with \nenhanced training and education by leveraging the expertise of the \nworld's best physicists, mathematicians, and engineers to help provide \nthat training.\n\n  This legislation will also provide greater opportunities for students \nto take advanced math and science classes by increasing the number of \nstudents who enroll in Advanced Placement and International \nBaccalaureate science and math courses.\n  Second, we must steadily increase our investment by 10 percent each \nyear for the next 7 years in long-term basic research, with special \nattention devoted to the physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, \nand information sciences. \n  The Federal Government supports a majority of the Nation's basic \nresearch and nearly 60 percent of the R is performed in U.S. \nuniversities. At the same time, this investment at universities and \ncolleges plays a key role in educating the next generation of \nscientists and engineers and a technically skilled workforce. We ought \nto provide 200 new research grants annually--worth $500,000 each \npayable over 5 years--to the Nation's most outstanding early-career \nresearchers.\n  Additionally, we should consider creating a revolutionary agency in \nthe Energy Department modeled on the highly successful Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency to sponsor research to meet the Nation's long-\nterm energy challenges that industry by itself cannot or will not \nsupport.\n  Just as Olympic-caliber athletes need the finest equipment and \ntraining protocols to triumph in their events, so do scientists, \nengineers and their students need the most modern research instruments \nand facilities with the best capabilities, the farthest reach, and the \nfinest accuracy and resolution. To enable us to push beyond the \nfrontiers of our current knowledge, we should create a centralized \nresearch infrastructure fund of $500 million annually over the next 5 \nyears to ensure we have the equipment necessary for breakthrough \nscientific discoveries. \n  Third, we must increase the number of U.S. citizens earning science, \nengineering, and math degrees. We must redouble our efforts to \nencourage gifted young American men and women to pursue these high tech \ndisciplines which require so much from them and which have so much to \noffer all of our people. We can do so by providing annually 25,000 \ncompetitive undergraduate scholarships in physical sciences, \nengineering, and mathematics, and fund 5,000 new portable graduate \nfellowships in those fields.\n  Equally important, we need a global recruitment strategy to attract \nthe best and brightest to learn and live in America as part of our high \ntech workforce. Our visa, immigration and export control policies \ndesperately need reform. Delays and difficulties in obtaining visas to \nthe U.S. are contributing to a declining in-flow of scientific talent.\n  We need to ensure the best and brightest come here, stay here, and \nobtain legal residency after college to contribute to our national \neconomy instead of being forced back to their home countries to compete \nagainst us.\n  Finally, we need to be able to assure investors that the U.S. is the \npreferred site for investments in new or expanded businesses that \ncreate the best jobs and provide the best services.\n  To spur U.S.-based research and experimentation to meet global \ncompetition, we need to modernize the patent system, realign our tax \npolicies to encourage long-term investments in innovation, and ensure \nthe Nation meets the goal of affordable broadband Internet access by \n2007.\n  Our patent laws must also be reformed by moving to a first-to-file \ninstead of a first-to-invent, thus bringing us into line with the rest \nof the world while reducing expensive litigation. Infrastructure \nplanning grants and loan guarantees could also ensure that U.S. science \nparks are competitive with those throughout Asia.\n  Additionally, we should eliminate uncertainty by doubling the R tax \ncredit and making it permanent. Studies document that this tax credit \nencourages as much R spending as it costs in foregone revenue--and \nperhaps even twice that amount over the long haul. \n  We face a competitive challenge of historic proportions today due to \nseveral new factors: The growing number of countries with advanced \nskills, multinational corporations placing their R centers, fueled by \nhigh education and low labor costs, wherever the profits are the \ngreatest, and virtually every service being electronically \ncommunicable.\n  It will be difficult to ever match our populous economic competitors \nin the quantity of their scientists and engineers. Ours is an even \ntougher task: to stay far ahead in the quality of our research and to \nkeep pioneering scientific fields so cutting edge that others, for the \nmost part, cannot duplicate them.\n  We can readily meet this challenge and enjoy a prosperous future, \neven though these investments in education and research require \nincurring costs now for benefits later.\n  The PACE Act will sustain our vibrant science and technology sector \nand with it our well-being, health, environment, and security.\n  It will encourage education at home and attract talented scientists \nand engineers from abroad, as well as nurture a business environment \nthat transforms new knowledge into new opportunities for creating high \nquality jobs and reaching shared goals.\n  The passage of this farsighted public investment program will ensure \nthat the United States is stronger, smarter, and leads the world in \nscientific and technological innovation in the twenty-first century.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I join with Senators Domenici, \nBingaman, Mikulski, and more than 25 other senators, in introducing the \nProtecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act--a package of three \nbills to enhance American brainpower.\n  America is now playing in a tougher league. China and India are \ncompeting for our jobs. The best way to keep those jobs in America is \nto maintain our brainpower edge in science and technology.\n  The story of this bill really began last May, when Senator Jeff \nBingaman and I, with the encouragement of Senate Energy Committee \nChairman Pete Domenici, asked the National Academies this question: \n``What are the ten top actions, in priority order, that Federal policy \nmakers could take over the next decade to help the United States keep \nour advantage in science and technology?''\n  To answer the question, the Academies assembled a distinguished panel \nof business, government, and university leaders headed by Norm \nAugustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin, that included three Nobel \nPrize winners. They took our question seriously. We asked them for 10 \nrecommendations; they gave us 20 when they released their report in \nOctober.\n  In October, the Energy Committee held a hearing to learn more about \nthose recommendations from Mr. Augustine and the Academies. It was the \nfirst opportunity Congress had to hear the Academies' answer to our \nquestion.\n  Following those hearings, Chairman Domenici, Senator Bingaman, and I \nconvened a series of ``homework sessions'' with members of the \nAcademies, outside experts, and some officials in the Administration. \nThese off-the-record sessions allowed Senators and Administration \nofficials to grapple with the Academies' recommendations and consider \nhow best to implement them.\n  Last November, Norm Augustine led a dinner discussion hosted by \nSenator Frist with about 30 Senators on the report's recommendations \nright here in the Capitol. And then, in December, Senators Domenici, \nBingaman, and I met with President Bush where he graciously listened to \nour ideas. The President was very engaged and knew these issues well.\n  Now, as the Senate begins its session for the year, we are \nintroducing this legislation to implement the recommendations of the \nAugustine Report. Next week, when the President addresses the nation in \nhis State of the Union address, it is my hope that he will make this a \nfocus of the address and his remaining three years in office.\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\n  This bill is all about brainpower and the relationship of brainpower \nto good American jobs.\n  The United States produces more than 25 percent of all the wealth in \nthe world (in terms of GDP)--but has only 5 percent of the world's \npopulation. We are a fortunate country indeed. The Academies explain \nthis phenomenon in this way: ``. . . as much as 85 percent of measured \ngrowth in U.S. income per capita is due to technological change.''\n  This technological change is the result, in the report's words, of an \noutpouring ``of well trained people and the steady stream of scientific \nand technological innovations they produce.''\n  Most of this good fortune comes from the American advantage in \nbrainpower: an educated workforce, and our technological innovation. \nThe United States has the finest system of colleges and universities on \nearth, attracting more than 500,000 of the brightest foreign students. \nNo country has national research laboratories to match ours. Americans \nhave won the most Nobel prizes in science and registered the most \npatents. We have invented electricity, the computer chip, and the \ninternet.\n  As one scientist noted, we don't have science and technology because \nwe're rich. We're rich because we have science and technology.\n  Yet we worry that America may be losing its brainpower advantage. \nAmerican experts who travel to China, India, Finland, Singapore, \nIreland, and elsewhere come home saying, ``Watch out.''\n  The Augustine Report found that we are right to be worried: Only 6 \npercent of American college-age students earn degrees in the natural \nsciences or engineering, trailing students in China and India and a \ndozen other countries, many of which have doubled or tripled their \ndegree output over the last decade. For the cost of one chemist or \nengineer in the United States, a company can hire five chemists in \nChina or 11 engineers in India. China is spending billions to recruit \nthe best Chinese scientists from American universities to return home \nto build up Chinese universities.\n  The report also found signs that we are not keeping up: U.S. 12th \ngraders performed below the average of 21 countries on tests of general \nknowledge in math. In 2003 only three American companies ranked among \nthe top 10 recipients of new U.S. patents. Of 120 new chemical plants \nbeing built around the world with price tags of $1 billion or more, one \nis in the United States and 50 are in China.\n  To maintain America's global leadership in research and development, \nthe Augustine Report made twenty wide-ranging and urgent \nrecommendations for U.S. schools, universities, research, and economic \npolicy that include: Recruit 10,000 new science and math teachers with \n4-year scholarships and train 250,000 current teachers in summer \ninstitutes. Create a new coordinating office to manage a centralized \nresearch infrastructure fund of at least $500 million per year. Provide \n30,000 scholarships and graduate fellowships for scientists. Increase \nfederal funding for basic research in the physical sciences by 10 \npercent a year for 7 years. Give American companies a bigger research \nand development tax credit so they will keep their good jobs here \ninstead of move them offshore. Create a new agency in the Department of \nEnergy modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to \nconduct breakthrough R, that will lessen our dependence on foreign \nsources of energy.\n\n  Some may wince at the price tag--$9 billion in the first year, and \nthen it edges upward over the full seven year period. I believe the \ncost is low, relative to the benefits. Maintaining America's brainpower \nadvantage will not come on the cheap.\n  This year, one third of State and local budgets go to fund education. \nMore than 50 percent of American students have a Federal grant or loan \nto help pay for college. The Federal Government spends nearly $30 \nbillion per year on research at universities and another $34 billion to \nfund 36 national research laboratories.\n  Just last year, Congress spent $85 billion to fight the war in Iraq, \n$71 billion for hurricane recovery, and $352 billion to finance the \nnational debt. If we fail to invest the funds necessary to keep our \nbrainpower advantage, we'll not have an economy capable of producing \nenough money to pay the bills for war, social security, hurricanes, \nMedicaid, and debt.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has strong bipartisan \nsupport. It is our hope President Bush will make it a focus of his \nState of the Union Address and of his remaining 3 years in office--and \nthat future candidates for president will make it the center of their \ncampaigns. Aside from our national security, there is no greater \nchallenge than maintaining our brainpower advantage so we can keep our \ngood paying jobs and strengthen our economy. That is the surest way to \nkeep America on top.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in this critical effort to protect \nAmerica's competitive edge.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I'd like to thank my colleagues: Senator \nPete Domenici, Senator Jeff Bingaman and Senator Lamar Alexander for \ntheir effort in moving this issue. I am so proud of our great \nbipartisan team. I can't say enough about the appreciation that many of \nus in the Senate feel about their initiation of the report, ``Rising \nAbove the Gathering Storm,'' which is the basis for our legislation, \nthe PACE Act.\n  America must remain an innovation economy. This legislation creates \nthe building blocks that we need for a smarter America. Our Nation is \nin an amazing race--the race for discovery and new knowledge. The race \nto remain competitive and to foster an innovation society, to create \nnew ideas that lead to new breakthroughs, new products and new jobs. \nThe innovations that have the power to save lives, create prosperity \nand protect the homeland. The innovation to make America safer, \nstronger and smarter.\n  Our legislation is called ``Protecting America's Competitive Edge'' \nAct or PACE. It is divided into 3 sections: Energy, Education and Tax. \nIt calls for: getting new ideas by doubling Federal funding for basic \nresearch in the Department of Energy with special attention going to \nphysical sciences, engineering, math and information sciences; getting \nthe best minds with scholarships for future math and science teachers \nincluding $20,000 scholarships from the National Science Foundation \n(NSF) for undergraduate students majoring in math or science along with \nteacher certification; visa reform for foreign science and math \nstudents so the best and brightest can stay here, creating a new \nstudent visa for doctoral students studying math and science so they \ncan stay in the U.S. longer; and an extension of the R & D tax credit, \ndoubling the current R & D credit, from 20 percent to 40 percent, \nexpanding the credit to cover all research--since current law only \nallows credit for energy research.\n  Why is this so important? Because a country that doesn't innovate, \nstagnates. The whole foundation of American culture and economy is \nbased on the concept of discovery and innovation. That's part of our \nculture. When you look at what has made America a superpower, it's our \ninnovation and our technology. We have to look at where the new ideas \nare going to come from that are going to generate the new products for \nthe 21st century.\n  I want America to win the Nobel prizes and the markets. This \nlegislation will help to set the framework. It will make sure that \nwe're helping our young people with scholarships and new visas, and \nhelping our science teachers and those working in science with funding \nand research opportunities. We also are forming partnerships with the \nprivate sector, and building an innovation-friendly government.\n  This is so important to me and I'm going to use my committee \nresponsibility and my work and expertise in the United States Senate to \nmake it happen. Whether it's my position on the HELP Committee, working \nto pass the education piece, or in my seat as an appropriator and Vice \nChair on the subcommittee that funds Science. I will work to make sure \nthat there is money in the federal checkbook to support these important \nproposals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2200. A bill to establish a United States-Poland parliamentary \nyouth exchange program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation urging \nthe\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nAdministration to develop a United States--Poland Parliamentary Youth \nExchange Program.\n  The purpose of this exchange program is to demonstrate to the youth \nof the United States and Poland the benefits of friendly cooperation \nbetween the U.S. and Poland based on common political and cultural \nvalues. I have long been an active supporter of the Congress-Bundestag \nExchange program and am hopeful that this new endeavor will make \nsimilarly important lasting contributions to the U.S.-Polish \nrelationship.\n  As a Rhodes Scholar, I had the opportunity to discover international \neducation at Pembroke College--my first trip outside of the United \nStates. The parameters of my imagination expanded enormously during \nthis time, as I gained a sense of how large the world was, how many \ntalented people there were, and how many opportunities one could \nembrace. Student exchange programs do more than benefit individual \nscholars and advance human knowledge. Such programs expand ties between \nnations, improve international commerce, encourage cooperative \nsolutions to global problems, prevent war, and give participants a \nchance to develop a sense of global service and responsibility.\n  Funding a great foreign exchange program is a sign of both national \npride and national humility. Implicit in such a program is the view \nthat people from other nations view one's country and educational \nsystem as a beacon of knowledge--as a place where international \nscholars would want to study and live. But it is also an admission that \na nation does not have all the answers--that our national understanding \nof the world is incomplete. It is an admission that we are just a part \nof a much larger world that has intellectual, scientific, and moral \nwisdom that we need to learn.\n  The United States and Poland have enjoyed close bilateral relations \nsince the end of the Cold War. Most recently, Poland has been a strong \nsupporter of efforts led by the United States to combat global \nterrorism, and has contributed troops to and led coalitions in both \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Poland also cooperates closely with the United \nStates on such issues as democratization, human rights, regional \ncooperation in Eastern Europe, and reform of the United Nations. As a \nmember of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, and the \nEuropean Union, EU, Poland has demonstrated its commitment to \ndemocratic values and is a role model in its region.\n  I believe that it is important to invest in the youth of the United \nStates and Poland in order to strengthen long-lasting ties between both \nsocieties. After receiving for many years international and U.S. \nfinancial assistance, Poland is now determined to invest its own \nresources toward funding a U.S.-Poland exchange program. To this end, \nthe Polish Foreign Minister unambiguously stated that Poland welcomed \nthe opportunity to be an equal partner in funding important efforts.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 2201. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to modify the \nmediation and implementation requirements of section 40122 regarding \nchanges in the Federal Aviation Administration personnel management \nsystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, in the hours after the terrorist attacks on\n9/11, America's air traffic controllers rose to meet the tremendous \nchallenges of that day.\n  After halting all takeoffs, controllers began clearing the skies over \nAmerica. Under unprecedented conditions, controllers guided 4,500 \nplanes carrying 350,000 passengers to safe landings. They also rerouted \nmore than 1,100 of the 4,500 flights within the first 15 minutes of the \nlanding order--about one every second--and cleared the skies over \nAmerica within 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n  That kind of performance was wholly dependent on the caliber and \ntraining of the world's finest air traffic controllers. And as I come \nto the floor of the Senate today, there are hundreds of pilots flying \ncommercial airplanes under an air traffic controller's guidance. Each \nand every day, the lives of thousands of people are in the hands of \neach and every air traffic controller.\n  Because what they do is vital to our safety, I became very concerned \nby a letter I received from Illinois air traffic controller Michael \nHannigan last December. He wrote that ``the air traffic controllers, \nwho work aircraft everyday, often six days a week, are not being \nallowed to negotiate in good faith with the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.'' And he asked for me to help ``the hard working \nFederal employees that want the protections as a labor union that they \nshould have a right to bargain for.''\n  What was clear in Michael's plea was the sense that he and his \ncolleagues felt that they were being treated unfairly. I looked into it \nand came to the conclusion that if we did not restore a fair \nnegotiation procedure, it would threaten agency morale and \neffectiveness.\n  The problem is this: lower courts have determined that the FAA \nAdministrator currently has the extraordinary authority to impose wages \nand working conditions on her workers without arbitration. In order to \ndo that, she merely has to declare an impasse in negotiations and if \nCongress does not set everything else aside and stop her from imposing \nher terms and conditions within 60 days, the Administrator can go ahead \nand act unilaterally. That authority denies air traffic controllers and \nall other FAA employees the opportunity to engage in and conclude \nnegotiations in good faith.\n  To diffuse the management-labor tension at the agency and bring the \nFAA together, I am introducing ``The FAA Fair Labor Management Dispute \nResolution Act of 2006''. I am also proud to say that Senator Inouye, \nthe co-chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \nCommittees; Senator Murray, the ranking member on the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee; and Senator Lautenberg, a member on the \nCommerce Committee Subcommittee on Transportation, are joining me in \nthis effort.\n  The FAA Fair Labor Management Dispute Resolution Act replaces the FAA \nAdministrator's arbitrary authority with neutral binding arbitration in \nthe case of an impasse in labor-management negotiations. In \narbitration, both labor and management would have to make concessions, \nand both would be able to accept the outcome as fair.\n  We need this legislation now because the FAA Administrator is engaged \nin contract negotiations with the agency's two largest groups of \nworkers--the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) and \nProfessional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS). In both cases, \nnegotiations have been contentious. And the FAA's workers fear that the \nAdministrator is not intent on reaching fair, voluntary agreements \ngiven her previous negotiations. Indeed, the Administrator has already \nused her authority to impose wages and working conditions without \narbitration or agreement on NATCA's 11 non-air traffic controller \nbargaining units, and she stands at impasse with four of PASS's five \nbargaining units.\n  The Administrator has made three arguments in defense of her actions: \n1. the FAA needs the authority ``to operate more like a business''; 2. \nair traffic controller pay is ``inappropriate given the financial \ncircumstances of the airline industry the system serves''; and 3. \nchanging the law to send an impasse to binding arbitration would \nessentially ``change the rules of the game during halftime.''\n  But the agency's employees point out that the agency is not a \nbusiness driven to cut costs in pursuit of profit, it is a public \nagency with no margin for error. They also argue that the nation's air \nsafety should not depend on how well or poorly the airlines are doing \nfinancially. And, if the rules are unfair, the employees argue they \nshould be changed before negotiations conclude.\n  Regardless of the merits of each side's positions, if the \nAdministrator is able to impose her chosen conditions on air traffic \ncontrollers, it will have two negative effects on the agency: 1. it \nwill lead to an erosion of talent at the agency with vital, retirement-\neligible air traffic controllers interpreting such agency action as an \ninvitation to\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nretire; and 2. it will make recruiting needed replacement employees \nthat much more difficult.\n  I recognize that negotiations between the Administrator and the air \ntraffic controllers are difficult. However, it is in the best interest \nof the agency and public safety to have management and labor cooperate \nin contract negotiations and if that is impossible, then no one side \nshould be able to impose its views on the other. Only neutral \narbitration can produce a fair outcome that the entire organization can \naccept.\n  More than 2,900 air traffic controllers will be eligible to retire \nthis year, and 7,100 controllers could leave the agency within the next \nnine years. Meeting this management challenge will require cooperation \nbetween labor and management. Moreover, rising tension between the FAA \nAdministrator and FAA employees threatens this vital agency's \neffectiveness at every level and, as a result, threatens the safety of \npassengers.\n  Again, the legislation we are introducing today would encourage both \nsides in all FAA labor-management negotiations to reach a voluntary \nagreement and in the case of impasse, it would allow the FAA to move \nforward after binding arbitration, bring its workers together, and \nfocus on other challenges because no one side will have had arbitrary \nauthority.\n  The FAA's employees are dedicated, hard working public servants \nresponsible for helping ensure the safety of the flying public. It is \nstressful, important work. We must value that work and treat them \nfairly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2202. A bill to provide for ethics reform of the Federal judiciary \nand to instill greater public confidence in the Federal courts; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Fair and \nIndependent Judiciary Act of 2006 because ensuring a fair and \nindependent judiciary is critical to the system of checks and balances \nestablished in our Constitution. This legislation seeks to preserve the \npublic confidence that our Federal courts enjoy, and that our courts \nneed to adequately fulfill their constitutional role in our system. \nRevelations that judges and justices are receiving gifts from parties \nthat may appear before them or have a financial interest in a \nlitigating party undermine the public's trust.\n  For the past 4 years, editorial boards across the country have called \nour attention to the appearance of impropriety that occurs when Federal \njudges accept gifts and attend lavish private seminars sponsored by \nwell-heeled corporations. I have proposed similar legislation in \nprevious Congresses to address the problem of private judicial \nseminars. Last year, despite my ongoing concerns about reports of \njudicial activities that undermine public confidence, I withheld these \nprovisions from a judicial pay raise bill. I had hoped that the Federal \njudiciary would engage in self-regulation on these timely and \nsubstantive ethical issues. Unfortunately, recent press reports show \ncontinued appearances of impropriety, even by a member of the Supreme \nCourt. This legislation does not prohibit judges and justices from \nattending educational seminars. Instead, it simply requires them to \nlearn and disclose the private sponsors of the seminars and make that \ninformation public. Then, they would be allowed to attend the seminars, \nbut at the court's expense, instead of having special interests pick up \ntheir tabs.\n  Another issue that threatens to undermine confidence in our judicial \nimpartiality was highlighted at the recent hearings for Judge Alito. \nSome judges fail to monitor their financial holdings so that they can \nproperly recuse themselves from cases where there may be a conflict of \ninterest. One way to be sure that the recusal laws Congress enacted are \nbeing followed by all Federal judges is to allow more transparency of a \njudge's financial conflicts. This legislation contains a provision to \nimprove the public's access to the recusal lists that all judges keep \nwithin their chambers or clerks' offices.\n  Because the public's trust is at stake, it is important to require \nthat private seminar providers fully disclose the litigation interests \nof their sponsors and to improve access to judicial conflicts. The \nAmerican people deserve a Federal judiciary that is beyond reproach--in \nappearance, and otherwise. The Fair and Independent Judiciary Act seeks \nto ensure continued public confidence in our Federal courts.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate cost-sharing under part D of such title for certain full-\nbenefit dual eligible individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \naddress yet another serious flaw in the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit that has come to light.\n  On January 1, the new Medicare prescription drug benefit went into \neffect. Overnight, millions of seniors and disabled Americans found \nthemselves thrown into a confusing and complex transition.\n  Some of our poorest and most vulnerable beneficiaries, those in \nassisted living facilities, have found themselves suddenly forced to \nproduce copayments to get the medications they need.\n  These are beneficiaries with serious mental illnesses who have been \nstabilized on medications, and people with developmental and physical \ndisabilities who have little or no incomes and no way to afford the \nmedicines that they depend on.\n  The bill I am introducing will fix this problem by waiving copayments \nfor this group of vulnerable beneficiaries and reimbursing them for any \ncopayments they have already been forced to shoulder.\n  This is just one of so many problems we have seen plaguing this \nprogram. The first 26 days of this program have been a disaster for far \ntoo many seniors and disabled across New York and across the country.\n  We have heard reports from our poorest seniors, who were being \ncharged hundreds of dollars for drugs. We have heard reports of \ndisabled individuals asked to provide doctor's notes certifying a need \nfor their medications and of beneficiaries leaving pharmacies without \nthe drugs they depend on to keep them healthy.\n  As a result of problems with computer systems, phone lines, and the \ninability of Medicare and private plans to provide correct information \nto those on the front lines of care, millions of people around the \ncountry have faced problems receiving this new benefit.\n  I am working on all fronts to help Medicare beneficiaries weather \nthis transition. Before this program went into effect, it was clear \nthat those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, our poorest and \nmost vulnerable seniors and disabled, would have a particular challenge \nnavigating this transition. I was very concerned that many these \nMedicare recipients would walk up to their pharmacy counters on January \n1 and be unable to get their prescriptions filled.\n  In anticipation of these problems, I introduced legislation in \nDecember to keep these Medicare recipients from falling through the \ncracks by stepping up outreach and education to pharmacists and \nproviding reimbursement to pharmacists who are charged a transaction \nfee to access beneficiary information through Medicare. I also \ncosponsored legislation to give Medicare beneficiaries more time to \nenroll in the new program.\n  And I issued a resource guide, now available in both English and \nSpanish, to help New Yorkers navigate this new program. To date more \nthan 75,000 copies of the guide have been distributed.\n  Since the new program went into effect, I have repeatedly urged the \nBush administration to address the problems plaguing this program. And \nlast week, I introduced comprehensive legislation along with several of \nmy Senate colleagues, that includes my bill to help pharmacists help \ntheir customers, and makes the other fixes I have been calling for: \nprovisions to improve outreach and education, fix problems with drug \nplans transition programs, protect the benefits of seniors who also \nhave coverage from a retiree drug plan, and make sure that States and \nlow income beneficiaries are reimbursed for excessive costs they have \nbeen forced to shoulder by the inept implementation of the new benefit.\n  We owe it to our seniors and disabled Americans to get this right. \nAnd I will keep fighting to ensure that we do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S230-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 354--HONORING THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC \n                      SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on \nbehalf of a resolution I am submitting with Senator Graham and 31 other \nsenators, many of whom are members of the National Guard Caucus like me \nand Senator Graham. I am also very proud to note that the National \nGuard Association of the United States has endorsed our resolution.\n  This resolution honors the service of the National Guard and requests \nconsultation by the Department of Defense with the Congress and our \nNation's Governors prior to offering proposals that could change the \nforce structure of the Guard. In my opinion, it could not be timelier \nor more important.\n  We all know the tremendous sacrifices the National Guard is making \naround the globe today. The Army National Guard and the Air National \nGuard represent 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands \nand the District of Columbia and they are currently hard at work in \nIraq, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and over 40 other countries around \nthe world.\n  Long gone is the phrase ``weekend warrior''. The Guard is made up of \ncitizen-soldiers and airmen who serve full-time when their country \ncalls on them. Since September 11, they have responded and represented \nAmerica's militia with great honor.\n  Currently, the Nebraska National Guard has 364 personnel in Iraq. \nTheir units are the 1-167th Cavalry which provides combat support to \nthe Marines, the 67 Area Support Group which is responsible for command \nand control and the 189th Truck Company which handles convoy \noperations. In Afghanistan, there are 65 National Guard members of the \n2nd Battalion at the Regional Training Institute helping to train the \nAfghan National Army. Their Adjutant General, Major General Roger L. \nLempke, leads the Nebraska National Guard with great pride and \ndistinction. He is a credit to the National Guard, Nebraska and the \nNation he represents.\n  The Guard is unique in that it's a shared resource between the \nGovernors and the President. The National Guard is the first to respond \nto domestic emergencies which range from natural disasters to homeland \ndefense. Ninety percent of the troops on the ground in Louisiana and \nMississippi responding to Hurricane Katrina were members of the \nNational Guard.\n  Most Nebraskans will recall the blizzard that roared out of Colorado \nin October 1997 and slammed into Nebraska causing extensive damage that \nwould take weeks to clean up. It was fall and most trees still had \ntheir leaves. Branches snapped under the weight of more than a foot of \nheavy, wet snow and ice. The resulting power outages left 125,000 \nNebraskans without electricity for days and even weeks.\n  As governor of Nebraska then, it was the responsibility of my office \nto declare a state of emergency which activated the National Guard to \nhelp in clean up and rescue operations. The Guard responded with troops \nand equipment that made the effort proceed smoothly and efficiently.\n\n  The Guard handles State missions like this every year and every \nseason while experiencing critical equipment shortages, especially \nvehicle and radio shortages. Congress added $1 billion dollars for new \nequipment for the Guard last December, but that's only a small portion \nof what is needed to fully fund the equipment needs of the Guard. And \ndeployments, especially to Iraq and Afghanistan, have stretched the \nGuard thin.\n  It's in this environment that the Department of Defense will release \nthe Quadrennial Defense Review next month. The QDR review could impact \nthe future of the Guard. The Army and the Air Force may recommend \nchanges in the force structure which will impact Army National Guard \narmories and Air National Guard wings throughout the country.\n  Reductions in the force structure combined with a lack of adequate \nequipment for the National Guard threaten its missions and ability to \nrespond in an emergency. Homeland defense is the most important mission \nof the Department of Defense and the National Guard is the force best \nsuited to defend the homeland. It's the very last place resources \nshould be cut from.\n  Unfortunately, media reports indicate that to pay for modernization \nprograms, the Department of Defense will propose changing the Guard's \nforce structure. In an effort to begin a dialogue with DOD we are \noffering this resolution which honors the National Guard and recommends \nthat DOD: Fully funding the equipment needs of\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\nthe National Guard; requests that the Department of Defense should, as \nsoon as possible, consult with Governors, as well as Congress, on any \nproposed changes to the National Guard force structure; requests that \nany plan of the Department of Defense regarding the National Guard \nforce structure take into account the role of the National Guard in \nhomeland defense and other state mission defined by Governors; requests \nthe Department of Defense provide budget projections that detail cost \nsavings from any changes in National Guard force structure, as well as \nprojected costs in the event large personnel increases are necessary to \nrespond to a national emergency; and requests the Department of Defense \nassure Congress, and Governors, that potential force structure changes \nwill not impact the safety and security of the American people.\n  Every debate about the defense budget should be held in the context \nof long-term national security goals. I look forward to engaging with \nthe Department on their QDR proposals for the future of America's \nmilitia, the National Guard, and I urge adoption of this resolution by \nthe full Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S232-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, earlier today I filed a cloture motion on \nJudge Alito's nomination in order to bring to close in the not too \ndistant future this outstanding nominee's confirmation process.\n  The cloture vote is scheduled, as my colleagues know, for 4:30 in the \nafternoon on Monday. If cloture is invoked--which I believe it will \nbe--we will have a final up-or-down vote on confirmation on Tuesday at \n11 o'clock in the morning.\n  While I believe the Senate has a responsibility to have a thorough \ndebate, a robust debate on every judicial nomination, I am disappointed \nand it is time to end the delay tactics which we have seen play out \nover the last several weeks, delay tactics my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are using to obstruct this nominee. Thus, that is why \nI filed cloture to say enough is enough.\n  It has been 87 days since the President announced Judge Alito's \nnomination. I should say, by the way, that it took an average of 63 \ndays from announcement to confirmation of both of President Clinton's \nnominees.\n  When Judge Alito was nominated on October 31, or shortly after that--\nmaybe even that day--Chairman Specter and I worked in good faith with \nSenator Reid and Senator Leahy for a timeline on confirmation \nprojecting out where we would be. We agreed to give Judge Alito a fair \nup-or-down vote after plenty of time for hearings and preparations for \nthe hearings on January 20. We agreed to consider the nomination--it \nwasn't our preference--after the holidays. We also agreed--again it \nwasn't our preference--to the Democratic schedules not to begin \nhearings the week we preferred, January 2.\n  All of these accommodations were made with the expectation that \nDemocrats on the Judiciary Committee, once they had plenty of time for \ntheir hearings themselves, would not delay\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nthe vote coming out of the committee, which would set back the schedule \nyet a week later, which indeed is what happened. Judge Alito was \nresponsive. He was forthcoming. He answered more than 650 questions. \nAgain, when people hear these numbers, what is the perspective? That is \nmore than double the number of questions that Justice Ginsburg or \nJustice Breyer answered during their entire confirmation hearings.\n\n  But still, the Democrats delayed Judge Alito's vote coming out of \ncommittee. Yes, it is within the rules. All of this is within the \nrules. But we have seen this steady delay, postponement, obstruction. \nLuckily, the process continues forward. That is where we are today.\n  We are now scheduled to have a vote on January 31. That is the \nagreement the Democrat leader and I agreed to in representing our \ncaucuses earlier today. That means we will have had a total of 5 days \nof floor activity. It is 8 o'clock tonight. We have had speech and \ndebate over the course of the day, and we will have debate tomorrow. As \neveryone is well aware, we are given plenty of time in the Senate. We \ncould stay here later tonight, tomorrow, tomorrow night. I said we will \nplow through Saturday until we get this done. It will end up being 5 \ndays in terms of floor action.\n  Just to put that in perspective, for all of the sitting members on \nthe Supreme Court today, only one other had 5 days of floor debate on a \nnominee. Again, we are pushing the limits once again. That is why we \ncame forward to file cloture, to bring closure to this process.\n  Throughout the entire process I have been very consistent: These \njudicial nominees deserve, in terms of just dignity, but also it is our \nresponsibility, they deserve a fair up-or-down vote. I should add, \nalso, a recent poll shows that a majority of Americans believe Judge \nAlito should be confirmed. So, tonight, I can say not with absolute \ncertainty but with as much certainty you can get around this place that \non Tuesday Judge Alito will get that fair up-or-down vote.\n  I mentioned the recent poll. That is the general sense people get as \nwe go back to our communities talking about the hearing process and the \nconfirmation process. They broadly support this highly qualified \nindividual. The list goes on and on in terms of his qualifications, his \n15 years on the Federal courts, his highest rating with the ABA, the \ntestimony from some of his colleagues in the hearing, now 2 weeks ago, \nall of which underline his modest judicial temperament, his integrity, \nhis character. The polls show that the American people have spoken in a \nfairly dramatic way to us as we go back to our States.\n  I agree with the American people. Next Tuesday, a bipartisan majority \nwill vote to confirm Judge Alito as Justice Alito.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/01/26/senate-section/article/S233-1", "month": "01", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JANUARY 27, 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
