Mr. President, it is not often that you see a legislative \nplan with such bipartisan opposition. The asbestos bill before the \nSenate is an example of how you should not proceed on a piece of \nlegislation. I have explained throughout the week, as have others, that \nthe so-called FAIR Act is not fair. I have explained how this \nlegislation will harm victims by trapping them in an administrative \nclaims system that is irreparably defective and doomed to fail. It is a \nbill that is not only unfair to victims but to businesses, except for a \nfew large corporations. Major industries oppose this, such as the \ninsurance industry. It is terribly unfair to the American taxpayer, \nterribly unfair to the veterans.\n  The trust fund set up under this bill to pay for victims' claims is \nwoefully underfunded. Expert after expert has opined that $140 billion \nwill not be sufficient to satisfy expected claims, and it doesn't \nproperly account for expected borrowing and administrative costs. \nAdding insult to injury, the mechanics of the trust fund claims system \nunacceptably abridge the rights of victims with unworkable startup and \nsunset provisions.\n  It is no surprise that the asbestos bill that has reached the Senate \nfloor is in such poor shape when it is the product of such an unusual \nlegislative process. Ordinarily, Senate deliberation on a bill is open \nand transparent. But consider all the ways this bill is shrouded in \nmystery.\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\n  First, we still do not know which companies will contribute to the \nasbestos trust fund and how much each company will contribute. Senator \nDurbin asked for a list on the floor yesterday, and in response the \ndistinguished manager of the bill, Senator Specter, said: Well, we \ndidn't have to subpoena Government agencies. Well, they had to be \nprivate companies. Whom are they? He would not say. It is not clear \nthat the list Chairman Specter obtained by subpoena even lists the \ncontribution amounts. We don't know. For a bill such as this, not to \nknow? Without this information, the Senate can have no confidence that \nthe trust fund will raise $140 billion or, in fact, anything.\n  Second, the sponsors have promised a managers' amendment. Mr. \nPresident, as I said on the floor yesterday, I don't have the \nlegislative experience of the distinguished President pro tempore, but \nI have a lot of experience--three decades of legislative experience. \nThis is, by far, the worst piece of legislation with which I have ever \nhad to deal. But think about this--and I want all Senators, all \nDemocrats and all Republicans, to understand what is happening. Anyone \nwho has a problem, they can go to Senator Specter and they will stick \nit in the managers' amendment. One of my colleagues had five concerns. \nWithin a short period of time, it was all taken care of in the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  Of course, nobody can see the managers' amendment. It is composed of \nover 40 amendments. How could anyone vote for a piece of legislation \nsuch as that--a managers' amendment with 42 separate amendments? Now, \nthese amendments were not put in, in a conference committee. People \ncomplain about that. But at least in a conference committee, you have \npeople working together, sticking things in. Sometimes Democrats \ncomplain and sometimes Republicans complain--whoever is in the minority \nhere: Well, we didn't get enough consultation; you cut us out of the \nprocess. But at least you had a group of Democrats and Republicans in \nthe process. Here, you have one person making a decision as to what is \ngoing to be in the managers' amendment. There is no way to know what is \nin it. How could anyone say: OK. You have taken care of me, but I don't \nwant to see the other 40 amendments--because with this legislation, \nsimilar to all legislation, you put something in one spot, and you have \nto take something out someplace else.\n\n  Well, another way this bill is shrouded in mystery is, yesterday, we \nreceived a statement of administration policy on this bill. Ordinarily, \nthese documents contain several pages of detailed analyses of pending \nbills. The administration outlines its problems with the bill. This is \nstandard procedure. It is a detailed analysis of the bill. Yesterday, \nthe statement on this 400-page bill that some say should be $280 \nbillion, not $140 billion, is 2 paragraphs. One of them is a short \nparagraph:\n\n       Although the administration has serious concerns about \n     certain provisions of the bill, the administration looks \n     forward to working with Congress in order to strengthen and \n     improve this important legislation before it is presented to \n     the President for his signature.\n\n  Mr. President, what can we expect? What does this mean? What \nprovisions do they not like? How are they going to work with Congress? \nThis bill is not ready for Senate floor consideration.\n  The letter contains no list of which provisions raise concerns or \nwhat the concerns are, just an implicit promise that once the bill gets \nto conference, the White House will rewrite it to its satisfaction.\n  Finally, also in the mystery shroud, yesterday, we learned that the \nmanagers intend to evade a valid budget point of order by including \nlanguage in the bill to prohibit more than $5 billion in payments each \n10-year period, even though that would leave the program paying far \nless than $140 billion in claims. One of the complaints everybody has \nis that the trust fund will have their money stolen, in effect, with \nthis legislation. The insurance industry, the businesses, and not the \nleast of which are the claimants, the victims--they don't have enough \nmoney with $140 billion. Now they are going to be told that to avoid \nthis point of order, they will limit how much money can be paid. If it \nis not enough, limit what the victims get. It is a terrible situation. \nThis bill, if it weren't so serious, would be an example of how not to \nhandle legislation, with a managers' amendment that contains more than \n40 amendments, and the basis for the legislation is secret. Members of \nthe Judiciary Committee--not someone in the Commerce Committee or the \nAppropriations Committee--nobody, not even members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, are entitled, according to the manager of the bill, to see \nhow they arrived at the $140 billion. He said that on the Senate floor.\n  I am not too sure the Judiciary Committee should have jurisdiction of \nthis bill. I think maybe it should have been a joint referral to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I have not spoken to the \nchairman of that committee, Senator Inhofe. I have been chairman of \nthat committee on two separate occasions. I will bet Senator Inhofe \nwonders why his committee hasn't had something to do with this. I have \nhad some differences with the Senator from Oklahoma, but I have never, \never had a problem with him not telling me or anybody on the committee \nhow they arrived at the numbers. We did over $300 billion at one time \non a highway bill, and there were no secrets as to how the numbers got \nin there. There were computer printouts. Sometimes it took several \nhours for the printouts. But here we don't know where they came up with \nthese numbers.\n  This is not the way to legislate. It demeans the Senate, demeans the \nlegislative process. I recognize that people consider me partisan on a \nlot of occasions, and maybe they have a right to do that. I try not to \ndo it, but sometimes things happen. But I want the record to be spread \nthat this is not a partisan attack on this legislation. There are \npeople who believe this legislation is unfair. I see my friend from \nAlabama, and he can speak for himself, as we all know, but I have \nunderstood--I have not talked to him personally, but I understand that \nhe is concerned about the trust fund amounts that will be set up to pay \nthe claims. They are going to be stripped of their money in this \nlegislation.\n  The whole premise of this bill is flawed. It deprives Senators and \nthe public of an opportunity to consider the bill on its merits. The \nSenate should operate in the spirit of transparency and candor, not \nsecrecy. The proponents claim there is an absolute asbestos litigation \ncrisis in this country and this crisis requires that we act on this \ndeeply flawed legislation. There is no asbestos litigation crisis, Mr. \nPresident.\n  We have an asbestos disease crisis. The consumer advocacy \norganization Public Citizen stated:\n\n       There is no logjam of asbestos cases in the courts. \n     [Moreover], [t]he best obtainable statistics . . . do not \n     support the oft-repeated contention that an avalanche of \n     asbestos lawsuits is paralyzing state and federal courts.\n\n  Consider some of these facts. In Federal courts, which account for 20 \npercent of asbestos cases, new Federal filings for asbestos liability \nhave been on the decline, both in recent years and compared to much \nhigher levels at the start of the 1990s. Most recently, new Federal \nfilings have declined from 9,111 in 1998 to 1,400, a drop of 84 \npercent, according to the U.S. Administrative Office of our courts.\n  Asbestos suits as a fraction of all product liability suits have \nfallen considerably, from two-thirds of all cases in 1990 now to 4.2 \npercent in 2004. The number of asbestos product liability trials in \nFederal courts is down sharply in recent years, from 271 in 1991 to \nzero in several recent years, according to the U.S. Department of \nJustice Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n  In State courts, among tort cases disposed of by trial in 2001, in \nthe Nation's 75 largest counties--which together account for about 23 \npercent of the population--there were 31 asbestos trials, .4 percent of \nan estimated total of 7,948 cases. Among major categories of State \ncases, asbestos product liability cases going to trial had the shortest \nmedian period for disposition for 2001, the latest period for which \ndata is available. While the disposition time for other cases was \nlittle changed since 1996, the disposition time for asbestos trials \nfell by 80 percent, from 50 months to 10 months.\n  Overall, the rate of growth for new asbestos claims has markedly \nslowed. In the mid-1980s, the number of claims for mesothelioma, other \ncancers, and\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\nnonmalignant cases each was growing by 25 percent annually, but now the \nrate of growth is down by 76 percent for mesothelioma, down by 96 \npercent for other cancers, and down by nearly half for nonmalignant \ncases.\n  Even the largest number of asbestos claimants in a single year, \n2002--about 95,000--amounts to a little more than one-half of 1 percent \nof new annual State and Federal cases.\n  Our system of justice is unique. State courts have seen the problems \nand they have done something about them. I have talked to Republican \nSenators and Democratic Senators. Texas has a system we should take a \nlook at here. Illinois has a great system. What they have established \nis what they call a pleural registry. What they do there, if you have \nbeen around asbestos and you think you might get sick--because some of \nthese periods of dormancy can be for years and years--you give your \nname and the statute of limitations is tolled. If nothing happens to \nyou, no problem. If 10, 20, 30 years later something comes up, you can \ngo into court. It has worked great in Illinois, where a lot of cases \nwere being filed. It protects the most serious cases, the mesothelioma \nand asbestosis.\n  There is no litigation crisis. These facts contradict any assertion \nthere is some type of asbestos litigation crisis overwhelming the \ncourts.\n  In addition, the pleural registry and the system they have in Texas \nand other States--take, for example, US Gypsum. My brother worked for \nUS Gypsum his whole professional life. They had a lot of problems with \nasbestos. Why? Because that is what they manufacture stuff with. With \nUS Gypsum, they set up a program and settled all their cases. Right now \nthey have settled all their cases for about $900 million. Other \ncompanies have done the same thing. They have gotten money together: \n``Let's get rid of this litigation.'' So anyone talking about a crisis \nwith litigation--the crisis is these big companies are trying to escape \nresponsibility.\n  I read here on the floor the day before yesterday an example of four \ncompanies, hundred-year-old companies, that pay nothing in asbestos \nnow. But one company, even though they paid not a penny for asbestos \nlitigation, under this proposal will pay $19.5 million a year. They \nwill go bankrupt and a 100-year-old American company is gone.\n  We do not need to pass this defective legislation. We should instead \npass legislation to help the thousands of victims of asbestos exposure \nand the companies that have contributed to their injuries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S877-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night I was in my office in the \nRussell Senate Office Building and we were evacuated to the parking \ndeck, and following the excellent leadership of the Capitol Police, \npeople responded professionally and well without any undue alarm and \nshowed good discipline and good spirits.\n  I point that out to ask, have we forgotten there is an enemy out \nthere who desires to attack us, desires to attack our Nation's Capitol, \nor any other spot in our country, desires to cause us harm, and that we \nare spending billions of dollars, that some of the best people in this \ncountry are working night and day, like our Capitol Police, in \nlocalities all over this country to protect us? From local sheriffs, \npolice officers, State police officers, the FBI, the CIA, the Customs \nService, the Immigration Service, to all the agencies that are involved \nin protecting us, they are out there working their hearts out, and \nsometimes I think we in this body have gotten too comfortable about \nthis. We have been the subject of a declaration of war by al-Qaida. Bin \nLaden has declared war on the United States. He has asserted it is his \nright and, indeed, the duty of his followers to attack Americans and \neven civilian targets, men, women and children.\n  We have authorized the U.S. Government, the President, and the \nexecutive branch to exercise certain rights because it is war. It is \nnot a criminal matter. If we capture our enemies, they are not entitled \nto a trial in the southern district of New York because they are \nprisoners of war. They are entitled to be held without trial as every \nprisoner of war since the beginning of the Republic and the rules of \nwar have been instituted. They are held without trial. In the Hamdi \ncase, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that even an American citizen \nengaged in the war against the United States can be held without trial \nas an enemy combatant against the United States because it is not a \ncriminal matter. A state has one primary responsibility, and that is to \nmaintain its existence against those forces that would destroy it.\n  I would ask if anyone thinks we would have any liberties at all if \nbin Laden ran this country. He would tell you what clothes to put on in \nthe morning. We would have people not only not being free, they \nwouldn't be able to drive an automobile--women would not be--under his \nmentality.\n  This is a serious question, and we need to respond to the challenge \nto this country in an effective way consistent with our heritage of \nlaws and liberties. There is no doubt about that.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has pointed out recently something that is so \nobvious, but we should think about it. He said the military challenge \ntoday is to find, fix, and finish the enemy. He said there is no doubt \nif we target and develop a plan, we can finish them successfully. We \nhave that military capability. There is no military in the world \ncapable of destroying the military of this United States.\n  I ask you to remember what we heard after 9/11. What we heard was our \nintelligence is weak. What we heard was we did not have enough \nintelligence, that we did not have enough information to find the \nenemy; that they had sleeper cells in this country and those sleeper \ncells were activated by phone calls from Afghanistan and bin Ladin over \nhere to encourage them to step forward to carry out the events that led \nto September 11. Isn't that what happened? And we had this spasm of \nself-flagellation about intelligence and how we operate our \nintelligence community. Our job unfortunately was based on the fact \nthat there were failures and we could have done better, had we had \ninterceptions of some of those 18 responsible for 9/11 prior to 9/11, \nthat if we had been able to listen to those conversations, we could \nwell possibly have taken steps to avoid that and 3,000 American \ncitizens would have civil liberties today. Now they have none because \nthey are no longer with us.\n  We have to ask those questions and go back and look at the history of \nour country and what is the legitimate power of the President and our \nforces in a time of war.\n  What do our intelligence leaders tell us about the capability of the \nNational Security Agency as it has dealt with the ability to intercept \ninternational phone calls involving al-Qaida members? What do they tell \nus? What do all three of our top intelligence people\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\nsay? The National Intelligence Director John Negroponte testified last \nThursday before the Intelligence Committee and he stated:\n\n       This was not about domestic surveillance. It was about \n     dealing with the international terrorist threat in the most \n     agile and effective way possible.\n\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller testified last Thursday as well, stating \nto the Senate Intelligence Committee:\n\n       We get a number of leads from the NSA from a number of \n     programs, including the program that's under discussion \n     today.\n\n  The FBI Director is saying we get a number of leads from this program \nunder discussion today.\n\n       And I can say that leads from that program have been \n     valuable in identifying would-be terrorists in the United \n     States, individuals who were providing material support to \n     terrorists.\n\n  Let me interject here. I was a Federal prosecutor for a long time. I \ndealt with a lot of drug gangs and some organized crime-type groups. \nThey are pretty close-knit organizations. Sometimes you don't even know \nthey exist. Then all of a sudden you have the ability to identify them \nand penetrate the organization and gain information against them, and \nall of a sudden you realize right in your own community there is a \nmajor drug-dealing gang or a major organized crime network. So one tip, \none lead from an intercepted phone call, can identify a sleeper cell in \nany community in America. I kid you not. That is the way law \nenforcement works.\n  How do you get a warrant to surveil the sleeper cell of terrorists in \nthe United States? Oftentimes it is this kind of intercept on a \nnational security call from foreign sources here that causes us to have \nthe information that leads to the identification of a group bent on \ndestroying our country.\n  CIA Director Porter Goss testified to the Intelligence Committee:\n\n       I'm sorry to tell you--\n\n  And I hope the American people listen to this--\n\n       I'm sorry to tell you that the damage has been very severe \n     to our capabilities to carry out our mission. . . . I use the \n     words ``very severe'' intentionally. That is my belief and I \n     think the evidence will show that.\n\n  He is talking about the revealing to the world our intelligence \ncapabilities at NSA.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       When I start talking about the disruption to our plans, \n     things that we have under way that are being disrupted \n     because of releases to the press or public discussion; when I \n     talk about the risk to access, the sources or methods that \n     are no longer viable or usable or less effective by a large \n     degree; when I talk about the erosion of confidence in our \n     working partners overseas, I'm stung to the quick when I get \n     questions from my professional counterparts saying, ``Mr. \n     Goss, can't you Americans keep a secret?''\n\n  How can we expect them to share intelligence with us if you pick it \nup in the newspapers? How can we have techniques of this kind and have \nthem leaked to the press?\n  I would say it is time for us to reevaluate how we do business. It is \ntime for us to realize that we are in a war and that we are entitled to \nconduct that war and to win that war. Our military and our intelligence \nagencies have been charged by us--indeed, they have been criticized by \nus for not being effective enough in this effort.\n  I will conclude. I see my colleague from Missouri is here, and he \nknows this issue very well. I would like to yield to him.\n  I will conclude with this thought: Please note, Americans, that our \nmilitary and intelligence agencies have every right to intercept \nforeign phone calls between two foreign sources. That has never been in \ndispute. The question we have is whether the authorization of force and \nthe inherent power of the President allows warrantless surveillance of \nan international call that is connected to the group we are at war \nwith, al-Qaida, that calls into the United States. To say we can't do \nthat will lead to this weird result.\n  We intercept an international phone call that has not been connected \nto the United States and we discover information that they are planning \nan attack on France, we can call France and tell them. If they have a \nplan that we discover that they are going to attack Canada, we can call \nthem and warn them--or New Zealand or Mexico or any other of our allies \nand friends around the world. But if the call is into the United States \nfrom al-Qaida, we can't intercept that call, we can't use that \ncapability to defend Americans.\n  I believe that is not logical. The American people don't agree with \nit. They support and expect our military to carry on these activities. \nI hope and I believe they will be continued.\n  Why do I believe they will be continued? Because despite the fact \nthat we have told the world of this capability and severely damaged our \ncapability, not one Member of this Congress that I know of has said we \nshould stop it. If it is so evil and bad, why do they say it does not \nneed to be stopped?\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I certainly support the very powerful words \nof my colleague from Alabama. He has pointed out many of the compelling \nreasons for this program.\n  I rise today to discuss this vitally important program for protecting \nour national security, and I do so regrettably because this is an open \nsession on the floor of the Senate. This program, of course, is known \nas the NSA terrorist surveillance program. I say I discuss it \nregrettably because it is to the detriment of our Nation that this \nprogram was leaked to the media and has now been discussed openly for \nmonths.\n  I submit to you that the year 2005, in intelligence and national \nsecurity circles, will go down in history as the year of the leak. I \nwill not repeat the full litany of those leaks, but we have all been \ncontinually reminded about the most damaging one.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to say how much I appreciate his \nleadership. I note that Senator Bond is a senior Member of this Senate \nand has served on the Intelligence Committee. He has a son serving in \nthe Marine Corps in Iraq right now in harm's way defending this \ncountry. He is a brilliant lawyer, made the highest score on the \nconstitutional law test--I happen to know this--when he was at the \nUniversity of Virginia. I think the American people need to listen to \nwhat he says about this issue.\n  I guess that is my question. Otherwise, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I say thank you to the Senator from Alabama.\n\n  Let me get back to the remarks.\n  For example, the allegation that the United States is running some \nsecret prisons in Europe has caused European nations and other allies \nto question their cooperation with us on the war on terror for fear of \ninternational retribution; the barrage of books and articles disclosing \nalleged classified operations, like James Risen's book, ``State of \nWar,'' where he takes every supposed leak he can find and churns it out \nfor profit in a book; and the NSA terrorist surveillance program which \ntips off terrorists to our early warning program.\n  On February 2, CIA Director Goss testified to Congress and the \nIntelligence Committee in open session about the damage to our national \nsecurity. I asked him if these leaks had a significant impact on our \ncapabilities to carry out our mission. And to quote him:\n\n       I use the words ``very severe'' intentionally. That is my \n     belief.\n\n  He went on to say that foreign leaders chide him that the United \nStates cannot keep a secret and that we have lost the confidence of \nmany in the world who were desiring to assist us in the global war on \nterror. Do those who leak classified information with reckless abandon \nrealize they are potentially aiding and abetting the enemy by allowing \nthe enemy advanced warning of how to avoid our defenses as we seek to \nprevent another 9/11?\n  Since so many have taken political advantage of the leak on the NSA \nterrorist surveillance program, the administration and those of us who \nagree with the concept of the program are now forced to speak openly to \ndefend it to make sure Congress does not throw this vital program out \nwith the bath water while reviewing it. Some say the program is illegal \nand even unconstitutional. How do they figure? The President has the \ninherent constitutional\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\nauthority, so held by the courts, to conduct ``warrantless'' \nsurveillance when it is reasonable for the surveillance for foreign \nintelligence purposes. This is a constitutional principle which has \nbeen established for centuries. Go back to the writings of our Founding \nFathers, and from our first President, George Washington, to our \ncurrent, President George Bush. Presidents have intercepted \ncommunications to determine the plans and intentions of our enemies.\n  A steady stream of Federal court cases has confirmed this \nPresidential authority, as Attorney General Gonzales pointed out on \nMonday before the Senate Judiciary Committee: In the face of \noverwhelming evidence for the President's authority, opponents retort \nthat the President must then be breaking the law by violating the 1978 \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA. But--and this is \nimportant--Congress cannot extinguish the President's constitutional \nauthority by passing a law.\n  We in this body cannot take away the powers the Constitution gives \nthe President. If the law is read in such a way as to encroach upon his \nconstitutional authority, then I question whether that part of the FISA \nact would be constitutional.\n  This is not the first time a President has faced the issue of \nexercising his inherent constitutional powers for foreign intelligence \nsurveillance in view of legislation that could be interpreted as \ninfringing on that authority.\n  In 1940, President Roosevelt wrote to Attorney General Robert Jackson \nthat despite section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934, and in this \ninstance despite a Supreme Court ruling upholding the prohibition on \nelectronic surveillance, President Roosevelt said he believed he had \nthe inherent constitutional authority to authorize the Attorney General \nto ``secure information by listening devices direct to the conversation \nor other communications of persons suspected of subversive activities \nagainst the government of the United States, including suspected \nspies.''\n  So does the President have carte blanche with respect to foreign \nintelligence surveillance? The answer is clearly no. Under the fourth \namendment to the Constitution, the surveillance has to be \n``reasonable,'' and it does not require a warrant. In the context of a \nwar against al-Qaida and those who would do great harm by attacks on \ninnocent American civilians within our country and with a \nconstitutional resolution authorizing the use of ``all necessary and \nappropriate force'' to prevent attacks, who is the best to determine \nwhat is and isn't ``reasonable''?\n  When surveying communications in real time, who is best to make that \ndetermination? A judge or a lawyer or an intelligence analyst who has \nspent his or her professional life observing, listening, studying, and \ntracking the terrorist personalities which make up groups such as al-\nQaida? To me the answer is obvious: the analyst.\n  Consider this: If someone listened to your voice on a telephone call, \nwho would be the best person to assess it by the voice intonation and \nword usage, whether it is your voice on the other end or a lawyer or \nsomeone who knows you well? Of course, the answer is the person who \nknows you. And I submit that the Americans who know these terrorist \npersonalities better than anyone else are the analysts who have spent \nendless days over the past 4 years studying them.\n  Again, do the analysts have carte blanche to eavesdrop on \ninternational communications coming into or out of the United States to \nknown suspected terrorists? No. Their decisions are reviewed by \nsupervisors, and the program is reviewed by the NSA inspector general, \nthe NSA general counsel, the White House Counsel, and numerous lawyers \nat the Justice Department who are ready to blow the whistle if they see \nanybody stepping out of line. The Attorney General also reviews the \nprogram, and the President reauthorizes it every 45 days with the \ndetermination that al-Qaida continues to pose a significant threat.\n  Did the President keep the Congress in the dark? No, he didn't. He \nbriefed the Congress in a manner consistent with the practice of \nPresidents over the past century. He briefed leaders of both parties in \nthe House and Senate and the two leaders on each Intelligence \nCommittee, Democrats and Republicans.\n  These leaders were elected by their constituents to represent them in \nCongress and elected or appointed by their parties to serve in these \nincredibly important positions, so if any one of them ever questioned \nthe legality of this program, they had the responsibility to bring the \nmatter to the leadership, discuss it with the administration, and if \nnecessary to cut off funding for the program through congressional \nauthority.\n  The reason the President briefed the Congress was to afford them the \nopportunity to do exactly that. Did anyone do that? No. There was a \ncarefully couched letter written that simply expressed concern. There \nwas no followup, no action taken, and no mention of it at all during \nsubsequent program briefings, according to public statements by those \nin attendance.\n  Some Members of Congress may feel slighted because they were not \nbriefed on the program. I am on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Do I \nfeel slighted? Absolutely not. To the contrary, I recognize that the \nPresident has to keep these very important programs top secret, which \nthe President is doing to protect my family, my constituents, and \nmyself. That is his responsibility.\n  The bottom line is that I believe congressional oversight is a vital \naspect of ensuring the proper execution of matters involving national \nsecurity, and I believe there was adequate oversight. We are not \ntalking about the U.S. Government listening to phone calls from me to \nyou or from my constituents in Missouri to their relatives in or out of \nState. We are talking about our best intelligence officials having the \nability to assess whether al-Qaida affiliates are communicating \ninternationally where one end of the communication takes place inside \nthe United States and the other end takes place outside the United \nStates, maybe discussing another attack like 9/11 on America.\n  These are times to stand up in arms over our civil liberties. I will \ndo so when I believe they are infringed upon. This is not one.\n\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are a number of issues to be \ndiscussed, but the distinguished Senator from Utah has been awaiting \nrecognition. I yield now to Senator Bennett so he can make his \ncomments. We managers will be here all day and can speak later and not \ntie up the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his courtesy \nand pay tribute to him and the Judiciary Committee for their effort in \ndealing with this most vexatious problem.\n  When the asbestos problem burst into the American consciousness, \neveryone was concerned there would be a way to compensate those who are \nvictims of this difficulty. Unfortunately, certain members of the trial \nbar developed what I would call a business plan that was based on two \nfundamental principles: No. 1, venue shopping; and No. 2, a deliberate \npattern of overwhelming the legal system so the various cases could not \nbe heard on their merits.\n  Those who adopted this business plan have been tremendously \nsuccessful. They have driven 75 companies into bankruptcy. They have \ncreated enormous litigation all over the country. Unfortunately, the \noutcome in terms of the victims has not been what anyone would want, \nwith the possible exception of those who were behind the creation of \nthe business plan in the first place.\n  The net effect of what we have seen in the asbestos litigation is to \ntake an American tragedy and turn it into an American disaster, with a \nrelative pittance for the victims; an undeserved windfall for people \nwho have no health problems; and an overwhelming bumper crop of cash \nfor the trial lawyers who developed the plan in the first place.\n  There is a great uprising of demand that we do something about this. \nThat demand is legitimate. The Congress should act. We do need a \nnational solution, even though we have seen progress take place--not at \nthe Federal level but at the State level. It is very interesting to \nwatch what has been happening as various States have grappled with this \nchallenge and done their best to deal with the two problems I have \nidentified: the venue shopping and the strategy of overwhelming the \nsystem.\n  One breakthrough in this regard came from a Federal judge. Her name \nwas Janis Jack. I am told she had something of a medical background. \nShe was trained as a nurse. So when these cases came before her she \ninstinctively realized there was something fundamentally wrong with the \nmedical claims. Without going into the detail of what happened before \nJudge Jack, I quote the statements she made as she handed down her \nscathing decision:\n\n       These diagnoses were driven by neither health nor justice, \n     they were manufactured for money. The court finds that filing \n     and then persisting in the prosecution of silicosis claims, \n     while recklessly disregarding the fact there is no reliable \n     basis for believing that every plaintiff has silicosis, \n     constitutes an unreasonable multiplication of the \n     proceedings.\n\n  I pause here to say she is highlighting what I talked about before, \nthat there was a conscious business plan to overwhelm the system. She \ncalls it ``an unreasonable multiplication of the proceedings.''\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       When factoring the obvious motivation, overwhelming the \n     system to prevent examination of each individual claim, and \n     to extract mass settlements, the behavior becomes vexatious, \n     as well. Therefore, the court finds that the firm will be \n     required to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, \n     and attorney fees reasonably incurred because of such \n     conduct.\n\n  I am not a lawyer, but I understand when a Federal judge uses the \nwords ``vexatious'' it is probably not good for the people who are in \nher court listening to her. And she is requiring the law firm that \nbrought the case to pay all of the costs of the case. That has sent a \nchill throughout the plaintiff's bar who thought they had a free ride \nwith their business plan.\n  The other thing that has happened as various States have looked at \nthis has been the setting up of inactive dockets, or deferral \nregistries, two terms with which I was unfamiliar before I got into \nthis. They make eminent good sense. All they do is say to those \nplaintiffs who, in fact, are not sick: We will let your claim stand, we \nwill not dismiss it out of hand, but we will put it in an inactive \ndocket or a deferral registry. In other words, your claim cannot be \npursued until you get sick. Just because you have a doctor's \ncertificate that says you might get sick does not mean you are entitled \nto damages.\n  Interestingly enough, the fallout from Judge Jack's ruling where she \nfound that doctors had gone beyond medical practice in order to give \nthese certifications that would allow people to come forward as if they \nwere plaintiffs, means that some doctors are facing jail time and some \nlawyers are facing jail time as a result of the findings in Judge \nJack's court.\n  The combination of a judge who finally says, You need to focus on \nwhether people are ill, and State legislation that says, We will not \nallow the courts to be overwhelmed by the claims of those who are not \nill, has begun to taper off the level of asbestos cases and has caused \nsome people to say we have turned the corner; that the trust fund \nestablished in the bill before us is an idea whose time has gone; that \nit is not necessary to have a trust fund to deal with these issues. \nOthers say: No, we have to have the trust fund. We have to have the \nbill before us.\n  One of the perplexing things to me, as I listened to people in the \nbusiness community discuss this, has been to discuss how split the \nbusiness community is, how there are so many companies that come to me \npassionate in their insistence this bill be passed, or they say there \nwill be disaster going on uninterrupted into the unknown future.\n  Just as passionate are other companies who come to my office, sit \ndown with me and say: This bill is the biggest disaster we have ever \nseen. You cannot allow it to happen. If this bill happens, we will go \nout of business.\n  That is not a minor gulf between the proponents and the opponents. I \nhave tried to figure out why business men and women examining this as \ndispassionately as they can have come to\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\nsuch diametrically opposite positions. I have found, for me, what is an \nexplanation. I have prepared two charts that will demonstrate this. \nBoth of these are based on assumptions. We must understand that this \nentire debate is based on assumptions. No one really knows.\n  There are those who say the $140 billion called for in the trust fund \nwill be more than enough to take care of all of the claims. There are \nthose who say it is nowhere near enough.\n  There are those who say the claims will go down as a result of the \ntrust fund, and there are those who say the claims will increase as a \nresult of the trust fund. No matter how you slice it, every argument \neverybody is making, including the ones I will make, is based on an \nassumption that is not provable. But I have done the very best I can to \ncome up with sources that are reliable.\n  So here is why I think the business community is split. It has to do \nwith where you fall on the trust fund chart, what tier you are in, and \nbasically how much money you have to pay.\n  Here is the first list that comes up, and this is compiled by a \nconsulting firm to the bankruptcy court that looked at asbestos claims. \nI have summarized in this column of the chart, if there is no trust \nfund, the estimated liabilities of the companies listed. That means, \nArmstrong World Industries, according to the consulting firm, if there \nis no trust fund, will face a liability of roughly $2 billion. Babcock \n& Wilcox will face a liability of roughly $2 billion--and so on all the \nway down--U.S. Gypsum, $4 billion. I will come back to U.S. Gypsum in a \nminute because it helps make my point. So this is the column that shows \nthe liability of these 10 companies if the trust fund is not enacted.\n  Now, this is the column that shows what they will pay to the trust \nfund. In other words, their liability will go from this number to this \nnumber, if the trust fund is established. Here in this column is the \ndifference. For these 10 companies, it is $20 billion.\n  If I were the CEO of any one of those companies, I would be very \nstrongly for the trust fund. Now, I reject the idea this is being \ndriven by K Street and lobbyists. This is a very logical business \ndecision on the part of the CEOs of these companies, and I do not think \nany of them had anything to do with this allocation. It is the way the \ntrust fund was structured. As they read the details, they said: This \nmakes good sense for us. Let's be for it.\n  But out of this chart comes a fundamental question that I have at the \nbottom of the chart. If there is a $20 billion difference between their \nliabilities and their contributions, who will make up the difference?\n  So now let's go to the second chart.\n  On this chart is a list of companies with estimated outlays, if there \nis no trust fund, that will be substantially less than those on the \nfirst chart. Foster Wheeler--I understand this number may change. These \nare estimates. All of these numbers may change. But I have heard, just \nthis morning: Hey, we are trying to recalculate that, Senator. We want \nyou to be exactly accurate. It might be $79 million, but it may not. \nBut it will be relatively low compared to the number on the next chart. \nSo let's understand all of these.\n  But here is Foster Wheeler, Oglebay Norton. They will have no \nobligation--no obligation--if the trust fund does not pass. Why? \nBecause they have insurance. They took precautions. They have insurance \nthat will pay the claims. They will have no obligation. National \nService Industries will have $11 million if the trust fund is not \nenacted, and so on.\n  Now, Oglebay Norton will owe the trust fund $495 million in order to \nbe relieved of zero obligation if the trust fund does not pass. Who \nwill make up the difference? It will be made up by companies like \nthese, some of which earn so much lower numbers than the numbers that \nare here that this could very easily jeopardize their survival. Some of \nthe companies on this chart might not survive if the trust fund is \npassed. You have no obligation, but you have to pay half a billion \ndollars over a 30-year period?\n  There are some companies here whose total revenue is $100 million a \nyear, and their annual responsibility to the trust fund is $19 million. \nTwenty percent of their total revenues will be required, and they have \nno exposure or relatively no exposure. There is not a company here with \nexposure, no matter how high it may be, that would not be satisfied by \n2 or 3 years' contribution to the trust fund, but they are going to \nhave to make that contribution for 30 years.\n  The companies on the first chart will see their stocks go up \ndramatically as soon as this bill is passed, and I do not begrudge them \nthat. I think that is wonderful. But the other companies that will make \nup the difference will not only see their stocks fall, they may \ndisappear and see their employees put out of jobs, their employees put \non the unemployment line.\n  I do not think there was anything sinister about the way in which the \ntrust fund decisions were made. But I do not think it has been analyzed \nproperly with respect to the real-world impact of those decisions. So, \nto me, that is why we have the split in the business community, with \nsome companies saying this is a great idea, and other companies saying, \nwith some irony, over our dead body, because they may be very much \ndealing with a dead body here.\n  All right. Does that argue that we should not have Federal \nlegislation? No. The progress in the States, causing this level of \nlitigation to level out and begin to turn down, is not even throughout \nthe country. We need a national standard. Ohio has led the way. Ohio \nhas bills that are causing the litigation to begin to dry up. We are \nseeing the pattern of venue shopping dry up. But we still do not have \nany action out of California or New York. And, if I may, I remember \nwhen the Governor of Utah was once asked: What is the greatest economic \ndevelopment agency you have in Utah? And he said: The California State \nLegislature.\n\n  I think we can wait a long time before the California State \nLegislature can be depended upon to deal with this issue. So we do need \na national bill.\n  But the one thing everybody on either one of these charts wants is \ncertainty.\n  Let's go back to the first chart and the example I was talking about \nwith respect to U.S. Gypsum or USG. Within the last week or two, USG \nannounced they were setting up a reserve for their asbestos \nliabilities. They said: We are setting up the reserve with $900 million \nin cash and $3 billion in contingent notes. Their stock went up 15 \npercent the next day because their investors said there is a degree of \ncertainty.\n  Now, if you take that $3.9 billion figure they determined was the \namount of their liability and you compare it to what the consultants \nsaid their liability was--$4 billion--you are very much in the ballpark \nwith roughly the same figure. Now, the interesting thing about the \ncontingent notes they said they would sign for the $3 billion is the \ncontingency. The contingency was whether this bill passes. If this bill \ndoes not pass, they will then be on the hook for the $3 billion in \ncontingent notes. If the bill does pass, they are out with only the \n$900 million. As we see, they are only required to pay, under the trust \nfund, $797 million. So as to the $900 million, they may even get a \nrefund from that if this bill passes.\n  That demonstrates the value of certainty. They came up with \ncertainty, one way or the other, and their stock went up 15 percent. We \ncan give people certainty with the right kind of Federal bill that does \nnot have the problems that this trust fund has.\n  So what do I search for in a bill? Well, the first one should be \nobvious from the presentation I have made: a restructuring of the \nliabilities in the trust fund. And if the trust fund were to go away, \nthat would not bother me either, if we could have an understanding of \nhow we could take the experience in the States and make it work on the \nFederal level.\n  Back to Judge Jack and her rulings and the actions of the various \nStates, we discovered there really are only a few things that need to \nbe done to tame this monster.\n  The first one is to stop the venue shopping. Well, if we pass a \nFederal bill, we can do that. The Judiciary Committee has worked hard \nin that direction, and I commend them for it.\n  No. 2, building on what Judge Jack discovered, we can have the right \nkind of medical certification. All she did was force these people to \nprove they were injured and the claims went away. I am not satisfied \nthe medical certification in this bill is strong enough. I\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nwould prefer to take the kind of medical certification we have at the \nState level, particularly Ohio, and say if we can write that into the \nFederal bill, then we are on our way toward realizing Judge Jack's goal \nin eliminating those who are not medically certified.\n  The third thing we can do is adopt the position that many of the \nState courts have adopted, which simply says: You can file your claim \nif you are not sick because you think you might be, but we are going to \nput that claim in an inactive docket, or a deferral registry--pick \nwhichever term of art you prefer--and it will sit there unacted upon \nuntil you can come in and prove you are sick.\n  If we can do those three things--stop the venue shopping, get a \nlegitimate medical certification, and set up inactive dockets--at the \nFederal level, the State experience says we can solve this problem. \nWhether there is a role in all of that for the trust fund, I am not \nsure.\n  I am enormously respectful of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. \nHe is a close, personal friend and has been the entire time I have been \nin the Senate. I commend him and the members of the Judiciary Committee \nfor their efforts in working on this bill. But I do have a sense that \nin their focus on the disaster this has been throughout our history \nthey have crafted a solution that, like the generals in the Army, may \nbe the solution to the last war. They may have been fighting the last \nwar instead of addressing what has currently happened.\n  So I understand the Senator from Texas has an amendment, which I \nintend to support. I understand the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, has \na provision that presumably will affect this difference between people \non the two lists. I am interested in that. I am not sure it is the \nsolution, but I want to move in this direction. I think we need a bill. \nI want to support a bill. As the bill currently stands, I think it is \nin need of the kinds of changes I have outlined.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to commend the Senator from Utah. He and I \ncome from different parts of the political spectrum, and his life \nexperience in business and otherwise is quite different from my own \nlife experience. But I will tell you that I agree completely with your \nanalysis. I think you have carefully looked at the impact of this \npending bill on real-life companies, real-world companies, and there \nare clearly winners--and big winners--and losers--and big losers--in \nthe course of creating this trust fund.\n  Without assigning any motive as to why some companies do so well and \nothers do so poorly, I think what you have suggested as an alternative \nis the sensible middle ground. And the sensible middle ground, which I \nthink will soon be offered by the Senator from Texas, is to look at \nsuccessful efforts in States that have changed the whole environment on \nasbestos litigation.\n  I am looking to this amendment. I want to read it carefully before \nmaking any commitment on my part, but this seems to me to be the right \nmove to make, to capitalize on the State efforts before we create a \ntrust fund.\n  I would like to ask the Senator if he has any knowledge or personal \nexperience with the creation of other trust funds in the past in an \neffort to solve problems like black lung, and even in the trust funds \nthat were created by companies like Johns Manville, and whether the \ninitial estimates of cost turned out to be accurate in the long run.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator for his kind words. We will continue \nto be on opposite sides of the spectrum, but we will continue to be \ngood friends.\n  In response to his specific question: Yes, the GAO has done a study \nof Federal trust funds and has found that as a general rule, the \ncreation of a trust fund creates roughly twice as many claims as was \nanticipated at the time of their creation. This doesn't automatically \nmean twice as much money. In some cases, it means substantially more \nthan twice as much money. And in one case, it means the amount of money \nstayed the same because the amount proclaimed was less than projected.\n  The one thing we can draw from that experience is what I said at the \nbeginning of my remarks. Virtually everything we are saying about this \nis a guess. Everything we are assuming is based on an extrapolation \nbased on other assumptions. We cannot, with any certainty, say that the \ntrust fund will be sufficient or that it will not be sufficient. The \none thing that we can say with certainty is, this is how much you will \nhave to pay if the trust fund is created. That, as I say, is the reason \nfor the split in the business community. As people have done the \nnumbers, some say: I am better off in the tort system. Others say: I \nwill pay anything to get out of the tort system.\n  The trust fund needs to be manipulated, if we are going to keep the \ntrust fund, to make sure that there is a greater degree of fairness on \nthe part of those who are contributing to it.\n  This is taxation with a vengeance on the part of the Federal \nGovernment for many of these companies. And some companies are saying: \nWe are willing to pay that tax rate. Others are saying: Under no \ncircumstances.\n  It will be very interesting if a conversation is held with those \ncompanies fighting for the bill and the proposition is made, if you \nreally want the bill, will you increase the amount of your contribution \nto the trust fund so that the amount for some of these other companies \nwill go down? That will be an interesting conversation. I understand \nsome people are thinking about having it. I would like to be present \nwhen it is had, to see where we go with this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2748 to Amendment No. 2746\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself, Mr. \n     Coburn, Mr. Graham, Mr. Thune, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n     Martinez, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Smith, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n     Sununu, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Bunning, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2748 to amendment No. 2746.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in a call for \nasbestos reform. No other issue more readily highlights the toll that \nexcessive litigation has placed on our society and, even more \npoignantly, on the lives of those who are dying with asbestos-related \ndisease who are left with inadequate legal recourse and compensation by \nvirtue of the massive waive of litigation, primarily by those who are \nnot sick and who suffer no impairment as a result of their exposure to \nasbestos. Make no mistake about it: Today we are not just talking about \nliability reform, we are talking about scandal reform.\n  The legislation before us represents a genuine effort--I dare say, a \nHerculean effort--by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the \nranking member and others who have worked together with them to try to \nbring us to where we are today; that is, with a good-faith proposal to \naddress this complex problem. No one has worked harder or driven the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee harder than our chairman, Senator \nSpecter. He has tried hard to reach consensus among so many disparate \nparties and on so many different complicated issues.\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n  The question before us is whether a national trust fund of the \nmagnitude contemplated is the appropriate method to ensure victims will \nbe compensated fairly and efficiently and that the trust fund can \nreasonably expect to remain solvent and viable.\n  After countless hours of reviewing and studying the options and hours \nof working with my colleagues to achieve reform, I unfortunately \nconclude that in its current form and with its current significant \nweaknesses, it is not. Rather, I believe the likelihood is far greater \nthat the trust fund will sooner, rather than later, prove unsustainable \nand return us to the same broken tort system, then leaving thousands of \nAmericans in the wake of a failed Government program, wondering where \nto go and why they must now go back to court. This simply cannot be the \noutcome.\n\n  I offer an alternative solution, a simple solution that has been \ntested in States around the country and a solution that would target \nthe key causes of the asbestos liability crisis. I am pleased to offer \nthis amendment on behalf of 14 cosponsors: Senators Coburn, Graham, \nThune, Ensign, Inhofe, Martinez, Crapo, Bennett, Smith, Craig, Sununu, \nDeMint, Thomas, and Bunning. We are working closely with our colleagues \non the Democratic side who are looking for an alternative solution. I \ndo believe, before the close of business today, we will have bipartisan \ncosponsorship of this amendment.\n  We are looking for a solution that provides a simple but effective \napproach and one that establishes a national floor with respect to the \nmedical criteria required to bring a claim into court, one which tolls \nthe statute of limitation to ensure that victims get their day in court \nand virtually eliminates the likelihood of fraud in the medical \nscreening industry, which has proven to be a corrupt cottage industry.\n  In short, that is basically what this amendment would do. It is about \n50 pages, not 400 pages. It requires no complicated administrative \nscheme, no complex funding formulas that require a Ph.D. in economics \nto understand. There are no complex constitutional questions, no \nlitigation that will arise over the constitutionality of the proposal, \nand no real cost to the American taxpayer or, for that matter, to the \nbusinesses that would otherwise have to contribute to this $140 billion \ntrust fund. There is no question about favoring one constituency \ndifferently than another constituency. Most importantly, I am confident \nthat our solution is a system more likely to ensure that those \nindividuals who are truly sick from exposure to asbestos will receive \nfair and efficient adjudication of their claims against those who were \nactually responsible for their injuries.\n  This proposal is embraced by such a diverse group as the American Bar \nAssociation that studied it. You can imagine getting lawyers to agree, \nwith their divergent interests, on what solution to this problem would \nlikely work best and be the least disruptive to our civil justice \nsystem. They believe this is it. Indeed, our legislation would target \ndirectly the well-documented causes of the asbestos liability scandal \nplaguing our civil justice system.\n  The oft-quoted RAND Corporation, in its research, has discovered:\n\n       Almost all the growth in the asbestos caseload can be \n     attributed to the growth in the number of nonmalignant claims \n     which includes claims from people with little or no \n     functional impairment.\n\n  In other words, these are people who are not sick. Those are the main \nclaimants today under the asbestos liability system. Their research \nreveals that up to 90 percent of the plaintiffs filing claims have no \nphysical impairment, but they have clogged our courts and delayed \njustice for those who are sick with asbestos disease. These claims \nbrought by unimpaired plaintiffs often are generated through mass \nscreenings and supported by questionable medical evidence, backed by \ndoctors who do not claim to have a doctor-patient relationship but who \nwill screen thousands of x-rays and who, not surprisingly, more often \nthan not, overwhelmingly find some evidence of asbestos-related \ndisease. When those same x-rays are given a second opinion by someone \nwithout a vested interested in finding asbestos-related disease, only a \nminute fraction actually are confirmed. So this is a cottage industry \nof fraudulent claims which has further contributed to the broken system \nwe have today.\n  Under the status quo, forum shopping is rampant. For example, between \n1998 and 2000, five States captured 66 percent of the filings; 66 \npercent of the asbestos lawsuits were filed in just five States because \nof rampant forum shopping. They were the States of Texas--my State--\nMississippi, New York, Ohio, and West Virginia. It is not surprising \nthat each of these States has now enacted or is seriously considering \nenacting asbestos liability reform at the State level. The good news \nis, as the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, pointed out, these State \nreforms appear to be working. They are working because they rightfully \nfocus on the causes. So, too, should a national solution. Doctors and \nmedical providers take the Hippocratic oath which says: First, do no \nharm. We in the Congress, particularly in the Senate, have a \nHippocratic responsibility to, first, do no harm in the legislation we \npass.\n  Notwithstanding the Herculean efforts undertaken by the chairman and \nthe Judiciary Committee, I believe we cannot honestly take that oath \nand represent to the American people that we have done no harm in the \nproposal currently before us. We need an alternative which we have \noffered with this amendment.\n  The past several years have witnessed encouraging signs from States \nknown to have been havens of the worst of the asbestos litigation \nabuses. As I mentioned, States such as Texas, Mississippi, Ohio, \nFlorida, and Georgia are taking action. During the time that we have \ndebated in the Nation's Capitol what to do, the States have acted.\n  Some States have created special dockets for unimpaired claimants, \nallowing only those who are sick to proceed to trial. It makes sense. \nThe modest venue reforms and limits on consolidation have been adopted, \nand at least 4 States, including, last year, Texas, have enacted \nobjective medical criteria.\n  The Texas bill, in the context of asbestos-related claims, allows \nclaimants who are actually impaired to pursue their claims in the \njudicial system and merely defers the claims of those who are exposed \nbut not impaired. It does this by establishing medical criteria that a \nclaimant must meet to demonstrate some impairment before proceeding \nwith the lawsuit. The good news for these individuals who are not \nimpaired and have been exposed, and for the system generally, is the \nvast majority of them never will get sick.\n  Under the perverse limitations required by the statute of limitations \nthat require you to file a lawsuit or risk being forever barred under \nthe current system, they must file now, thus contributing to the huge \nclog of our court system and the bankruptcies that have racked up \nseemingly one after another. These State efforts are, in fact, working.\n  While it is difficult to assess the nationwide impact in the short \ntime they have been implemented, anecdotal evidence indicates there has \nbeen a real impact. For example, one Texas tort reform observer, in \n2006, said this:\n\n       We are still waiting on more definitive figures, but rough \n     estimate at this point--filings of new claimants in Texas \n     have dropped in excess of 50 percent since the State bill \n     passed in July. Based on the terms of the act, the time has \n     just run for claimants to file medicals to avoid the [multi \n     district litigation in Federal Court]. The effect will be \n     that at least 75 percent of pending claims will be dismissed \n     or abated. Thousands of claims from unimpaired claimants have \n     been rendered dormant and will not proceed.\n\n  Perhaps the most important point is the ones that justifiably should \nproceed because they have real manifestations of asbestos-related \ndisease will have priority, will have their day in court, and will not \nbe left with pennies on the dollar, which many are today because of the \nbankruptcies that have been created by this flood of litigation.\n  One example of the claims history of a company in Texas--we will call \nit ``company A'' because we don't want to necessarily point out or talk \nabout a particular company, but company A, between 1980 and 1996, had \n134,000 new claims. In 1987, they had 25,000. You can see the rest of \nthe numbers. The height of their claims experience was in 2001, when \nthey had 56,000 claims. In 2005, after this legislation passed in Texas \nimposing strict medical criteria, creating a dormant docket for those \nwho\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\nwere exposed but not impaired, while letting those who are sick go to \ncourt, only 13,272 claimants came forward. There has been a 77-percent \ndecline in new filings over the last 5 years. This is due largely to \nthe legislation and fair enforcement of the law in States such as \nFlorida, Mississippi, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, and Illinois.\n  Company B, in Mississippi, has experienced a 90-percent decrease in \nclaims since their legislation was enacted. The point is, some might \nsay why don't we leave this up to the States? Unfortunately, we have \nseen claims migrate to States that don't have similar reform \nlegislation, thus mandating, in my opinion, a national solution. That \nis what this amendment proposes.\n  Company C reports a significant decrease in new litigation filings \nsince September 1, 2005. This is in Texas. The mix of the claims is \nimportant because there have been zero, none, malignancy cases, and 10 \nmesothelioma claims--the most pernicious cancers that are caused by \nasbestos exposure. In terms of the other types of claims, they have \ndropped precipitously. So 34 new filings in 5 months, all malignancy \ncases, which can be adjudicated in court based upon their respective \nmerits.\n  We will go through a couple more here. Company D, in 2003, \nexperienced 32,444 filings. In 2004, that number dropped to 5,000--from \n32,000 to 5,000, roughly. In 2005, it dropped to 2,415, with 6,791 \ndismissals.\n  As we can see, there have been significant declines in the number of \nclaims, making way for people who truly are sick to have their day in \ncourt, while those who have been exposed but are unimpaired and not \nsick can preserve their claims for a later date, if and when they \nhappen to get sick.\n  The national solution we have crafted is designed to ensure that \nthose who truly are sick get their day in court, as I said. It \nestablishes specific medical criteria to be used to distinguish claims \nbetween people who are physically impaired due to exposure to asbestos \nand the claims of people who are not experiencing any physical \nproblems. This legislation will prioritize the claims of the truly sick \nthrough the use of reasonable, objective medical criteria. It requires \nphysical impairment. It requires supporting documentation to verify \nthat the claimant can demonstrate impairment based on reasonable and \nobjective medical criteria. It requires that the diagnosing physician \nactually have a doctor-patient relationship with the claimant, avoiding \nthe millions in this cottage industry doing fraudulent screenings, \nwhich has generated problems for the current system. It allows the \nclaimant who acquires a nonmalignant condition to pursue a separate \nrecovery if the person later develops an asbestos-related cancer.\n  I could go on, but I think it is clear from not only the simplicity \nof this approach, and due to the fact that it has broadly been embraced \namong organizations such as the ABA, which has both defense lawyers and \nplaintiff's lawyers and represents the legal profession generally, it \nis their considered judgment that this represents a reasonable and, in \nfact, a better solution to our current problem. It observes the \n``Hippocratic oath'' that I submit should apply to legislation as much \nas it should to the practice of medicine, that it does no harm to \nthe current system. In fact, it is narrowly focused on the causes of \nthe problems that confront our system today.\n\n  The Federal trust fund may well be a fine solution to the current \nproblem but only if structured appropriately and only if we can \nreasonably expect that it will proceed.\n  I am sorry to say that S. 852, as drafted, cannot, in my opinion, \nsucceed. It would create an unsustainable Federal entitlement, with \ncosts that would likely far exceed the $140 billion price tag presently \ncontemplated. Enacting this legislation without significant \nmodification would undermine recent State reforms and would create at \nleast as many problems as it would solve.\n  I sincerely believe this alternative amendment my colleagues and I \nhave offered today is the best hope we have of accomplishing the goal \nthat I believe all of us operating in good faith share, and that is \nensuring prompt payment for victims and allowing those exposed but not \nsick to have their day in court if and when they do become sick.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join the 14 of us who are cosponsors \nto this amendment. I predict by the close of business today we will \nhave a bipartisan amendment. We are continuing to reach out to our \ncolleagues in the Senate, and I know this is a complex issue and many \non the Judiciary Committee have spent years trying to get us to where \nwe are today. Frankly, I applaud their efforts, as I have the \nleadership of our chairman. I believe, and the cosponsors of this \namendment believe, this is the best approach; that is, to pass this \namendment and send it to the House of Representatives so we can provide \na simple and effective solution to the current asbestos scandal.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2749 to Amendment No. 2748\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before I conclude, I send a second-degree \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself, Mr. \n     Coburn, Mr. Graham, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n     Martinez, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Thune, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Smith, Mr. \n     Craig, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Sununu, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2749 to Amendment No. 2748.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing this \nimportant amendment to debate. I will ask him a question or two about \nhis amendment.\n  I think the Senator is on the right track in noting that several \nStates have made significant progress in dealing with the asbestos \nlitigation. In some States, there has been an agreement between what \nare usually warring and opposing parties as to how the system can be \nimproved. I wish to ask the Senator from Texas whether the approach he \nhas suggested to the Senate today would preempt existing State laws and \nstandards in this area?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator for his question. It is an important \none. Our intention would not be to preempt local State laws but, \nrather, to create a national forum, in a way that would provide \nuniformity and would avoid the migration of claims from those States \nthat have reform to those that do not, thus continuing the status quo.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One of the more controversial parts of the amendment \nrelates to joint and several liability, which those of us who have \npracticed law know a little more about than those who have not. If a \nState already has joint and several liability in these cases, would \nyour amendment preempt that State's joint and several liability \nstandard?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the question. This amendment \ncalls for several liability, not joint liability. The Senator raises a \ngood question and, frankly, one I want to make sure I do a little \nresearch on and confer with him, perhaps, so I can give him a more \ndefinitive answer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for allowing me to ask \na question. I thank him also for offering the amendment. It is a \nvaluable part of the debate. Parenthetically, I concur completely with \nthe Senator from Texas in the fact that many States are doing very \npositive things to deal with this issue, and I think it would be wise \nfor us to look to their leadership in some of these areas. Secondly, I \nthink he feels as I do, that the underlying trust fund has some \nfundamental flaws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak a little bit about the \nstatus of the points of order that have been discussed, at least in the \nmedia, relative to this bill, that arise from the Budget Act.\n  There are four potential issues here. One, we have not seen the final \nlanguage, so many of these have not been resolved as to their \napplicability.\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n  Talking about the one which has received a significant amount of \nattention, there is a reserve fund that was created in the last budget, \nthe purpose of which was to allow this bill to come forward. The \nreserve fund has a series of conditions attached to it, and the effect \nof the reserve fund is that it sets up the ability of the budget \nchairman to release dollars--in this case an allocation--if those \nconditions have been met.\n  As Budget chairman, I find myself in what would be called a position \nof a referee or a fair arbiter on this issue. I have views on this \nbill. I don't happen to support the bill. Those views are not relevant \nto the decision I need to make as chairman of the Budget Committee \nrelative to releasing a reserve fund.\n  The key issue on the reserve fund is whether at some point in the \nfuture taxpayers will become obligated for the claims which would be \nmade under this asbestos claims bill.\n  How do I come to a conclusion as to whether taxpayers would be \nobligated in my role as a fair arbiter or referee? Basically, I turn to \nour professional, nonpartisan, fair whistle caller, sort of like the \nreferee on the football field on an instant replay going up to the guys \nin the stands who just viewed the play and get their opinion. That \ngroup is the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office. They take a look at \nthe bill, and they score whether the bill is fully paid for. If it is \nnot fully paid for, then it is arguable, of course, the taxpayers may \nend up picking up some of the bill in the outyears, which would \nundermine the purposes of the reserve fund.\n  The initial response from CBO, which was sent to the chairman of the \ncommittee, Chairman Specter, essentially said they don't know. They \nestimate the potential income to the fund is about $140 billion. That \nis the number talked about around here. The potential administrative \ncost of the fund is about $10 billion, but they are not sure whether \nthe claims will exceed $130 billion. If they exceed $130 billion, \ntheoretically taxpayers might become liable; if not, the taxpayers \nwould not become liable. So they essentially said they don't know. \nSince they are dealing with outyear numbers, it is, to some degree, \nguesswork.\n  We have not seen the final product, but the final product was \ndelivered to CBO last night. They are now rescoring it. I don't know \nwhat they are going to say. They may come back and say, yes, it is \nclearly outside the revenues and, therefore, taxpayers may end up with \nit. They may come back and say, no, clearly it is not the final \nversion. Or, again, they might say they really can't tell.\n  Again, as referee, I have to look at this information and make a \ndecision. My inclination is that if there is no clear one-way-or-the-\nother call from CBO, that it either, A, is under, in which case clearly \nwe would release, or B, it is over, in which case we clearly would not \nrelease. If they are, rather, of the opinion this is too far out and \ntoo difficult to call and are dealing in a range of $10 billion, which \nthey were in their first letter, then it would probably be unfair--to \nstop this bill on that point of order--to the bill, to the manager, and \nto the people who believe they have a right to get a fair hearing on \nthis bill. But that final decision has not been made.\n  There are three other points of order, however, that lie whether or \nnot this point of order is made ripe. Those three other points of order \nare still potentially there. There has been representation that these \npoints of order are technical. They are not. At least one of them \ncertainly is not because it was put in place to address the issue of \none Congress binding later Congresses to major programmatic activity.\n  We will address those as we go down the road. However, I did want to \nupdate people generally on where this specific point of order relative \nto the reserve fund lies because there has been a lot of representation \nin the press, as occasionally happens, that has been a little bit off \ntarget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had hoped to engage in a short colloquy \nwith the Senator from Texas on his amendment, but I had to leave the \nfloor for a moment or two. I want to make a couple of very brief \npoints--and I will elaborate on them more extensively later--and that \nis the medical criteria bill does not do anything for the employees of \ncompanies which have gone bankrupt. There are some 77 of those, and \nmore imminently, so that we have a large group of people suffering from \nmesothelioma and other deadly, serious diseases who will not be \ncompensated.\n  Then we have the veterans who have had exposure to asbestos in a \nvariety of ways, a lot through Government work, where they do not have \nanybody to sue. So a medical criteria bill will not help them.\n  Then we have basic consideration of the medical criteria bill that \ndoes not really take these cases out of the court system. It does not \nstop the suits from being filed. It does not stop the extensive \ndiscovery process, the depositions, the interrogatories, the medical \nexaminations. When we deal with the question as to injury, it is \nsubject to contest and subject to litigation. So the medical criteria \nbill is a diversion--I wouldn't call it a poison pill because I don't \nwant to engage in any inflammatory language, but it does not do what \nthe trust fund does, and that is provide a remedy for compensation for \nthousands of very seriously ill people.\n  While I am on the Senate floor, I want to take up one other point \nbriefly while the Senator from Illinois is on the floor. He has made an \nargument--an extensive argument--about knowing who is going to put up \nthe money.\n  When I pointed out yesterday that the lists were available to him to \nknow who is putting up the money, that his staff, in fact, had looked \nat them, he then shifted his ground from not knowing who was putting up \nthe money to the specious argument that they were secret from the \npublic in general and that there is some effort to conceal something \nwhich, of course, is not the case.\n\n  Then on a mutation, he moves from that to a contention that these \npeople who had to be subpoenaed have written the bill because somehow \nthey have provided some information as to how much money is going to be \nput up, which goes into the bill.\n  I don't think I require any extensive reply to that. I think of my \nsister Shirley in Elizabeth, NJ, who likes the Senator from Illinois, \nas I do--sometimes--pointed out to me that she could see through those \narguments. But not making the materials available beyond the Senator \nand the staff--and I can see they ought to be able to copy them--I will \nstand by that--so that Senator Durbin doesn't have to look at them, his \nstaff can look at them, copy them, and show them to Senator Durbin, all \nwithin the range of confidentiality. But that doesn't mean there is \nsome secret being kept from the American people, not as long as Dick \nDurbin knows what they are; he will protect the American people. \nFrankly, so will Arlen Specter protect the American people. But it \ndoesn't mean these sinister forces have written the bill because the \nbill was written by the committee. Senator Durbin is on the committee. \nHe helped write the bill. He made amendments. I think some were even \nadopted. I won't swear to that. I know one was and then it was changed \nwhen we finally understood what it was. We adopted one in about 4 \nminutes one day--right?--and then we had to change it when we found out \nwhat it really was. We do that from time to time.\n  I have taken a look at the issue of confidentiality because I \nreserved that yesterday during the discussion. I find there are a \ncouple of provisions that are very problematic. One is section 1905 of \ntitle 18 of the United States Code which makes it an offense--and I am \nnot sure what, with the abbreviated version I have here, the penalties \nare, but it prohibits any officer or employee of the United States to \ndivulge information--I will have this printed in the Record--``which \ninformation concerns or relates to trade secrets, processes, \noperations, style of work, or apparatus,'' et cetera.\n  It is hard to interpret it without doing some more research, but I \nthink it may well cover this.\n  There is also a Senate rule, rule XXIX(5), which relates to \nprohibition against any Senator, officer, or employee of the Senate \ndisclosing secret or confidential business proceedings of the Senate. \nIt does not appear on its face to conclusively cover these kinds of \nrecords, but it may. It may be part of the records of the Senate. But I\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\nthink there is more than a colorable prohibition against disclosure on \nconfidentiality. At least at this time, I wouldn't rule it out \ncompletely. I would like to have maximum disclosure, frankly, if it can \nbe done consistent with the law and consistent with the rules of the \nSenate and consistent with fairness to the companies which provided the \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this document entitled \n``FAIR Act Transparency,'' which includes the references to which I \njust alluded, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is the Senator prepared today to tell us \nwho prepared this list, the entity he had to subpoena to get the \ninformation about how the trust fund will be funded?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am prepared to have the Senator told because I don't \nhave it at my fingertips. But I am prepared to have that information \ngiven to the Senator from Illinois. Yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         FAIR Act Transparency\n\n       Funding is guaranteed. The $140 billion in defendant \n     participant contributions to the Fund under the FAIR Act are \n     guaranteed by the manufacturers and industry.\n       Certification. The fund cannot be deemed operational until \n     the Fund Administrator publishes a list of defendant \n     participants and their required payments in the Federal \n     Register.\n       Senator Durbin's assertions that outside groups wrote the \n     FAIR Act is flat wrong. S. 852 creates an allocation formula \n     whereby contributions are based directly on a manufacturers \n     ``prior asbestos expenditure'' in the tort system. This was a \n     FORMULA created and drafted by SENATORS. Our Congressional \n     subpoena was directed at the corporations to identify, by \n     computing their ``prior asbestos expenditure'' what tiers of \n     the funding formula they would fall into.\n       Process. I have met with many Senators individually \n     including, at different times, Senator Cornyn (4/12/05) and \n     Senator Feinstein (5/10/05) on the issue of transparency. The \n     Judiciary Committee issued three subpoenas in an effort to \n     learn more about the companies likely to pay into the Fund \n     created by the FAIR Act. The subpoenas were dispatched \n     between September 30 and December 1 to groups representing \n     companies on both sides of this bill.\n       These transparency efforts led to the creation of a \n     spreadsheet with the names and anticipated tier assignments \n     of companies. The staff came up with their estimates based \n     upon publicly available information included in SEC filings \n     and data gathered through hundreds of phone calls. In light \n     of this information, Judiciary Staff held at least two \n     transparency briefings, the first of which occurred on \n     October 7, 2005.\n       All Senators and their staff can view a list compiled now. \n     This list is confidential because it includes confidential \n     information from businesses.\n       Confidentiality. In issuing the subpoenas and making \n     telephone calls, my office informed companies that the \n     information obtained would be held confidential pursuant to \n     Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate and under 18 \n     U.S.C. 1905. Rule XXIX (5) of the Standing Rules provides:\n       ``[a]ny Senator, officer, or employee of the Senate who \n     shall disclose the secret or confidential business or \n     proceedings of the Senate, including the business and \n     proceedings of the committees, subcommittees, and offices of \n     the Senate, shall be liable, if a Senator, to suffer \n     expulsion from the body; and if an officer or employee, to \n     dismissal from the service of the Senate, and to punishment \n     for contempt.''\n       Similarly, Section 1905 of Title 18 of the United States \n     Code provides:\n       Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States \n     . . . divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner . . . \n     any information coming to him in the course of his employment \n     or official duties or by reason of any examination or \n     investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or \n     filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee \n     thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade \n     secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, \n     or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or \n     source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any \n     person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association; . . . \n     . shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more \n     than one year, or both; and shall be removed from office or \n     employment.\n       In light of the foregoing, the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     reiterates what we have said from the beginning of this \n     exercise: we are prepared to share the spreadsheet with any \n     Senator or designated member of their staff. The staff may \n     even make a copy of the spreadsheet so long as they sign an \n     acknowledgement form indicating they understand the \n     information is to remain confidential pursuant to Rule XXIX \n     and 18 U.S.C. 1905.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and \nI say with genuineness that I respect him more often than not. I go \nbeyond ``sometimes'' which he said of me, and say I respect him more \noften than not. I respect his great work on this issue. This is not \neasy.\n  What the Senator is trying to do is nothing short of revolutionary. \nHe wants to close down the court system of America for hundreds of \nthousands of individuals who otherwise would go to court, to a judge or \na jury, and ask for fair compensation for their injuries.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has decided that system is wrong or \ninadequate or broken and has suggested that we are going to do away \nwith the court system in America for these victims and create a brand \nnew system.\n  That is a daunting task. I am not sure, given the 2 or 3 years that \nthe Senator has put into it, that I could even come up with a \nsuggestion that I would have confidence would work.\n  This is what we know about the trust fund and the system we are being \nasked to vote for in the Senate.\n  First, the cost of this is being estimated over a period of 50 years. \nOver 50 years, what are we likely to pay to those Americans who have \nbeen injured and died from asbestos exposure? If you will follow some \nof the best prophets and predictors in Washington, you will find them \nwoefully inadequate to predict what is going to happen next year, let \nalone in 50 years.\n  So I have challenged the Senator from Pennsylvania and those in his \ncorner, including my friend, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, to \ntell me where you came up with the figure of $140 billion. The response \nwe have been given is: Why, that is what Senators have been talking \nabout for a long time, $140 billion.\n  I think that falls short of the kind of certitude that we should have \nbefore we close down the court system of America to hundreds of \nthousands of injured people and their families.\n  The second question I asked yesterday, which we again explored today, \nis; Who is going to pay for this? Who is going to provide the $140 \nbillion, if it is not the taxpayers, to pay the people who were \ninjured?\n  I am afraid today the Senator from Pennsylvania continues along the \nsame line of reasoning. Someone--an undisclosed company--which he has \npromised he will now tell me, some undisclosed private entity decided \nwhich businesses in America would pay into this trust fund and how much \nthey would pay. A curious thing: I don't know who contacted this \nprivate group to create this information. It is certainly essential to \nthis concept of a trust fund. But the group that created the \ninformation was so loathe to share it with the Congress which is \nconsidering this bill that the chairman of the committee had to \nsubpoena the information from the company that created it for his bill \nwhich we are now considering.\n\n  It is a strange process. On the one side, the chairman of the \ncommittee would rely on this private company to determine who will pay \ninto the trust fund and how much they will pay, and then having relied \non them to write this bill to close down our court system for millions \nof Americans exposed to asbestos, he couldn't get the information from \nthem unless he sent them a subpoena demanding it under his power of the \nJudiciary Committee. At some moment in time, they produced it. Then \nwhen it came in, this information, essential to know whether this trust \nfund will work, it turns out it was marked ``committee confidential.''\n  I have been around the Senate for a few years. I was on the \nIntelligence Committee. I know when things are marked classified and \ntop secret and confidential, it is clear that they are secret. They are \nnot to be shared with the public. But what is it about this bill and \nwho is going to pay into it that is so classified and so confidential \nand so secret that the American people have no right to know? That is \nthe question I asked yesterday. Because if we are going to say to \nmillions of Americans and their families: Give up your day in court, \nwhat has been your constitutional and legal right for the 200-plus \nyears America has been in existence; give it up, trust us, we will\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\ncreate a trust fund that is going to be more fair and more generous, \nshouldn't we share with the American people the basic information that \nwas used to create this alternative to a day in court?\n  No. The chairman comes before us today and tells us he thinks it is \nillegal, it may be illegal, it may even violate Senate rules to share \nthis information.\n  I struggle with it because I think this gets to the heart of the \nmatter. If we cannot justify the cost of this trust fund over 50 years, \nif we cannot say to the American people: ``Here is how it will be paid \nfor,'' then I am afraid we are asking too much. We are asking them to \nwalk away from their American-given right for redress in our courts for \na trust fund that cannot be explained, a trust fund that was created by \nsome private company that did not even want to share the information \nthat led to its creation. That is not a confidence builder.\n  Despite my admiration for the chairman of the committee--and it is \ntruly something I would say on this floor without reservation. He is a \nman I respect very much, in a variety of ways, for his service in the \nSenate. Despite that, this bill should not be passed. This bill, which \nwill literally change the system of justice in America, should not be \npassed on such a flimsy foundation.\n  A moment ago, the Senator from New Hampshire, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, came to the floor and made an interesting statement. \nHe said he will rely on the Congressional Budget Office to determine \nwhether this trust fund will work. But if the Congressional Budget \nOffice comes back and says: We don't know, we can't tell you--maybe it \nwill and maybe it will not--I think I heard the Senator from New \nHampshire say that is good enough. If they say it will not work, OK. \nBut if they are not sure, that is good enough.\n  Is it good enough? Is it good enough for the millions of Americans \nwho are counting on us not to take away their rights as American \ncitizens to go to court when a wage earner and his or her family have \nbeen exposed to asbestos, unwillingly, unknowingly exposed and now \ncannot breathe and has a limited amount of time left on this Earth and \nbelieves that the company that sold the asbestos product should be held \nresponsible and accountable--is it good enough for us to say: No, we \nare not going to let you go to court any longer?\n  Is it fair for us to say to the housewife who--and this is a real \ncase; I am not making this up--who literally had a husband who worked \nin the asbestos industry, brought home his work clothes, piled them up \nin the laundry room, and before she stuck them in the washer she shook \nhis clothes, not knowing that she was breathing in asbestos fibers, and \nshe contracted mesothelioma, the deadly lung disease from asbestos, \nsimply by being exposed that much--is it wrong for us to say she should \nnot hold a company such as W.R. Grace and Company responsible for the \nfact that for more than 70 years they refused to disclose the danger of \nthis asbestos fiber to their workers and people who used their \nproducts?\n  I know how I feel about it. All we are asking is that that family \nhave a chance to argue their point of view in a court and let a jury of \nthat woman's neighbors and peers decide what is fair and what is just. \nThat is what is at issue here; to close the courthouse door to her and \nher family and say, no, you can no longer go before the courts of \nAmerica, the courts of your State, you have to go to a trust fund, a \ntrust fund that may get around to considering your claim, may end up \npaying your claim--all of these possibilities.\n  I am also troubled by the fact that when you take a hard look at this \ntrust fund of $140 billion over 50 years, you realize what is going to \nhappen as soon as this bill passes. Should it pass, there will be a \nrush of people filing under the trust fund, asbestos victims. Why? \nBecause the instant this bill is signed into law, anyone who has a \nclaim pending in American courts is stopped. They cannot move forward. \nThey cannot take their case any further. If they are not arguing their \ncase in trial before a jury or a judge, they are finished; closed down \nand stopped. They could have the trial scheduled that they have been \nworking for years to start next week, and they are finished the day \nthis bill is signed.\n  What will they do--all that work, all that preparation, gathering all \nthe medical records? They will start over. Sick people, dying people in \nAmerica will start over, filing the paperwork for the new system. We \nexpect a lot of them, if this bill passes, to rush in and say: Pay us, \nfor goodness sakes. We have been working at this for years. Why \nwouldn't they do that?\n  As they do, they will swamp the system. This trust fund is not \ndesigned to collect all this money from all these corporations and \ninsurance companies in a hurry. It collects it over a 30-year period of \ntime. So at the outset, if the trust fund is going to actually pay the \nvictims, they have to borrow money to do it.\n  We have had some calculations that if they borrow the money to pay \nthe claims in a timely fashion, more than a third of the $140 billion \ntrust fund will be spent on interest payments for borrowed money--more \nthan a third: $52 billion will be spent over the life of this trust \nfund.\n\n  When the Senator from Pennsylvania addressed this issue the other \nday, he was brutally frank and candid. What would we do if we ran out \nof money? What would happen if $140 billion did not compensate all the \nasbestos victims we know are out there? I have to say over the course \nof the history of asbestos that we have underestimated the potential \nclaimants time and time again. What happens if $140 billion does not \nwork? The Senator from Pennsylvania came to the floor and said: We will \nadjust the payments to the victims; the medical criteria for \neligibility. In layman's language, we will cut the victims' \ncompensation.\n  When the Senator comes to the floor and suggests that an alternative \nfrom the Senator from Texas will leave some people in the lurch, it may \nnot be as inclusive as the underlying bill, I hope he will recall his \nown words on the floor when he said if $140 billion is not enough, \nthose same victims will be shortchanged and will receive less.\n  I am going to close at this moment and say, as I said at the outset, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania accepted a Herculean assignment to try to \nreplace the court system in America. If you are going to do that for \nhundreds of thousands and maybe millions of Americans, it is a task \nthat many Senators would never accept. I salute him for trying. But I \nsay in all honesty that, as we stand here today, this will not work. \nThis trust fund will fail.\n  It will not be the first time a legislative effort will fail. Many of \nour efforts do. We try our best, but we are human. Men and women try to \ncreate laws that will make America better. Sometimes they do and \nsometimes they don't. The Medicare prescription drug plan, Part D, is a \ngood indication of something that doesn't work. It was passed 2 years \nago by this Senate and the House, was signed by the President--2 years \nto get ready to get 40 million Medicare recipients into prescription \ndrug coverage, which we all support, and we created a system which has \nbeen nothing short of a disaster, an unsalvageable fiasco. So our best \nefforts will leave some poor senior citizens without the drugs they \nneed and many others completely confused and perplexed by this \nbureaucratic mess we created called the Medicare prescription drug \nplan, Part D.\n  I think we will learn our lesson quickly, and I hope we change that \nlaw. But think about this law. What if we get this law wrong? What if \nwe say to thousands of American families with someone deathly ill in \ntheir home: You are finished in court. Walk away from all of your \nefforts for compensation. Trust us that we will create a new system \nthat will be as just and even more fair than the court system in \nAmerica.\n  If we are wrong on that one, if we make a mistake on that one, the \nhuman suffering and misery that will result goes far beyond what we \nhave seen on the Medicare prescription drug plan, Part D.\n  I don't think it is worth the risk. I think we ought to look at this \nin more modest terms and honest terms and realize that a trust fund \nwhose total amount we cannot justify, from sources that are still on a \nsecret list that cannot be seen by the American public, is not the best \nway to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from Illinois talks \nabout doing it in an honest way--we have done that. We have been \nhonest.\n  When he talks about, if we make a mistake, there will be a lot of \nhuman suffering, there is a lot of human suffering right now. It would \nbe hard to structure a substitute system which would have more human \nsuffering than you have now. We are looking at a system which is \ntotally debilitating and decimating, with the courts clogged and with \nthousands of people suffering from deadly diseases and not being \ncompensated.\n  When the Senator from Illinois makes a reference to saluting me for \ntrying, I appreciate salutes of any kind, but I am looking to the \npossibility of a salute for succeeding. I don't know how this debate is \ngoing to turn out or what is going to happen in the final vote. But I \ndo know that for more than 3 decades, nobody has been able to bring a \nbill to the floor and nobody has been able to move past a determined \neffort by the minority to block this bill with a filibuster.\n  When that effort failed late in the afternoon on Tuesday, they wanted \nto withdraw the motion, and we defeated it very soundly.\n  The Senator from Illinois says I have undertaken a Herculean \nassignment. It is a Herculean problem. I wish Hercules was around to \nhandle it. I would be glad to defer to Hercules were he here.\n  When the Senator from Illinois refers to cutting payments, that does \nnot happen unless the Congress agrees. When the administrator evaluates \nthe trust fund and finds that there may be insufficient funds to pay \nthe claims, the administrator then reports to a committee of 20, \nselected by the leaders of the House and Senate, and then they make a \nrecommendation to the Congress.\n  So it isn't a cut without having congressional action. As wise as we \nmay think we are today, there will be Senators here into the indefinite \nfuture; we hope forever. They will have the wisdom, they will make a \njudgment, and they will have the determination as to what payments are \ngoing to be made. So it is not an automatic or easy cut in payments.\n  Bear in mind that the basic remedy is to go back to the tort system, \nto go back to court. So the claimants are no worse off under the tort \nsystem than they are today, if no plan is adopted.\n  The Senator from Illinois has repeatedly challenged the establishment \nof the trust fund of $140 billion. Yesterday, he referenced a letter \nwhich he sent to me to which he has not gotten an answer. I checked \nabout the letter and I checked about what we did about the questions \nraised in the letter, and the answer was we had a briefing 2 days \nlater. We answered the questions, not by written letter but by a more \ndetailed statement from a briefing.\n  When the Senator talks about the $140 billion which was established, \nall the information was available in that briefing, and still is to the \nSenator from Illinois about projections based upon experience with \nasbestos.\n  When we talk about the Bates White report, that has been thoroughly \nrefuted. They took into account people such as manicurists and taxi \ndrivers who did not have an occupational exposure to asbestos.\n  The Congressional Budget Office came up with an analysis of Bates \nWhite, and left the Bates White report in ruins. We had a detailed \nhearing on that as we have had every time an issue has arisen.\n  The Congressional Budget Office then issued a supplemental report \nshowing that Bates White was wrong and their initial figures were \ncorrect. On page 8 of the report submitted by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, dated August 25, 2005, they have a chart where it supplements \ntheir analysis that there could be costs in the range of $120 billion \nto $150 billion, and then they come to a net conclusion of the \nprojection at $132 billion. These are projections; they are not \nguesses; they are not speculations; but they are not mathematics, \neither. They are based upon the best information available and they are \njudgment calls.\n  In the letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated December 19, \nthey included this statement after analyzing a great number of factors:\n\n       The final outcome cannot be predicted with great certainty.\n\n  I don't know what can be predicted with great certainty. I know for \nmany years I was a district attorney prosecuting criminal cases and \nhandled first-degree murder cases. The death penalty is imposed in \nAmerica is if it is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. But on a level of \ngreat certainty, that is not an attainable level, and I would say \nalmost in any field of human endeavor. I don't want to be too expansive \nin that assertion, but great certainty is not something you come by in \nthe ordinary affairs of men and government.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I wish to ask the Senator if he would \nagree with the following: If we can't say beyond a reasonable doubt or \ngreat certainty, if we reach the point where $140 billion is \ninadequate, and it cannot compensate as we called for in this bill, is \nit not true at that point there are only three options? One option is \nto go back to the businesses that contributed to the trust fund and ask \nfor more; the second is for the Government to assume the liability; and \nthe third is to reduce the payments to the victims as called for in the \nexisting legislation.\n  Is there another option I am missing?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the answer to the first question is no. \nThe answer to the second question is yes. OK?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the senator be kind enough to give me a few more \nwords? I know he has a lot.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do not know if it is possible for this Senator to give \na few words. I will try.\n  The answer is no, those are not the only options. The answer is yes, \nthere is another option. The ``yes'' answer is to go back to the tort \nsystem. Senator Biden offered that amendment in July of 2003. I am on \nit because it seemed to me that claimants should not bear the risk of \nthe failure of the trust fund, and in this bill you go back to the tort \nsystem. So the claimants are no worse off than they are now.\n  Mr. President, these letters may be part of the Record, but I want to \nbe sure they are.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from the Congressional \nBudget Office, dated August 25, 2005 and December 19, 2005, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 852, the Fairness \n     in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Mike \n     Waters (for federal costs), Barbara Edwards (for revenues), \n     and Paige Piper/Bach (for the private-sector impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Douglas Holtz-Eakin,\n                                                         Director.\n     S. 852--Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005\n       Summary: S. 852 would establish the Asbestos Injury Claims \n     Resolution Fund (the Asbestos Fund) to provide compensation \n     to individuals whose health has been impaired by exposure to \n     asbestos. Under the bill, the Administrator of a new Office \n     of Asbestos Injury Claims Resolution (the Office) within the \n     Department of Labor would administer the Asbestos Fund and \n     manage the collection of federal assessments on certain \n     companies that have made expenditures for asbestos injury \n     litigation prior to enactment of this legislation. A separate \n     Asbestos Insurers Commission would allocate other payment \n     obligations among insurers with asbestos-related obligations \n     in the United States. The Asbestos Fund also would absorb all \n     private asbestos trust funds already existing at enactment. \n     Under the bill, individuals affected by exposure to asbestos \n     could no longer pursue awards for damages in any federal or \n     state court and would submit claims to the Administrator, who \n     would then evaluate such claims and award compensation \n     according to criteria and amounts specified in the \n     legislation.\n       CBO estimates that net receipts and expenditures of the \n     Asbestos Fund would increase projected budget deficits over \n     the 2006-2015 period by about $6.5 billion (excluding debt \n     service costs).\n       We expect that sums paid into the fund would be treated in \n     the budget as federal revenues and that amounts expended to \n     pay claims and administer the fund would be considered new \n     federal direct spending. During periods when surplus amounts \n     would be collected by the fund, CBO assumes that\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\n     most of its assets would be invested in nongovernmental \n     securities. The net cash flows associated with such \n     investments would also be direct spending.\n       Over the 2006-2015 period, we estimate that payments to \n     eligible claimants, start-up costs, investment transactions, \n     and administrative expenses would total nearly $70 billion. \n     Over the same 10-year period, we estimate that the fund would \n     collect about $63 billion from firms and insurance companies \n     with past asbestos liability and certain private asbestos \n     trust funds.\n       Consequently, we expect the Administrator of the fund would \n     need to exercise the borrowing authority authorized under the \n     bill to meet the fund's obligations during this period. \n     Assuming enactment of S. 852 by the end of calendar year \n     2005, CBO estimates that almost $8 billion would be borrowed \n     during the first 10 years.\n       To evaluate the long-term financial viability of the fund, \n     CBO projected cash flows over the life of the fund--assumed \n     to be about 50 years--using a variety of assumptions about \n     the number, type, and timing of future claims likely to be \n     submitted to the fund, and alternative assumptions about \n     future inflation and interest rates. The legislation is \n     designed to produce collections totaling about $140 billion \n     over the first 30 years. CBO expects that the value of valid \n     claims likely to be submitted to the fund over the next 50 \n     years could be between $120 billion and $150 billion, not \n     including possible financing (debt-service) costs and \n     administrative expenses. The maximum actual revenues \n     collected under the bill would be around $140 billion, but \n     could be significantly less. Consequently, the fund may have \n     sufficient resources to pay all asbestos claims over the next \n     50 years, but depending on claim rates, borrowing, and other \n     factors, its resources may be insufficient to pay all such \n     claims.\n       A more precise forecast of the fund's performance over the \n     next five decades is not possible because there is little \n     basis for predicting the volume of claims, the number that \n     would be approved, or the pace of such approvals. \n     Epidemiological studies of the incidence of future asbestos-\n     related disease and the claims approval experience of private \n     trust funds set up by bankrupt firms can be used to indicate \n     the range of experience of the federal asbestos trust fund \n     might face, but those sources cannot reliably indicate the \n     financial status of the fund over such a long time period.\n       CBO estimates that the fund would face more than half of \n     all anticipated claims expenses in its first 10 years, while \n     it would receive roughly constant collections from insurers \n     and defendant firms over its first 30 years. This conclusion \n     is consistent with other forecasts that we have reviewed. \n     Because expenses would exceed revenues in many of the early \n     years of the fund's operations, the Administrator would need \n     to borrow funds to make up the shortfall. The interest cost \n     of this borrowing would add significantly to the long-term \n     costs faced by the fund and contributes to the possibility \n     that the fund might become insolvent. Under the provisions of \n     section 405, the fund would have to stop accepting new claims \n     (a process known as ``sunset'') if its current and future \n     resources become inadequate to fulfill all existing and \n     anticipated obligations, including its debt obligations.\n       Pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates \n     that enacting S. 852 would cause an increase in direct \n     spending greater than $5 billion in at least one 10-year \n     period from 2016 to 2055.\n       S. 852 contains two intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), but CBO estimates \n     that the cost of complying with those mandates would be \n     insignificant and well below the threshold established in \n     that act ($62 million in 2005, adjusted annually for \n     inflation).\n       S. 852 would impose new private-sector mandates, as defined \n     in UMRA, on certain individuals filing claims for \n     compensation for injuries caused by exposure to asbestos; \n     certain companies with prior expenditures related to asbestos \n     personal injury claims; certain insurance companies; trusts \n     established to provide compensation for asbestos claims; \n     health insurers; and persons involved in manufacturing, \n     processing, or selling certain products containing asbestos. \n     Based on information from academic, industry, government, and \n     other sources, CBO concludes that the aggregate direct cost \n     to the private sector of complying with all of the mandates \n     in the bill would well exceed the annual threshold \n     established by UMRA ($123 million in 2005, adjusted annually \n     for inflation).\n       Estimated Cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 852 over the 2006-2015 period is shown \n     in Table 1. The effects of this legislation fall within \n     budget functions 600 (income security) and 900 (interest). \n     CBO estimates that the bill would have little net effect on \n     the budget over the first five years but would add about $6.5 \n     billion to deficits from 2011 through 2015. (The longterm \n     budgetary impact of the bill is discussed in the section \n     following the ``BASIS OF ESTIMATE'' section.)\n       Basis of Estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that S. \n     852 will be enacted by the end of calendar year 2005. Based \n     on information from the Department of Labor, we expect that \n     the Asbestos Fund could become fully operational during \n     fiscal year 2007 and that certain pending exigent asbestos \n     claims would be paid by the fund in 2006.\n       CBO expects that the fund's assessments on firms and \n     insurers would be treated in the budget as revenues and that \n     payments to satisfy claims would be considered direct federal \n     spending. In addition, because the Administrator would be \n     authorized to invest the fund's balances, certain cash flows \n     associated with investments in nongovernmental financial \n     instruments also would be reflected in the budget. \n     Specifically, under the Administration's current procedures \n     for budget presentation, government funds invested in \n     nongovernmental financial instruments are recorded as \n     expenses (outlays), and the redemption of such investments is \n     recorded as a receipt (negative outlay). Under the bill, any \n     noncash assets received from 4 existing private asbestos \n     bankruptcy trust funds (such as the Manville Trust) would \n     have no budgetary impact until they were liquidated by the \n     Administrator. At that point, both the assets and any gains \n     or dividends on those assets would be recorded on the budget \n     as revenues.\n\n                                                     TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 852\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                          By fiscal year, in billions of dollars\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     2006        2007        2008        2009        2010        2011        2012        2013        2014        2015\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nClaims and Administrative\n Expenditures of the Asbestos\n Fund:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..        8.7        21.9        11.1         5.3         5.3         5.3         5.0         4.9         4.7         4.6\n    Estimated Outlays...........        8.7         5.6         8.4         9.5        10.8         6.7         5.2         5.1         5.0         4.8\nInvestment Transactions of the\n Asbestos Fund:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..          0         1.1           0           0        -1.0        -0.2           0           0           0           0\n    Estimated Outlays...........          0         1.1           0           0        -1.0        -0.2           0           0           0           0\nTotal Direct Spending:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..        8.7        23.0        11.1         5.3         4.3         5.1         5.0         4.9         4.7         4.6\n    Estimated Outlays...........        8.7         6.7         8.4         9.5         9.8         6.5         5.2         5.1         5.0         4.8\n \n                                                                   CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nCollected from Defendant Firms..        2.9         2.9         2.9         2.9         2.9         2.9         2.9         2.9         2.9         2.9\nCollected from Insurer                  1.3         4.1         5.0         5.0         5.0         1.1         1.1         1.1         1.1         1.1\n Participants...................\nCollected from Bankruptcy               4.5           0         0.4         1.6         1.6           0           0           0           0           0\n Trusts\\1\\......................\n    Total Estimated Revenues....        8.7         7.0         8.4         9.5         9.6         4.0         4.0         4.0         4.0         4.0\n \n                                                                 CHANGES IN THE DEFICIT\n \nEstimated Net Increase or                 0        -0.3           0           0         0.3         2.5         1.2         1.1         0.9        0.8\n Decrease (-) in the Deficit\n from Changes in Revenues and\n Direct Spending................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ CBO estimates the total value of cash and financial assets of the asbestos bankruptcy trust funds would be $7.5 billion in 2006 and $8.1 billion\n  when liquidated. The federal budget would record the cash value of those trust assets when they are liquidated by the Administrator to pay claims. CBO\n  estimates that assets of asbestos bankruptcy trust funds would not be fully liquidated until 2010.\nNote: Numbers in the table may not add up to totals because of rounding.\n\n       To estimate the cost of processing claims, CBO reviewed \n     prior government experience with similar compensation funds \n     and operations of privately run asbestos funds. We also \n     discussed the potential costs of administering the fund with \n     the Department of Labor. To estimate the number and types of \n     claims the Asbestos Fund would receive and when they would be \n     received, CBO reviewed a number of projections of asbestos \n     injury claims that were prepared for different purposes by \n     several private groups and individuals, including those \n     developed by the Asbestos Study Group, Navigant Consulting, \n     the National Association of Manufacturers, and Legal Analysis \n     Systems during consideration of this bill and of similar \n     legislation considered by the 108th Congress. In addition, we \n     studied the history of claims paid and projections of those \n     anticipated to be paid by the Manville Trust and considered \n     the inaccuracy of past projections of future asbestos injury \n     claims. Finally, to determine whether the Asbestos Fund could \n     be expected to collect the amount of assessments from \n     defendant companies and insurance companies that are \n     anticipated in the legislation, CBO examined financial \n     information for some of the public companies that would \n     likely be contributors to the fund and the reserves held by \n     insurance companies for asbestos claims.\n       Direct spending: To estimate the amount and timing of new \n     direct spending under S.\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\n     852, CBO considered the cost of administering the Asbestos \n     Fund and the length of time it would take following enactment \n     for the fund to be fully operational and processing claims. \n     We projected the number of claims that would be submitted to \n     the fund over the 2006-2015 period, including those claims \n     that have been filed or will be filed in federal or state \n     courts or with existing trusts but not settled by the time \n     the bill is enacted (these claims are known as pending \n     claims). To estimate the cost of paying valid claims \n     submitted to the fund, we considered the number of claims \n     likely to be submitted by persons with malignant and \n     nonmalignant medical conditions due to asbestos exposure. We \n     also estimated the net disbursements and receipts associated \n     with the fund's investment activity. Finally, we considered \n     the borrowing that might be required in each year in order \n     for the fund to pay claims.\n       Administration and Start-up of the Asbestos Fund. Based on \n     the cost of operating existing government compensation funds, \n     the operation of privately run asbestos trusts, and \n     information from the Department of Labor, CBO estimates that \n     administration of the Asbestos Fund would require a staff of \n     over 700 employees for the 2006-2015 period, costing a total \n     of nearly $1 billion over 10 years. Such administrative costs \n     would be paid from the Asbestos Fund and would not require \n     further appropriation action. For this estimate, CBO expects \n     that the Office would start accepting claims in 2006, shortly \n     after enactment. During the first three years of operation, \n     CBO estimates that the Office would receive around 185,000 \n     claims per year, but that this number would fall to an \n     average of around 60,000 for the next seven years, once all \n     currently pending claims are resolved by the fund.\n       Individuals seeking compensation from the Asbestos Fund \n     would need to file a claim with the Office within the time \n     specified by the legislation (five years from the date of \n     enactment for pending claims or five years from the date of \n     diagnosis for future claims). The Administrator would then \n     have 90 days to present a proposed decision concerning the \n     appropriate award according to the medical criteria and \n     awards values specified in the legislation. If the claimant \n     chooses to accept the award, the Administrator would issue a \n     final decision, and the Asbestos Fund would pay the claimant \n     over the next one to four years. A claimant could appeal a \n     decision by the Administrator within 90 days of its issuance \n     by requesting either a hearing or a review of the written \n     record. In those cases, a decision on the appeal would be \n     required within either 180 days or 90 days, respectively.\n       Under the bill, any claim pending on the date of enactment \n     would be stayed, unless it were already before a court. Of \n     the stayed claims, exigent claims (defined by S. 852 as those \n     claims brought by a living claimant with either mesothelioma \n     or less than one year to live, or by the spouse or child of a \n     claimant who died after either filing of his or her claim or \n     enactment of the bill) would receive the earliest attention \n     by the Administrator. Within 60 days of receipt, the \n     Administrator would be required to either approve or \n     disapprove such a claim as exigent. The bill would require \n     the Administrator to pay exigent claims within one year for \n     cases of mesothelioma, and in no more than two years for all \n     other exigent claims.\n       CBO expects that the fund would not be fully operational \n     until at least a year following enactment of the legislation. \n     Even after appointing an Administrator and Insurers \n     Commission, this start-up period would be needed to \n     promulgate detailed operating rules and procedures and to \n     recruit, hire, and train personnel to process claims and \n     manage the fund's operations. (The Energy Employees \n     Occupational Illness Compensation Program--a similar federal \n     fund serving a much smaller population--took slightly more \n     than a year to become fully operational.) During this start-\n     up period, the Administrator and the Insurers Commission \n     would also need to collect financial information from \n     thousands of firms and insurers that have made prior \n     expenditures for asbestos injury claims to set appropriate \n     assessment rates for those insurers and firms.\n       Payments to Claimants. To estimate the cost of paying \n     compensation claims under the bill, CBO reviewed projections \n     of asbestos injury claims that were presented to the Senate \n     Committee on the Judiciary during its consideration of S. 852 \n     and for similar legislation considered by the 108th Congress. \n     Such projections were based on a combination of \n     epidemiological data, projections of disease incidence for \n     the affected population, historical experience of bankruptcy \n     trusts, and projections of the number of injured that \n     would apply for compensation given the bill's medical \n     criteria and compensation award values.\n       S. 852 defines nine levels of medical impairment that \n     persons exposed to asbestos have suffered and specifies a \n     dollar amount of compensation that the fund would pay to \n     individuals who demonstrate both adequate exposure to \n     asbestos and specified medical conditions. Over time, those \n     award values would be adjusted for inflation. For the lung \n     cancer levels, the bill stipulates different awards, \n     depending on whether a claimant, currently or in the past, \n     does or does not smoke tobacco. (For example, claimants \n     having lung cancer with asbestosis would qualify for \n     compensation under level VIII; awards at this level would \n     range from $600,000 to $1.1 million, depending on the \n     claimant's history of tobacco use.)\n       To estimate the cost to the fund of compensating claimants, \n     CBO considered four categories--future claims that would be \n     made by individuals with malignant conditions, future claims \n     that would be made by those with nonmalignant conditions, and \n     claims pending on the date of enactment of the bill for both \n     malignant and nonmalignant conditions. As detailed below, CBO \n     used information from available projections and studies to \n     estimate the number of claims in each category that would \n     qualify for compensation under the medical conditions \n     specified in the bill. Individuals who are eligible for an \n     award would receive payments from the fund over a one- to \n     four-year period. For this estimate, we assumed that payments \n     for nonexigent claims would be spread equally over a four-\n     year period. We assume that claims pending for mesothelioma \n     at the time the bill is enacted would represent the exigent \n     claims and would be paid in 2006.\n       Table 2 summarizes the number of claims and total award \n     value for those claims that CBO projects for each category of \n     claims under the legislation.\n       Pending claims. Individuals who have an outstanding claim \n     with any firm filed in a court on the date of enactment of S. \n     852 would have five years to submit a claim for compensation \n     from the fund. CBO estimates that, over the first five years \n     that the fund is operational, more than 320,000 pending \n     claims would receive an award from the fund.\n       There is no comprehensive information regarding the numbers \n     and types of asbestos injury claims that individuals have \n     filed in federal and state courts or with existing trusts \n     under current law. Nor is there reliable information on the \n     numbers and award values of such claims that are settled each \n     year. In 2003, Navigant Consulting prepared an estimate of \n     the number and type of asbestos injury claims then pending in \n     federal and state courts. That information was collected to \n     inform the consideration of legislation similar to S. 852 in \n     the 108th Congress.\n\n                         TABLE 2.--SUMMARY OF ESTIMATED ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND AWARD VALUES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Initial 10-year period               Life of fund\n                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  Award Value of                  Award Value of\n                                                     Number of      claims (in       Number of      claims (in\n                                                      claims        billions of       claims        billions of\n                                                                     dollars)                        dollars)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPending Claims for:\n    Malignant Conditions........................          21,000              14          21,000              14\n    Nonmalignant Conditions.....................         301,000              11         301,000              11\n                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------\n        Total Pending Claims....................         322,000              25         322,000              25\nFuture Claims for:\n    Malignant Conditions........................          42,000              34          78,000              74\n    Nonmalignant Conditions.....................         620,000              16       1,184,000              32\n                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total Future Claims.........................         662,000              51       1,262,000             106\n    Total for All Claims........................         984,000              76       1,585,000             132\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       For this estimate, CBO used the information collected by \n     Navigant in 2003 and adjusted the data to reflect \n     developments since then. Using projections about the number \n     of claims expected to be filed in 2004 and 2005 and \n     assumptions about the pace of settlements for asbestos injury \n     cases, we concluded that the number of pending cases in 2006 \n     is likely to be larger than estimated in 2003--about 7 \n     percent larger.\n       For this estimate, CBO did not take into account the number \n     of claims that are still technically pending with at least \n     one company but have been inactive for several years. If the \n     claimants' lawyers actively seek out those individuals to \n     file a claim against the fund, the number of claimants \n     seeking compensation from the fund in the first four years \n     could be significantly higher. An award from the Asbestos \n     Fund for such individuals would be reduced by the value of \n     any other awards received for a given claim. CBO estimates \n     that the average award from the fund over the 2006-2015 \n     period for pending malignant claims would be about $650,000 \n     and\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n     that awards for such claims would total $14 billion. We \n     estimate that awards for pending nonmalignant claims would \n     average around $38,000; total awards for those claims would \n     be $11 billion over the next 10 years.\n       Future claims for malignant conditions. CBO examined \n     several projections of malignancies associated with asbestos \n     exposure. While all of those projections included claimants \n     with asbestos exposure and lung cancer but with no evidence \n     of pleural disease or asbestosis, such claimants would \n     receive no compensation under S. 852. CBO assumes that the \n     total number of claims for malignant conditions that would be \n     compensated by the fund would be near the average of the \n     various projections we examined (excluding those lung cancer \n     claimants who would not be eligible for compensation). \n     Adjusting for the time that has elapsed since the performance \n     of the studies that we examined, those studies varied from \n     65,000 to 100,000 claims for malignant diseases that would be \n     compensated by the Asbestos Fund. This estimate assumes that \n     there would be about 78,000 such claimants. We distributed \n     those cases across the categories of malignant diseases \n     specified in the bill based on the various projections and on \n     the historical distributions of such claims received by the \n     Manville Trust. On this basis, CBO estimates that the average \n     award for malignant conditions over the next 10 years would \n     be $800,000 and that the total value of awards for such \n     conditions over that period would reach $34 billion.\n       Future claims for nonmalignant conditions. The different \n     projections available to CBO of the number of nonmalignant \n     cases and their distribution among the categories specified \n     in the bill vary greatly. CBO expects that the ratio of \n     nonmalignant claims to malignancies under the bill would be \n     similar to the historical ratio of claims compensated by \n     existing bankruptcy trusts. For example, since 1995, the \n     Manville Trust has received an average of eight claims for \n     nonmalignant conditions for every claim for a malignant \n     condition. Based on those historical data and because \n     nonmalignant claimants could receive larger awards under S. \n     852 than those provided by existing trust funds, CBO \n     estimates that during the first 10 years after enactment, the \n     fund would compensate, on average, 10 new claims for \n     nonmalignant conditions for every new malignancy (including \n     claimants exposed to asbestos with lung cancer who would not \n     be eligible for compensation under the bill). CBO expects \n     that this ratio would decrease over time because of \n     reductions in the use of and exposure to asbestos. (Other \n     analysts have estimated the ratio of claims for nonmalignant \n     conditions to malignancies to be as low as 7:1 or as high as \n     17:1.) In total, CBO anticipates about 1.2 million future \n     claims for nonmalignant conditions.\n       CBO estimates that around 85 percent of claims for \n     nonmalignant conditions filed with the Asbestos Fund would be \n     eligible for medical monitoring reimbursement (level I) from \n     the fund. Such reimbursement, roughly $1,000, is the lowest \n     rate of payment specified for nonmalignant conditions. This \n     claims estimate is based on available research involving a \n     sample of the exposed population with nonmalignant conditions \n     and the history of claims filed with the Manville Trust. To \n     evaluate the history of such claims, CBO reviewed the trust's \n     estimate of how claims received under its 1995 trust \n     distribution process (TDP) would have been compensated under \n     the 2002 TDP. (The later TDP contains categories for \n     nonmalignant conditions more similar to those under S. 852.) \n     Overall, CBO estimates that, over the next 10 years, the \n     average payment for nonmalignant conditions would be about \n     $26,000 and total awards for such conditions would amount to \n     $16 billion.\n       Investments of the Asbestos Fund. Section 222 would \n     authorize the Administrator to invest amounts in the fund to \n     ensure that there are sufficient sums to make payments to \n     claimants. That section appears to imply that the fund's \n     Administrator could invest surplus amounts in private \n     securities. For this estimate, CBO assumes that the managers \n     of the fund would keep 20 percent of the investments in \n     Treasury securities and 80 percent in non-Treasury \n     securities. The current budgetary treatment of federal \n     investments in non-Treasury instruments is specified in the \n     Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Circular A-11, \n     which states that the purchases of such securities should be \n     displayed as outlays and the sales of such securities and \n     returns, such as dividends and interest payments, should be \n     treated as offsetting receipts or collections.\n       CBO estimates that investing 80 percent of fund balances in \n     private securities would result in net receipts of $200 \n     million over the 2006-2015 period. The fund would make net \n     investments in 2007, when its collections would exceed its \n     expenditures. In subsequent years when expenditures would \n     exceed collections, the difference would be made up by \n     drawing down assets from the fund, starting with any assets \n     received from other asbestos trust funds. Liquidated assets \n     and earnings from private trust funds would be considered \n     revenue in the federal budget, while the value of assets \n     privately invested by the Administrator would be recorded as \n     offsetting receipts upon liquidation.\n       For this estimate, CBO used its projections of the return \n     on Treasury securities to predict investment earnings of the \n     fund for both private securities and government securities. \n     Although private securities may well yield higher gains over \n     the long term, such investments carry much greater risk than \n     government securities. The difference between projected \n     returns on private securities and government bonds can be \n     seen as the cost investors must be paid to bear the \n     additional risk of holding private securities instead of \n     government bonds. Thus, adjusted for the additional cost of \n     risk associated with private securities, the net expected \n     returns on private securities are the same as those on \n     government securities.\n       Revenues. Receipts to the fund would come from three \n     sources: defendant companies that have spent more than $1 \n     million on asbestos injury litigation, insurance companies \n     that have made more than $1 million in such payments, and \n     existing private trust funds formed to settle asbestos \n     claims. Over the life of the fund, defendant companies would \n     be expected to contribute $90 billion, less any credits \n     granted for the establishment of private bankruptcy trust \n     funds set up after July 31, 2004 (known as bankruptcy trust \n     credits); insurance companies would be called upon to \n     contribute just over $46 billion, less bankruptcy trust \n     credits. CBO is aware of one bankruptcy trust that would be \n     eligible for such credits--the Halliburton Bankruptcy Trust. \n     CBO estimates that the bankruptcy trust credits of defendant \n     companies would total $2.4 billion over the 30-year period, \n     or $80 million per year, with the credits being apportioned \n     to all defendant companies based on their share of the total \n     amounts of payments for the year. Insurers would have an \n     estimated $1.5 billion in bankruptcy trust credits; those \n     credits would go to the insurers who paid into trusts set up \n     after July 31, 2004. All assets of existing asbestos trusts \n     (about $7.5 billion) would be transferred to the fund.\n       Defendant companies. Section 202 would specify $90 billion, \n     less any bankruptcy trust credits under section 222, as the \n     amount to be collected from defendant companies. The minimum \n     aggregate annual payment would be $3 billion, less any \n     bankruptcy credits. CBO estimates that annual payments would \n     total $2.9 billion over 30 years. For the purpose of \n     determining each firm's contribution, each one is assigned to \n     a tier based on its prior asbestos expenditures and whether \n     it is in bankruptcy proceedings.\n       The actual amounts paid by firms might differ from that \n     implied by their tier assignments because the bill would \n     allow certain exemptions for small businesses and \n     modifications of assessments, based on financial distress or \n     inequity or based on whether a firm meets the criteria for \n     being classified as a distributor. The bill also would allow \n     the Administrator to increase the amount that defendants \n     would pay if the total payments fall short of the minimum \n     aggregate annual payment amount.\n       The defendants' contributions could decline over the 30-\n     year period for two reasons. First, if more defendant \n     companies exist and make payments than CBO estimates, the \n     payments in the earlier years would exceed the minimum \n     required payment. Because the aggregate payments cannot \n     exceed $90 billion less bankruptcy credits (or a net of $87.6 \n     billion), any excess amounts paid in earlier years would \n     reduce the amounts needed to be paid in the future years. \n     Second, the required total payments could decline in later \n     years if the Administrator determines that full payment is \n     not required, and each company's assessment would decline \n     proportionately.\n       The amount the fund would collect from defendant companies \n     depends on a number of unknown factors:\n       The number of subject companies and the tiers into which \n     they would fall;\n       Which of those companies would be subject to exemption or \n     modification of their contributions and whether some \n     affiliated entities would elect to be treated separately or \n     jointly;\n       The size and nature of the assets of firms in liquidation;\n       The number and characteristics of subject firms that may go \n     into bankruptcy during the assessment period; and\n       How much funding is needed to satisfy claims and other \n     expenses of the fund.\n       Some sources have indicated that as many as 8,400 firms may \n     have paid sufficient prior asbestos claims to be covered by \n     the legislation. CBO could not verify this figure. Based on \n     information that CBO could obtain about firms that have \n     incurred asbestos litigation expenses, we estimate that about \n     1,700 defendant firms would be required to make contributions \n     to the fund under the bill. It was possible to determine the \n     likely tiers for about 500 of those firms. The remaining \n     firms were assigned equally to the two lowest tiers, based on \n     the assumption that firms with unknown tier assignments were \n     those with lower asbestos claims payments. No reduction in \n     the number of firms was made for those exempt due to size. \n     Similarly, CBO made no upward adjustment to account for \n     defendant firms not identified.\n       Tier I firms are firms that have filed for bankruptcy. \n     Revenues for tier I firms expected to emerge from bankruptcy \n     were obtained, where possible, from public sources. No \n     reliable information could be obtained about the possible \n     contributions of tier I firms that are likely to liquidate. \n     Firms that securities analysts expect to earn revenues in \n     2006 were assumed to make the required payments, and no \n     reduction in contribution was made for firms that would \n     receive hardship or inequity adjustments in their \n     contributions or for consolidated payments made by affiliated \n     groups.\n       Insurers. Section 212 would specify just over $46 billion, \n     less any bankruptcy trust\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\n     credits, as the amount to be collected from insurers over a \n     28-year period. In the case of insurers, no allocation or \n     formula for payments is specified in the legislation, \n     although the legislation does specify how much in aggregate \n     would be collected for each of the 28 years. The bill would \n     create an Asbestos Insurers Commission to determine an \n     allocation among the insurance companies. The bankruptcy \n     trust credit would represent a dollar-for-dollar reduction in \n     the amount of liability an insurer would pay under the bill \n     for any contributions to bankruptcy trusts established after \n     July 31, 2004. CBO estimates that the value of the bankruptcy \n     trust credits would be $1.5 billion. Either the allocation \n     determined by the Asbestos Insurers Commission or one agreed \n     upon by the subject companies would determine how much each \n     insurer would pay of the $46 billion total.\n       S. 852 would direct insurers to contribute an aggregate \n     initial payment of no more than 50 percent of the first \n     year's required $2.7 billion within 90 days after enactment. \n     The bill would authorize the Administrator to calculate the \n     initial payment obligations of insurers and handle other \n     matters related to the collection of the funds. However, the \n     initial payment amounts would not be considered final until \n     the Insurers Commission has been formed, promulgated its \n     allocation methodology, and issued its final determination of \n     liability of the insurers. Based on the procedural steps \n     specified in the bill, CBO expects that such determination \n     would be made in fiscal year 2007.\n       The participating insurers would pay interest on any \n     difference between their ultimate liability and the amount of \n     the interim payment. Any insurers who paid more than their \n     ultimate liability would receive interest on the excess \n     amount. The bill specifies that the interest rate on any \n     overpayments or underpayments would be the same rate. CBO \n     estimates that the fund would be able to collect the initial \n     payment from insurers by the end of fiscal year 2006 and that \n     the demands on the fund for payments would prompt the \n     Administrator to seek to collect the maximum allowed for the \n     initial payment--50 percent of the first year obligation. CBO \n     further assumes that the remaining 50 percent of the first \n     year's payment would be collected in the second year with the \n     associated interest and the second year's contribution.\n       Existing asbestos trust funds. Based on publicly available \n     information, CBO determined that the existing private trust \n     funds set up to compensate claimants currently contain about \n     $7.5 billion in assets. Under the bill, those assets would be \n     transferred to the new Asbestos Fund in the first year \n     following enactment. Until that transfer occurs, we assume \n     that claims paid by these funds would roughly equal \n     investment income. The assets of existing trusts are invested \n     in a variety of financial instruments, and only the cash and \n     U.S. obligations in these trusts would be recorded in the \n     federal budget as revenues of the government when \n     transferred. The private securities in the trusts (together \n     with any earnings) would be recorded as revenues only when \n     converted to cash or U.S. obligations.\n       Based on the financial reports of the Manville Trust, CBO \n     estimates that 56 percent of transferred trust assets (about \n     $4.5 billion) would be recorded as revenues in 2006. For this \n     estimate, we assume that the remainder of the assets would \n     only be sold as needed to finance spending in later years. \n     The proceeds of those sales would be recorded as revenues to \n     the fund at that time.\n       Offsets and guaranteed payment surcharge. The bill would \n     allow firms and insurers to reduce their individual \n     assessments by the value of any asbestos claims paid after \n     the enactment date of S. 852 and before 2007, when CBO \n     expects the fund's full operations would start. It also would \n     authorize certain payments by subject companies to guarantee \n     collection of the mandated amounts. For the purpose of this \n     estimate, CBO assumes that these provisions would have no net \n     effect on annual payments by firms and insurers.\n       Offsets for exigent claims paid during start-up of the \n     Fund. In the interim between enactment of S. 852 and the time \n     when the fund would begin full operations, defendants and \n     insurers may settle or face judgments on exigent asbestos \n     claims that the fund is unable to process or pay. Firms and \n     insurers could use those settlement amounts as a dollar-for-\n     dollar offset against their assessments, reducing the \n     payments required to be made to the fund.\n       Guaranteed payment surcharge and guaranteed payment \n     account. The Administrator of the fund could impose on each \n     defendant participant a surcharge to offset any shortfalls in \n     the annual aggregate payment amounts. If the payments by \n     defendant participants exceed the minimum aggregate annual \n     payment of $3 billion, less bankruptcy trust credits, the \n     excess amount, up to $300 million, would be set aside in the \n     guaranteed payment account as a form of self-insurance by the \n     fund, with any excess funds being carried forward to the next \n     year. For this estimate, CBO assumed that the Administrator \n     would assess a surcharge on all firms when necessary. If the \n     funds in the guaranteed payment account are insufficient to \n     ensure that the minimum annual payment is raised in any year, \n     the Administrator of the fund would be able to levy a \n     guaranteed payment surcharge on the defendant participants on \n     a pro rata basis.\n       Secondary effects on other revenue sources. The payments \n     made by defendants and insurers and the sums received by \n     claimants could affect taxable income under the federal \n     corporate and individual income tax systems. This cost \n     estimate includes no effects of those transactions on federal \n     income taxes paid by claimants or businesses. Those secondary \n     effects are likely to be insignificant in any event.\n       Payments made into the fund would be tax-deductible and \n     would thus reduce the corporate income tax liability of \n     participating firms. But in the absence of this legislation, \n     firms would have to pay asbestos damages set in the courts, \n     which would also be tax-deductible. It is impossible to say \n     with any confidence whether the amounts that would be paid \n     out by defendant firms and insurers under this legislation \n     would be higher or lower than what they would expend in its \n     absence through the tort system. The best assumption under \n     the circumstances is that the bill would have no significant \n     effect on corporate taxable income or on the government's \n     receipts from corporate income taxes.\n       Similarly, the tax treatment of payments received by \n     claimants would be unchanged from what it is now--effectively \n     excluded from taxable income and therefore having no effect \n     on taxes paid by individuals. There might be some reduction \n     in income tax receipts if a significantly larger proportion \n     of payments goes to claimants rather than to their attorneys, \n     who would pay tax on the income. But this would depend on \n     whether more claimants think they can navigate the new system \n     set up under the legislation without legal assistance than is \n     the case under the existing one--a circumstance that cannot \n     be known. CBO expects that any change in the allocation of \n     awards between attorneys and claimants would be too small to \n     significantly affect income tax receipts.\n       Budgetary impact of the Asbestos Fund after 2015: To assess \n     the long-term financial viability of the Asbestos Fund, CBO \n     considered several possible projections of the fund's cash \n     flows beyond the normal 10-year estimate of the legislation's \n     budgetary impact. When estimating such cash flows, the \n     provisions of section 405 are critical. That section of the \n     bill would sunset the fund's operations by directing the \n     Administrator to reject new claims if the fund's resources \n     (including borrowing authority) prove inadequate to pay \n     additional obligations. Under S. 852, claimants could seek \n     compensation in federal courts if the fund were to sunset. In \n     determining whether or not to sunset, the Administrator would \n     consider the unpaid costs of any approved claims and previous \n     borrowing against future revenues. Section 405 also would \n     require the Administrator to return remaining assets to \n     certain nongovernmental trust funds--but only in the event of \n     a sunset.\n       CBO estimates that total receipts to the Asbestos Trust \n     Fund over its lifetime would amount to about $140 billion, \n     including a small amount of interest earnings on its \n     balances. We estimate that the fund would be presented with \n     valid claims worth between $120 billion and $150 billion in \n     addition to any financing (debt-service) costs and \n     administrative expenses. Under the legislation, receipts to \n     the fund would be fairly evenly distributed over its first 30 \n     years. However, even if receipts exceed claims, CBO estimates \n     that more than half of the fund's expenditures for claims \n     would be paid in the first 10 years of its life. Such an \n     imbalance between when the fund's anticipated claims payments \n     would be made and when receipts would be collected would \n     require the Administrator to borrow to pay claims. Under the \n     bill, the borrowed amounts (including interest costs) would \n     have to be repaid from the fund's own budgetary resources.\n       Depending upon the precise timing and value of claims \n     presented to the fund as well as the exact revenue collected, \n     investment returns, and interest rates, the fund might or \n     might not have adequate resources to pay all valid claims. \n     For example, if the value of valid claims totaled $130 \n     billion, interest costs on the fund's borrowing might amount \n     to $10 billion, and interest earned on investments could \n     approach $2 billion, while administrative costs would add \n     another $1 billion to $2 billion. If the value of such claims \n     were significantly more than $130 billion, the fund's \n     revenues might be inadequate to pay all claims.\n       Because of the uncertainty and sensitivity of the variables \n     that affect the fund's balances, any long-term projection \n     over five decades must be viewed with considerable caution. \n     Operating the Asbestos Fund would be an entirely new \n     governmental task, and CBO and other analysts have little \n     basis for judging how the Administrator would implement \n     the legislation. The discretion available to the \n     Administrator and insurance commission with respect to the \n     allocation of costs, provision of adjustments, and levying \n     of surcharges makes the flows into and out of the fund \n     hard to predict with much reliability. Furthermore, the \n     projections that have been made in recent decades of the \n     number of asbestos claims likely to be filed were, in \n     hindsight, much too low, suggesting that there might be a \n     significant risk of underestimating the number of future \n     asbestos claims. In addition, receipts to the Asbestos \n     Fund would depend on the continued viability of the firms \n     required to pay into it, which is also uncertain.\n       The Asbestos Fund's operations are uncertain: Contributing \n     to the uncertainty of the cost to resolve claims under the \n     bill are some significant features of the claims process that \n     would only be defined after enactment of the legislation. For \n     instance, the bill\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\n     would require the Institute of Medicine of the National \n     Academy of Sciences to conduct a study to examine the causal \n     link between asbestos exposure and cancers other than lung \n     cancer or mesothelioma. If that study were to determine no \n     causal link between asbestos exposure and any of those \n     cancers, the number of claims for such conditions (level VI \n     under the bill) could decline significantly. The bill would \n     also require the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease \n     Registry (ATSDR) to conduct a study to determine if any other \n     contaminated sites pose dangers similar to those observed in \n     Libby, Montana. Because claimants from Libby would receive \n     higher minimum awards than other claimants and because the \n     bill would mandate similar treatment for any sites so \n     identified, the costs could rise depending upon which sites \n     might be judged similar to Libby and on how many claimants \n     would be affected. Also, this estimate does not take into \n     account the impact of approving any exceptional medical \n     claims, which are claims that do not fit into the defined \n     criteria but which might still receive compensation depending \n     upon the findings of specific panels of physicians. It is \n     difficult to assess how many such claims might be filed and \n     how liberally those panels might rule on the claims.\n       Past estimates of the number and value of Asbestos claims \n     have been inaccurate: Forecasts of asbestos claims made over \n     the past decade have failed to accurately predict the \n     magnitude, scope, and evolution of asbestos claims. According \n     to one witness that testified on similar legislation \n     previously before the committee, ``in every instance where \n     companies or trusts have attempted to project future asbestos \n     claims, they have always seriously underestimated.'' Most \n     estimates of future claims rely on a combination of \n     epidemiological information and statistical estimation \n     techniques using historical data. Such models contain a \n     number of potential sources of error in forecasting.\n       In 1988, experts estimated that the number of future claims \n     against the Manville Trust would range from 50,000 to \n     200,000. By January of 1991, the trust had already received \n     more than 171,000 claims. Through the summer of 2005, the \n     Manville Trust had received 690,000 claims. The most recent \n     claims forecast performed for the trust estimated that the \n     trust may receive up to 1.4 million additional claims.\n       CBO's estimates of the number and distribution of claims \n     that would be compensated by the Asbestos Fund under S. 852 \n     are based on forecasts similar to those that have been \n     prepared for the Manville Trust. Therefore, it is possible \n     that the number of claims that would be compensated under S. \n     852 could deviate in significant respects from our estimates \n     in terms of cost, timing, or both.\n       Revenue collections are uncertain: The revenue stream that \n     would be generated by the legislation is highly uncertain. \n     Although the aggregate amount of the levy on defendant firms \n     and insurers is fixed over the first 30 years, a number of \n     factors described earlier make it difficult to project the \n     annual receipts with much reliability.\n       First, identifying the defendant participants and where \n     they would fall in the different payment tiers is difficult, \n     if not impossible, without legislation requiring the \n     information to be disclosed. (Tier placement directly affects \n     the amount a defendant company would pay into the fund.) Many \n     of the prior asbestos settlements were made outside of the \n     court system and, as such, are not public record. This lack \n     of information means that the number of defendant companies \n     in each tier and the resulting payments could be either \n     higher or lower than the numbers used in preparing this \n     estimate.\n       If the number of defendants is significantly higher than \n     assumed in this estimate and if claims remain at or about the \n     level estimated, the likelihood of insufficient funding \n     available to settle claims would be reduced. At the end of \n     the first 10 years, if excess monies existed, the \n     Administrator could decrease the payments required by the \n     defendants by up to 10 percent.\n       Similar stepdowns in payments could also occur after 15, \n     20, and 25 years should funding exceed claims levels \n     sufficiently to warrant such a reduction.\n       To determine the impact of a significantly higher number of \n     defendant companies making payments, CBO estimated the \n     revenues and the resulting effects on cash flow if there were \n     an additional 650 companies in each of the two lowest tiers. \n     This scenario would result in approximately 3,000 defendant \n     companies paying into the fund and, assuming that the number \n     of claims projected by CBO is correct, the fund would be able \n     to pay all claims projected by CBO and there would be no \n     early sunset due to lack of funds to pay claims.\n       Conversely, significantly fewer defendant participants who \n     meet the criteria for payments under this bill would result \n     in higher levies on the existing defendant participants to \n     ensure the minimum aggregate annual payment of $3 billion \n     less bankruptcy trust credits. This continuing drain on \n     firms' resources could lead to more bankruptcies and even \n     higher levies on the remaining firms.\n       Thirty years is a long time-span for a business. Even under \n     ordinary conditions, economic circumstances lead many firms \n     to liquidate over time. Normal attrition will be exacerbated \n     by the costs of dealing with asbestos liability--either under \n     the current system of litigation or under the legislation \n     itself. The legislation's provisions for adjustments based on \n     inequity or financial distress might mitigate business \n     bankruptcies, but at the cost of even greater uncertainty in \n     the value of the fund's future revenue stream. The \n     legislation also would allow the Administrator to impose a \n     surcharge to guarantee payment of amounts that some firms \n     would be unable to pay. The success of this surcharge \n     depends, in turn, on estimating the attrition among firms.\n       The bill proposes no absolute deadlines concerning the \n     establishment of the Asbestos Insurers Commission. Some of \n     the tasks involved in promulgating a methodology and \n     producing final billings to the insurers are well defined and \n     have specific time frames, while time frames for other \n     activities are not clearly specified. CBO expects that \n     appointing and confirming the five members and establishing \n     the final allocation methodology for participating insurers \n     would take at least 12 months. If the process were to take \n     longer, it could delay the payments from insurers and \n     possibly necessitate more borrowing than CBO has projected.\n       Federal liability if the trust fund's resources are \n     inadequate to pay claims: So long as the fund's Administrator \n     does not borrow from the U.S. Treasury beyond the means of \n     the fund to repay such borrowing, the government's general \n     funds would not be used to pay claims. Furthermore, section \n     406 states that the legislation would not obligate the \n     federal government to pay any part of an award under the bill \n     if amounts in the Asbestos Fund are inadequate.\n       Estimated long-term direct spending effects: Pursuant to \n     section 407 of H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent Resolution on \n     the Budget, Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates that enacting S. \n     852 would cause an increase in direct spending greater than \n     $5 billion in at least one 10-year period from 2016 to 2055.\n       Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments: \n     S. 852 contains two intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     UMRA. First, it would preempt state laws relating to asbestos \n     claims and prevent state courts from ruling on those cases. \n     Second, the bill would require state governments to comply \n     with requests for information from the Asbestos Insurers \n     Commission. CBO estimates that any cost associated with this \n     mandate would be insignificant and well below the threshold \n     established in that act ($62 million in 2005, adjusted \n     annually for inflation).\n       The bill would authorize $15 million from the Asbestos \n     Trust Fund for state, local, and tribal governments to \n     monitor and remedy naturally occurring asbestos. Any related \n     costs to those governments would be incurred voluntarily as a \n     condition of receiving federal aid.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: S. 852 would impose \n     new private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA, on:\n       Certain individuals filing claims for compensation for \n     injuries caused by exposure to asbestos;\n       Certain companies with prior expenditures related to \n     asbestos personal injury claims;\n       Certain insurance companies; Trusts established to provide \n     compensation for asbestos claims;\n       Health insurers; and\n       Persons involved in manufacturing, processing, or selling \n     certain products containing asbestos.\n       Based on information from academic, industry, government, \n     and other sources, CBO concludes that the aggregate direct \n     cost to the private sector of complying with all of the \n     mandates in the bill would well exceed the annual threshold \n     established in UMRA ($123 million in 2005, adjusted annually \n     for inflation) during the first five years those mandates \n     would be in effect. CBO cannot determine the direction or \n     magnitude of the net impact of the bill's mandates on \n     claimants, defendant companies, or insurance companies over \n     the long term.\n       Asbestos injury claims: The bill would prohibit an \n     individual from bringing or maintaining a civil action \n     alleging injury due to asbestos exposure. Currently, \n     individuals can file asbestos injury claims against any \n     number of defendants in state or federal court. Under S. 852, \n     individuals would only be able to receive compensation for \n     asbestos-related injury by filing a claim with the federal \n     Asbestos Fund established by the bill. A claimant would be \n     able to recover from the fund if that person could meet the \n     bill's medical criteria, which are based on the severity of \n     the asbestos-related disease. Claims pending as of the date \n     of enactment would be stayed, except for certain pending \n     civil actions.\n       Some individuals who would receive compensation under \n     current law would not be qualified to receive compensation \n     under the bill. Further, some individuals would receive more \n     compensation for their asbestos injury claims under current \n     law, while others would receive more if S. 852 is enacted. \n     The direct cost of the mandate to claimants would be the \n     difference between the total settlements and judgments that \n     would be obtained under current law and the compensation that \n     would be obtained by claimants under S. 852.\n       Based on information from academic, industry, and other \n     sources, CBO assumes that claimants who would be deemed \n     ineligible for compensation under the bill would be \n     predominantly from the ``unimpaired'' category. Because \n     comprehensive data relating to asbestos exposure, litigation, \n     and compensation are not available, it is difficult to \n     predict the number of claimants who would receive \n     compensation and the amount of the settlements they would \n     receive under current law. Unimpaired claimants historically \n     receive multiple settlements of a few thousand dollars each \n     from as many as half-a-\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\n     dozen defendants. According to several expert sources, \n     settlements for unimpaired claimants may range in value from \n     $3,000 to $50,000 per claimant. Also, according to several \n     sources, a large proportion of claims currently pending could \n     have their settlements precluded or delayed under the bill.\n       Further, experts predict that many individuals would \n     probably receive less compensation in the first five years \n     under S. 852 than under current law. Consequently, CBO \n     expects that the direct cost to claimants of complying with \n     this mandate could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars \n     over the 2006-2010 period.\n       Assessments on defendant companies: Section 202 would \n     impose a new mandate on defendant participant companies, \n     defined in the bill as certain companies with prior \n     expenditures related to asbestos personal injury claims. Such \n     defendant companies would be required to pay an annual \n     assessment to the Asbestos Fund totaling a minimum of $3 \n     billion in each of the first five years, less any bankruptcy \n     trust credits. Defendant participants would be required to \n     pay over the life of the fund a total of not more than $90 \n     billion, less any credits.\n       Section 204 would require the Administrator of the Asbestos \n     Fund to impose a surcharge on each participant required to \n     pay contributions into the fund to make up for any shortfalls \n     in a given year due to nonpayment by some participants. The \n     amount of surcharge to be paid would be determined by the \n     Administrator. CBO expects that the Administrator would \n     assess a surcharge on all firms sufficient to compensate for \n     this loss and that the surcharge would be imposed \n     differentially on defendant companies to reflect their \n     different risks and to maintain their roughly equivalent \n     contributions. However, CBO expects that there would be no \n     surcharge on defendant companies during the first five years \n     of the mandate.\n       The amount the fund would receive from defendant companies \n     would depend on a number of factors, including the number of \n     subject companies and the tiers into which they would fall. \n     Based on data from industry and other sources, CBO estimates \n     that the defendant companies would pay $2.9 billion per year \n     into the fund over the 2006-2010 period. According to \n     industry and academic sources, defendant companies in \n     aggregate currently pay asbestos litigation and settlement \n     costs on an annual basis close to the amounts that would be \n     required by the bill in the next five years. Thus, CBO \n     estimates that the incremental costs, if any, for those \n     companies to comply with those mandates would not be \n     significant over the first five years the mandates would be \n     in effect.\n       Assessments on insurance companies: Section 212 would \n     impose a mandate on insurers with asbestos-related \n     obligations. The bill would require those insurance companies \n     to contribute to the fund, and specifies that their \n     contribution would satisfy their contractual obligation with \n     the defendant companies to compensate claimants for injuries \n     caused by asbestos. The bill does not, however, specify any \n     allocation or formula for such payments to the fund. The \n     amount of the contribution to the fund for individual \n     insurance participants would be determined by the Asbestos \n     Insurers Commission established under the bill.\n       The aggregate contributions to the fund of all \n     participating insurers would average $2.7 billion in the \n     first and second year and $5 billion in years three through \n     five. Participating insurers would be required to pay over \n     the life of the fund a total of $46 billion, less any \n     bankruptcy trust credits. Based on information from industry \n     sources, CBO estimates that insurers would pay a total of \n     about $20.4 billion into the fund during fiscal years 2006 \n     through 2010. According to industry information on asbestos \n     liability costs, insurance companies in aggregate would have \n     expected costs for asbestos claims under current law close to \n     the amounts that would be required by the bill over the next \n     five years. Thus, CBO estimates that the incremental costs \n     for those insurance companies to comply with the mandates \n     would not be significant over the 2006-2010 period.\n       Asbestos settlement trusts: Section 402 would require \n     asbestos settlement trusts, established to provide \n     compensation for asbestos claims, to transfer their assets to \n     the Asbestos Fund no later than 90 days after the enactment \n     of the bill. Such a requirement is an enforceable duty, and \n     therefore, a mandate under UMRA. Based on information from \n     the trusts and industry sources, CBO expects that such trusts \n     would transfer approximately $7.5 billion in assets to the \n     fund in 2006. The cost to the trusts of the mandate for the \n     trusts in that year would be the value of the assets net of \n     amounts that the trusts would otherwise pay for compensation \n     and administrative costs in that year.\n       Health insurance: Section 409 would impose a private-sector \n     mandate by prohibiting health insurers that offer a health \n     plan from denying, terminating, or altering coverage of any \n     claimant or beneficiary on account of participation in a \n     medical monitoring program under this bill or as a result of \n     any information discovered as a result of such monitoring. \n     This mandate would have no direct cost because such a medical \n     monitoring program does not exist under current law.\n       Ban on products containing asbestos: Section 501 would \n     prohibit persons from manufacturing, processing, or \n     distributing in commerce certain products containing \n     asbestos. The bill would require the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, not later than two years \n     after the enactment of the bill, to promulgate final \n     regulations prohibiting commerce in such products (with some \n     exceptions). In addition, the bill would require persons who \n     possess a product for the purpose of commerce that is subject \n     to the prohibition, not later than three years after the \n     enactment of the bill, to dispose of that product by means \n     that meet federal, state, and local requirements. A number of \n     products and processes still use asbestos, including brake \n     pads and linings, roofing materials, ceiling tiles, garden \n     materials containing vermiculite, and cement products. \n     According to industry and government sources, products are \n     readily available to replace products containing asbestos, \n     and the disposal of such asbestos products would not be \n     difficult. Therefore, CBO expects that the direct cost of \n     complying with this mandate would not be large.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Spending: Mike Waters and Kim \n     Cawley.

Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you requested, the Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) has studied the report prepared by Bates \n     White, LLC, concerning S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos \n     Injury Resolution Act of 2005. In particular, you asked CBO \n     to evaluate the Bates White projection of the claims against \n     the proposed asbestos trust fund from individuals with lung \n     and other cancers (identified in the legislation as disease \n     levels VII and VI). In light of that evaluation, you also \n     asked whether CBO would modify the conclusions reached in its \n     August 25, 2005, cost estimate for S. 852.\n       CBO has discussed the Bates White report with its authors \n     and officials of that firm. It has also met or spoken with a \n     number of other experts with varying views on the asbestos \n     legislation, including Judge Edward Becker, trial lawyers \n     with extensive experience in asbestos litigation, and \n     representatives of NERA Economic Consulting, the Asbestos \n     Study Group, the AFL-CIO, and Legal Analysis Systems. As a \n     result of that review and assessment process, CBO has reached \n     the following conclusions:\n       The Bates White report contains no new information that \n     would cause CBO to revise its cost estimate.\n       The Bates White report is not a cost estimate; its results \n     are therefore not directly comparable with those of the CBO \n     cost estimate. Bates White estimated the value of claims that \n     could be eligible for compensation; CBO estimated the value \n     of claims that would receive compensation. This distinction \n     is important because many potential claimants would probably \n     not file claims and not all of the claims filed would be \n     approved.\n       Two elements of the Bates White analysis are particularly \n     important, and contribute significantly to its estimate of \n     potential costs. Bates White assumes that one eligibility \n     requirement in the legislation (weighted work-years of \n     occupational exposure) would not constrain potential claims; \n     Bates White also estimates a prevalence of pleural \n     abnormalities (an eligibility requirement for claimants with \n     lung and other cancers) that is higher than other researchers \n     believe is likely.\n       The Bates White report highlights some factors that pose \n     potential risks to the financial viability of the asbestos \n     trust fund that S. 852 would establish--including the \n     possibility that the financial incentives created by the bill \n     could lead to a substantial number of claimants with disease \n     levels VII and VI. Those risks are real, but CBO believes \n     that claims of the magnitude suggested by Bates White are \n     unlikely to occur.\n       After further reviewing S. 852, studying the Bates White \n     report, and consulting with a wide range of experts on \n     asbestos legislation, CBO reaffirms the findings presented in \n     its August cost estimate:\n       The proposed trust fund might or might not have adequate \n     resources to pay all valid claims. There is a significant \n     likelihood that the fund's revenues would fall short of the \n     amount needed to pay valid claims, debt service, and \n     administrative costs. There is also some likelihood that the \n     fund's revenues would be sufficient to meet those needs. The \n     final outcome cannot be predicted with great certainty.\n       CBO projects that the proposed fund would be presented with \n     valid claims worth between $120 billion and $150 billion, \n     excluding certain potential costs or savings that CBO could \n     not estimate; total costs would be higher because the fund \n     must also cover administrative expenses and any financing \n     costs. The revenues collected under the bill would be, at \n     most, about $140 billion, but could be significantly less. If \n     the value of valid claims was significantly more than $130 \n     billion, the fund's revenues would probably be inadequate to \n     pay all claims.\n       CBO could not estimate any costs or savings that might \n     result from several features or consequences of the \n     legislation. A number of those features could add to the cost \n     of the legislation. In particular, CBO's estimate does not \n     include potential claims by individuals with older, so-called \n     dormant, asbestos\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\n     claims pending in the court system, who might seek additional \n     compensation from the fund. It also does not encompass: \n     possible claims by family members of workers who were exposed \n     to asbestos; the costs of any exceptional medical claims that \n     could be made under the bill; the potential costs for \n     residents of other areas of the country who might be deemed \n     eligible to receive the same special treatment given to the \n     residents of Libby, Montana, under the legislation; and the \n     impact on costs of allowing CT scans to serve as \n     documentation of pleural abnormalities. On the other hand, \n     CBO's estimate does not reflect the possibility that medical \n     studies required by the legislation might preclude \n     individuals with certain diseases from obtaining compensation \n     from the fund.\n       A more detailed discussion of CBO's review of the Bates \n     White report is enclosed. I hope this information is helpful \n     to you.\n       If you wish further details on this analysis, we would be \n     happy to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mike Waters.\n       Sincerely,\n                                              Douglas Holtz-Eakin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Analysis of Potential Claims Under S. 852, the Fairness in Asbestos \n                     Injury Resolution Act of 2005\n\n       As requested by Senators Specter, Leahy, and Feinstein, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has analyzed the report \n     prepared by Bates White, LLC, concerning S. 852, the Fairness \n     in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005, regarding the \n     potential cost of claims against the asbestos trust fund that \n     would be established by that act. In its cost estimate for \n     that legislation, dated August 25, 2005, CBO estimated that \n     the value of valid claims against the fund would total \n     between $120 billion and $150 billion. The Bates White \n     report, which was issued on September 19, 2005, suggested \n     that the cost of claims could be much greater.\n       CBO has discussed the Bates White report with its authors \n     and officials of that firm. It has also met or spoken with a \n     number of other experts with varying views on the asbestos \n     legislation, including Judge Edward Becker, trial lawyers \n     with extensive experience in asbestos litigation, and \n     representatives of NERA Economic Consulting, the Asbestos \n     Study Group, the AFL-CIO, and Legal Analysis Systems. As a \n     result of that review and assessment process, CBO has reached \n     the following conclusions:\n       The Bates White report contains no new information that \n     would cause CBO to revise its cost estimate.\n       The Bates White report is not a cost estimate; its results \n     are therefore not directly comparable with those of CBO's \n     cost estimate. Bates White estimated the value of claims that \n     could be eligible for compensation; CBO estimated the value \n     of claims that would receive compensation. This distinction \n     is important because many potential claimants would probably \n     not file claims and not all of the claims filed would be \n     approved.\n       Two elements of the Bates White analysis are particularly \n     important, and contribute significantly to its estimate of \n     potential costs. Bates White assumes that one eligibility \n     requirement in the legislation (weighted work-years of \n     occupational exposure) would not constrain potential claims; \n     Bates White also estimates a prevalence of pleural \n     abnormalities (an eligibility requirement for claimants with \n     lung and other cancers) that is higher than other researchers \n     believe is likely.\n       The Bates White report highlights some factors that pose \n     potential risks to the financial viability of the asbestos \n     trust fund that S. 852 would establish--including the \n     possibility that the financial incentives created by the bill \n     could lead to a substantial number of claimants with disease \n     levels VII and VI. Those risks are real, but CBO believes \n     that claims of the magnitude suggested by Bates White are \n     unlikely to occur.\n       After a careful review of the Bates White report and \n     further analysis of the legislation, CBO reaffirms the \n     findings presented in its August cost estimate:\n       The proposed trust fund might or might not have adequate \n     resources to pay all valid claims. There is a significant \n     likelihood that the fund's revenues would fall short of the \n     amount needed to pay valid claims, debt service, and \n     administrative costs. There is also some likelihood that the \n     fund's revenues would be sufficient to meet those needs. The \n     final outcome cannot be predicted with great certainty.\n       CBO projects that the proposed fund would be presented with \n     valid claims worth between $120 billion and $150 billion, \n     excluding certain potential costs or savings that CBO could \n     not estimate; total costs would be higher because the fund \n     must also cover administrative expenses and any financing \n     costs. The revenues collected under the bill would be, at \n     most, about $140 billion, but could be significantly less. If \n     the value of valid claims was significantly more than $130 \n     billion, the fund's revenues would probably be inadequate to \n     pay all claims.\n       CBO could not estimate any costs or savings that might \n     result from several features or consequences of the \n     legislation. A number of those features could add to the cost \n     of the legislation. In particular, CBO's estimate does not \n     include potential claims by individuals with older, so-called \n     dormant, asbestos claims pending in the court system, who \n     might seek additional compensation from the fund. It also \n     does not encompass: possible claims by family members of \n     workers who were exposed to asbestos; the costs of any \n     exceptional medical claims that could be made under the bill; \n     the potential costs for residents of other areas of the \n     country who might be deemed eligible to receive the same \n     special treatment given to the residents of Libby, Montana, \n     under the legislation; and the impact on costs of allowing CT \n     scans to serve as documentation of pleural abnormalities. On \n     the other hand, CBO's estimate does not reflect the \n     possibility that medical studies required by the legislation \n     might preclude individuals with certain diseases from \n     obtaining compensation from the fund.\n\n\n               The Methodology of the Bates White Report\n\n       The Bates White analysis of S. 852 is based on an \n     epidemiological analysis of the population employed in \n     industries with some potential exposure to asbestos. To \n     estimate how many claims could be presented to the fund under \n     S. 852 by individuals with both malignant conditions and \n     asbestos exposure, Bates White first estimated the size of \n     the population working in industries and positions in which \n     asbestos exposure was probable. Using estimates of the \n     lifetime incidence for individuals of developing lung and \n     other cancers that could be compensated under S. 852, the \n     authors estimated how many people could make such claims \n     under the bill by further estimating how many of those \n     individuals would develop pleural abnormalities. Evidence of \n     such abnormalities is one of the qualifying requirements for \n     compensation for disease levels VII and VI under S. 852.\n       For one of the cost scenarios in the Bates White analysis, \n     the authors reported that they estimated that the value of \n     claims from all individuals that could seek compensation from \n     the fund would sum to $300 billion over the next several \n     decades. That figure does not include any costs or savings \n     from most of the same features of the bill, mentioned above, \n     that CBO could not quantify. Bates White also presented an \n     alternative estimate that includes some of those costs, \n     bringing the total value of potential claims to nearly $700 \n     billion. Because the Bates White estimate of the value of \n     claims that could be presented to the fund far exceeds the \n     resources likely to be available to the fund, the authors \n     concluded that the fund would have to be terminated without \n     paying all valid claims.\n       The Bates White estimate includes a large number of \n     potential claims against the asbestos trust fund from \n     individuals suffering from lung and other cancers, many of \n     which would not have been caused by exposure to asbestos. The \n     report's authors believe that such claims are significantly \n     under-represented in the experience to date in the tort \n     system and existing asbestos trusts. Nevertheless, CBO \n     remains convinced that the number of such claims that would \n     be submitted to the trust fund and approved for payment under \n     S. 852 would be far fewer than suggested by Bates White. In \n     CBO's judgment, the historical experience of the Manville \n     Trust and that trust's current projection of future claims \n     against it are a more reliable basis for estimating the \n     number of future valid claims that would be filed with the \n     asbestos fund under S. 852.\n\n\nComparing the Bates White Report on S. 852 and CBO's Cost Estimate for \n                                the Bill\n\n       The Bates White report and the CBO cost estimate cannot be \n     directly compared because the estimates address different \n     questions. CBO estimated the value of valid claims that would \n     be presented to the fund's administrator. Bates White \n     estimated the value of claims that could be presented to the \n     administrator; its figures are not adjusted to indicate how \n     many individuals actually would seek and receive compensation \n     from the fund. If such adjustments were made, the Bates White \n     cost analysis might be much more in line with other estimates \n     of the likely cost for compensating claims for malignant \n     conditions.\n       In attempting to answer different questions, the two \n     analyses used different methodologies. CBO's estimate relies \n     on the projections of claims from other analyses prepared \n     with regard to S. 852 and similar legislation. Those \n     projections are grounded, in part, on the historical \n     experience of claims paid by the Manville Trust. That \n     approach reflects the observation that the Manville Trust \n     receives claims from nearly all of the individuals that have \n     brought asbestos tort claims, and the expectation that it \n     provides a reasonable model to use for projecting the number \n     and types of future valid claims likely to be filed with the \n     asbestos trust fund that would be established under S. 852--\n     particularly claims for malignant conditions.\n       The Bates White analysis of S. 852 rejects the notion of \n     using the experience of the Manville Trust to project the \n     number of claims that could be made against the proposed \n     fund, because the authors observe that not all individuals \n     with malignant conditions that could make asbestos tort \n     claims choose to do so. Bates White notes that engaging in \n     tort litigation can be costly and burdensome, and that many \n     individuals with potential asbestos tort claims choose not to \n     make such claims. The authors expect that replacing the \n     asbestos tort system with the administrative settlement \n     process specified in S. 852 would encourage many of those \n     individuals with malignant conditions and asbestos exposure \n     to make claims against the federal asbestos fund. (Bates \n     White also estimates fewer claims for nonmalignant conditions \n     than CBO projects, but the financial\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\n     impact of that decrease is much smaller than the impact of \n     its much larger estimate of the number of claims for \n     malignant conditions.)\n\n\n                 Evaluation of the Bates White Approach\n\n       During the Senate Judiciary Committee's November hearing on \n     S. 852, several witnesses voiced concerns about the Bates \n     White estimate of the number of individuals with lung and \n     other cancers that could make claims for compensation under \n     S. 852. CBO has discussed many of these issues with Bates \n     White and others who have studied the legislation, and shares \n     some of those concerns. They include:\n       Bates White may have overestimated the incidence of pleural \n     abnormalities. Pleural abnormalities are one of the \n     conditions that claimants with lung or other cancers must \n     exhibit under S. 852 to qualify for compensation. Although \n     there is broad agreement about the incidence of lung and \n     other cancers in the asbestos exposed population, there does \n     not appear to be a consensus about the extent of pleural \n     abnormalities within that population. The Bates White report \n     cites several studies as the basis for its estimate that \n     about 10 percent of its exposed population of 27 million \n     people could be expected to have pleural abnormalities. Among \n     the more heavily exposed population of-about 9 million, \n     however, Bates White estimated that the incidence of \n     abnormalities would be higher--around 24 percent.\n       NERA presented CBO with an evaluation of the studies cited \n     by Bates White for its estimate of the incidence of pleural \n     abnormalities. NERA concluded that the report overstated the \n     incidence of pleural abnormalities by at least half. The \n     incidence among the asbestos-exposed population appears to be \n     in dispute because the sample population used in some studies \n     that have measured it may not be representative of the \n     population in question. In addition, some of the studies \n     measured the incidence of pleural abnormalities based on \n     their presence in only one lung, whereas eligibility under \n     the bill would require the presence of such abnormalities in \n     both lungs. CBO has not attempted to independently estimate \n     the incidence of pleural abnormalities in the exposed \n     population, but a proportion that differed significantly from \n     that estimated by Bates White would change the results of \n     that study substantially.\n       The Bates White study does not explicitly account for the \n     work-years of occupational exposure specified by the bill. \n     Under S. 852, claimants with lung or other cancers would be \n     required to demonstrate that they experienced asbestos \n     exposure for a specific number of years, weighted by the \n     intensity of exposure and when it occurred. By not accounting \n     for the bill's weighted work-year exposure criteria, Bates \n     White has overestimated the number of individuals that could \n     file a successful claim under S. 852. CBO believes that a \n     significant percentage of potential claimants might be unable \n     to demonstrate a sufficient number of work years of exposure \n     to asbestos to qualify for compensation under the bill.\n       Meeting the bill's required weighted work-years of \n     occupational exposure to asbestos is one of the key \n     qualifying criteria--along with exhibiting pleural \n     abnormalities--for an award under the legislation. The Bates \n     White study did not directly account for this requirement. \n     The authors told CBO that most individuals in the exposed \n     population typically had long careers in the same occupation \n     or industry and that the presence of pleural abnormalities \n     was likely to indicate sufficient years of asbestos exposure \n     to meet the bill's criteria.\n       However, pleural abnormalities can occur in individuals \n     with fewer years of exposure than are required to qualify for \n     disease levels VII and VI under the bill. Consequently, \n     applying the work-year criteria could eliminate a significant \n     number of claimants who might otherwise qualify.\n       The Bates White report attempts to estimate the number of \n     individuals that could make successful claims under S. 852, \n     but does not attempt to estimate how many individuals would \n     seek to do so. There is general agreement that individuals \n     exposed to asbestos that have developed mesothelioma and \n     asbestosis have a high propensity (probably well above 70 \n     percent) to file tort claims and apply to the Manville Trust \n     for compensation. There appears to be much less agreement on \n     the propensity of individuals that have been exposed to \n     asbestos and have developed lung or other cancers to take \n     such actions. That is, in part, because there is no consensus \n     on how many individuals with lung or other cancers could \n     demonstrate that asbestos exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to their disease (the basis for \n     estimating a claiming rate). Many researchers agree that \n     claiming rates for such individuals today are much lower--\n     certainly less than half, perhaps much less--than for people \n     with mesothelioma or asbestosis. Applying a claiming rate of \n     much less than 100 percent for the Bates White estimates of \n     level VII and VI claims would substantially reduce the costs \n     presented in the Bates White analysis.\n       Bates White estimates a much larger population exposed to \n     asbestos than most other analyses. Bates White reported that \n     its estimate considered a working population of about 27 \n     million that was exposed to asbestos, a much larger number \n     than many other studies have assumed. However, the authors \n     noted that about 9 million of those people, who had medium-\n     to-heavy exposure to asbestos, accounted for about 90 percent \n     ($270 billion) of the potential claims. An asbestos-exposed \n     population of around 9 million is similar to the estimates of \n     other researchers, and CBO does not consider the size of the \n     exposed population to be a significant issue with the report.\n       How the key participants in the process--the fund's \n     administrator, claimants, and attorneys or others who assist \n     claimants--behave would have a significant impact on the \n     number of successful claims filed with the proposed asbestos \n     trust fund. The authors of the Bates White report have \n     suggested that the behavior of claimants and attorneys under \n     S. 852 would differ greatly from their behavior under the \n     current system. They expect that under the no-fault \n     administrative process outlined in the legislation, many more \n     claimants with asbestos exposure and lung or other cancers \n     would pursue claims than have done so or filed with the \n     Manville Trust. They anticipate this outcome because they \n     expect that the cost of seeking an administrative claim from \n     the fund would be much less than pursuing litigation, and \n     that the rewards for claimants would be much greater than \n     those obtained from the Manville Trust (though perhaps not as \n     large as awards obtained in some tort settlements).\n       CBO reaches a different conclusion--that the system \n     specified in S. 852 bears sufficient similarity to the \n     operations of the Manville Trust that the latter's experience \n     is a sound basis for projecting the number of most types of \n     claims under the bill. CBO's estimate of the number of future \n     claims for malignant conditions expected under S. 852 is very \n     similar to the most recent claims projection prepared for the \n     Manville Trust.\n       A number of factors make that analogy appropriate. For \n     example, whether pursuing an asbestos tort claim under \n     current law or an administrative settlement under the \n     legislation, a claimant would need to demonstrate that \n     asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor to \n     his or her cancer. Thus, just as under the current system, \n     claimants could not necessarily assume that the fund's \n     administrator under S. 852 would approve all claims. This is \n     particularly true for level VI claims, which would be \n     individually evaluated by a medical panel. The Manville Trust \n     also requires applicants to demonstrate a specific number of \n     work-years of exposure to asbestos to qualify for an award. \n     The number of work-years needed to qualify for an award from \n     the Manville Trust is generally less than would be required \n     under S. 852, so in that respect, the experience of the \n     Manville Trust could imply more claims than the federal fund \n     might actually face. Also, CBO believes that claimants to the \n     proposed federal asbestos fund would face costs and \n     procedural burdens similar to those that applicants to the \n     Manville Trust face.\n       Although the financial incentives for some claimants might \n     be greater under the bill than under the current tort system, \n     the financial incentives for attorneys to assist claimants \n     would be weaker. Attorneys play a significant role in \n     identifying claimants and pursuing their claims under the \n     current system, and would probably do so under S. 852. Most \n     claimants would probably need help preparing a claim under S. \n     852, and the bill would cap attorneys' fees at 5 percent of \n     individual awards made by the fund. By contrast, under the \n     current tort system, attorneys typically receive fees of up \n     to 40 percent of the amount awarded. Because attorneys or \n     others who might assist claimants would play such a key role \n     in the claims process, the bill's cap on fees makes it less \n     likely that the legislation would lead to a substantial \n     influx of claims that are not represented in the current \n     system.\n       Some of the attorneys whom CBO consulted suggested that \n     asbestos tort claims have recently shifted away from \n     relatively straightforward settlements, and that asbestos \n     cases today involve a significant time commitment and large \n     up-front costs to prepare for litigation, factors that may \n     deter some individuals from pursuing claims. If so, the \n     number of potential claimants to the fund proposed under S. \n     852 might be under-represented in the current tort \n     environment. But because asbestos litigation has been under \n     way for many years, CBO believes that the long historical \n     experience of the Manville Trust is the best available \n     indicator of claimants' behavior under the bill, even if the \n     current tort environment differs somewhat.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before yielding the floor, let me say \nwhat a constructive role Senator Coburn has played in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Senator Coburn has been in this body since 2004. He had been \nin the House of Representatives. He has brought his expertise as a \nmedical doctor and he has made great contributions.\n  We address some very tough medical procedures. I have said this to \nhim privately, what a contribution he has made, and there is no reason \nI shouldn't say it publicly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the bill.\n  There is one thing that is an absolute certainty: There are a ton of \npeople in this country who have bad diseases from asbestos who aren't \ngetting treatment and aren't getting cared for. That is what certainty \nis. You can bet on\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\nthat, that the problem is made worse because the trial bar is clogging \nthe courts with cases of people who do not have diseases from asbestos, \nclaiming they do. That is one of the reasons the courts want reform.\n  Having been on the Judiciary Committee during the process of this and \nvoting this bill out of committee, even though I have significant \nreservations about this bill. Let me talk a couple of minutes about \nthat.\n  It doesn't matter to me what the Congressional Budget Office says \nbecause their track record in estimating everything from the cost of \nMedicare to the benefits in capital gains taxes is usually 180 degrees \noff what actually happens. Having CBO's estimate about what is going to \nhappen with this trust fund I don't think lends any credence or \nundermines it one way or the other. Because I think they do not know, \nand I don't think anybody can know.\n  There is a second problem in this bill; that is, the problem we face \ntoday is this bill will allow people who do not have injury from \nasbestos to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars for an asbestos \nclaim when they do not have it. That deals with the medical criteria. \nIt will allow smokers who have some exposure to asbestos who develop \nlung cancer--smoking is the No. 1 cause of lung cancer--who have no \nevidence of significant disease caused by asbestos causing their lung \ncancer to be compensated for a disease that they themselves were \nresponsible for by smoking tobacco products.\n  The intended purpose of the FAIR Act is to compensate those who are \ntruly sick from asbestos exposure, without destroying the companies and \njobs and opportunities in the future. My worry with this bill is the \ndefendants and the plaintiffs will end up back in the tort system in a \nvery short period of time.\n  I am rising today to support Senator Cornyn's alternative, the \nAsbestos and Silica Claims Priorities Act. I am doing that because I \nthink it addresses the real problem.\n  If you look at the abuse in the courts and if you look at what is \nwrong with this bill, it has to do with putting people in court who do \nnot have disease from asbestos. The Cornyn Amendment has a very defined \nmedical criteria which the courts will have to follow when making \njudgments about who is eligible to file a claim on this bill.\n  A major reason the FAIR Act won't have enough money--and the major \nreason people can attack the FAIR Act in terms of the amount of the \ntrust fund--is because the medical criteria is going allow too many \npeople to be in the process who do not have disease related to \nasbestos. There have not been significant changes in the medical \ncriteria associated with this bill.\n  I tried to amend this in committee. I could not win. I have a \nsignificantly different level of knowledge on the committee than the \nrest of the members in terms of medical knowledge, having continued to \nbe a practicing physician, and I know it is going to be very difficult \nto explain all those medical issues to Members of this body to try to \nget them changed. That is why I think Senator Cornyn's approach is a \nbetter alternative.\n  We have to create a fair system in the courts for allowing those who \nare truly sick from asbestos exposure to seek compensation from those \nwho are truly responsible, rather than creating another Federal \nbureaucracy that is likely to fail.\n  More than 73 companies have already gone bankrupt, and many others \nhave suffered a great deal of financial difficulty, not because many \nsick people have sought compensation for their injuries but because \nsmart trial lawyers have learned to game the system and file phony \nclaims. These aren't faceless companies with unlimited resources. And \nthe people who are truly injured are not faceless people who didn't \ncontribute something good to the companies they worked for. The \nbusinesses, by and large, are ready and willing to right the past \nwrongs. The question is, Should they be paying when nobody is injured? \nWith the medical criteria in this bill today, a third of the claims, in \nmy estimation, will be paid to people--$50 billion will be paid to \npeople--who will file under the medical criteria, as written, who have \nno injury whatsoever from asbestos but yet these companies will be \npaying them for a perceived injury from asbestos.\n  Ninety percent of the claimants out there in the courts today who \nhave filed claims that allege to have impairment from asbestos have no \nimpairment. If you read the press stories about how the game has been \nplayed, how the B-Readers have falsely read, for payments from trial \nlawyer organizations, the chest x-rays, and the pulmonary function \ntests have been manipulated illegally to claim benefits from some of \nthese companies, you can see we cannot have loose medical criteria and \never expect to have this trust fund survive.\n  The other thing to mention--it is not mentioned much--there is a \nbackground caseload in this country of mesothelioma, cancer of the \nlining of the lung, of about 800 people a year. If there had never been \nany asbestos, 800 people a year would develop mesothelioma.\n  At my age, and for most people somewhat younger who went to any \npublic school where the ceiling tiles had asbestos components, we can \nqualify under this bill not because asbestos truly caused it. There is \nno causal effect in that low an exposure. There is no particle load \ncount at all in terms of measuring exposure, which is what we know is \nimportant. A small amount of asbestos exposure is harmless, a large \namount of asbestos exposure is terribly disease causing. When we don't \nlook at load factors, we are going to have medical criteria that make \npeople eligible who are truly not diseased from asbestos.\n  For example, there are 174,000 new cases each year in this country of \nlung cancer.\n  This is kind of a wordy chart. I don't think it is going to project \nwell. But the important thing about that is they may have no true, \nactual asbestos exposure but could claim under this system asbestos \nexposure from environmental background exposure. Most of these people \nhave lung cancer because they are smokers, and they are going to have \nlung impairment, and they are going to meet some of the requirements \nunder the medical criteria but have no true asbestos exposure.\n  If you look at that, and take 10 percent of the cases based on lung \ncancers alone, you are talking $5 billion a year. Just lung cancer \nalone times 30 years, at $5 billion a year, is more than the trust fund \nhas in it.\n  I will guarantee we will see an approach for compensation by anybody \nwho has ever had any exposure or been around asbestos, and they will \nqualify to a certain extent more or less under this bill. What if it is \n5 percent? You are still talking $78 billion. The numbers are massive.\n  If you are going to have a trust fund, you are going to have to have \nadequate medical criteria that truly reward those people and compensate \nthose people who are truly injured. If you have good medical criteria, \nthe trust fund system will work. If you do not have good medical \ncriteria, if you have very loose medical criteria, the trust fund will \nfail. We will not have solved the problem.\n\n  Either we have to get away from a trust fund program and design \nmedical criteria the courts will use, or we have to keep a trust fund \nprogram and tighten up the medical criteria in this bill.\n  The bill as written today, I believe, will fail. It will fail because \nit will be overwhelmed with claims against this trust fund by people \nwho do not have asbestos-related true disease.\n  I will give a couple of examples. Nonmalignant level 2 under the fund \nallows individuals who have obstructive pulmonary disease--people with \nemphysema, people with chronic bronchitis--to receive compensation by \nthe fund even when they do not have restrictive pulmonary diseases. \nThat is what asbestos causes, a restrictive disease, not an obstructive \ndisease. Under the criteria written in this bill, smokers who have had \nexposure to asbestos, who do not have a disease related to asbestos, \nwill be compensated under this bill.\n  Consequently this fund allows a smoker--the No. 1 cause of \nobstructive airway disease, not asbestos, but smoking--asbestos causes \nrestrictive lung disease--to receive compensation. That cannot work \nwith the fund as we see it today.\n  This fund also will compensate people for cancers where there is no \nscientific evidence whatever that their cancers are caused by asbestos. \nFor example, for colorectal cancer, there are 130,000 cases of colon \ncancer a year.\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\nThere are tons of scientific studies that show there is no connection \nbetween that and asbestos, but we have this in the bill. It is \ndependent on an IOM study, but it should not be in the bill. If new \nscience sometime later shows some connection between colorectal cancer, \nstomach cancer, or esophageal, laryngeal, and pharyngeal cancer, we can \nput it back. We are putting it in, when there is no science \nwhatsoever--and the small studies on laryngeal and pharyngeal cancer \nthat show some connection were not modified for smoking and alcohol \nuse, the No. 1 and No. 2 causes. So it is not good science.\n  Therefore, we have a large group. If you take lung cancers combined \nwith all the other cancers and put them together and you say 10 percent \nof those who are coming through will try to go to the trust fund, you \nhave $267 billion that will blow this thing wide open.\n  This trust fund, with the medical criteria it has today, will not \nwork. That is why having a bill that has specific medical criteria in \nit will work.\n  Let me be clear why I support the Cornyn substitute. The Cornyn \nsubstitute does not shut anyone out of the courts. If you think you \nhave asbestos exposure, and you want to sue, you can. But you will have \nto meet the medical criteria for it to be related to asbestos or \nsilicosis. There is no unreasonable requirement; there is just upfront \nmedical criteria that must be met to have application and that \nrequirement must apply.\n  It does not mean you cannot have your day in court. You can. You have \nto demonstrate your disease matches the medical criteria which are \nrecognized medical criteria associated with asbestos disease.\n  The other thing that is good about this bill is if you have had \nasbestos exposure and have no disease now, this does not cut you off \nfrom the future. If you develop disease that is truly related to \nasbestos, you will be able to have your day in court years--30, 40 \nyears--down the road if, in fact, you develop impairment related to \nasbestos within this medical criteria that the medical community and \nthe scientific community recognize is accurate.\n  Under this substitute, as compared to the present bill, physicians \nwill have to comply with strict scientifically sound requirements. \nThere is no room for doctors and x-ray B readers to fudge the data \nunder the Cornyn substitute. The substitute makes sense. The trust fund \nconcept will work if we have good medical criteria. We do not, so it is \nnot going to work.\n  The answer is to keep people in the court system but define the \nmedical criteria where they can win when they truly have a disease that \nis caused by asbestos, and they lose when they do not have a disease \ncaused by asbestos.\n  The science is not that hard. But we cannot take care of the trial \nlawyers and take care of all the executives who want this problem \nsolved the way they want it. They want an answer now. The answer is, \nuse what this country has used in the past: the judgment of courts \nbased on sound criteria that cannot be manipulated. Then we will get \nthis problem solved and the people who are suffering today, who cannot \nget into court because of false claims--hundreds of thousands of them \nby people who do not have asbestos-related illness--the people who are \ninjured will get compensated.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn for, first, his courage to offer a substitute. \nHe is on the Judiciary Committee. We have a great chairman. He has done \na lot of hard work on this. He has brought a bipartisan bill to the \nSenate. The bill will fail. It takes a great deal of courage on Senator \nCornyn's part to offer a commonsense alternative to this. It is my hope \nthat the many Members in this Senate will look at the trust fund with \nthe medical criteria as set out today, and reject it as it is written. \nEither modify this bill or take the Cornyn substitute and put it in its \nstead.\n  This is an issue we will spend a lot of time on. I know people are \nconsidering points of order against the legislation. In fairness to the \nSenate and also the public, if that is going to happen, they ought to \ndo it so we do not continue to spend time. Part of the process around \nhere is to make things not happen so you can have a political \nadvantage. If people are going to offer a point of order, they ought to \noffer it. Let's go on to the next thing on the agenda for the American \npeople. If they are not going to offer it, let's have a real debate, \nfile cloture, get a vote on this bill and move on.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that S. \n662, as amended, be returned to the calendar and that it not be in \norder for the Senate to consider any conference report or House \namendments to H.R. 22 if it would cause a net increase in on- or off-\nbudget direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the four 10-\nyear periods beginning in 2016 to 2055, as estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER appointed Ms. Collins, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nVoinovich, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \nCarper conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. President, I would like to take a moment to comment on the \npassage of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act.\n  Today's passage of S. 662 is a first step towards meaningful postal \nreform. The Postal Service forms a crucial part of the backbone of our \neconomy, and I am encouraged by today's action toward bringing \nmeaningful reform to the Postal Service.\n  I am optimistic that the process of resolving the differences between \nthe Senate and House bills will result in a product that goes even \nfurther to ensure that America's Postal Service has the resources and \nflexibility necessary to remain relevant and competitive in the global \nmarketplace.\n  I want to thank the chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and \nSenator Tom Carper of Delaware, for their leadership. They worked \ndiligently with their colleagues in the Senate, the U.S. Postal \nService, the administration, and kept their focus on the thousands of \npostal workers in communities across America, and the businesses which \nrely on the mail system to craft the current compromise.\n  In the past three and a half decades, the needs of the Postal Service \nhave changed dramatically. Indeed, the way we communicate has been \ntransformed by technology through e-mail, faxes, and my personal \nfavorite, Blackberries.\n  We can now pay our bills on the Internet. And online shopping is more \ncommon than catalog sales.\n  Nevertheless, the Postal Service remains a critical part of America's \neconomy. Between paper manufacturing, printing, catalog production, \ndirect mailing and financial services, the $900 billion mailing \nindustry employs 11 million workers in America.\n  And it is fair to say that we rely on the U.S. Postal Service more \nthan any other governmental service. In Nashville and Knoxville, and \ntowns all across the country, the local post office still represents \nthe heart of the community.\n  In recent years, the Postal Service has undergone some of its most \nchallenging and difficult times. In 2001 and 2003, it was hit with \ndeadly anthrax and ricin bioterrorism attacks. It was a frightening \ntime for our country's postal workers, and shook us all to the core.\n  The Postal Service has also undergone significant modernization on \nthe business side. These reforms have made the postal service more \nefficient and productive, and I applaud the leadership of Postal Master \nJack Potter who has been a steady, forward-thinking, responsible leader \nof the U.S. Postal Service.\n  I have worked with the Postmaster General on a number of occasions. \nThe attacks in 2001 and 2003 brought us together to address the public \nhealth risks of mail-born bioterrorism, and to develop better ways of \nprotecting the Postal Service's employees and America's mail.\n  And most recently, Jack and I announced the transfer of the historic \npost office on the Mississippi River in Memphis, to the University of \nMemphis for their new law school. He personally worked with me, the \ncity and the university to get this done for the Memphis community.\n  The Postal Service is in good hands, and under Jack Potter's \nleadership has significantly improved its financial performance. But in \norder for America to have a healthy and stable mail system into the \nfuture, the Postal Service needs a less cumbersome rate-setting process \nand better flexibility to respond to an increasingly competitive and \ndemanding marketplace. S. 662 takes important steps toward that goal.\n  It grants the Postal Service Board of Governors new authority to set \nrates for competitive products like express mail and priority mail, and \nreplaces the current rate-setting process for products such as first-\nclass mail, periodicals, and library mail with a more efficient, less \nlitigious rate cap-based structure.\n  The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act also transforms the \nexisting Postal Rate Commission into the Postal Regulatory Commission \nwith authority to regulate rates for noncompetitive rates and services, \nensure financial transparency, and establish limits on the accumulation \nof retained earnings, among other things.\n  I look forward to seeing more work done on this issue, but today's \naction represents the beginning of real reform to the Postal Service \nwhich will benefit the taxpayers, ratepayers, and the thousands of \ndedicated U.S. Postal Service employees.\n  Every day, we are working to keep America moving forward.\n\n\n                          u.s. postal service\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the work done by Senator \nCollins, Chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, by the ranking member Senator Lieberman, and also by Senator \nCarper. It has literally taken years to\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\nmove this important postal reform legislation.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Postal Service faces multiple \nchallenges in our changing economy. One of these challenges is how it \nshould manage its network of processing and logistics facilities. In \norder to remain competitive and maintain universal service, the Postal \nService is currently studying how best to streamline its processing and \nlogistics network and remove excess capacity. The decisions it will \nmake as part of this process will have a long term impact on many of \nthe communities and businesses that it serves.\n  Sadly, the process that the Postal Service has developed to date to \nstudy facility closures and consolidations fails to adequately allow \nstakeholders, key customers, postal employees or community leaders \nnecessary input. The current process also fails to provide an open and \ntransparent explanation to affected communities for what may be quite \ncompelling reasons underlying the decisions to close or consolidate a \nfacility.\n  I learned how completely lacking in public participation and \ntransparency this process is from my constituents in Sioux City, IA. \nUntil I convened a meeting with postal officials in my office last \nweek, the Sioux City community had been unable to get any information \nfrom the Postal Service about the timing or reasons for the proposed \nconsolidation of a mail processing and distribution center there with a \nsimilar facility in another state.\n  Senators Collins, Lieberman, and Carper have agreed to include \nlanguage in S. 662 that would ensure that this does not happen. This \nlanguage does not stop the Postal Service from studying consolidation \noptions for its processing operations. What it does do is require that \nthe Postal Service revise the area mail processing study process by \nwhich it analyzes which of its processing facilities should be closed \nor consolidated.\n  While the language does not prevent the Postal Service from \nproceeding with ongoing area mail processing studies on consolidation \nof specific facilities, it does provide that no facility closing or \nconsolidation may actually be implemented until the Postal Service has \nmet the requirements of public notice, transparency and public input \nspecified in new section 302(c)(3)(D)(i-iv) .\n  The new language requires that the Postal Service's decisionmaking \nprocess be transparent, with any analyses made available to the \ncommunity upon request. It will also require that the businesses and \ncommunities affected by proposed consolidations of Postal Service \nfacilities have the opportunity to provide input and guarantees that \ntheir concerns and advice are taken fully into account by the Postal \nService before the Postal Service issues a decision on a closure or \nconsolidation.\n  The first section of the amendment provides that the Postal Service \nnotify an affected community about the potential of a facility being \nclosed or consolidated in their district; such notification will be \nprovided at the beginning stage of the matter or as soon as the Postal \nService makes a decision to begin reviewing the matter. The Postal \nService should do their best to ensure that this notification reaches \nall of businesses, residents, employees, government entities, and other \norganizations that depend on the facility.\n  The second section will require the Postal Service to make available \nto the community, upon request, any data, analyses, or other \ninformation that is being considered by the Postal Service as part of \nits decisionmaking process. This will ensure that the Postal Service's \ndecisionmaking analysis on this matter is transparent.\n  The third section will allow the affected members of the community \nample opportunity to provide input on the proposed decision. This will \nensure that the community has the chance to provide valuable input into \nthe decisionmaking process.\n  The fourth section requires the Postal Service to take community \ninput into account prior to making a final decision at the district \nlevel. Once the district level decision on consolidation is made, which \nincludes taking the community input into account, the district level \nrecommendation can then be forwarded to the next decisionmaking step at \nthe regional level. It is worth noting that the community served by a \npostal facility can be a valuable information resource and that it \nshould benefit the Postal Service to listen to the community's \nsuggestions as they seek to arrive at a result that works for them, \ntheir customers and those they serve.\n  Mr. CARPER. While I fully support efforts by the Postal Service to \nrationalize its processing operations, I also believe that the Postal \nService can engage in consolidation decisions that are rational and \njustified and can withstand public scrutiny. I believe that this \nlanguage will improve the consolidation process, and I was pleased to \nwork with my colleague from Iowa in drafting it. I believe that the \nlanguage strikes the appropriate balance by not stopping the Postal \nService from studying proposed consolidations of particular facilities, \nwhile at the same time requiring the Postal Service to meet some basic \nobligations to its customer and affected communities before a \nconsolidation can be implemented.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am pleased to lend my strong support to adding this \nprovision to S. 622 in order to improve the procedures by which the \nPostal Service consolidates its mail processing operations. The \nproblems local communities are encountering from the Postal Service's \nconsolidations hit home for me in Waterbury, CT. Connecticut residents \naffected by the Postal Service's decision to close its Waterbury mail \nprocessing center have a right to participate in a process that is \ntransparent and open. This new provision in S. 622 will help ensure \nthat, when the Postal Service streamlines its mail processing or \nlogistics network, it gives adequate public notice and takes other \nsteps to be sure that those who are potentially affected--including \npostal customers, postal employees, and other businesses and \nindividuals in the community--have an opportunity to understand and \nprovide input into the Postal Service's decision before facilities are \nconsolidated or closed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Oil Drilling\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to call to the \nattention of the Senate that over the past couple of days the question \nof drilling for oil off the coast of Florida has been joined. Indeed, \nthe question and the debate has accelerated.\n  Yesterday, the Department of the Interior offered their proposed new \nalignment of the Gulf of Mexico and the central planning area where \ndrilling for oil will occur and the eastern planning area where oil \ndrilling will not occur.\n  As we have speculated for some period of time, when the Department of \nthe Interior published in the Federal Register that State boundaries \nwere going to be redrawn so that the boundaries of the State of \nLouisiana, indeed, went into the waters off of the State of Florida, we \ncould well speculate, with some justification, that indeed that was \ngoing to be the plan. That, in fact, was the plan offered yesterday by \nthe Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, for the next 5 years in the \nOuter Continental Shelf.\n  The Secretary's plan increases the drilling in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico off the State of Florida by 2 million acres. That was \nsimultaneously followed by the filing of a bill by the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, which would encompass \nalmost the entirety of an area not included in the moratorium on the \nOuter Continental Shelf, known as lease sale 181.\n  The essence of the proposal by the Senator from New Mexico is to \ndrill for oil and gas in an area of 4 million acres, in a bulge which \nbulges out from the imaginary Florida-Alabama line into the waters off \nthe State of Florida.\n  This senior Senator from Florida, joined by my colleague, Senator \nMartinez, recognizing this was coming, laid out a plan last week--a \nplan that would allow some drilling in a part of\n\n[[Page S944]]\n\nlease sale 181 but far from the Florida coast--indeed, 260 miles west \nof Tampa Bay and Clearwater Beach, that from Pensacola, FL, in the \npanhandle, would be 150 miles to the south but then would honor the so-\ncalled ``military mission line,'' about which Secretary of Defense Don \nRumsfeld stated in a letter before Christmas that oil and gas drilling \nin that area, which has been restricted space because we train and test \nour military weapons, would not be compatible; to use his words: It \nwould be incompatible with military objectives, with military \npreparedness through our training and testing in the waters, off the \nwaters, and around the waters of the Gulf of Mexico off Florida.\n  Therefore, Senator Martinez and I proposed a line that would honor \nthe request of the Department of Defense. That request was corroborated \nthe day before yesterday in front of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, when this Senator put the question to Secretary Rumsfeld, \nagain in the form of thanking him for his clear statement, and he \nacknowledged that statement again.\n  Where does this leave us? We must continue to have this fight.\n  We have the prodrilling forces, as evidenced by Senator Domenici and \nhis proposal wanting additional drilling off the coast of Florida. We \nhave a more modest proposal by the Secretary of the Interior, who \nconsulted with a couple of dozen oil companies and their proposal, and \nwe have the proposal of the two Senators from Florida, recognizing \nthere is much at stake beyond drilling.\n  The stakes are very high, not even to speak of Florida's economy, \nwhich is certainly evidenced by a $50 billion a year tourism industry \nwhich depends on pristine beaches, without oilspills the likes of which \noccurred last week in Alaska.\n  When people say: Oh, it is gas that we want to drill, not oil, \nignoring the fact that one of the largest and most costly oil spills \noccurred when a gas rig blew off the coast of California in 1968, \ncausing this massive oilspill, which led to the enactment of a \nmoratorium of all drilling off the Continental Shelf of the United \nStates.\n  Certainly, economic interests of our State are clearly one component. \nBut there is another component; that is, we have bays and estuaries \nwhere so much of our marine life is spawned where the delicate \nenvironment would be savaged with an oilspill.\n\n  People said it would be far from Florida shores, but winds and \ncurrents do not understand mileage. Indeed, there is that current that \ncomes up into the Gulf of Mexico in a northward arc off of the Yucatan \nPeninsula of Mexico and then turns southward and comes around the \nFlorida Keys, then northward it is the current known as the Gulf \nStream.\n  The idea that long distances are going to protect the delicate \nenvironment, I hope that can be recognized as a false argument.\n  Another component of the argument is simply that there is very little \noil out there. They have had several dry holes. The geology shows there \nis not very much oil. The oil, in fact, in the Gulf of Mexico, is where \nthe 4,000-plus oil rigs are, which is the central gulf and the western \ngulf off of, primarily, Louisiana and Texas.\n  But then, of course, there is the fourth component of why we should \nnot drill in the eastern gulf. That is our military preparedness. If \nyou fly commercially from Tampa to New Orleans, you do not fly across \nthe gulf. You hug the coast of Florida. Why? It is restricted space. It \nis the largest testing and training area for our U.S. military. It is \nwhat Secretary Rumsfeld memorialized in the letter to the Senate \nCommittee on Armed Services in December saying: Do not drill east of \nthat military mission line.\n  We are testing weapons systems such as the F/A-22. All pilot training \nis being done at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City. Why? Because \nthe Gulf of Mexico is restricted space. In a dog fight with the F/A-22, \ncompared to the F-15, the F/A-22 is engaging in air-to-air combat at a \nspeed of 1.5 mach, not like the F-15 and the F-16 at .75 mach, three-\nquarters of the speed of sound. In other words, the new stealth fighter \nis engaging in air-to-air combat at twice the speed of our present \nfleet of aircraft. Therefore, the training area has to be so much \nlarger.\n  We are testing right now a laser weapon shot from a ship, which goes \nseveral hundred miles. We have to have restricted space. Secretary of \nDefense Rumsfeld said oil and gas rigs are incompatible with the \nmilitary uses of that space.\n  That is four components. Senator Martinez and I took all those \ncomponents into consideration in suggesting our plan. And we added a \n20-mile cushion since that military mission line that Secretary \nRumsfeld referred to was established in 1981, and the weapons have \ngotten more sophisticated and, as I stated, require much more space in \nwhich to test and to train our military.\n  That is the line we have drawn which is in effect from Clearwater \nBeach, right there at Tampa Bay, St. Petersburg Beach, 260 miles to the \nwest from a position further south of Florida, like Fort Myers or \nNaples. It is in excess of 300 miles from the coast of Florida.\n  To my knowledge, as of today every newspaper editorial page in the \nState of Florida, save for one newspaper, has editorialized in favor of \nSenator Martinez and my proposal from last week. I don't have the exact \ncount, but that is something upwards of 20 editorial pages.\n  As we come here for the fights that are going to occur, Senator \nMartinez and I are looking for a practical line that will accommodate \nthe interests of everyone, including our military preparedness. That is \nwhy we cannot have a bill that was offered in the House of \nRepresentatives last fall that says leave it up to the States. We can't \nleave it up to a State to set military policy. We cannot leave it up to \nan individual State legislature to determine whether the U.S. military \nis going to be prepared in this long war on terror. That is why Senator \nMartinez and I have said these boundaries ought to be permanent, not in \nsome 5-year plan that is now being offered but permanent.\n  We are going to continue the fight. I can tell the Senate there is no \ndaylight between Senator Martinez, who sits on that side of the aisle, \nand this senior Senator of Florida, who sits on this side of the aisle. \nWe will employ every opportunity we have under the rules of the Senate \nto try to get others who disagree to understand the practicality and \nthe wisdom of the proposal we have laid out to accommodate all of the \ninterests, including the military interests of this country.\n  I share that with the Senate. This is not going to be the last time \nwe will discuss that, but I make this Senator's position unalterably \nclear. I thank the Senate for this opportunity to share these thoughts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on S. 852, the asbestos \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Presiding Officer, is there an amendment \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are several amendments pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Is one of the amendments the Cornyn substitute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are two Cornyn amendments pending. There \nis a perfecting amendment pending and a second degree to that \nperfecting amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Cornyn amendment to the \nunderlying bill. I want the record to reflect my deep disappointment in \nthose two amendments. I am deeply concerned we are losing sight of what \nis at stake.\n  What is that? Making sure that people who are sick, who are likely to \nbecome sick from exposure to tremolite asbestos are not denied the \nability to fight for their rights against the persons or companies that \ninjured them. That is absolutely the bottom line. If these amendments \nare agreed to, people in the small county of northwest Montana will not \nget justice. These people will not get relief. They will not get \nsupport. They will not be able to pay for needed health care as they \ndie.\n  We are talking about hundreds of sick and dying people. This \namendment turns our back on them. It will hurt them while they are \nalready down. It will hurt the people of Libby. The people in Libby are \nproud. They have had more than their share of hard knocks. They just \nkeep going, getting up and\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\nkeep trying. They are good, proud people. But they have been injured. \nThey have been deceived. They have been wronged. They have been lied \nto.\n  They have tried to put their faith in our Congress and in our \nlegislative process to make things right. They are survivors. I am \nprivileged to know them so well and to represent them.\n  Let me tell you about the first time I went to Libby. It was January \nof the year 2000. I traveled to Libby to meet with 25 extremely ill \npeople for the first time. I had been briefed a number of times on what \nI might expect to hear that night. These kind men and women, some of \nwhom are no longer with us, gathered to share huckleberry pie and \ncoffee in the home of Gayla Benefield.\n  They opened their hearts. They poured out unimaginable stories of \nsuffering and tragedy on a scale that absolutely stunned me. Entire \nfamilies--fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, sons, and daughters--all \nsick, hundreds are dead--they are all bound together by their exposure \nto the company mine, exposure to tremolite asbestos mined by W.R. \nGrace.\n  This is an isolated community of a few thousand people located as far \naway from Washington, DC, as you could possibly get, way up in \nnorthwest Montana.\n  I will never forget a man I met that night. He has become my dear \nfriend. His name is Les Skramstad. I mentioned Les yesterday. Let me \ntell you about our first introduction.\n  At that meeting in the home of Gayla Benefield, Les watched me \nclosely all evening. He was weary and came up to me after his friends \nand neighbors finished speaking and said to me:\n\n       Senator, a lot of people have come to Libby and told us \n     they would help, then they leave and we never hear from them \n     again.\n       Max, please, as a man like me, as someone's father, too, as \n     someone's husband, as someone's son, help me. Help us. Help \n     us make this town safer for Libby's sons and daughters not \n     even born yet. They should not suffer my fate, too. I was a \n     miner and I breathed that dust in.\n       And what happened to me and all the other men and women who \n     mined wasn't right--but what has happened to the others is a \n     sin. Every day I carried that deadly dust home on my clothes. \n     I took it into our house. I contaminated my own wife and each \n     of our babies with it too. Just like me, they are sick and we \n     will each die the same way.\n       I just don't know how to live with the pain of what I have \n     done to them. If we can make something good come of this \n     maybe I will stick around to see that, maybe that could help \n     make this worthwhile.\n\n  That is what Les said to me that evening. It riveted me. I told him I \nwould do all that I could, that I would not back down, and I would not \ngive up. I said to myself that evening, if I do anything, I am going to \nhelp get justice for the people of Libby, MT.\n  Les accepted my offer and then pointed his finger at me and said: \nI'll be watching, Senator.\n  Les is my inspiration. He is the face of thousands of sick and \nexposed folks in this tiny Montana community. When I get tired, and I \nsee the difficulties we face to try to get justice for the people of \nLibby, I think of Les, and I cannot shake what he asked me to do. In \nall my years as an elected official, this issue of doing what is right \nfor Libby is among the most personally compelling things I have ever \nbeen called on to do.\n  Doing what is right for the community and making something good come \nof it is my mission in Libby. I thank Les Skramstad every day for \nhanding me my marching orders. My staff and I have worked tirelessly \nfor Libby--not for thanks, not for recognition but because the tragedy \nis that gripping. There is no other choice. It is a no-brainer. We do \nall we can. It is such a tragedy for the people of Libby.\n  The extent of asbestos contamination in Libby, the number of people \nwho are sick and who have died from asbestos exposure is staggering. \nThe people of Libby suffer from a deadly asbestos-caused cancer, \nmesothelioma, at a rate 100 times greater than the rest of the Nation. \nMr. President, 1 in 1,000 residents of Libby suffers from this disease. \nThe national average is 1 out of 1 million. Libby residents suffer from \nall asbestos-related diseases at a rate of 40 to 60 times the national \naverage.\n  So how could this happen? Well, a company named W.R. Grace owned and \noperated a vermiculite mining and milling operation in Libby. It just \nso happened the vermiculite was contaminated by a deadly form of \nasbestos called tremolite asbestos. It is much more pernicious than the \nordinary chrysotile asbestos. Tremolite asbestos is so bad, it gets \ninto your lungs. It has hooks in it. It stays there and does not ever \nget out.\n  Mr. President, 5,000 pounds of tremolite asbestos was blown over the \ntown every day. Every day this dust contaminated the air. Dust settled \nin the town of Libby, on cars, on homes, in gardens. Think of it. You \nget up in the morning to go outside, and there is this tremolite \nasbestos dust on your car. It is on your home. It is everywhere, your \ngarden. It settled on children as they played in the parks. Workers \nbrought the dust home on their clothes and exposed their families. \nHundreds have died, hundreds more are sick.\n  The very worst part about this story is that W.R. Grace knew exactly \nwhat it was doing and did not tell anyone. It was making a buck while \nit was hurting people. It knew that the vermiculite dust was \ncontaminated with deadly tremolite asbestos. Yet it had told workers in \nthe town it was harmless. It was just dust, they said. W.R. Grace not \nonly said it was harmless, then what did it do? To add insult to \ninjury, it bagged this stuff. It put all this tremolite asbestos in \nbags and then gave bags to residents for their gardens and to the high \nschool for covering for the high school track and for parks and \nplaygrounds.\n  Well, W.R. Grace filed for bankruptcy. Before they did that, what did \nthey do? They transferred almost all their assets away to other \ncompanies so they could not be sued. So people in Libby could not get \njustice. Through all of this, W.R. Grace has yet to step up and do the \nright thing for Libby.\n  So I stepped up. I stood up for the people of Libby. And I am \nstanding up now for Les and his family to do all I can to help him and \nthose other people in Libby.\n  I worked hard with the Judiciary Committee, especially my colleagues, \nSenator Specter and Senator Leahy, to tailor a solution that addresses \nthe unique problems in Libby. I am extremely grateful to Senator \nSpecter, the chairman of the committee, and Senator Leahy, the ranking \nmember, for all their work to help protect Libby. I spent a lot of time \nexplaining to them the problems of Libby, and to their credit, they \nlistened and put provisions in the bill, the underlying bill, that \naddress the very unique, special problems of the tragedy in Libby.\n  The original medical criteria in the bill did not address the \nspecific needs of Libby because disease resulting from exposure to \ntremolite asbestos progresses differently than disease from exposure to \nthe traditional form of asbestos. Tremolite asbestos, the latency \nperiod is a lot longer. You cannot detect it until much later. It is \nalso a pernicious kind of asbestos that causes much more injury and \nmakes it much more difficult to breathe. It is wicked stuff.\n  So we worked hard, and we included medical criteria that specifically \naddress the unique needs of Libby. My colleagues, I hope, understand--\nthey must understand; the right thing to do is to understand--this \nwhole community was exposed, not just the mine workers but everyone.\n  W.R. Grace mined the raw vermiculite in the mines of Libby and then \nmilled that vermiculite to remove up to 96 percent of the tremolite \nasbestos contained in the vermiculite. That milling process then shot \n5,000 pounds of tremolite asbestos into the air each and every day. \nThat asbestos blanketed the town. The asbestos did not discriminate \nwhere it fell. It covered the school playground and little league \nbaseball field. And it is now growing in the bark of trees, if you can \nimagine. It is everywhere.\n\n  I am offended some of my colleagues think they know best. I am \noffended some of my colleagues, who think they know better, have not \ntaken the time to know the issue, to travel to Libby, to understand \nwhat is going on there, to open up their minds and their hearts, to try \nto understand. They have not taken the time to meet the people, to \nunderstand there are different types of asbestos or that the disease \nfrom exposure to tremolite asbestos progresses very differently and is \nmuch more pernicious.\n  So if you do not support the bill, I ask my colleagues to say so. But \ndo not\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nhold the people and the community of Libby hostage. Whatever we do, \nhowever we deal with the underlying asbestos bill, we cannot hold the \npeople of Libby hostage. Do not ask the innocent people of Libby to do \nyour bidding for you.\n  And if this amendment passes--the Cornyn amendments--I will have to \ngo back to Libby. I will look into the eyes of that community, and I \nwill tell them that their Nation turned its back on them.\n  Let me be very clear. I will keep fighting for Libby until they get \nthe help that is desperately needed and long overdue. Until they get \nthe compensation they deserve, I am going to keep fighting. We are \ngoing to find a way, eventually, to give these people the justice they \ndeserve.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I see the chairman of the committee on the floor. I thank him for his \nhelp and his recognition of the unique differences in Libby, MT. I tell \nhim, I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nthose comments and for his leadership in structuring the bill now on \nthe floor, S. 852. He has accurately described the very serious \nsituation in Libby, MT, where many people have been exposed to asbestos \nin a dreadful situation, a situation where the W.R. Grace Company sent \nthis deadly substance into the atmosphere knowing its dangers.\n  The bill which has been structured would compensate the people there. \nThe Senator from Montana accurately and forcefully articulates the \nreasons why the pending amendment for medical criteria is totally \ninsufficient. It simply does not cover people such as those in Libby, \nMT. It does not cover the thousands of people who worked for companies \nwhich were bankrupted--77 of them. It does not cover the veterans of \nAmerica who are suffering from exposure to asbestos. It does not cover \nthe real core of the issue and the problem at hand.\n  I have talked to Senator Cornyn about scheduling a vote. We would \nlike to have a vote reasonably soon. A vote is always a salutary method \nof getting Senators to the floor to move the bill along in other \nrespects. Senator Cornyn wanted to have some time for discussion and \nargument. And a few minutes after 2, I said I would try to accommodate \nhim on what he wanted to do in that respect. But I hoped we could have \na vote no later than 3 o'clock. That is still my hope, and to get \nthere, I am going to be brief.\n  I see Senator Leahy on the floor, and I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, did the Senator from Montana wish to say \nsomething?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not care who has the floor, but I \nwish to say I appreciate the comments of the chairman of the committee \nand, also, how much I appreciate the efforts of the ranking member of \nthe committee, Senator Leahy from Vermont. He has also, as has the \nchairman of the committee, been very receptive in his understanding of \nthe issue.\n  I might say, I thank again the Senators. They sent staff to Montana \nto get a firsthand understanding of what is going on. I thank the \nchairman. I also again thank the Senator from Vermont for his deep \nunderstanding. He has taken the time and effort to learn the problems \nthat face Libby, MT. I again thank both Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Montana for his comments. I should note that from the first day \nSenator Specter and I started talking about this legislation, the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana was there visiting with us. He made \nit very clear he wanted to make sure that whatever we passed took care \nof what is an extraordinary and unique situation in Libby, MT. His help \nand his counsel have been extraordinarily important throughout.\n  We had so much testimony that said the same thing, that said the \ncurrent system for compensating asbestos victims is broken. Victims are \ndying. Ironically, they are dying while they are waiting for their day \nin court--a day that will not come. Even for those who finally receive \ntheir day in court, they often receive only a small percentage of the \ncosts involved in our tort system. Of course, if the defendant has been \nforced to file for bankruptcy, or decided to file for bankruptcy, these \nvictims receive little or no compensation.\n  I think, as both Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg have said, this cries out for a solution outside of the court \nsystem that streamlines the claims process for victims, to make sure \nthey receive timely and fair compensation relative to the severity of \ntheir injuries. That will protect compensation they receive from \nsubrogation by insurance companies.\n  Actually, we find from the most recent RAND study asbestos victims \nreceive an average of only 42 cents for every dollar spent on asbestos \nlitigation. What may surprise some, 31 cents of every dollar goes to \ndefense costs. A somewhat smaller amount, 27 cents, goes to plaintiffs' \nattorneys and other related costs. All that is eaten up before the \nvictim, the one suffering, sees anything.\n  I think the enactment of a medical criteria bill, such as the \namendment the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, has \nproposed, for asbestos would fail to reduce the high transaction costs \nof the asbestos tort system.\n  Medical criteria bills do nothing to protect businesses from going \nbankrupt or victims who were injured by bankrupt companies to receive \nfair compensation.\n  The plain fact--the plain and easy fact--is many of these asbestos \nmanufacturers are in bankruptcy proceedings and, therefore, are immune \nfrom suit. Victims, such as our Nation's veterans, are unable to \nrecover for asbestos exposure while serving their country in the \ncurrent tort system. Think of that, our veterans.\n  We received the following testimony from Hershel Gober, the national \nlegislative director of the Military Order of the Purple Heart. He \nsaid:\n\n       We believe the compensation fund approach is the only \n     solution that will provide veterans suffering from asbestos-\n     related illnesses with fair [with fair] and certain \n     compensation.\n\n  But he also pointed out:\n\n       The avenues open to veterans to seek compensation through \n     the tort system, however, are very limited. The Federal \n     government, as the members of this Committee know, has \n     sovereign immunity, thereby restricting veterans' ability to \n     recover from the government; and most of the companies that \n     supplied asbestos to the Federal government have either \n     disappeared or are bankrupt and, therefore, are only able to \n     provide a fraction of the compensation that should be paid to \n     asbestos victims, if anything at all.\n\n  This distinguished veteran went on to say:\n\n       Even if there is a solvent defendant company for a veteran \n     or his/her family to pursue, there remains the lengthy, \n     costly, and uncertain ordeal of filing a civil lawsuit and \n     going through discovery and trial, where the plaintiff bears \n     a heavy burden of proof and often has the very difficult to \n     impossible task of establishing which defendant's product \n     caused their injuries.\n  Criteria bills, such as that of the distinguished Senator from Texas, \nwill do nothing to compensate victims such as our Nation's veterans who \nare injured by bankrupt companies during their service to our great \ncountry. Legislation imposing medical criteria on the tort system is \ninherently unfair to victims. These measures don't alleviate the delays \nvictims face when they are confronted with overwhelmed court dockets. \nCriteria bills, such as the Cornyn amendment, allow defendants and \ninsurers to enjoy the delays of litigation and maintain all of their \ndefenses in the tort system. They are far away from streamlining a \nprocedure to help people who are sick and dying, and they impose new \nhurdles for plaintiffs and continue to require the identification and \nproof of the manufacturer or entity responsible for exposing them to \nasbestos decades ago.\n  In contrast, the bill Senator Specter and I have brought to the floor \nwill not require victims to identify and prove the manufacturer or \nentity that exposed them to asbestos. They only have to show the \nsuffering they have had from asbestos. They will not have to hope that \nthe entity responsible for their exposure is still in existence or \nfinancially solvent. They will recover\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\ncompensation under the fund in proportion to their impairment or \ndisease. The current system for compensating victims of asbestos \nexposure is inefficient and inequitable.\n  This medical criteria amendment is not a solution. It actually \noperates within that same broken tort system.\n  I could go further, but I know the distinguished chairman hopes we \nwill come to a point where we can vote. I would note that this \namendment will preempt the silica claims of thousands of victims. I \nunderstand that the AFL-CIO and other labor unions representing \nthousands of workers, like this distinguished veterans association, \noppose the Cornyn amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 852, the bipartisan \nFairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005. Over the last \nseveral days, several of the opponents of this legislation have made \nserious, misleading claims, and I would like to take a moment to \nrespond.\n  Opponents of this bill have claimed that it amounts to a bailout of \nbig business generally, and asbestos manufacturers specifically. Guess \nwhat. They are, as usual, almost right. Webster's Dictionary defines \n``bailout'' as a rescue from financial distress. It is true that we are \ntrying to save 90 percent of this country's industry from financial \ndistress. It is also true that we are trying to rescue literally \nhundreds of thousands of asbestos victims from the plague of \nuncertainty that advances from the efforts of asbestos attorneys and \nthe cruelty of asbestos bankruptcies. So using the word ``bailout'' is \nnot a complete mischaracterization of what this bill does.\n  This bill saves an overburdened legal system. We have been asked by \nno less than the Supreme Court of the United States of America three \ntimes to do something about this mess. If we don't do something about \nthis mess, we are going to have a severe economic crises in this \ncountry, driven by this approach that is literally bankrupting some \nvery innocent companies.\n  This bill saves asbestos victims from unfair and untimely \ncompensation. This bill saves ordinary Americans from the tremendous \nstrain on our national economy. And this bill saves veterans who have \nnowhere else to turn. I ask my colleagues if they know that once \nvibrant companies, now bankrupt due to asbestos liability, employed \nover 200,000 workers--200,000. The asbestos crisis affects over 85 \npercent of the U.S. economy. Over $200 million in lost wages--$200 \nmillion--gone. Almost no one has been spared. Mr. President, 75 out of \n83 industrial sectors in this country are affected.\n  Has not this body been working for several years now to save domestic \njobs and help our industries? Not a single Senator questions the fact \nthat this Nation faces an immediate crisis. Not a single Senator \ndisputes the fact that our legal system cannot handle the thousands \nupon thousands of asbestos claims. And, hopefully, not a single Senator \nquestions that we must do something, and do it now, and this is the \nonly vehicle we have.\n  Too much time has passed, too many people have died, too many people \nhave lost their jobs, too many people have gone uncompensated, and too \nmany asbestos lawyers have private jets and luxurious yachts as a \nresult.\n  Some colleagues claim this bill lets defendant companies off the \nhook. I believe the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid yesterday that S. 852 would shift more of the financial burden \nonto the backs of injured workers. I share my colleague's concern for \ninjured workers. I disagree with his assessment of how this bill works.\n  The FAIR Act does not add to the burden on injured workers; it \nlessens it. This bill will ensure that asbestos victims are compensated \nover a 3- to 4-year period. Individuals with exigent claims will \nreceive their compensation within 1 year.\n  Moreover, asbestos victims under this bill will receive the entire \naward themselves instead of giving enormous percentages to attorneys in \ntransaction costs. Of course, claimants may elect to utilize an \nattorney, in which case attorney's fees are capped at 5 percent, rather \nthan 40 percent. That is a far cry from some of the exorbitant \nattorney's fees that are being charged today.\n  I wholeheartedly believe attorneys should be compensated for their \nefforts, but I also believe that such compensation should be \nreasonable. Under the FAIR Act, defendant companies are not let off the \nhook. Defendant companies, along with insurers and reinsurers, do not \nget a free ride under S. 852--unless one thinks a combined $136 billion \nobligation constitutes a free ride. Defendant companies are responsible \nfor payments up to $90 billion over the life of the fund. Insurer \nparticipants are responsible for payments up to $46 billion. That is \nnot pocket change. Indeed, as some of my colleagues have pointed out, \nthere are companies and insurers who oppose this bill because of this \nobligation.\n  I ask my colleagues: Why would some of these companies oppose this \nlegislation if it amounted to a free ride? This brings me to my next \nsubject.\n  Some of my colleagues have alleged that taxpayers will be footing the \nbill for the FAIR Act--$140 billion, they claim. That would be a truly \nfrightening allegation if it were true. Fortunately for us, if you read \nthis bill, it is not true. The FAIR Act is entirely funded by private \nmeans. American taxpayers do not pay one dime. Although an argument \ncould be made that during the war our Government used asbestos in \nshipbuilding and so many other ways. And I am just talking about the \nwar. You can extrapolate way beyond that. But we haven't asked the \nFederal Government to pay anything. This bill does not require any \npayments by the Federal Government--not one nickel, not one penny.\n  The truth is, as I mentioned before, private entities provide the \nfunds for this bill--$140 billion--and none of it comes from the \ncoffers of the United States of America. Defendant companies pay $90 \nbillion, participant insurers pay $46 billion, and the remaining $4 \nbillion? Bankruptcy trusts: At present, there is somewhere in the range \nof $4 billion to $7 billion that sits in bankruptcy trust. This bill \nwould consolidate those moneys and fold them into the trust it creates.\n  It is true that some of those trusts do not relish this idea. I don't \nblame them. I do not like living in the shadow of this problem either. \nBut the fact is, Congress can and should consolidate the existing \nbankruptcy trusts as part of the comprehensive solution to a critical \nnational problem.\n  Let me also say this: If we don't do something about this--and this \nis just step 1. We have to get the House to do something. I doubt \nseriously they are going to do this bill. If they don't do this bill, \nthey have to come up with one of their own. When they do, that means we \nhave to go to conference and hopefully work out any of the problems we \nuncover between now and then.\n  If we don't do this bill, then I personally believe the economy is \ngoing to be very badly damaged and ultimately hurt. I hate to be a \ndoomsayer, but I really believe that is what is going to happen. I \nthink virtually everybody in this body knows we need to do something. \nThis is the vehicle that we have to get through the Senate, and then we \nare going to have to, hopefully, get the House to come up with a \nsimilar vehicle, or at least whatever they think is the best way of \ndoing this. Then we have to go to conference, and people working with \ngoodwill have to try to solve these problems, hopefully using the best \nthings in this bill and the best things in a House bill so we can solve \nthis problem for our country, for our economy, for our workers, and for \ncompanies so that in the future they aren't going to go bankrupt.\n  When I first started working on this, there were only 30 companies in \nbankruptcy. Today there are almost 80. That is just a few years. It is \ngoing to get worse.\n  As I understand it, the problem is going to get worse because of \nsuperficialities and a tort system run amok, and because we are \nunwilling to stand together and do something about it, and because of \nspecial interests. No,\n\n[[Page S948]]\n\nnot special interests down at K Street, special interests that are the \nlargest hard-money supporters of our friends on the other side today.\n  As I understand the situation, there are two primary claims against \nincluding the existing bankruptcy trusts in this legislation. The first \nargument amounts to a finality claim. Some argue that Congress should \nlet sleeping dogs lie. Critics in this camp believe we should not undo \nwhat has been done in the bankruptcy court since victims in those \ncircumstances have been compensated to a degree and the channeling \ninjunction that accompanies a 524(g) trust effectively terminates \nresidual liability.\n  There are problems here. In many instances the sleeping dog here is, \nin fact, a very sick puppy. It cannot take care of itself. The Manville \nTrust, for example, pays only pennies on the dollar and it does not \naddress the global problem. In fact, the Supreme Court has, on more \nthan one occasion as I have said, struck down attempted global \nsettlements while simultaneously calling upon Congress to act.\n  The fact is, the Supreme Court is right. The asbestos problem is a \nhorrific mess and it is time for Congress to intervene. I understand \nwhy companies on the receiving end of a channeling injunction would not \nwant to upset the balance they have struck. But they will have the \nprotections of this bill while simultaneously providing much needed \nfunding that will be used to compensate the true victims of the \nasbestos crisis.\n  One further point on existing asbestos bankruptcy trusts. For reasons \nI will explain in a moment, most bankruptcy trusts in this context were \nestablished by the plaintiffs' trial bar. The provisions of 11 United \nStates Code 524(g) do not permit a channeling injunction unless 75 \npercent of the claimants approve of the measure. That means that \nplaintiffs' attorneys in these cases--and there are about 12 major law \nfirms, that is what it comes down to--have a very big say in how the \ntrust is set up and, more troubling, how they, the asbestos lawyers in \nthese 12 firms, basically are compensated. I can see why the asbestos \nplaintiffs' bar would not like to see this change. Can you blame them? \nThis is a cow they want to milk. It is high quality milk at that.\n  The second problem is a little more complicated. Certain asbestos \nbankruptcy trustees have argued that the inclusion of their assets in \nthe larger trust established under the FAIR Act constitutes an unlawful \ntaking in violation of the fifth amendment to the Constitution. I admit \nI was surprised when I discovered that my friend Professor Laurence \nTribe and I actually agree on a point of constitutional law. But it is \ntrue. He was correct to say:\n\n       It is a well-settled rule that legislatures may act \n     rationally to modify or abolish causes of action, impose \n     assessments, and create new compensation programs without \n     violating due process or triggering the right to just \n     compensation under the Takings Clause.\n\n  I also agree with Professor Tribe's assessment:\n\n       The bankruptcy process, and in particular the confirmation \n     of a plan of organization, does not provide a debtor or a \n     resulting trust with ongoing immunity from the operation of \n     federal law as it might evolve over time.\n\n  In a nutshell, there is not a final property interest at issue in \nthis context. I agree with Mr. Carter G. Phillips:\n\n       Any property rights arising from the trusts are contractual \n     in nature and the law is well established that contracts, \n     however expressed, cannot fetter the constitutional authority \n     of the Congress.\n\n  I do not believe a valid takings claim can exist in a vacuum of \nproperty rights.\n  In the interest of time, I will not bore my colleagues with a more \ndetailed legal explanation on the takings issue, but I wish to submit \ntwo letters for the Record, the first dated February 6, 2006, from \nProfessor Laurence H. Tribe, and the second dated February 7, 2006, \nfrom Mr. Carter G. Phillips. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                Cambridge, MA,\n\n                                                 February 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter, I am writing in response to your \n     request for my current views of the constitutional questions \n     posed by S. 852, the Fairness in Abestos Injury Resolution \n     Act (``FAIR.''). The bill was voted out of committee on May \n     26, 2005, with a bipartisan majority of 13-5, and is \n     scheduled for floor debate in the near future.\n       As I testified before the Committee on June 4, 2003 (and as \n     I reiterated in subsequent responses to questions from \n     members of the Committee), Congress has ample constitutional \n     authority to replace the current avalanche of asbestos \n     litigation with an administrative compensation scheme to \n     minimize transaction costs and to allocate responsibility \n     more rationally than the badly broken status quo. Carte G. \n     Phillips of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, LLP, and former \n     Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman, now of Wilmer Cutler & \n     Pickering, joined in my conclusions at the hearing in 2003.\n       Nothing since that time has led me to alter my legal views. \n     I continue to believe that Congress possesses clear \n     constitutional power to use past histories of payments for \n     asbestos-related judgments, combined with current revenues, \n     to substitute predictable fiscal obligations for \n     unpredictable future liabilities. The aim of S. 852 is to \n     apportion liability according to likely responsibility, \n     tempered by some attention to ability to absorb the burden--\n     not (as in cases like Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. \n     498 (1998)) to saddle one company with liability because it \n     is the last remaining solvent defendant. Indeed, a principal \n     aim of S. 852 is precisely to avoid such a scenario, which is \n     currently being played out in the tort system.\n       Urging Congress to let the litigation avalanche continue \n     lest the Supreme Court invalidate the proposed alternative \n     makes little sense. After all, it was that Court that wrote \n     in 1997, in a landmark asbestos case I successfully argued, \n     ``a nationwide administrative claims processing regime would \n     provide the most secure, fair, and efficient means of \n     compensating victims of asbestos exposure.'' In 1999 and \n     2003, the Supreme Court repeated this invitation to \n     congressional action.\n       In your latest request of me, you have called special \n     attention to the transfer of assets held by certain \n     bankruptcy trusts to the FAIR Fund. In particular, former \n     Senator Don Nickles argued in a February 1, 2006 op-ed on \n     behalf of a group of existing trusts that ``[m]ore than $7 \n     billion currently set aside to compensate 524(g) \n     beneficiaries would be taken from the trusts and paid to the \n     national fund created by S. 852. This represents a `taking' \n     of property by our government without just compensation, \n     which is expressly prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.'' With \n     all respect to Senator Nickles, I believe his objection has \n     no merit as a constitutional matter.\n       First, it is not enough to assert that S. 852 changes the \n     rules applicable to bankruptcy trusts. After all, the bill \n     changes the rules applicable to other participants as well. \n     It abrogates insurance contracts, eliminates causes of \n     action, and overrides numerous existing legal entitlements. \n     All of these changes could be said to upset expectations \n     regarding future liabilities and tort recoveries. But none of \n     the changes states a takings claim, in light of the well \n     settled rule that legislatures may act rationally to modify \n     or abolish causes of action, impose assessments, and create \n     new compensation programs without violating due process or \n     triggering the right to just compensation under the Takings \n     Clause. See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 432-\n     33 (1982); Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 281-83 \n     (1980). State workers' compensation laws, federal pension \n     regulation, and the Black Lung D1sability Trust Fund, 30 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 901, et seq., all rely on this principle. \n     ``[L]egislation readjusting rights and burdens is not \n     unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled \n     expectations . . . even though the effect of the legislation \n     is to impose a new duty or liability based on past acts.'' \n     Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U.S. 1, 16 (1976).\n       Second, it is well settled that the bankruptcy process, and \n     in particular the confirmation of a plan of reorganization, \n     does not provide a debtor or a resulting trust with ongoing \n     immunity from the operation of federal law as it might evolve \n     over time. Midlantic Nat'l Bank v. New Jersey Dep't of Envtl. \n     Protection, 474 U.S. 494, 502 (1986). See NLRB v. Bildisco & \n     Bildisco, 465 U.S. 513, 534 (1984) (bankrupt debtor not \n     relieved of labor law obligations); In re Baker & Drake, \n     Inc., 35 F.3d 1348, 1353-55 (9th Cir. 1994) (reorganization \n     plan does not immunize debtor from state law on ongoing \n     basis); see also City & County of San Francisco v. PG & E \n     Corp., 2006 WL 44315, *9 (9th Cir. Jan. 10. 2006) \n     (governmental regulatory actions are exempt from bankruptcy \n     court jurisdiction).\n       This principle is particularly salient with respect to \n     bankruptcy trusts, which are themselves the specialized \n     creatures of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Having responded to \n     the asbestos litigation crisis by creating such trusts in \n     1994, Congress is not in any way disabled from taking further \n     legislative steps toward reform a decade later. Cf. Dames \n     & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 674 n.6 (1981) \n     (President's action in nullifying government-created \n     attachments of Iranian assets pursuant to hostage release \n     agreement did not effect a taking of property in violation \n     of Fifth Amendment).\n       Bankruptcy trusts are subject to the longstanding rule that \n     ``[p]rospective relief under\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\n     a continuing decree remains subject to alteration due to \n     changes in the underlying law.'' Miller v. French, 530 U.S. \n     327, 344 (2000). ``The provision of prospective relief is \n     subject to the continuing supervisory jurisdiction of the \n     court, and therefore may be altered according to subsequent \n     changes in the law.'' Id. at 347.\n       Otherise, the bankruptcy system would create a whole \n     constellation of black holes in the fabric of the U.S. Code. \n     To avoid such profound disruption of innumerable federal \n     statutory regimes--from product liability reforms to \n     telecommunications auctions, from energy conservation \n     legislation to coal safety laws--courts have routinely \n     applied statutory changes to debtors in ongoing \n     reorganization plans, even post-confirmation, and even when \n     the effect has been to leave the estate without property that \n     private parties expect to receive. For example, the 1996 \n     amendment to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930(a)(6), governing the \n     imposition of quarterly fees for the United States Trustee in \n     certain Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganizations, has been \n     repeatedly applied even to debtors in confirmed \n     reorganization plans that had made no provision for the \n     payment of such fees.\n       In exactly the same way, S. 82 represents an intervening \n     change in federal law that is neutral in design and general \n     in application and accordingly must be accommodated \n     prospectively by bankruptcy trusts. If bankruptcy trusts won \n     some special exemption or immunity on a prospective basis \n     from intervening changes in federal law in relation to \n     asbestos liability, there would be no field within the broad \n     reach of Congress' legislative power that would not be \n     compromised by the unpredictable appearance of a potentially \n     limitless number of financially crippling gaps.\n       An order establishing a bankruptcy trust hardly resembles a \n     final judgment for money damages, of the kind that creates \n     ``vested'' rights. Bankruptcy trusts are ongoing \n     administrative entities created for the processing and \n     payment of claims. They typically pay claims at a small \n     fraction of their face value, and those rates may change \n     overtime. For example, the Manville Trust is paying out \n     claims at approximately 5% of their face value. In fact, the \n     Supreme Court has squarely rejected any analogy between \n     bankruptcy orders and final judgments for money damages. In \n     Tennessee Student Assistance Corp. v. Hood, 541 U.S. 440 \n     (2004), the Court held that, precisely because bankruptcy \n     orders are completely unlike judgments for money damages, a \n     confirmation order can bind a nonconsenting state under the \n     Eleventh Amendment, even if the state does not participate in \n     the bankruptcy process. The Court used much the same \n     reasoning in Central Virginia Community College v. Katz, 2006 \n     WL 151985 (U.S. Jan. 23, 2006), to hold that states are \n     subject to in rem bankruptcy proceedings to recover \n     preferential transfers.\n       Finally, any ``takings'' claim by bankruptcy trusts would \n     be ill-founded because any assets they hold are uniquely \n     dedicated to the payment of asbestos-related claims. Yet S. \n     852 would eliminate the trusts' liability in that regard. It \n     is difficult to understand why the trusts would have a \n     reasonable expectation of retaining property in the situation \n     where their pertinent liabilities have been eliminated. See \n     Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis. 480 U.S. 470, \n     488 (1987) (noting that ``reciprocity of advantage'' ``has \n     been recognized as a justification of various laws'' to \n     defeat takings claims) (quoting Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. \n     Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922) (Holmes, J.); Penn Central \n     Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 140 (1978) \n     (no compensation due where there is a ``reciprocity of \n     advantage'').\n       For all these reasons, I adhere to my conclusion that S. \n     852 falls well within Congress' constitutional authority to \n     enact.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laurence H. Tribe.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Sidley Austin LLP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 2006.\n     Re S. 852 Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: On April 28, 2005, I submitted a \n     letter explaining my views that S. 852's requirement that the \n     assets of asbestos bankruptcy trusts be transferred to the \n     national compensation fund was fully constitutional. You have \n     asked whether my views have changed in the interim, and also \n     how I would respond to the points raised by former Senator \n     Nickles in his recent editorial, Let Existing Trusts Opt Out \n     Of Asbestos Plan (Feb. 1, 2006), available at http://\nthehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/Comment/OpEd/\n201006_oped.htl (attached as an addendum to this letter \n     (``Add.'')).\n       My views have not changed in the interim. As more fully set \n     forth in my letter of April 28, 2005, which responded to \n     arguments raised by Theodore B. Olson, there are multiple \n     reasons why S. 852 presents no constitutional difficulties. \n     Asbestos trusts created under section 524(g) of the \n     Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 524(g), even when they assume \n     the form of state law trusts, are prospective federal \n     judicial remedies authorized and defined by Congress to \n     administer the ongoing payment of asbestos-related injury \n     claims, present and future. They are claims-paying mechanisms \n     subject to the ongoing superintendence of the federal court \n     during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, as the terms of \n     confirmation orders and reorganization plans creating \n     asbestos trusts generally reflect. See Findley v. Blinken (In \n     re Joint E. & S. Dists. Asbestos Litig.), 982 F.2d 721, 750 \n     (2d Cir. 1992) (noting that the Johns-MansviUe Trust, after \n     which section 524(g) trusts were modeled, ``is not an \n     ordinary private undertaking of a settlor to carry out \n     private preferences. It is the mechanism established under \n     the auspices of the Bankruptcy Court to implement a plan of \n     reorganization. The Bankruptcy Court has continuing \n     responsibilities to satisfy itself that the Plan is being \n     properly implemented''). There are no separation of powers \n     concerns when Congress modifies the law applicable to such \n     trusts. As the Supreme Court has repeatedly declared, \n     ``[p]rospective relief under a continuing, executory decree \n     remains subject to alteration due to changes in the \n     underlying law.'' Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 344 (2000). \n     A bankruptcy confirmation order itself is not kindred to a \n     final and unappealable judgment for damages in federal court; \n     moreover, to the extent other aspects of a confirmation order \n     may be deemed to create some vested rights, there is \n     certainly no finality in a  prospective claims-paying \n     mechanism. See United States Tr. v. CF & I Fabricators of \n     Utah, Inc. (In re CF & I Fabricators of Utah, Inc.), \n     150F.3d 1233, 1239 (10th Cir. 1998); Hillis Motors, Inc. \n     v. Hawaii Auto. Dealers' Ass'n, 997 F.2d. 581, 587 n.11 \n     (9th Cir. 1993); Findley v. Trustees of the Manville \n     Personal Injury Settlement Trust (In re Joint E. & S. \n     Dists. Asbestos Litig.), 237 F. Supp. 2d 297, 316-17 \n     (B.D.N.Y. 2002). Just like any other prospective remedial \n     decree, the trust is subject to the continuing \n     jurisdiction of the federal district court, and thus \n     subject to the power of Congress to change the governing \n     law that the court will apply in exercising that \n     jurisdiction.\n       Furthermore, any property rights arising from the trusts \n     are contractual in nature, United States Tr. v. Craige (In re \n     Salina Speedway, Inc.), 210 B.R. 851, 855 (10th Cir. B.A.P. \n     1997), and the law is well established that ``[c]ontracts, \n     however expressed, cannot fetter the constitutional authority \n     of the Congress.'' Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R.R., 294, U.S. \n     240, 307-08 (1935). For all the foregoing reasons, nothing in \n     the decrees creating asbestos trusts under section 524(g) \n     create property rights that would be subject to a federal \n     takings analysis.\n        Finally, the only ``property right'' that an asbestos \n     plaintiff can colorably claim is the right to file a claim \n     with the trust and to prove that his injury meets the \n     criteria for compensation; no individual beneficiary of the \n     trust with an unliquidated claim has a property right in the \n     trust assets themselves. In essence, a bankruptcy court \n     creating a section 524(g) trust converts the plaintiff's \n     claim against the debtor under state tort law into a claim \n     against the trust. While a claim for relief is a species of \n     property right, it is not a vested right that entitles the \n     plaintiff to compensation under the Takings Clause if \n     abrogated. Indeed, if the law were otherwise, Congress could \n     not pass legislation preempting accrued state or federal law \n     claims without federal takings liability. That is not the \n     rule; rather `` `a legal claim affords no definite or \n     enforceable property right until reduced to final judgment.' \n     '' Arbour v. Jenkins, 903 F.2d 416, 420 (6th Cir. 1990) \n     (quoting Sowell v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 888 F.2d 802, 805 (11th \n     Cir. 1989)); see also, e.g, Hammond v. United States, 786 \n     F.2d 812 (1st Cir. 1986) (no vested right ``until a final, \n     unreviewable judgment is obtained''). Finally. as more fully \n     reviewed in my April 28, 2005 letter, even if all these \n     hurdles could be overcome, asbestos claimants would have no \n     right of recovery under regulatory takings analysis.\n       Former Senator Nickles' editorial lacks force because it \n     does not recognize these legal principles. Senator Nickles \n     characterizes the bankruptcy court orders as ``final court \n     judgments approving reorganization plans that resolved \n     asbestos claims against debtor companies].'' Add. 1. However, \n     as noted above, bankruptcy reorganization plans (and \n     especially settlement trusts) are subject to the continuing \n     jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and are not final in the \n     constitutional sense; they do not limit the power of Congress \n     to change governing law. Nor do the confirmation orders \n     themselves ``resolve claims'' against the debtor; instead, \n     they crate a new prospective remedial mechanism and new form \n     of claim that must be proven in order to secure payment. \n     Beneficiaries with the right to file a claim against federal \n     asbestos trusts are not ``entitled to timely compensation \n     from those trusts,'' and they have no greater property right \n     (and no more ``certainty and security'' against abrogation by \n     Congress in the public interest) than any other asbestos \n     plaintiff. Add. 1, 2. Senator Nickles asserts that the \n     transfer of trust assets is an unconstitutional ``taking of \n     trust beneficiaries' property'' without just compensation, \n     Add. 2, but that claim cannot withstand legal analysis.\n       Senator Nickles is absolutely right that Congress must be \n     vigilant against legislation that results in the \n     unconstitutional taking of vested property rights; however, \n     those doctrines are not implicated here. In essence, S. 852 \n     requires all asbestos defendants to contribute substantial \n     assets to a national fund to create a uniform federal \n     administrative remedy; the requirement that the assets of \n     asbestos trusts (which were originally the assets of the \n     debtor) be transferred to the national fund serves the same \n     end of marshaling defendant assets for the\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\n     benefit of injured parties. Not only are no vested property \n     rights of trust claimants ``taken'' under the Fifth \n     Amendment, but there is no inequity in having plaintiffs all \n     treated the same, regardless of whether the defendant who \n     allegedly injured them happened to have sought bankruptcy \n     protection. S. 852's requirement that the assets of asbestos \n     trusts be transferred to the national fund is not only \n     perfectly legal, but it is also highly just and equitable.\n       Sincerely,\n                                               Carter G. Phillips.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I wish to close by taking a brief moment to address the \nbudgetary issues. Earlier I spoke to the private versus public funding \nissue. Some of my colleagues believe the taxpayer is on the hook for \nthis bill and I wish to help explain how that is not the case. These \nare serious concerns, but the FAIR Act does not use Federal funds. It \nis privately funded--lock, stock, and barrel.\n  Those of you who might be watching at home might be wondering why \nsome people are worrying about the FAIR Act, if it is privately funded, \nand in the spirit that underlies this bill I will try to explain it. To \nmy knowledge, there is only one way by which the FAIR Act may touch \nFederal funds and that is through the borrowing mechanism. The \nadministrator created by this act may borrow such funds as are \nnecessary to maintain the liquidity of the fund, but--and this is a big \n``but''--the administrator may not borrow amounts which exceed the \nfund's ability to repay. So the bottom line is that American taxpayers \ndo not pay for this fund. The defendant companies and insurer \nparticipants do.\n  At the end of the day, asbestos victims cannot wait any longer. \nVeterans cannot wait any longer. The overburdened legal system cannot \nwait any longer. The only group that does not mind waiting consists \nmainly of 12 law firms filled with asbestos lawyers who do not mind \nexploiting a broken system because of the billions of dollars that are \nin it for them. You can hardly blame them. It is a plum tree waiting to \nbe picked. They are slow walking this bill. I have to implore my \ncolleagues to resist these efforts.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I wish to speak briefly to Senator \nCornyn's medical criteria amendment. I agree with my colleague from \nTexas that the FAIR Act is not a perfect bill. I think Senator Specter \nhas made that clear. Others have made it clear. We have done the best \nwe can through the Judiciary Committee. This is the first step in a \nnumber of steps that simply have to be taken. I have several concerns \nof my own about this bill, and I suppose most everybody does. But I \nhave to say, as much as I agree in principle with Senator Cornyn, I am \nnot sure his approach does the trick.\n  I might add, my colleague from Utah raises the point that there are \nsome companies that will go bankrupt if we pass this bill. That may be \nthe case. I will do everything in my power through the whole process \nhere to make sure that doesn't happen, and I believe Senator Specter is \ndedicated to doing everything in his power to make sure that doesn't \nhappen. I personally believe Senator Leahy will do everything in his \npower to make sure that doesn't happen. I believe there are 435 Members \nof the House who will do everything in their power to make sure that \ndoesn't happen. I believe any conference committee that comes up is \ngoing to make sure that doesn't happen. I wouldn't tolerate that, in \nthe end.\n  But we have to have a vehicle. We have to have a bill. If we do not \nhave a bill, we have nothing. And, we have a future prospect of a \nnumber of very fine companies--with the loss of hundreds of thousands \nof more jobs--going into bankruptcy at a cost to our economy that may \nbe overwhelming after a while--all because of a runaway tort system \nthat basically is out of whack.\n  In my opinion, the medical criteria approach fails to help too many \nsick and injured people. It does nothing for the mesothelioma victims. \nThese are the ones who deserve compensation. First and foremost, the \nreason we basically started this bill, was to help those who are going \nto die because they have mesothelioma. They are going to die. Once they \nare diagnosed, it is just a matter of months, and their families are \nleft with nothing. They didn't cause this problem and they are the ones \nwho deserve compensation. Yet they are the ones who, if we do nothing, \nare left out while others--hundreds of thousands--who are not sick at \nall are going to get rewards. This is wrong.\n  In my opinion, as I say, the medical criteria approach fails to help \ntoo many sick and injured people. Let me give another illustration. The \nveterans, for example, have very few places to turn under a medical \ncriteria bill. We just had 10 veterans organizations on Capitol Hill \nholding a press conference this week--I was there with them--making it \nclear that of all people who deserve to be compensated, they do. This \nmedical criteria approach does nothing for them. This is the main \nreason why we switched to the trust fund approach; so we can take care \nof the truly sick--those who really have difficulties.\n  But, as I do with every amendment, I am going to give the medical \ncriteria approach a very hard look as we go through this process. In an \nideal world we could run with my colleague's idea. But, unfortunately, \nthe realities of the asbestos crisis prevent a medical-criteria-only \nsolution. There may be, down the line, a way of doing a medical \ncriteria bill that will take care of people who truly deserve to be \ntaken care of. This amendment is not that. But I am willing to work \nwith my colleague from Texas and see what we can do to come up with \nsomething that will work as well, if not better, than what we have \nhere. But right now this is it.\n  This is a bill that is well thought out in spite of the difficulties \nwith it. But I submit that any bill this size is going to have some \ndifficulties.\n  As I say, this is step No. 1 in what always has been a legislative \nprocess that does not end here. It starts here. If we do not start it, \nwe don't have a chance of correcting these tremendous ills to our \nsociety that could swamp us. So it is very important that we support \nSenator Specter and Senator Leahy and get this bill out of the Senate. \nIf we don't, I have to say I believe this is probably the last chance \nto resolve issues that deserve to be resolved, and to do justice \ninstead of continue the injustices that are currently resulting from \nthe current out-of-control asbestos tort system.\n  I commend my colleagues for their steadfastness in working on this \nvery difficult, complex set of issues. It is a difficult problem for \nus. There are very sincere and good people on both sides of this issue. \nThere are very sincere and good people on both sides of this aisle. I \nhave tremendous respect for my colleagues.\n\n  On the other hand, for those who are voting against the bill because \nthe trial lawyers are their largest hard-money supporters, I don't \nthink that is a good enough reason. I admit it is a powerful reason, \nbut not if you are interested in the country, not if you are interested \nin our economy, not if you are interested in the people who have \nsuffered from asbestosis and from all of the derivatives of asbestosis, \nnot if you are interested in helping these mesothelioma victims who \ndeserve help, helping the veterans who did nothing to cause these \nproblems but are left high and dry.\n  This is an effort by the leadership of the Judiciary Committee, led \nby Senator Specter and Senator Leahy, to do justice. It is an effort to \ncomply with at least three requests by the U.S. Supreme Court: \nCongress, please do something about this awful issue because we can't.\n  They can't legislate from the bench to resolve this issue. Some \npeople think individual States can resolve this issue. That might be \nso, if you had absolutely honest judges and absolutely nonpartisan \njudges down the line, and if they were willing to work hard, and if \nevery State would do it. But only a few are going to. Only a few are \ngoing to pass laws that possibly will help in this area. It is up to us \nto get this done.\n  I hope our colleagues who want to do something right here will \nrealize this is step one. You have to go ahead with it. Good people of \ngood values, well-intentioned people are going to be able, hopefully, \nin the end to get this so it works; so no company is going to be hurt \nby it, but the economy as a whole will be helped by it. But above all, \npeople who deserve compensation will receive compensation with a \nminimum of charges that reduce that compensation, compared to the \nalmost 60 percent attorneys' fees and transaction costs it is costing \nus today.\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been trying to set a vote here on \nthe amendment offered by Senator Cornyn since about 2, 2:15. I had \nhoped to vote at 3, and then I had hoped to vote at 3:30. The Senator \nfrom Illinois advised me a few moments ago that his preference would be \nto vote at 4:15. We are willing to accommodate that preference unless \nthere is some inclination to vote sooner than 4:15.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that we set the vote on the Cornyn \namendment for 4:15, with the time equally divided between now and then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, is this a vote on the Cornyn \namendment? My understanding was there was going to be a tabling motion. \nIf it is on the Cornyn amendment, I don't agree, but if it is on the \ntabling motion, I am willing to agree to 4:15. But if it is on or in \nrelation, I am not willing to do that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I withdraw my request. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after lots of discussion, as usual around \nhere, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:45 I be recognized for a motion \nto table Cornyn amendment No. 2748, and that the time between now and \nthen be equally divided between the two managers or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the manager \non this side of the aisle is Senator Durbin. I wonder if the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania would change the unanimous \nconsent request so the time would be divided between Senator Durbin and \nSenator Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a very brief statement on an \nunrelated matter. Could I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nmake sure I have an opportunity to address the debate, and under the \nunanimous consent request there is ample opportunity given to me.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the way the sides are aligned here, we \nneed a scorecard to figure out who will give Senator Cornyn time. I \nthink the manager in favor of Senator Cornyn's amendment would give him \ntime, and that turns out to be Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope to restate the unanimous consent \nrequest which was agreed to accurately. It is my understanding that at \n4:45 we will have a vote on the motion to table the pending amendment \nby Senator Cornyn of Texas, and that the time be equally divided \nbetween now and then, which would be 60 minutes, 30 minutes to each \nside; that I am controlling the 30 minutes in opposition to the motion \nto table. I will yield from that amount 15 minutes to Senator Cornyn to \nspeak during the same period. He can use that time, even if I don't \nhave to give him the floor at the moment.\n  We have to understand what we are considering. I am sure people who \nare watching this debate wonder why we take so much time going into \nquorum calls and talking among ourselves trying to come to some \nagreement about what we are going to do. That is the way the Senate \noperates. We operate by unanimous consent. Everyone has to agree. Think \nabout that--100 different Senators coming to an agreement. However, we \nhave managed, at least to the point of bringing this to a vote.\n\n  The vote is important because the bill before the Senate right now is \na bill about asbestos. Everyone knows asbestos is a lethal substance \nwhich, if inhaled, can kill you. It can cause your lungs to stop \nfunctioning, you can start to suffocate, and you can develop something \nlike lung cancer called mesothelioma and die. People all across \nAmerica, since we started using asbestos in products, have been exposed \nto it. Some are fortunate and they do not get sick. Others, with very \nminor exposure inhaling these asbestos fibers, have set off little \ntimebombs in their lungs, and they never know when they will detonate. \nVictims can go for 10, 20, 30, 40 years after exposure and nothing \nhappens; then something terrible happens. How do they know it is \nasbestos that causes it? Some of these conditions are only related to \nasbestos. Mesothelioma is one of them.\n  People who have been exposed to asbestos over the years have gone to \ncourt and said: The companies that exposed me to products that harmed \nme should be held accountable. Some courts and some juries have said, \nyes, they should pay; others have said, no, they should not pay. But \nwhat is the nature of our system of justice? You go to a court for your \nday in court, you tell them how you were injured, and you let a judge \nor jury of your neighbors and peers decide your fate. It happens every \nday across America in thousands and thousands of courtrooms.\n  Now comes this bill, Senate bill 852, which wants to change the way \npeople across America will be able to recover for their injuries from \nasbestos. The first thing it does is to eliminate your option to go to \ncourt. As an American, you could be injured from exposure to some toxic \nchemical and go to court, have your day in court, and let the court \ndecide. But if you have been exposed to this substance, to asbestos, if \nthis law is passed, you will no longer be able to go to court.\n  What happens to you? This bill creates a brand new approach--\nreplacing the courtrooms of America with a trust fund created by this \nbill, administered by an agency which does not exist at this moment, \nwhich will handle hundreds of thousands of people who have been exposed \nto asbestos.\n  Some Members come to the floor skeptical that we can change a \njudicial system in America and eliminate access to court to hundreds of \nthousands of people and get it right. If we do not get it right, the \nlosers are not going to be embarrassed Senators; the losers are going \nto be victims across America, people whose lives have been changed and \nin some cases ended because of asbestos.\n  I don't know of a single person in America who said: Listen, I know \nasbestos will kill me; let me take a whiff of it. Not one. Virtually \nall the victims and families I have run into were unsuspecting people--\nworkers on the job; a mechanic putting in an asbestos brake lining; \nsomebody trying to put in a heating duct in a home and using an \nasbestos substance; asbestos shingles on your roof; asbestos tile on \nthe floor--grinding it, cutting it, powder flying in every direction. \nWho knew? Who had any idea what was going on? So these victims, \ninnocent victims, are the ones who will be affected by this bill.\n  It is a large bill, a bill of 393 pages. It should be because it is \nchanging the basic system of justice in America. But this morning, this \nbill has become a dead letter. We are no longer considering that bill. \nWe have a new bill. We were handed this bill this morning. It is 392 \npages. It includes some 40 significant changes to the bill we had on \nour desks when we came to work this morning. We knew it was coming, we \nknew there would be a change, but these changes are significant.\n  Many Members believe that before we start enacting laws that are \ngoing to impact millions of victims across America, before we close \ndown the courtrooms of America and say to people, what you used to \nassume was your right as an American citizen is no longer your right, \nwe ought to be careful and we ought to take the time to get it right.\n  Some of the things that have been filed with this bill reflect the \nfact that even those preparing it really do not have it quite clear in \ntheir minds how it is going to work.\n  One of the amendments filed this morning, amendment 2747 by the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee--I am\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\ncertain this was inadvertent--inadvertently included the following on \nlines 7 through 9:\n\n       (Note: I recognize that this may not be the most adequate \n     indicator of insurance matching liabilities--however, it is a \n     political reality that must be addressed.)\n\n  Does that sound like a sentence out of a law? I am sure it is not. It \nis a sentence from a staffer who, in preparing this language, notified \nsomeone that they were not sure what they were writing would achieve \nthe goal they want to achieve. That happens all the time. I expect my \nstaff to be candid with me when they are preparing a law. But it tells \nsomething. By inadvertently including this staff note with this \namendment, it is clear that the people writing this bill are not sure \nwhat is in it. They are not sure what the impact will be.\n\n  What is driving this debate? Why are we so hellbent on passing this \nlegislation at this moment? There are many good reasons, and there are \nmany real reasons. One of the real reasons is that for many of the \nmajor corporations in America, this bill is a windfall.\n  This morning, Senator Bennett, a Republican from Utah, brought a \nchart to the Chamber and showed 10 of the major corporations in \nAmerica, corporations that could be taken to court today because people \nwere exposed to their products and have asbestos disease. He calculated \nhow much they would pay into this trust fund under this bill against \nwhat they have said they would have to pay if they went to court. Those \n10 corporations will save, with this bill, $20 billion. Do you think \nthey want to see this bill passed? Why, of course they do. They have an \neconomic interest in it. But the obvious question is: If they do not \npay the $20 billion to victims, who will? Other companies?\n  Senator Bennett brought to the Senate another chart of companies that \nhave never been sued for asbestos, never been held liable. Those \ncompanies will end up paying into this fund even though they never, \never have been sued successfully.\n  There is a basic unfairness here. There is a transfer of wealth in \nthis bill from some of the largest corporations in America and a burden \nto smaller companies, not to mention that at the heart of this issue \nare hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of asbestos victims.\n  Now comes Senator Cornyn of Texas. He says: Consider another \napproach. Consider an approach that will look to what the States are \ncurrently doing to deal with this. Are there ways to change asbestos \nlawsuits so that victims get more, so that people are treated fairly, \nso that those who are trying to rip off the system on either side are \nnot advantaged? And he turns to State laws. There have been several \nState laws, including Texas, Florida, and Ohio.\n  He says in his amendment: Let's establish medical criteria so that if \nyou want to go to court, we know you are truly sick. Perhaps you cannot \ngo shopping around for the friendliest court in your State or the \nNation. He goes through a variety of different scenarios. All of them \nare worthy of debate.\n  The good thing about Senator Cornyn's amendment is it is based on the \nfundamental American right to have your day in court. Senator Cornyn is \ntrying to achieve a procedural change in the courts of America which \nwill not extinguish a basic American right to have your day in court.\n  I believe he filed the amendment early this afternoon, maybe late \nthis morning. I am not certain. And now the other side is saying: That \nis it, we do not want to talk about that amendment anymore, let's get \nrid of it. They want to table that amendment.\n  As it is currently written, I could not support the amendment by the \nSenator from Texas, but I will stand with him to keep this amendment on \nthe floor so we can try to find a bipartisan solution which does not \nhave such great damage to our judicial system and to the people who \nrely on it. There will have to be significant changes in the Cornyn \namendment before I would support it. But he has said to me that he is \nwilling to sit down on a bipartisan basis in good faith to work out \nthose differences, and he tells me there is significant support on the \nRepublican side of the aisle for that effort.\n  Wouldn't that be the best outcome--an outcome that is bipartisan, one \nwhich tries to work out differences between both sides, keeping in mind \nthe innocent victims, tries to make this system a little fairer, not \nbasically abandoning our judicial system, which this new bill, new \nversion of the bill we have been handed, would do? That is a sensible \napproach.\n  I am going to support the efforts of Senator Cornyn at this moment to \nresist a motion to table, with the understanding that before I will \nmake any commitment to vote on his final amendment, we will have to sit \ndown and try to work out our differences. It is not too much to ask.\n  Do you know how long this program is supposed to affect America? For \n50 years. Is it worth a few hours, maybe even a day, to get it right? I \nbelieve it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I believe this is one of those situations \nwhere there is broad bipartisan consensus that we need to find a \nsolution to this national crisis which not only affects people who are \nsick with asbestos-related diseases, including cancers, but also the \ncompanies that are in bankruptcy because they have been put underwater \nby the huge volume of claims from people who are not yet sick but who \nare worried the statute of limitations will run and bar them from \nbringing their claims in the future.\n  I am proud of the work the Judiciary Committee has done under Senator \nSpecter's leadership to try to bring us this far. On many of the \ndifferences we have had, he has ably negotiated a resolution. Where we \nare today is much better than where we were a year ago.\n  There was a strategic decision made, as there had to be, whether to \ngo with the trust fund approach or with a medical criteria approach. \nFrankly, the trust fund approach left the station, and everyone put \ntheir hopes and their work and effort into that approach. I am sorry to \nsay that notwithstanding the hard work and effort which has gone into \nthe bill, I still believe the trust fund is fundamentally flawed for \nreasons I have already talked about.\n  There are problems with regard to the allocation; that is, the long \narm of Uncle Sam will reach out and send you a bill for a lot of money \nto pay into this fund. We have been told by a number of companies that \nin order to pay that bill, they will simply have to shut their doors \nand go out of business, put their employees on the streets, possibly \ncausing pension funds to be jeopardized. People who have come to rely \non the solvency of those companies and their ability to pay their \nretirees the benefits they have agreed to, we are told they would be \nseriously jeopardized by this trust fund as currently written.\n  Then there is the issue of, how do we know how much money should go \ninto the trust fund? That has been a subject of a lot of negotiations, \nand $140 billion is where we are today. As we have heard before, there \nis a wild variation on estimates by very smart people as to how much \nthe claims for this fund will total, ranging from $120 billion to $695 \nbillion, which is the high number. Just having a predictable bill we \ncan vote for with some confidence that we believe will actually work as \nintended is lacking.\n  Of course, there is the huge bureaucracy that will be created within \nthe Department of Labor to administer this fund. We have no idea what \nthat will look like, but it will be a new addition to the bureaucracy \nin Washington, DC. I can tell you, the last thing I want to do, coming \nfrom my State to the Senate, is to grow the size of the bureaucracy in \nWashington, DC, unless there is no other option. I do not want to do \nthat.\n  Then there is the issue of the medical criteria, where here again the \nchairman had to negotiate carefully in order to keep his votes on the \ncommittee. But it is my contention that the medical criteria in the \ntrust fund are way too loose--authorizing the payment of substantial \nfunds under the claim to people who are not demonstrably sick from \nasbestos-related disease, thus further jeopardizing the solvency of the \nfund.\n  In response to my colleague, Senator Hatch of Utah, who expressed \nconcern for the veterans who could benefit\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\nunder the fund but who would not directly, anyway, benefit under a \nmedical criteria approach, I think it would be a cruel joke--a cruel \njoke--for our veterans, if we built their expectations up, that they \nwere going to receive benefits under the trust fund, only to have it \nexplode or go bankrupt in a year or two and dash those hopes to the \nground.\n\n  So I am as concerned as anyone is about our veterans. But I certainly \ndo not want to give anyone unrealistic hope or expectation that this is \ngoing to be a panacea, because of the concerns I have raised.\n  I would agree with the Democratic whip that we have only today seen a \nsubstitute for the underlying bill filed which totals almost 400 pages. \nWhile a number of us have been working on asbestos legislation for a \nlong time, neither I nor my staff, I am confident, had a chance to read \neach and every one of those 393 pages, I believe it was, to determine \nwhat is in it and to determine whether there are amendments we need to \nfile in response. Likewise, I would say, as to the 50-page bill we \nfiled this morning, the amendment that contains the medical criteria \napproach, people are only now beginning to understand what their \nchoices are.\n  Basically, what this amendment presents is a choice, either for a \ntrust fund or an alternative medical criteria bill or, third, no bill \nat all, a continuation of the current crisis, about which I think we \nhave a bipartisan consensus that it is a scandal and needs to be \naddressed.\n  So I believe the amendment does present a good alternative. But I \nwould like to have a chance for my colleagues to look at it further. We \nhave had a number of good discussions across the aisle. I have talked \nto a number of colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and they \nsaid, well, they would like to keep the amendment alive. They want to \nvote against the motion to table, but they are not yet ready to vote \nfor the amendment because they may want to try to negotiate and work \nout some minor differences so they can support it. I would like to have \nthe opportunity to do that with them.\n  I would, by the way, point out, I guess as further evidence of what I \nam talking about--Senators reading the bill, coming to understand now \nthey are not left with either the trust fund or nothing at all, that \nthey have a third choice with the medical criteria bill--we have had \ntwo additional Senators come forward and ask to cosponsor it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Saxby Chambliss \nand Senator Mike Enzi be added as cosponsors to the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CHAFEE). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I believe, given adequate time, there will \nbe other Senators who will be interested in this alternative approach. \nHere again, I believe we are all committed to trying to find a \nsolution. I hope we are because we know the status quo is a scandal. \nHere again, it is with great respect and admiration for the long and \narduous effort put into this by the chairman that I hesitated even to \noffer this alternative. But I do believe that based on the merits, \nbased on the choice it provides to the Members of the Senate, and based \nupon the need to have a little bit more time for Members of the Senate \nto understand what is in the amendment and to negotiate perhaps \nagreement so we can come back with some modification and an up-or-down \nvote on that, that I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to \ntable, both on the merits and based on the need for more time for \ndeliberation and adequate consideration.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Senator from Texas says the \nstatus quo is a scandal, he is right. But the medical criteria bill is \na ``scandal lite.'' It is a light scandal. You hear about Coke and Coke \nLite. Well, this bill is a scandal in its own right, not quite as big a \nscandal but a scandal nonetheless.\n  The only change which this medical criteria bill makes that is an \nimprovement over the present system is that it does not allow \ncollection by people who have been exposed but who are not yet sick. \nBut this medical criteria bill does not go to the heart of the problem; \nthat is, the thousands of people suffering deadly and serious injuries \nwho have no one to sue.\n  This bill is directed to protect the veterans of America who have \nbeen exposed to asbestos in a variety of contexts, sometimes during \nwork at shipyards, sometimes during work at other governmental \nfacilities, but they have no one to sue. This bill is directed to \nprovide compensation to employees of some 77 companies which have gone \nbankrupt, where they have no one to sue because the company is in \ndefault and the company is bankrupt.\n  This bill, similarly, does not answer the grave problem of the \neconomy of the United States, with companies continuing to go bankrupt \nbecause litigation continues. You still have the costs of going to \ncourt--the costs of filing papers, the costs of depositions, discovery, \ninterrogatories, taking the case to trial.\n  And then you continue to have the lawyers taking the lion's share of \nthe compensation. The fact is that only 42 cents of every dollar spent \non asbestos litigation goes to the victims. The fact is, surprisingly, \nmore money goes to defense costs--31 cents of every dollar--and 27 \ncents of every dollar goes to plaintiffs' attorneys. That is a \nstatistic compiled by the reliable RAND Corporation.\n  So the medical criteria bill does nothing at all to deal with the \nreal problems with regard to asbestos litigation but is designed, pure \nand simple, to defeat the trust fund concept which is on the floor.\n\n  When the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Nevada argue \nstrenuously against the trust fund proposal, they do not want this \nbill. It is window dressing and a red herring to cite the companies \nwhich are going to save money because the thrust of the bill is to make \nan equitable allocation, which we think we do here. There has never \nbeen any real attack on that, except this wild talk about secrecy, \nwhich is unfounded. And you continue to have the problem of companies \ngoing bankrupt and people not being able to collect because there is no \none from whom to collect.\n  When the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Texas complain \nabout the new bill, there again, it is something they know better. They \nhave the original bill. We had managers' amendments totaling some 47. \nAnd as a tactical matter, the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Nevada said they would put us through every one of these \namendments individually. The procedural way to deal with it was to put \nthem all in another bill called the substitute bill. But they know what \nis involved. They know what bill is involved. And the substance is \nbefore them. So you have one charade after another.\n  And you have a system which is scandalous. Nobody who has addressed \nthis problem disagrees with the nature of the problem. Scandal is a \ngood characterization for it. Scandal is an equally good \ncharacterization for the medical criteria bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I respect my colleague from Texas and \nthose others who believe this amendment will be a preferable way to \ndeal with the asbestos morass we now have. I, however, based on my best \njudgment, cannot agree. It perhaps will make some businesses happy and \nsome plaintiffs' lawyers happy, but the one group I clearly think will \nnot be as well treated and will not have the same guarantees and \nprotections will be the victims.\n  We are not here to represent any one group. We are here to look at a \nlitigation problem that has gone wild. It has lost control. It is not \noperating properly. I think the trust fund concept is the only way to \nmake this thing have any sanity about it.\n  As I understand it, the medical criteria will help a great deal in \nmaking sure that claims by people who are not sick are not maintained \nin court, that they can be dismissed short of trial. That would be a \ntremendous benefit. I will not dispute that. It would certainly reduce \nthose kinds of lawsuits.\n  However, it would have no coherence. It seems to me that two people \ncould file a lawsuit, and one could draw a favorable judge or favorable \njury and win\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\n$50 million and the other one, I suppose, could win nothing or $1 \nmillion. I do not know that it would represent any predictability for \nthe defendant companies so they could show on their balance sheets \nprecisely what they are going to be looking at in the future as they go \nforward.\n  It also would maintain the current litigation method of handling the \nlawsuits. That, to me, is where we have had the most difficulties \nbecause 60 percent of the money that is being paid out is being eaten \nup by lawyers. So if you have lesser numbers of lawsuits but they are \nbigger and will be more intensely litigated, the defendant companies \nhave to hire expensive attorneys to defend themselves, and the \nplaintiffs' attorneys, facing top defense attorneys, will charge their \nnormal high fees, as the case may be, and you end up back where we are, \nas the RAND Corporation said, with 60 percent--58 percent--of the money \nbeing paid out in expenses, which is what I would like to see avoided.\n  The attractiveness of the legislation that is before us is we take \nthe 60 percent that has been eaten up and we take probably 50 percent \nof that and allow it to go to the victims. They get it, with certainty, \nin an equal amount. So if you have mesothelioma, a deadly disease, \nunder this system, you could file your claim, with a doctor's \ncertificate stating you have mesothelioma--a fairly indisputable \ndiagnosis--and you get $1.1 million; half of it within 30 days and I \nbelieve the other half within 6 months before you die.\n  As I noted before, why have we had so many mesothelioma widows here? \nIt is because these lawsuits take years. I am not just saying that. \nThis is a fact. These cases take years, and people die of diseases or \nbecome disabled without receiving money.\n  Under this bill, you will be able to get your money promptly. The \nproposal, as I understand it, will not necessarily fix that. Maybe the \ncases could be settled.\n  Again, I say to my distinguished colleague from Texas, we agree on so \nmuch of this. I certainly will say this. His proposal would be far \nbetter than the current system.\n  There is no doubt about that. The current system is absolutely \nindefensible. It is to the point that it is immoral, and the Congress \nhas no higher responsibility than to make sure our legal system is \nworking effectively. It is not happening that way.\n  I believe the medical criteria in the base bill before us is not \ntight enough, that it will still allow a large number of people to \nmaintain lawsuits for diseases they were going to get anyway from other \nnatural causes or misbehavior such as smoking. They were going to get \nthose diseases anyway, and they want the asbestos fund to pay for it. \nWhen it is connected to asbestos exposure, and it can be shown \nscientifically, this bill allows for that. It actually allows for \npeople to draw on the fund who probably shouldn't qualify for it.\n  I am for tightening up those criteria. I am for eliminating the \nfrivolous, baseless lawsuits where people are not sick, which this \nCornyn bill would do. But I do believe it would undermine one of my \nhighest goals in this legislation, and that is that we would be in a \nposition where you make a claim like you would in workers' \ncompensation. You have so much injury, you get so much money, and you \nget it promptly. And the maximum attorney's fee would be 5 percent.\n  I don't see how you can limit attorney's fees if you are going to \nhave a long, competitive trial. The victims are going to need top-\nflight attorneys, and the defendants are going to need top-flight \nattorneys. The juries are going to be calling these cases. Some of them \nare going to say big verdicts, and some of them are going to say little \nverdicts. We will have more inconsistencies, more jackpot justice than \nI would like to see.\n  I am reluctantly of the opinion that this would not be the best \napproach. If this bill gets any worse, I would certainly see that the \nsuggestions of the Senator from Texas would be preferable. If this bill \nwere to flounder and isn't successful, I certainly would agree that his \nproposal is better than the current law and would support it. Right \nnow, the Specter legislation is preferable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I find myself in an unusual position of \nboth agreeing and disagreeing with my colleague from Alabama. That \nprobably typifies how most of us feel about the proposed solution in \nthe trust fund. If my colleague from Alabama and I could sit down and \nhammer out some meaningful tort reform, we would not have any trouble \ndoing it, if it were just he and I. I know he is concerned about the \nscandal that 58 cents on the dollar for every asbestos recovery there \nis goes to transaction costs, attorney's fees for the plaintiff, \nattorney's fees for the defendant, court costs, and the like. And that \nis not just in asbestos litigation. That is common, unfortunately, in \npersonal injury litigation generally. If we could get 60 votes to get \ncloture on some meaningful tort reform and have an up-or-down vote, we \ncould be in business and address his concerns, with not only asbestos \nbut with our civil justice system generally. It is out of sync and \nbenefits too few people at the expense of the many.\n  My colleague from Alabama mentioned our effort to try to reduce \nattorney's fees because this is, under the trust fund, a system where \nan individual does not even need a lawyer to make a claim against the \nfund. So we decided in committee to keep it down to 5 percent. But it \nis my understanding, and my colleague can check me on this, that in the \nmanagers' amendment, that negotiated provision on attorney's fees was \nchanged to further expand the recovery of attorney's fees under the \ntrust fund bill.\n  My point is that for every time the chairman, Senator Specter, tries \nto address one concern, he has to address another concern that loses or \nundermines support by someone else. After spending a long time trying \nto come to terms with this and understand it and be constructive about \na solution, I came to the reluctant conclusion that it was futile, that \nthe trust fund was fatally flawed. That is why I have offered my \ncolleagues a choice. In addition to a choice between the trust fund and \nnothing at all, I have offered them another choice, and I would like to \nhave a chance for more colleagues to think about it, to consider it, \nand to work with us to try to make it even better. That is why I urge \nmy colleagues to vote no on the motion to table.\n  Finally, one of the other things we have not spent much time on, \nthere is actually a huge amount of money, hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, put in the trust fund to look for new claimants. It pays for \nscreening of people who have not voluntarily come forward but basically \ngoes out and looks for more claimants, which further stresses the fund \nand increases the likelihood that it will go under because of an \noverwhelming number of claims that have not been taken into account in \narriving at the amount of the fund or the medical criteria for which \nclaims would be paid and which would be excluded.\n  I hope my colleagues, both on the merits and on the basis of process, \nthe need for more time to carefully consider our alternatives and come \nup with the best possible solution, will vote no on the motion to \ntable.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Cornyn substitute \namendment to S. 852. I thank the Senator from Texas for his work on \nthis issue. He is someone who comes to this debate with great knowledge \nof the subject matter and has modeled his legislation after what has \nbeen a very successful model in the State of Texas.\n  As the Senator from Texas has noted, this is a problem that needs to \nbe addressed. Out-of-control asbestos litigation has become a disease \nin our economy. It threatens to drive scores of companies into \nbankruptcy. It diverts compensation away from legitimate victims of \nasbestos. It discourages investment in companies under suit and drives \nstock values down and diverts funds away from expansion and growth and \nresults in job loss. In short, it has become an obstacle to economic \nrecovery.\n  Few of us in this Chamber can disagree with those very basic facts. \nHowever, I am not persuaded that creating\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\na new Federal program, yet another entitlement program, one more \ncompensation program, is the right solution. We need to seriously \nassess the wisdom of Congress's growing inclination to create more of \nwhat are virtually uncapped entitlement funds. The problem is in the \ncourts. That is where the solution should be. We cannot continue to \nhave the Government take every litigation quagmire out of the court \nsystem and put the problem on the back of the Federal Government and \nultimately on the backs of the taxpayers. We cannot continue to do so.\n  I voted to proceed to debate on this bill because this is a problem. \nIt needs to be solved. Indeed, Congress must act. But what is the best \nsolution? Should we create yet another entitlement trust fund or should \nwe reform the tort system by imposing reasonable medical criteria \nstandards in the courts?\n  We need to find a solution that protects both the economy and the \nlegal rights of those truly injured by asbestos or who will develop \nasbestos-related injuries in the future. It is my belief that it would \nbe a mistake to establish an asbestos trust fund. I know this fund \nrelies on private financing. Unfortunately, this may turn out to be \nonly the seed money and unable, over time, to sustain the fund for very \nlong, creating a high risk that Congress, at some point in the future \nmay have to step in to keep it operating. The last thing we need is \nanother uncapped Government entitlement, especially with our existing \ndeficits.\n  The major problem with the trust fund is that the private funding is \ncapped but the potential liability is not. We have to face reality. \nThis fund will go insolvent. I don't believe it is a question of if; it \nis a question of when. The underlying bill supposedly answered that by \nputting in a sunset provision that, when the fund goes insolvent, sends \nall unpaid claimants back to the tort system, the same broken tort \nsystem that we have today. Does anybody really believe that will \nhappen? This Senator certainly does not.\n  With hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of unpaid claimants, \nwould those claimants be happy about going back into a court system to \nspend 3 or more years litigating a case for an award that probably \nwould be less than they could have received under this trust fund bill? \nI don't think they will do that.\n  Political pressure on Congress from union and victims groups to bail \nout the trust fund and sustain it would be immense. These liability \ntrust funds typically do not go back to the tort system. Trust funds in \ngeneral rarely ever go away, not after creating an entirely new class \nof entitled people. So let's not delude ourselves.\n  President Reagan once said that the closest thing to immortality on \nthis planet is a government program. Once we create a whole new class \nof entitled people, it will be very difficult to go back or in any way \nsunset this program. The result would be the taxpayers being left on \nthe hook. That is why I support the Cornyn substitute amendment.\n  I ask my colleagues to seriously consider where Congress is going if \nit creates such a fund. What kind of precedent is this creating and \nwhere will this end?\n  There has been a dangerous inclination by Congress to rescue segments \nof our economy from out-of-control litigation by simply taking claims \nout of the courts and creating a Government-administered liability \ntrust fund. The solution should be commonsense tort reform, not to have \nthe Government become some gigantic claims processing and payment \nagency.\n  The best solution, one that has no cost to the Treasury, that does \nnot require the creation of new Government agencies or battalions of \nGovernment administrators and one that will have immediate positive \neffect for both business and victims is a simple solution that, one, \nestablishes reliable and verifiable medical criteria standards in the \ncourts; two, tolls the statute of limitations to protect future \nvictims; and, three, prohibits abusive venue shopping. That is it. It \nis simple. It is not loaded up with tort reform that our friends on the \nother side of the aisle often object to. And importantly, many trial \nlawyers who represent malignant claims of asbestos exposure have in the \npast endorsed this approach.\n  It is time to consider a more modest solution. It may not provide the \ngrand, comprehensive solution that many have wished for, but it takes a \nsubstantial bite out of the problem and is certainly better than \nnothing, which is what all parties will have if we continue to pursue \nthe impossible.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against the motion to table and to \nsupport the Cornyn substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel \nbe added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time, if \nany exists.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will yield the floor when Senator \nSpecter returns. I will say a couple of things. First, under this \ncriteria bill--which has good criteria and some very good provisions in \nit--veterans are not going to be able to recover. Veterans don't have \nanybody to sue, and they would be very much disadvantaged. That is why \nthey oppose it.\n  No. 2, we would still have litigation, and the reason litigation now \nceases to be wise is because the defendants are prepared to pay. It is \nbasically not a question so much of how they are responsible--whether \nanybody is responsible for damages; they are prepared to pay, but they \nwant to know a predictable amount that they are paying, No. 1, and they \nwant to have it paid fairly.\n  Under this system, if you meet the illness criteria and you are able \nto proceed with your litigation, one person with asbestosis, who \nseriously has a disability, maybe is on oxygen--as I have known people \nto be as a result of breathing asbestos--they might get $100 million, \nliterally. Another person may get zero. So I think we have this \naberrational way that a certain limited amount of resources would be \nutilized to help people who are sick.\n  We are at a point now where we have created a circumstance that would \nallow a fairly even workmen's compensation type distribution of it. \nSecondly, it allows the litigation spasm to continue. Yes, it will take \nout the bogus claims from people who are not sick and who don't need to \nbe in court. Those claims will be able to be removed. But they will \nhave large numbers of trials of those who actually are injured by \nasbestos, and the lawyers on both sides have to be compensated. We know \ntoday that those compensation arrangements turn out to eat up 58 \npercent of the cost of what the defendant companies pay out. In other \nwords, many of these companies that are in bankruptcy, and many more on \nthe verge of bankruptcy and could be pushed into bankruptcy, are paying \nout to victims, but only 42 percent of what they are paying out gets to \nthe victims.\n  So I was hoping in this legislation--my vision has always been, how \ncan we not fix this system? How hard is it to take this 60 percent, \nallow the business community some predictability and certainty over 30 \nyears, and get more money to the victims quicker and faster? If, \ninstead of 300,000 pending lawsuits, let's say you have now 150,000 \npending lawsuits, that is a lot of lawsuits. That is a lot of lawsuits. \nAnd they are pending by the thousands in certain districts in America. \nPeople are not going to get trials right away. They are not going to be \nable to say I want to have my trial today; I have a serious asbestosis; \nI am on oxygen; I may die soon, or I have mesothelioma, and this is a \ndeadly disease, and the doctors say I only have 9 months to live, and I \nwant to have my case tried. It is not going to happen that way. It is \nnot happening that way now, and it will not under this bill.\n  Therefore, people are going to die and suffer in poverty for years \nbefore they get any payment; whereas, in this bill, we can get the \nmoney to the victims promptly and fairly, in an objective way, with \nplaintiffs similarly injured, similarly situated, getting similar \namounts of money--generous amounts\n\n[[Page S956]]\n\nof money. As I noted, a mesothelioma case gets $1.1 million. Half would \nbe paid within 30 days, without any need for an attorney whatsoever. \nYou go in with a medical claim, and if an attorney is involved, the \nmaximum he could get is 5 percent.\n  My colleague from Texas said we modified the attorney fee rule, and I \nwas at fault for that. Senators Specter and Leahy and others asked we \nconsider the fact that when cases are appealed, they tend to become \ncomplex and require quite a bit of lawyer time, and we ought to allow \nlawyers to have more than that, if the judge approves it. So I thought \nthat was a reasonable request. We have amended it only to that small \ndegree. It is not an opening up of attorneys' fees under this bill.\n  I am concerned that some of the primary advantages of asbestos reform \nwould not be availed under this amendment. That is why I am reluctantly \nnot able to support it. I hope we can continue with the bill and that \nother people will bring forth thoughtful amendments, as Senator Cornyn \nhas, and those who joined with him and presented it in a thoughtful \nway. But as I have stated, I don't believe it is the proper vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. For the opponents of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as we wind down on this debate, I want to \nemphasize to my colleagues the importance of this vote because this \namendment, essentially, after looking at it in some detail, is a poison \npill. If this amendment is not defeated, the whole thrust of the \ncompensation program for victims of asbestos who cannot now collect one \npenny will be defeated. The whole thrust of this trust fund was to \ncompensate victims whose employers had gone bankrupt, compensate \nveterans who have served the country, who have no one to sue, and to \nstop the rush of bankruptcies, now totaling some 77, resulting in a \nloss to the economy estimated at some $300 billion.\n  This proposal for a medical criteria bill doesn't even rise to the \nlevel of being palliative. It doesn't do anything except defer the \nclaims of people who have been exposed until they become ill. It \ndoesn't do anything about the rash of bankruptcies. It doesn't do \nanything about the people who suffer from mesothelioma, which is a \ndeadly ailment, where they have no one to sue. So when the sponsor of \nthe bill characterizes the current system as scandalous, that \napprobation could apply equally well.\n  This is one of the many votes on the floor of the Senate where the \noutcome is uncertain. There is a curious alliance here, with some on \none side of the aisle and some on the other side of the aisle. Trial \nlawyers may be for this amendment if it can be modified because they \nsee the medical criteria bill as a way of continuing to bring cases to \ncourt, and to continue with the current structure. I don't criticize \nthe trial lawyers. I don't criticize anybody. I don't criticize the \ntrial lawyers for exercising whatever rights the current system allows. \nBut it is up to the Congress of the United States to make the \ndetermination as to what is the appropriate public policy. That is a \ncongressional decision to make.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely \nright; it will not be a party-line vote. I hope the Senator from \nPennsylvania succeeds. It is interesting, the people who represent \nvictims and people who don't have legal representation support the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. Just about every labor union supports the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, as veterans groups do. I will not go through \nthe list again. Just about every veterans group that has spoken on this \nissue supports the Senator from Pennsylvania. There are a lot of others \nwho support the Senator from Pennsylvania, but I mention veterans and \nlabor as an interesting coalition. They are speaking for people who \nwould not have a voice otherwise. They support what the Senator from \nPennsylvania is doing, as do an awful lot of businesses, I might add. I \nhope he is successful.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield for a question, to pinpoint \nwhat the Senator said about labor's support. The AFL-CIO, which \nrepresents labor, the working men and women of America, has been a \nparty to the discussion for 2\\1/2\\ years, at some 36 meetings, which \nJudge Becker and I have presided over. When they heard about this \nmedical criteria bill, they were alarmed at the impact it would have on \nthe working men and women and the veterans, their constituency, and \nthey put out an all-points to those people as to what was going on.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Vermont would care to amplify, as the \nsenior Democrat and principal cosponsor of the Leahy-Specter bill, as \nto what labor is doing in this area.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is interesting. We have a lot of labor unions coming \nout foursquare for the bill. Some held back and they want a couple of \nchanges they are looking for. It is interesting that all of them are \nagainst this amendment--those who haven't yet endorsed the bill and \nthose who have endorsed the bill. It is the same with the veterans \ngroups. I think they know that this amendment, no matter how well \nintentioned it would be, if it went through, basically kills the \nchances of people to recover anything. It puts us back into the decades \nof litigation where, as people across the spectrum were saying, from \nthe late Chief Justice William Rehnquist to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we \nneed a solution on the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield further, as to what happened \nin today's maneuvering and negotiations on the floor, where we have had \ninitially the trial lawyers being against this amendment. If people \nwere wondering what all the maneuvering and negotiation was about, why \nwe could not have an up-or-down vote, but a tabling motion, that is \nbecause the trial lawyers think that the amendment offered by Senator \nCornyn may be better for them, but they want to change it around so \nthat if this motion to table is not defeated, they will have time to \nrework it to their satisfaction.\n  That is the way the system works, and if that happens--this is now \nThursday afternoon at 16 minutes to 5--there will be frantic \nnegotiations between now and Tuesday, when we come back to work on this \nbill--or perhaps Monday afternoon--to come to an alliance. I won't call \nit an unholy alliance, but it will be an alliance in very curious ways, \nwhere people who oppose the bill do so out of the mistaken notion that \nit is going to cost the Government money. This bill is ironclad not to \ncost the Government money. People on my side of the aisle who are \nopposed to it don't want to have the Government undertake an \nobligation, and I agree with that. This bill accomplishes that, with no \ngovernmental obligations. Now the issue is whether sufficient trial \nlawyers on your side of the aisle may come to a majority.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Well, if the Senator will yield, like him, I was a trial \nlawyer. But I know with all trial lawyers, there are times when you \nhave a superb settlement before you, you take it. The bill the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania and I put together, after countless hours, months, \nand years of work, is a lot better settlement than going to a jury. I \nwill support the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to table the Cornyn amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nwith the call of the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \npreviously been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I know there is no consent order in effect. \nWe were of the understanding that we were going to go back and forth \nwith amendments--there would be a Republican amendment, a Democratic \namendment. If that is not the case, I am certainly willing to live by \nthat, but I thought that was the agreement. I certainly have not spoken \nto the managers of the bill, Senator Specter and Senator Leahy, nor did \nI, in fact, speak to Senator Durbin, but that was my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada has said, \nthere has been no understanding. It is agreeable with me to have an \nunderstanding as to that effect in the future. I have already talked to \nSenator Kyl, who is poised to offer this amendment. I am glad to enter \ninto such an understanding. There is not one at the present time. I \nwould like to proceed with Senator Kyl and alternate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, we have no problem with Senator \nKyl offering the next amendment. The only problem is we have not seen \nit. Could we have some idea of what it is all about?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor for the purposes of letting the \nSenator from Nevada be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PROPORTIONAL PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) At page 171, after line 5, insert new (c) as follows \n     (the subsection references assume that the required \n     renumbering has occurred):\n       ``(c) Limitation.--For any affiliated group, the total \n     payment in any year, including any guaranteed payment \n     surcharge under subsection (m) and any bankruptcy trust \n     guarantee surcharge under section 222(c), shall not exceed \n     the lesser of $16,702,400 or 1.67024 percent of the revenues \n     of the affiliated group for the most recent fiscal year \n     ending on or prior to December 31, 2002, or for the most \n     recent 12-month fiscal year as of the date the limitation is \n     applied, whichever is greater.

Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  For those who have been involved in this issue, it has been discussed \nactually since last August and deals with the small companies or \nbusinesses that would be paying into the fund that is the subject of \nthis bill. The amendment is designed to reduce the impact of the trust \nfund on the small- and medium-sized companies and to ensure that the \nfund does not drive them into bankruptcy.\n  It does principally two things.\n  First, it provides across-the-board relief to small- or midsized \ncompanies, those with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion, by \nlimiting their trust fund contributions to 1.67 percent of their gross \nrevenues. This per se relief should resolve most ability-to-pay \nproblems that are created by the fund with certainty and without \nadministrative burdens.\n  For those who do not qualify for this across-the-board relief or for \nwhom it is not enough, the amendment provides a second form of hardship \nrelief. It authorizes the administrator to reduce the company's fund \nassessments if the company otherwise would go out of business and would \nbe unable to pay its bills. To be exact, under the amendment, a company \ncan qualify for an adjustment if it can show that its fund payments \n``would materially and adversely affect the defendant participant's \nability to continue its business and to pay or satisfy its debts \ngenerally as and when they come due.'' Under this amendment, access to \nthis form of relief would be unlimited.\n  This amendment does not solve all of the problems with the trust fund \nallocation of payments. I anticipate there will be other amendments to \naddress some of those issues, and I support some of those amendments, \nas well. I believe this amendment does go a long way toward solving the \nproblem I identified.\n  What this amendment does do is shave off some of the roughest edges \nof this bill. This amendment makes the hardship adjustment a real and \npredictable guarantee. The way that the bill currently is written, some \nsmall- and medium-sized companies will be hit with trust fund payments \nthat will constitute a major portion of their gross revenues. These \ncompanies obviously will not be able to make these payments. While the \nbill currently authorizes an insolvency hardship adjustment, that \nhardship adjustment is vaguely stated and includes limitations that \nundercut its usefulness for many companies on the margins. Literally, \ncompanies faced with crushing payments under the bill would be forced \nto tell potential creditors or capital markets, ``yes, we will be \nrequired to pay 25 percent of our gross revenues into the trust fund \nunder the FAIR Act, but we might be able to get a hardship \nadjustment.'' You can see why these companies might have trouble \ngetting a loan. Under my amendment, these same small- and medium-sized \ncompanies will be able to tell the banks and potential investors that \nthey will not be forced to pay more than one and two-thirds of a \npercent of their gross revenues into the fund. By providing guaranteed \nreasonable limits on assessments, this amendment will make it possible \nfor these companies to continue to engage in normal business \ntransactions.\n  This amendment does not directly affect the availability of inequity \nadjustments under the trust fund. The amendment does, however, \nindirectly expand the availability of inequity adjustments by making \nhardship adjustments into a separate category that is not drawn from \nthe $300 million that is currently set aside for both kinds of \nadjustments. That $300 million will now be set aside solely for equity \nadjustments.\n  Also, the amendment does not in any way affect the fund's guarantee \nof producing $3 billion a year for compensating victims. Under the bill \nas it is currently written, in the event of any shortfall in reaching \nthat $3 billion, a guaranteed payment surcharge is imposed on all \ndefendant participants in order to make up the difference. Thus, to the \nextent that relief received by any defendant pursuant to this amendment \nprevents the fund from reaching the $3 billion target, that gap will be \nfilled by the payment surcharge. This amendment, therefore, in no way \nadversely affects the FAIR Act's funding guarantee.\n  Allow me to describe in greater detail exactly how this amendment \nworks. Under the amendment, no defendant participant, other than a Tier \nI participant, with 2002 revenues of less than $1 billion is required \nto contribute more than the greater of 1.67 percent of its revenues as \nof December 31, 2002, or 1.67 percent of its revenues for the most \nrecent 12-month fiscal year. The revenue cap employed by this amendment \nmatches the 1.67 percent of gross revenues that is the measure of Tier \nI contributions. Also, only companies that elect to report on a \nconsolidated basis may take advantage of this revenue cap.\n  This amendment's revenue cap is only a rough measure of ability to \npay. It is, however, easy to administer, and it is less subject to \nmanipulation than other measures, such as net income.\n  As for the amendment's changes to the hardship adjustment, first, \nthere currently are two hardship provisions in the bill--section \n204(d)(2), which provides relief generally for severe financial \nhardship and which is subject to the $300 million hardship and inequity \ncap, and section 204(d)(5), which allows the cap to be exceeded if \notherwise a company would be forced into insolvency. My amendment would \nrewrite (d)(2) to provide clearer standards, eliminate (d)(5), and make \nclear that there is no cap on hardship relief. The result is a simpler \nproposal more attuned to the needs of potential hardship-adjustment \napplicants.\n\n  Under the amendment, any defendant participant can apply for hardship \nrelief, whether it is in Tier I or not, and whether or not it reports \non a consolidated basis. However, in the case of defendant participants \nthat do not file on a consolidated basis, the administrator must \nexamine the real financial situation of the defendant participant by \ntaking into consideration the financial position of the affiliated \ngroup.\n  Again, under the revised hardship adjustment in this amendment, the \nAdministrator may grant an adjustment if he concludes that the amount \nof a defendant participant's payment obligation would materially and \nadversely affect the defendant participant's ability to continue its \nbusiness and to pay or satisfy its debts generally as and when they \ncome due. The amount of relief would be limited to the amount necessary \nto avoid the problem.\n  In determining whether to grant an adjustment under this revised \nprovision, the administrator will required to consider, among other \nthings: the historical audited financial statements for the defendant \nparticipant or affiliated group for the three years immediately prior \nto the application for relief; projected financial statements for the 3 \nfiscal years following that application; an analysis of capital \nspending and fixed charge coverage on a historical basis for the 3 \nfiscal years preceding and the 3 fiscal years immediately following the \napplication; any payments or transfers of property made, or obligations \nincurred, by the defendant participant during the 6 fiscal years prior \nto the application to or for the benefit of any insider; any \nextraordinary transactions of the defendant participant, including \npayments of extraordinary salaries, bonuses, or dividends, within the 6 \nfiscal years prior to the application; the defendant participant's \nability to satisfy its payment obligations to the fund by borrowing or \nfinancing with equity capital, or through issuance of securities to the \nfund; and the defendant participant's ability to postpone discretionary \ncapital spending for a reasonable period.\n  The term of any adjustment under the amendment shall be 5 years, \nunless the administrator determines that a shorter or longer period is \nappropriate in light of the financial condition of the defendant \nparticipant. Any adjustment under the amendment may be renewed upon a \nshowing that it continues to be justified--and it is automatically \nterminated if the defendant participant files for bankruptcy \nprotection.\n  The amendment also eliminates provisions for recapture of hardship \nadjustments, except in cases of fraud. The current bill's provisions \nfor frequent review of hardship adjustments and potential for giving \nadjustments back\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\nhave significantly reduced the usefulness of these adjustments in \naddressing the concerns of companies on the margins. If these \nadjustments aren't reasonably predictable, they are not useful either.\n  Finally, under the amendment, companies that have received discounts \noff their tier/subtier allocation because of the cap or hardship \nadjustments would only get the benefit of cumulative step downs to the \nextent that the step downs exceeded the amount of the discounts the \ncompany already had. The same rule applies for hardship adjustments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \noffering this amendment.\n  This is a good amendment. There has been a great deal of concern that \nsmaller businesses--although we are talking about businesses which are \nsubstantial, but they are smaller than many in the field--should not \npay more than they can afford to pay. This amendment achieves that \nresult.\n  I add that Senator Kyl has been an outstanding member of the \ncommittee for many years, and in the past year and a half since I have \nbecome chairman, he has been a stalwart and has worked tirelessly on \nthis bill. I don't know how many meetings he and I and others, \nincluding the presiding Senator, Mr. Cornyn, have had. This has been a \nmatter very much on the Senator's mind and many others who have \nsuggested many other provisions. It is a very good amendment. I thank \nand compliment the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \nbill violates section 407 of H. Con. Res. 95, the concurrent resolution \non the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to waive the point of order under the applicable \nprovisions of the rules and statutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is debatable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of this issue is that the \npoint of order should not be sustained because there is no Federal \nmoney involved. All of the money involved comes from private sources. \nThis is a make-or-break issue for this bill.\n  The Federal budget is not involved in this bill. To repeat, which I \ndon't like to do, but for emphasis, the Federal budget is not involved \nin this bill. The money comes from private sources. It goes through the \nDepartment of Labor as a conduit. Technically, there is a Federal \nexpenditure, but it is not the Federal Government's money. Now, the \nonly issue which has been raised is that at some point in the future, \nthe Federal Government might seek to bail out this trust fund. The bill \nis emphatic in a number of places that the Federal Government has no \nobligation to pay out any money. If the trust fund runs short, there \nare provisions to meet that situation. It is a complicated provision, \nbut the administrator makes an analysis, and if he sees the necessity \nto make some modifications in the trust fund, he can take it to a \ncommittee and the committee can then make a recommendation to Congress. \nThe Congress has to act.\n  The real safety valve is the one provided by the Biden amendment in \nJuly of 2003 that if the fund runs out of money, claimants can go back \nto court. So the claimants are no worse off going back to court if the \ntrust fund runs out of money than they are now. But in the interim, \nthousands of people who suffer from deadly diseases--mesothelioma and \nexposure to asbestos--will be paid where they cannot be paid now \nbecause their companies are bankrupt or they are veterans and there is \nno one to sue.\n  The consideration that some future Congress, decades down the road, \nin the year 2030, might have a different view is up to the Congress in \nthat year. We cannot bind them as to what they are going to do, nor \nshould we try to bind them. But what we do here does not implicate or \ninvolve the Federal Treasury. To say that there may be a temptation in \nthe future for some Congress to spend Federal funds is not something we \nshould do. It is not within our purview. It is not within our \nresponsibility. In fact, we ought to keep our hands off the future \nCongresses. We should not presume that we know enough in the year 2006 \nto tell the Congress in the year 2026 what to do. They will be elected. \nThey may well be a lot smarter than this Congress. Perhaps it is hard \nnot to be. But it is up to them at that time.\n  This is a convenient maneuver to defeat the bill by requiring 60 \nvotes. That is like the motion to proceed, the filibuster, to try to \nstructure a vote for 60 votes, to try to find enough people who do not \nlike the bill; only takes 41 who do not like the bill to defeat the \nbill on this kind of a maneuver, whereas it takes 51 to defeat this \nbill otherwise.\n  The administration is for it. If this bill goes 50-50, the Vice \nPresident votes for it. The President issued a statement of support on \nS. 852. There are caveats in it. He said there are concerns. I don't \nknow of any Member of this Senate who does not have some concerns about \nthis bill. But that is what the debate is for. That is what we are here \nto consider. We will not be able to consider this if this point of \norder is sustained.\n  I yield to the real expert on budgets, a man who was chairman of the \nCommittee on the Budget for 73 years.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am 73 years old, but I didn't chair it all the time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thought he chaired it his entire life. Senator \nDomenici was the chairman of the Committee on the Budget the day I was \nsworn in. I have great respect for Senator Gregg, chairman of the \nCommittee on the Budget today, but I yield to the chairman of the \nCommittee on the Budget emeritus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So that I understand, I am speaking on my own time now; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized in his own right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right. First, let me say the Senator who is raising the \npoint of order has every right to raise the point of order. The \nquestion is, is this a real point of order? I want to tell the Senate, \nI am not the Parliamentarian. I am not the Congressional Budget Office. \nBut if I were either, I would say this point of order does not even \nlie, not that we should defeat it, it just does not lie. It is not a \nproper interpretation of the existing budget law to say this point of \norder can be raised and can invalidate this bill because the bill \nviolates the budget.\n  I want the Senators who are worried about voting to waive this point \nof order to understand this is not a budgetary issue. This is a \ntechnical point of order that got to the Senate because the \nCongressional Budget Office, I assume, or the Parliamentarian in \nconsultation with the Congressional Budget Office, ruled that any \nexpenditure of money exceeding $5 billion over a baseline in the year \n2016 cannot be sustained.\n  You see, Senator Byrd, this was done by our distinguished new \nchairman of the Budget Committee because he found that budgets were \nbeing broken in future years by putting in a program that ran at $2 or \n$3 billion a year and increased, way out there in future years, up to \n$10 or $15 billion.\n  Now, fellow Senators, what I have described was perfectly valid until \nthe distinguished chairman, within his rights, decided that this was a \nproblem he wanted to solve. Now, you see, the goal is to prevent the \nbump-up of expenditures in future years that are unexpected by \neverybody voting today--unexpected because the increase comes along 10 \nyears later and costs much more than what you thought you were voting \nfor.\n  Now, I cannot explain it any better than that. That is about the best \nI can do. Somebody must have determined that this budget rule applies \nbecause there is no way to disburse this trust fund money without going \nthrough the Department of Labor. That must be it. Because some \nGovernment agency must take this money--not tax money, not Federal \nmoney--and run it through their books and write the checks, somebody \nhas decided that this fear of a bump-up in some future year applies.\n  My good friend from Nevada is absolutely right to bring up this point \nof order if what he wants to have happen to this bill is for it to be \nproven by 60 votes. That is fine. But I want everybody to know, if the \npoint of order is not sustained and this bill goes forward, I don't \nthink the deficit of the United States is going to be affected in 2016 \nby one dollar if this $5 billion estimate is true because the money is \nnot\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\nreally on the Federal books. The trust fund has no real relationship to \nthe expenditure of Federal money.\n  So in considering this budget rule--I have explained it to you--I \nask: how are we going to break the budget when this money is not even \npart of the budget? It is not on the budget. The money is going to be \ncollected and then go through the Department of Labor, but it is not \nFederal money.\n  I say to Senator Byrd, when they send the budget up in 2016, there is \nnot going to be any of this trust fund money. This money might get a \nfootnote. The Department of Labor is going to have to run the trust \nfund, but it cannot add to or subtract from the deficit because the \nGovernment is not spending its money. And it is not tax money.\n  So let me say, if you want to kill this bill based upon a point of \norder that is--it is almost not a point of order, it is just a little, \ntiny technicality--it gets in by the skin of its teeth on an \ninterpretation--then vote for it. If you are worried about saving \nmoney, and being a tightfisted budgeteer, then understand that this has \nnothing to do with being a tightfisted budgeteer because there is no \nbudgeting involved.\n  So I thank the good chairman who has worked so hard on this bill. I \nhave never sat on the committee that produced this bill in my 34 years \nhere. I never chose to go on the Judiciary Committee, so I am not \nintimately knowledgeable about this. But I know we better do something \nabout asbestos. We run around talking about fiscal responsibility and \nhelping business and cutting taxes so we will have more business. If we \ndo not do anything about asbestos, and leave it in the courts, it will \nbe the biggest abuse of the court system that we have ever known.\n  If you want to tell these new countries becoming democracies, ``boy, \nare we a gifted country, we have this great rule of law, this fantastic \ncourt system,'' please, don't let them ask about asbestos because they \nwill laugh: Why should they be like America? Why should they have a \nlegal system that is so messed up that there are hundreds of thousands \nof claimants running around this country with scores of lawyers who, \nwhen we were practicing law, would not even have been lawyers? You \ncould not run around soliciting these cases when I was sworn into the \nbar. You could not run around hiring these doctors when I was a member \nof the bar. You could not run around saying: Go get your neighbors and \nsign them up.\n  That is American law today. It is business. It is entrepreneurial \nlaw. That is what we have. But it is not very orderly and it is not \nvery ``due'' in terms of due process. Nor is it very fair because the \nclaimants do not get very much money. The lawyers get a lot.\n  I do not know why we would want to kill this bill. Lawyers get less. \nThere is an orderliness involved. There is a way to adjudicate claims \ninstead of waiting around for years. So with this point of order, while \nI think it is not even a point of order in the sense of what we \nintended with the 10-year-out rule--let's call it that; the 10-year-out \nrule--I do not know what we are even trying to protect against. It is \nnot going to affect anything except to possibly kill the bill.\n  So with that I thank the Senate for yielding me a few minutes. I \nregret having to intervene before the proponent got to speak. But I \nthank the Senate nonetheless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the \ninterpretation of my colleague on the Budget Committee. I must say, I \ncome to a totally different conclusion based on the law and based on \nthe Congressional Budget Office's own reports.\n  Here is the report from the Congressional Budget Office itself with \nrespect to the issue of whether the point of order raised by the \nSenator from Nevada has merit or not. The Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich is nonpartisan, has said very clearly that this does involve \nFederal direct spending, does involve deficit spending. A point of \norder clearly lies.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Is the Senator aware, the ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee, that the current Republican chairman of the Budget Committee \nhas indeed ruled that the point of order I raised today is actually \nvalid?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. I have talked directly to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and he has said to me he believes that clearly this budget \npoint of order does lie. And he is buttressed, I might say to my \ncolleague, by the Congressional Budget Office itself, which says on \npage 2 of their report on this legislation called S. 852, the Fairness \nin Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, in the last paragraph:\n  Pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent Resolution \non the Budget, Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates that enacting S. 852 \nwould cause an increase in direct spending greater than $5 billion in \nat least one 10-year period from 2016 to 2055.\n  That is the point of order raised by the Senator from Nevada. It is \nabsolutely appropriate, and it clearly lies.\n  People can come out and be unhappy about the result, but the reality \nis we have a problem. And we have a big problem here. Why? Well, we \nhave done an analysis, my professional staff. Here is what they found. \nThe claims and administrative expenses will likely exceed the \ncontributions to the trust fund. No. 2, that upfront claims will far \nexceed contributions, so the trust fund will have to borrow substantial \namounts. I have heard over and over it stated on the floor that there \nis no Federal money, there is no Federal money. Really? Why is it, \nthen, that in the legislation they provide for borrowing Federal money? \nWhy is that? Because everybody knows that point No. 2 is true, that the \nupfront claims are going to greatly exceed the revenue, and the result \nwill be borrowing. And guess who they are going to borrow from. They \nare going to borrow from the Federal Treasury.\n  It is also our conclusion that small adjustments in the amount and \ntiming of the assumptions quickly bankrupt the trust fund; and, \nfinally, that it is unrealistic to assume the trust fund will ever \nterminate. Because the other thing they are saying is: Well, the \nlegislation provides, if they run out of money, we will terminate the \ntrust fund. Let's think about that for a moment. Companies will be on \nthe hook for tens of billions of dollars that they will have to pay \nback that have been borrowed, and then they are thrown back in the \ncourt system too. Can you imagine the outcry that will come from them?\n  Let me go to the next chart. I had hoped to not be engaged in this \ndebate, frankly, but we were asked to do a report. And we have done \nthat report. Professional staff did it. These are the conclusions. They \nlooked at the CBO estimates, and here is what we found. CBO did not \nscore many items that are likely to increase the costs, including \ndormant claims. Those are claims that are not currently being pursued \nbut would have a possibility of getting recovery if they went after \nthis pot of money.\n  No. 2, exceptional medical claims. There are nine categories that \npeople can fit into. But if you do not neatly fit into those, there is \nan opportunity for the costs to rise.\n  And third, CBO did not score any claims of family members of workers \nwho were exposed to asbestos.\n  We also--the professional staff found that CBO's estimate of the \nnumber of future cancer claims is likely to be too low. The CBO \nanalysis concluded there would be 78,000 new cancer claims. The \nTillinghast study--which we believe is the most objective study out \nthere, which was done by the Johns Manville trust--ran 14 different \nscenarios. They found, on average, 133,000 new cancer claims is the \nlikely result, not 78,000. By the way, if they are right, if the \nmidpoint of their range is correct, the increase in cost will be very \ndramatic. Finally, CBO's estimate of the percent of nonmalignant claims \nthat will receive a cash award is likely too conservative.\n  In this legislation, there are five tiers for non-malignant claims. \nTier 1 gets medical monitoring. They do not get money. Tier 2 gets cash \nawards of $25,000; tier 3, $100,000. CBO has estimated only 15 percent \nof claimants will get cash awards.\n  When our people went out and talked to experts, they said the range \nis 10 to\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\n40 percent. Our people took the midpoint of that range, 25 percent. The \nTillinghast study suggests it will be in the range of 23 or 24 percent. \nThat increases the cost over CBO's analysis.\n\n  The conclusion of the Budget Committee staff on the minority side is \nthat the shortfall over the period of the fund will be $150 billion, \nthe net present value difference being $50 billion. In other words, the \n$150 billion shortfall is over the life of the fund. That turns into a \nnet present value of $50 billion. But to show you how sensitive this \nis, we were very conservative in terms of new cancer claims. CBO said \n78,000. Our study said 90,000. Tillinghast, in 14 different scenarios, \non average found 133,000 new cancer claims. If they are right, this \nnumber is not $150 billion, it is $295 billion, with a net present \nvalue of $85 billion.\n  Let's reality test for one moment. We went out and looked at what has \nhappened in other cases where funds were set up, what the initial \nestimates were and then what actually happened. In the case of the \nManville trust, the original range was that there would be on the low \nend 50,000 claims and on the high end, they said 200,000 claims. Here \nis how many there have actually been to date--not 50,000, not 200,000--\nthere have already been 690,000 claims. That is not the end of it. They \nnow estimate there will be another 1.4 million claims on top of that, \nfor a total of over 2 million claims. So what is the result? The result \nis, people who were promised certain recovery are getting 5 cents on \nthe dollar. That is what they are getting now, 5 cents on the dollar.\n  We also looked at the black lung fund. In the black lung fund they \nprojected at the beginning, the original estimate, it would cost $3 \nbillion. Here is what it has cost so far--$41 billion. That is through \n2004.\n  The assertion has been made that CBO has said this is paid for. That \nisn't their conclusion. CBO said this in the letter:\n\n       The proposed trust fund might or might not have adequate \n     resources to pay all valid claims. There is a significant \n     likelihood that the fund's revenues would fall short of the \n     amount needed to pay valid claims, debt service, and \n     administrative costs.\n\n  If you look at the numbers behind the numbers, I think it is very \nhard to conclude anything other than what my professional staff \nconcluded. The strong likelihood is that this fund is way under water. \nOur conclusion is $150 billion under water. It is entirely possible----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to, when I have finished my sentence. It \nis entirely possible that it is $295 billion under water. I regret to \nconclude it may be more serious than that.\n  With that, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have noted the chart. If you could put \nthe chart back up, please.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Which one?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The last one. The one the Senator from North Dakota is \ntalking about, the one that has the letter going to Senator Arlen \nSpecter. I received that letter. You may be surprised to know that I \nread that letter.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am not surprised at all.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senators receive lots of letters; relatively few are \nread.\n  My question to the Senator from North Dakota is, isn't it true that \nthe two sentences which you left off following the chart you have read:\n\n       There is some likelihood that the fund's revenue would be \n     sufficient to meet those needs.\n\n  Isn't it true that that is the next sentence in the letter?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the next sentence in the letter. It is also true \nthat the CBO analysis is very clear. They have not even attempted to \nput a cost behind a whole series of things that they have told us are \nvery likely to cost money and increase the cost in a way that puts this \nfund over into insolvency.\n  I regret being in this situation. I have no desire to be involved in \nthis debate, but we are here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield for another question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Isn't it true that following the sentence I just read, \nwhich was ``there is some likelihood that the fund's revenues would be \nsufficient to meet those needs,'' the next sentence reads:\n\n       The final outcome cannot be predicted with great certainty.\n\n  Isn't that pretty much standard CBO, where they are making \nprojections, and the thrust of what CBO has said and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has cited is that you don't know ``with great certainty''? \nAnd isn't it true that in any projection of this sort you cannot have \n``great certainty,'' that you don't even have that on proof for the \ndeath penalty in a first-degree murder case where it is only proof \nbeyond a reasonable doubt? Isn't it true that CBO in the letter which \nthey sent to me, dated August 25, made a projection that the cost would \nbe between $120 and $150 billion, and the final line on page 8 was $132 \nbillion which is well within the $140 billion figure?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say to my colleague, the problem with that is, it \ndoesn't include debt service. It doesn't include any additional amount \nfor dormant claims. It doesn't include any additional amount for \nexceptional medical claims. It doesn't include any additional amount \nfor claims of family members. CBO's estimate of the number of future \ncancer cases, we believe, is likely to be far too low. And CBO's \nestimate of the percent of nonmalignant claims that will receive a cash \naward is likely far too low.\n  I will go further in answering my colleague and say, when you reality \ntest all of these things against what has happened in other funds like \nthis, what we see is a consistent pattern, a very consistent pattern, \nthat the initial estimates of how many claims there will be have been \nvastly understated.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator from North Dakota outlines the situation, \nCBO is incompetent, grossly incompetent. When the Senator from North \nDakota shows different conclusions which his staff has reached, why \nwouldn't it be sensible to disband the Congressional Budget Office and \njust rely on his staff?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Because first, I say to my colleagues, those are his \nwords and his conclusions. I have great respect for the Congressional \nBudget Office. I think the Senator knows that is the case.\n  I say this in seriousness. They have been very clear with us. They \nhave said there are areas that are extremely difficult to predict. I \naccept that. It is very difficult to know how many dormant claims will \ncome out of the woodwork. But to suggest there are not going to be any \nis unrealistic. To say that the number of future cancer claims is going \nto be 78,000, when the Tillinghast study that was paid for--not by the \ntrial bar, not by the labor unions, not by any of the companies who are \nagainst this legislation--it was paid for by the Manville trust, they \nsaid they ran 14 different scenarios, and on average there were 133,000 \nnew cancer claims. That one change, if they are right, increases this \nfund from being under water by $150 billion to being under water by \nalmost $300 billion.\n  Finally, CBO's estimate of the percentage of nonmalignant claims--\nagain, this is a hard thing to know--the Tillinghast study suggests \nthat the range will be 10 to 40 percent. The midpoint of that range is \n25 percent. If you think about it, people come in and they go to their \ndoctor and you have a situation in which they might qualify for $25,000 \nor even $100,000. There is going to be a tremendous tendency to push \nthem into those categories. It is human nature.\n  Again, if we reality test and go back to what has happened with these \nother funds, there is a very consistent pattern. Black lung, they said \nit was going to cost $3 billion. It cost $41 billion, 14 times as much.\n  I reluctantly come to the conclusion that this is not only under \nwater by the amount my professional staff came to--they came to the \nconclusion it was $150 billion--I think it is entirely possible, even \nlikely, that it is at least $295 billion under water, and it may be a \nmultiple of that because the history of these things is so clear. When \nyou stack up a bunch of money and you say, come and get it, guess what. \nPeople come and get it. All of a sudden there are all kinds of people \ncoming forward and making a case that they are owed money.\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am somewhat querulous at the \nrepresentation of the reluctance of the Senator from North Dakota to \ntake the position which he has articulated. It is certainly obvious \nthat he wasn't prepared to take the position, certainly obvious that \nthis point of order, which was articulated this afternoon, has taken \nhim by surprise. As I look at his elaborate charts, I think he has been \nanticipating this moment for some time, which doesn't necessarily \nimpugn his comment that this is with reluctance, but it looks to me as \nif it is with calculation.\n  I am not unaware of the obvious facts of life--that colleagues of the \nSenator from North Dakota on the Democratic side of the aisle are not \ntoo fond of this bill. I am not unaware of that. I won't go into the \nreasons behind it, but it happens to be a fact.\n  Senator Conrad is experienced and articulate. He has been chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and ranking member for a long time and a \ndistinguished Senator, after having been elected in 1986. I have served \nwith him in this body for 20 years now. But when he talks about the \nTillinghast study and when he projects what his own staff has done, he \nis undercutting the Congressional Budget Office which puts this $140 \nbillion well within the ballpark. I put these letters in the Record--I \nhave already done that today--where there is the comprehensive analysis \nof the Congressional Budget Office, in a letter to me, dated August 25, \n2005, and a letter dated December 19, 2005. The long and short of the \nCongressional Budget Office analysis is that you are dealing in a range \nof $120 to $150 billion, and the point they struck on is 132, which is \n$8 billion under the 140.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota talks about dormant claims, he \ndoesn't know how many dormant claims there are. Nobody does. You can't \nsit here in the year 2006 and speculate about how many other claims \nthere are that he has articulated. We are not going to vote on this \nissue tonight. There aren't enough Senators in the Chamber to vote \ntonight. We are going to have a battle royal of charts by the time we \nrevisit this issue a few days from now. We are going to have fancier \ncharts than the Senator from North Dakota has. This whole bill may turn \non who has the fanciest charts. We have some pretty good chart makers \nourselves.\n  When the Senator from North Dakota says it will be terrible if, after \ncompanies have paid money into this trust fund, the trust fund becomes \nexhausted and they are asked to pay more money going back to court--\nwell, the companies who committed to pay $140 billion understand that. \nDon't feel sorry for them. They know what they are getting into.\n  The reality is this: As Mr. Thomas Donahue, head of the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, has estimated, they are dealing with a $500 billion issue \nhere, which can be accommodated with $140 billion because you cut out \ntransaction costs, because when claimants only get 42 cents on the \ndollar, $140 billion may be enough, when it may cost as much as $500 \nbillion otherwise. The economy has already suffered to the extent of \n$300 billion. So don't feel sorry for the companies. If the trust is \nterminated because we believe Senator Biden was right when he offered \nhis amendment, which I supported in committee, that the claimant should \nnot bear the risk if the fund was insufficient, that claimants ought to \nhave the right to go back to court, that is the real safety valve if we \nare wrong.\n  But I don't think we are wrong, because we are going to have some \nfancy charts in a few days that will show the decline of asbestos \nclaims. Senator Sessions is usually erudite, but he is especially \nerudite on that subject, as to how the claims have gone down and how \nthe projections show that we will realistically being paying out less, \ncertainly well within $140 billion.\n  I know Senator Ensign and Senator Sessions want to speak, so I will \nreserve some of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It was with great reluctance that I raised this budget \npoint of order. I have a great deal of respect for Senator Specter and \nbelieve there is a great need to enact asbestos legal reform. There are \ncompanies that are shutting down. Many of the current tort claims are \nfraudulent. There are victims who are not getting the compensation they \nneed and deserve.\n  The asbestos crisis is a serious problem that is threatening the \neconomy of the United States. I recognize that. I voted for the Cornyn \nsubstitute because I believed it was a better answer to help the United \nStates, our economy, and the victims. The Hippocratic oath, to first do \nno harm, has been mentioned on this floor before. Unfortunately, this \nChamber has, on many occasions, done more harm than good. There is so \nmuch unpredictability in this bill that my fear is we are considering \ndoing far more harm than the current system.\n  In the December 19 letter written to Senator Specter from the \nCongressional Budget Office, that Senator Specter and Senator Conrad \nwere just talking about, it says:\n\n       There is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues \n     would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims, \n     debt service, and administrative costs. There is also some \n     likelihood that the fund's revenues would be sufficient.\n\n  So there is a significant likelihood that they won't be enough and \nsome likelihood that they will. CBO's final conclusion is that they \ncannot predict the Budget impact of this bill with any degree of \ncertainty. We have all seen the Congressional Budget Office or the \nJoint Tax Committee's work product. It is put together by hard-working \nfolks who do their best to estimate. But I have not seen their \nestimates turn out to be accurate very often. This is because what they \ndo is an incredibly inexact science. What they are trying to estimate \nin this bill is even less precise, less exact of a science than what \nthey normally do. Just a given example with respect to JCT, I had a tax \nprovision about a year and a half ago that had to do with bringing \nmoney from overseas back into this country. The CBO estimated it would \nresult in $125 billion to $140 billion coming back into this country \nfor investment. We thought that estimate was very low. It turns out we \nwere right. To date over $350 billion has been reinvested in the United \nStates, far in excess of the estimate.\n  Now if CBO's estimate is off on this particular legislation to the \ndegree that the estimate was on my legislation, we are in serious \ntrouble. That is why the CBO says, and the Democratic ranking member \nand the Republican Budget Committee chairman say, the point of order is \nvalid and lies on this bill.\n  I think there are problems with this bill. One problem has to do with \nthe medical criteria. It allows all kinds of people to recover without \nany degree of certainty as to how many future claimants there will be. \nThe potential is huge. So despite my strong desire to fix this \nlegislation, I believe that it cannot be fixed. I wish Senator Cornyn's \nsubstitute would have passed. I thought that was the right place to \nstart working on solving the asbestos crisis. This body could have \nworked with that legislation. We could have made sensible changes to \nmove that version forward. I don't think that the underlying piece of \nlegislation can be fixed to provide any certainty. I don't see how we \ncan ensure that the taxpayers do not end up with a huge mess that \nincludes a great deal of debt for future generations.\n  When will the uncertainty occur? Will it be 8, 10, 12, or 15 years \nfrom now? I don't know. When the uncertainty comes, the debt that the \ntaxpayers will be asked to shoulder could be enormous. And this bill \ncould come due at exactly the wrong time. When we can least afford it. \nIt will come due when the baby boomers start affecting Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security. I respect the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee a great deal for the work he has done, and I know he has \ntried to work in a bipartisan fashion and with many industries. They \nsay politics makes strange bedfellows. This legislation proves that to \nbe true. When the positions that we take on this bill or on the point \nof order do not break down by party lines and when liberals and \nconservatives are likewise divided, you know that this bill has strange \ndynamics. Industries that are normally allies are also split on this\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\nbill. Trial lawyers are split on this bill. The reasons for such a \nsplit are a result of the uncertainty about this piece of legislation.\n\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues to allow me to speak for \na few minutes. I look forward to the debate on this point of order. I \nam not sure exactly when we will vote on it, but I hope the point of \norder is sustained.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I serve as a member of the Budget \nCommittee, and I am very pleased that Chairman Gregg put in language \nthat allows for this budget point of order. I think it has a potential \nin many of our entitlement programs to help rein in abusive spending. \nBut this is quite a different matter, I say to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Ensign. He is such a terrific asset to this Senate, \na great member of the Budget Committee, and is rightly engaged in \ntrying to make sure we don't throw away money. I hope I have been an \nally with him in that process.\n  But this is not Government money. This is money put up by the \ndefendants who are paying out every day in judgments and lawsuits all \nover America. They have said: We are tired of having 58 percent of the \nmoney we pay out not get to the victims. Only 42 percent gets to the \nvictims. We ought to create a system to allow victims to get more \nmoney, and we can have a little certainty as to what we pay out. So \nthey agreed to pay into this fund. It is not the Government's money. It \nsimply would be administered by the Department of Labor and, therefore, \napparently the experts say it qualifies for this objection.\n  Let me say what happens if there is a shortage. What happens is the \nfund fails, the FAIR Act ends, and the plaintiffs get to go back to \ncourt, as they are today, and file their lawsuits. And the Government \nis not on the hook for that money, if there is a shortfall, No. 1.\n  Senator Ensign correctly guesstimated that more money would come back \nfrom foreign company profits into the United States with his tax relief \nbill than CBO did. Well, I would say this. I can guesstimate this. At \none point, I represented plaintiffs. I see that the lead plaintiff \nlawyer in the history of this litigation has made an estimate on it and \nhe has concluded there is plenty of money in this trust fund. Why is it \nlikely, in my opinion, that there is enough money? People say there is \nnot enough money here and it is going to fail. Why would I conclude \nthat may not be so, that probably the fund may survive?\n  First, those who are putting money into it think it is enough. They \nwould not subject themselves to this if they didn't think it would \nwork. Second, CBO estimates it, and why would they estimate something \nin this nature? The reason is, somewhere in the 1970s--probably early \n1970s--people became sensitized to the dangers of asbestos. They \nlearned about it and crackdowns were undertaken to limit exposure. By \nthe time 1980 got here, very strict rules were imposed--and that was 26 \nyears ago--on how to handle asbestos, and exposure today is nil \ncompared to what it was in the 1940s and 1950s, when people were \nunknowingly placed in positions where their health was destroyed as a \nresult of massive exposure to asbestos fibers.\n  So it is obvious we have very little asbestos in our society today. \nIf you even see somebody take asbestos out of a building today, they \nhave masks on. All of this stuff is required by OSHA so that not one \nfiber will touch them. I think the likelihood is that we are going to \nsee a continued decline in the asbestos claims and, as a result, I \nthink it is possible--although I am certainly not an expert--that CBO, \nplaintiff lawyer Dicky Scruggs, and others are correct to conclude \nthere is enough money in the fund to make it go.\n  There are a few things we need to do, however. We need to tighten up \nseveral of the medical criteria issues in this legislation so it will \nbe sure to be successful. If we allow people to come into the fund \nbecause at one time or another they were exposed to some asbestos and \nthey may contract some cancer or some other disease, and they can then \nclaim they are, therefore, owed payment from the asbestos fund, we will \nnever have enough money. The criteria we have today are far better than \nexist in the courts of America, but I think there needs to be some \nfurther tightening up, so that people who are sick from asbestos get \npaid and paid generously, but people who contract other diseases are \nnot unjustly enriched by being paid out of a fund that is designated \nfor people who have contracted disabilities and diseases as a result of \nasbestos. That is what is fair and just. That is what the fund should \ndo. I hope we will be successful in reaching that.\n  I say again that I respect this point of order and I respect Senator \nEnsign for raising it. I point out this is indeed technical in the \nsense that the monies in this fund are not Federal Government money, \nand that if the fund runs out of money, the Government doesn't put in \nextra funds. It goes back into the litigation system and the plaintiffs \ncontinue their lawsuits in that fashion. Therefore, I think it would be \nwise under these circumstances to waive the Budget Act.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama for his comments, and I thank him for his extensive work on the \ncommittee, especially on this bill and especially for being on the \nfloor so much this week and making such very strong arguments.\n  Our general counsel said to me in the corridor a few hours ago: Jeff \nSessions has been around all the time. He is doing the work, and he \nused a four-letter word, a blank of a good job. I thank Senator \nSessions for his work.\n  I wish to make a few comments in closing. We probably lost a few \npeople who watch C-SPAN2, in any event. We certainly lost the Senators.\n  When the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, made a comment about \nunpredictability, there is one thing which is not unpredictable, and \nthat is the suffering of the mesothelioma victims and the other victims \nfrom asbestos exposure. We talk a lot about mesothelioma--abbreviated \nto meso but that is a fatal disease which is caused by exposure to \nasbestos, and there are many gradations.\n  When we talk about unpredictability, we also ought to talk about \npredictability, about the tens of thousands of asbestos victims who are \nnot being compensated today because their companies are bankrupt. There \nare tens of thousands of veterans who are not being compensated because \nthey have no one to sue, even though they contracted illnesses from \nasbestos in the service of their country. We know of the 77 companies \nthat have gone bankrupt, and more are on the way. We do know that \npredictability.\n  When the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, talks about estimates which \nare inexact, that is true. You can fault the Congressional Budget \nOffice, but they do the best they can. We do know of the exact \nestimates, exact reality of the people who are suffering.\n  I believe the conclusion is that we have a duty to do something about \nthat. When private companies are willing to put up $140 billion to \ncompensate those victims of asbestos to save future bankruptcies, to \nsave and eliminate and cure pain and suffering, we ought to take that.\n  We are not infallible. If we are wrong and we do not have enough \nmoney, they understand the consequence of going back to court. But I \nthink it all points to the conclusion that we ought to pass this bill. \nWe ought to consider a number of problems that we have in the floor \ndebate and improve this bill. Then when we have come to the end of the \nrainbow on improving this bill as much as we can, we have to make a \njudgment: Is this bill, albeit not perfect, albeit not satisfying \neverybody's interests, better than the current chaotic system?\n  It has to be an enormously terrible bill to be worse than what we \nhave today. That we know with certainty.\n  When you don't meet the Congressional Budget Office test of ``great \ncertainty,'' that is all of life. Again, I analogize the standard for a \ndeath penalty in a criminal first-degree murder case is proof beyond a \nreasonable doubt, and in a civil case is more probable than not. And in \nour legislative judgment, we have done the most we can do in good faith \nto craft legislation\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\nto meet a pressing problem, on which everyone agrees--the Senator who \nis advancing this point of order starts off conceding the terrible \nproblems of asbestos and the pain and suffering to the victims and the \nterrible blight on the economy.\n  We will be debating this some more in the days ahead. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider this issue very carefully because this is an \nissue which will kill the bill if this point of order is not defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad we have finally come to this \nportion of the argument because it reinforces a lot of things that have \nbeen said on this Senate floor over the last several days. It really \ncomes down to a very basic question, the question as to whether this \nbill has been carefully crafted, whether it contains enough money in \nthe trust fund to compensate the hundreds of thousands of asbestos \nvictims who will have to count on it.\n  I have raised this issue repeatedly as to the $140 billion figure. \nThere are reliable estimates of the actual cost over a 50-year period \nof time that almost double the amount of this trust fund, some even \nhigher.\n  Senator Kent Conrad on our side of the aisle is well respected as the \nranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. His background as the \nhead of taxes in his State of North Dakota, his own personal education \nand experience give him extraordinary credibility when it comes to \nissues of cost and issues involving accounting. He has made a \nconvincing case to our caucus and to those who are listening on both \nsides of the aisle that the $140 billion that is part of this trust \nfund is not nearly adequate to the task.\n  Of course, if it isn't, what choices do we have? Senator Specter \nsuggested on the floor the other day that if $140 billion wasn't enough \nto pay the victims, then we will pay the victims less. Today when I \nasked him a similar question, he said there are other options. You can \nsay to these victims, if you have taken away their lawsuit that they \nworked on for a year or two, they have to stop their case in court. \nThen put them into this new trust fund system, and then the trust fund \nsystem fails them at some later date and doesn't pay them all they are \nentitled to, you can say to these victims: You can go back and start \nover in court now.\n\n  That is cold comfort to a family that is doing its best to take care \nof medical bills and lost wages and burial expenses for someone they \nlove.\n  They have made a point over and over that under no circumstances will \nthe Federal Government step in and make up the difference. I guess that \nverbal assurance is good, but we know there is always that possibility \nat some later date if this program doesn't work, if it fails, that \nsomeone will say we can't go back to the companies and ask them to put \nmore money in the trust fund; we can't turn the victims loose; the \nright, compassionate thing to do is for the Federal taxpayers to step \nin.\n  It is not a farfetched argument, and it is one we have to consider as \na possibility.\n  Now a Republican Senator steps forward, Senator Ensign of Nevada, \nraising a valid point of order, a point which goes to the heart of the \nfunding of this bill and how it will pay out any benefits that might \naccrue in the future.\n  I would like to note some of the points that have been made during \nthe course of this debate that I think are worthy of repetition and, \nfor those following the debate for the first time, worthy of note.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has warned us of the significant \nlikelihood that this asbestos trust fund will fail.\n  In a letter to the chairman, who spoke just before me, they wrote:\n\n       The proposed trust fund might or might not have adequate \n     resources to pay all valid claims. There is a significant \n     likelihood that the fund's revenues would fall short of the \n     amount needed to pay valid claims, debt service, and \n     administrative costs.\n\n  So we are saying to hundreds of thousands of victims and their \nfamilies: Trust us, we have created a trust fund, and with that trust \nfund, we will take care of your needs in the future. There is enough \nmoney, the proponents of this legislation say, but the Congressional \nBudget Office, looking at the victims, their injuries, and the \ncompensation promised in this bill, came to a different conclusion. \nThey concluded:\n\n       There is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues \n     would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims. . \n     . .\n\n  As Senator Specter said on the floor the other day, one of the \noptions, then, is to pay the victims less.\n  One of the reasons we need to take a look at this trust fund \nshortfall is when we look at the elements that are behind it, the \nclaims and administrative expenses are likely to exceed contributions \nto the asbestos trust fund. The upfront claims will far exceed \ncontributions.\n  Understand, people who are told they have to leave the courthouse and \ncan no longer pursue a claim in court will have to turn to this trust \nfund. There is no place else to go. They will come in large numbers, \nbut the amount that is being contributed to the fund by businesses is \nnot going to match the demand. At the outset, claims will far exceed \ncontributions, so the trust fund will have to borrow substantial \namounts of money.\n  How much? The trust fund is supposed to be $140 billion. There are \nestimates that the interest and administrative costs may reach $52 \nbillion, more than a third.\n  Small adjustments in amount and timing of assumptions quickly \nbankrupt the trust fund. If you guess wrong how many people are sick \nand how often they will file their claims and in what numbers, the \nestimates of the solvency of the trust fund could fail. It is \nunrealistic to assume that the trust fund will ever terminate.\n  The reasons for likely trust fund shortfalls: The Congressional \nBudget Office didn't count dormant claims that may surface once this \ntrust fund is created, exceptional medical claims, or claims of family \nmembers of workers exposed to asbestos.\n  CBO's estimate of the number of future cancer claims is likely to be \ntoo low, according to consulting firms that have taken a look at their \nformulation.\n  The CBO's estimate of the percent of nonmalignant claims that will \nreceive a cash award is likely to be very conservative.\n  Take a look at this chart. This chart tells the story. The red part \nof the graph is trouble. The red part of the graph reflects the \nliability, the amount that should be paid out that cannot be covered by \nthe revenues coming into the trust fund.\n  So we make a promise to people. We say to them: Give up your claim in \ncourt, come to this trust fund and trust us. Yet when we project the \nneeds of these victims against the revenues coming into the trust fund, \nwe see a dramatic shortfall.\n  The fund stops paying claims in 2009. Claims filed in 2009 and all \nlater years will not be paid. Too many claims, not enough revenue into \nthe fund.\n  Let me indicate what this shortfall can mean. Mr. President, $150 \nbillion--remember, this trust fund is funded at $140 billion--to fall \nshort $150 billion is a substantial miscalculation. In present value \nterms, it means we would have to put $50 billion into the fund today to \ncover the $150 billion shortfall over the 30-year life of collections \nand 50-year life of disbursements under this trust fund. So this is a \nsignificant shortfall.\n  Keep in mind that we are saying to people: You cannot continue to go \nto court to be compensated; you have to turn to a trust fund with a \nhole in the pocket.\n  Let me tell you how badly others have miscalculated the number of \nasbestos cases that can be filed.\n  I remember Johns Manville, a big company, based in Colorado. They \nwere one of the first firms hit because they sold a lot of asbestos \nproducts. When they went bankrupt, they tried to create a separate fund \nto pay off all the victims of Johns Manville products, their workers, \nand others. They set aside money, and in order to set aside a proper \namount they had to speculate and give some calculation about how many \npeople would be making claims for asbestos injuries.\n  The original range of claims went from 50,000 to 200,000. That is \nwhat they said they would ultimately have to cover. The claims received \nthrough the summer of last year were almost 700,000. They had estimated \na high of 200,000. Almost 700,000.\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\n  The recent estimate of the total number that could be paid is 2.1 \nmillion. So how can those who have written this bill say with any \ndegree of reasonable certainty that we know how many people were \nexposed to asbestos at some point in their lives and will later come \nand make a claim? Because for many people, they will live a long time \nwith asbestos fibers in their lungs, ticking timebombs that could go \noff 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years after exposure. There could be anyone on \nthe Senate floor today harboring in their lungs asbestos fibers. Those \nfibers may or may not cause a problem. We just don't know because for \nyears no one paid close attention.\n  Many people were told it is safe. Expose yourself to asbestos, it \ncan't be a problem. Some were misled. Some operated out of ignorance. \nBut the fact remains. Johns Manville, in calculating its liability for \nits own trust fund, blew it. Instead of 200,000, it was 2.1 million.\n  (Mr. COBURN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is not the only case of miscalculation. For coal \nminers, we created a program called black lung. I know it pretty well \nbecause I have met a lot of coal miners suffering from it in my home \nState of Illinois. Exposure to coal dust, inhalation of coal dust \ncauses lung problems, so we tried to set up a separate fund for these \nminers to take care of it. We estimated it was going to cost us about \n$3 billion to compensate all these coal miners. Our actual black lung \npayments through 2004 are $41 billion.\n  So if some of us come to this floor skeptical of this trust fund, \nskeptical of this $140 billion, and wonder if we can say to victims in \ngood conscience, we are going to stop your going into court and force \nyou into a trust fund which will pay you, when we know full well how \nmany times we failed in estimating how much these trust funds need to \nhave banked away, I think that really goes to the heart of this whole \nissue.\n  Also, a critical element here is why we are on this bill today. \nPeople who are following this Senate debate maybe tune in to watch C-\nSPAN, follow the debate in other places, and some will say to them: \nWhat is the Senate talking about today? They may report: Well, it is \nabout asbestos.\n  Sure, it is an important issue. But my guess is most families across \nAmerica would probably step back and say: I sure wish they would talk \nabout the cost of health insurance for families, businesses, and \nindividuals or maybe the cost of this heating bill I have in my hand, \nwhere the cost of heating this home has doubled since last year or \nmaybe they ought to talk once in a while about this Medicare \nprescription Part D Program which has become a mess for seniors across \nAmerica. Why aren't they talking about pension security when our \nneighbors next door worked a lifetime at that plant, and then the plant \nwent into bankruptcy and dumped the pension, and now this man and his \nwife, who thought they had done everything right in life, don't have \nretiree benefits and don't have health benefits? Why aren't they \ntalking about those things?\n  No, the Senate is engaged in a debate on the asbestos bill which I \nhave characterized as a clash of the special interest titans--huge \ncompanies on both sides, for and against asbestos; insurance companies \nfor and against this bill; trial lawyers opposing the bill; others \nsupporting the bill; labor unions by and large opposing the bill with \ntwo or three exceptions. Why are we on this bill today? Because what \ndrives this debate is what is at stake. What is at stake is not just \nrecovery for hundreds of thousands of asbestos victims but a lot of \nmoney.\n  Earlier today, a Republican Senator, Mr. Bennett of Utah, came to the \nChamber with two charts which I thought really told the story. I don't \nhave those charts, but I have summaries here. What Senator Bennett \npointed out is that for about 10 of the largest companies affected by \nthis bill, this bill is a windfall. It is a windfall in this respect: \nThey estimated how much each of these companies would have been \nrequired to pay out to asbestos victims if they went through the \nregular court process, and then they estimated how much the same \ncompanies would pay into the trust fund we are talking about today. And \nthe difference is startling. For these 10 companies, the difference is \n$20 billion. In other words, if they paid the claims of victims in \ncourt, they would have paid $20 billion more than the amount they paid \ninto the trust fund.\n  One of the companies which has been publicized recently is U.S. \nGypsum. The reason people talk about it is they recently did a public \nfiling, and here is what they said. They said: If we are held liable in \ncourt for all the asbestos claims we think could be filed against us, \nwe believe we would pay out something in the range of $4 billion. But \nif this bill passes, we will be required to pay into the trust fund \n$797 million.\n  What a dramatic difference. So for this company, the passage of this \nbill is worth more than $3 billion. That is the reason we are here.\n  We are here because so many of these corporations know that if this \nbill passes, their exposure to liability is reduced dramatically. The \nobvious question is, If they don't pay the $20 billion to victims, who \nwill make up the difference? And that is the point made by Senator \nBennett earlier in the day. He gave the names of eight or nine other \ncompanies, much smaller, some of which have paid small amounts to \nasbestos victims in court cases in settlements, some which have paid \nnone. In each case, these companies had to step up and pay substantial \namounts of money, ranging from $75 million to $578 million.\n\n  So here is one of the largest companies, U.S. Gypsum, with the \nlargest exposure--$4 billion--paying about $800 million into the fund.\n  And then you take a look at a company named Foster Wheeler, a pretty \nwell-known company. They will pay out $80 million in their experience \nin asbestos over the next 10 years. That is their estimate, I should \nsay, $80 million. And they are asked to pay $578 million into the fund? \nWhere is the fairness in that, that these companies with little or no \nexposure have to pay so much money while companies with so much \nexposure pay dramatically less? That is the fundamental unfairness in \nwhat we are discussing in the Senate here this evening.\n  I might also add, many of us are struggling to try to absorb this \nbill because this morning, as we had expected, the chairman filed a new \nversion of the bill. We had been debating this for months, maybe years, \nand this morning comes a new version which, according to the chairman, \nmakes 47 significant changes in the first bill we were handed.\n  Think about that for a moment. When you consider how many lives and \nhow many families are dependent on our doing the right thing in the \npassage of this legislation, we are rushing to pass a trust fund that \nwill take these families and individuals out of the courthouse into a \ntrust fund.\n  The Presiding Officer is a medical doctor from the State of Oklahoma. \nWe may not see eye to eye on a lot of things, but I listened as he \nspeculated on what the exposure might be on this trust fund. He has \nmade some statements as to whether something should be covered or \nshould not be covered. But what he said, at least in the course of the \nJudiciary Committee hearing, is that there is some real uncertainty \nabout how many people will be filing claims and what those claims will \nbe worth.\n  That is what troubles me. I think there is more we can do to make \nthis system more fair. First don't abandon America's court system. \nDon't abandon our system of justice. Don't conclude that 200 years of a \ncourt system in America is not proof positive that it is a valuable \npart of our American heritage and a valuable part of America's life. \nStart with our court system.\n  If there are abuses, and I will concede there are abuses, let's deal \nwith them. I will tell you point blank, based on my legal education of \nlong ago, if you want to recover for injury in court, you must have \ninjuries or damages. Simple exposure to asbestos, which could include \nall of us, is not enough. You have to show some injuries or damages \nbefore you recover. That is why, in our State of Illinois, we set up \nwhat we call the pleural registry, and that says if you have been \nexposed but you are not sick, no symptoms, come in and sign up. If you \ndon't contract an illness or something that is fatal, then you will \nhave escaped any problem related to asbestos. If you do, you can come \nthrough the court system and you will\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\nnot be held back by any statute of limitations.\n  Some have argued about where lawsuits should be brought. That is a \nvalid issue. We should debate it. Some have argued about what \nattorney's fees should be. That is a valid issue. But there have been \nsome misstatements on the floor about attorney's fees, and I wish to \nclarify them. Some have said on the floor that 58 percent of all the \nmoney generated in these asbestos verdicts and settlements goes to \nlawyers. Technically, that is true, but look more closely: 31 percent \nis legal fees claimed by the victims' attorneys; 28 percent or 27 \npercent is from defense attorneys.\n  I practiced law for a number of years, and it was not uncommon for a \nperson of modest means to come in my office and say: I have been \ninjured, I need to file a lawsuit. And you would say to them: I know \nyou can't put up thousands of dollars to pay for all the time I have to \nput in as a lawyer to get ready to go to court, argue the case, do \neverything lawyers do, so I will take it on a contingent fee basis. If \nyou win, I win. If you lose, I lose.\n  For many people, that is the only way they can come to a courtroom. \nThey can't put up $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 to pay for a team of \nlawyers to prepare a case. They just don't have it. So contingent fee \ncases are all across America.\n  If you file a case in Workers' Compensation in Illinois, you may pay, \nI guess--it has been a few years since I have done it--around 20 \npercent in attorney's fees. An ordinary case for personal injury might \nbe a third. That is usually what the lawyer's fees are when it is a \ncontingent fee basis. To say that asbestos victims are paying 31 \npercent in attorney's fees doesn't suggest to me that there is a built-\nin scandal here; it suggests that is fairly ordinary and routine in the \nlegal practice.\n\n  It is interesting to note that for every dollar paid out, the \ndefense--companies that are hiring defense attorneys--is receiving 28 \ncents on the dollar. That is an indication to me, with 30 cents and 28 \ncents, the victims' attorneys and the defense attorneys are comparable \namounts. But having said that, if there is a discussion about how to \nmake those attorney's fees more fair, I am willing to sit down and work \non it.\n  I also believe we ought to look at the States that have already \nstepped forward and said: We are not going to abandon our courts, we \nare not going to abandon our system of justice, we will make changes so \nit works better--States such as Florida, Texas, Ohio. They give us good \nguidance. Senator Cornyn of Texas gave us an amendment--and may come \nback with another version of it soon--which addresses that particular \napproach. I would feel a lot more confident in making certain that our \ncourt system worked a little better than abandoning our court system to \nset up a trust fund that is not paid for.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle will \nseriously consider the point of order raised today by my Republican \ncolleague, Senator Ensign of Nevada. It is a valid point of order. It \ngoes to the issue as to whether $140 billion is adequate, whether the \npayout of this money is consistent with the budget rules of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think the first time I heard the \nfigure 31 to 27 was by Senator Durbin. It didn't surprise me, really. \nThe asbestos defendant companies are hiring some of the best lawyers in \nAmerica, and they charge them big fees. It is part of what they cost. \nIf it is 31 percent for the defendants' attorneys and 27 percent for \nthe plaintiffs' attorneys, I am not really surprised. I had no idea \nprecisely how it would come out, but I am not surprised at that.\n  What I would say to my colleagues here in the Senate, however, is \nthat it is not disputed that 58 percent of the money paid out by the \ndefendants is going to lawyers and not to the victims. It goes to the \nplaintiff, and the plaintiff has to pay almost half of the judgment to \nhis lawyer, so he or she doesn't get to keep all the money. He has to \npay this big lawyer fee. Plus the corporation is being sued and has 31 \npercent of what he is paying out going to his own lawyers. So who is \nwinning here? This is really indisputable. Who is winning here? The \nlegal system is grinding up people and companies in an extraordinary \nway which just has to be ended. We have to work our way through this.\n  It is so great to have a Presiding Officer, a medical doctor, try to \nhelp us deal with some of the medical criteria.\n  There still remains a great weakness in this bill in a number of \nthings.\n  My colleagues present the most contradictory arguments. One time they \nare in here saying we have to have it in the Department of Labor, or we \nhave to pay more and more and more, and then they come in and make the \nargument that these funds traditionally get out of control.\n  When Senator Coburn and Senator Cornyn propose an amendment that \ntightens the medical criteria a little bit, they object and vote \nagainst them.\n  This would be sort of amusing if it wasn't such a serious thing.\n  Some of my colleagues have been saying that the fund is clearly going \nto fail because we underestimate the number of claims. Claims are not \nthe real problem. This bill is going to help with the claims. I don't \nknow how many claims this bill will reduce--not quite as much as the \nCornyn bill did because it was better criteria, in my view; more \nrealistic, according to medical data and science.\n  But under this bill, I would guess that 40 percent to 50 percent of \nthe current claims are not legitimate.\n  It prohibits and bars claims when a person is not sick. The latest \nestimates are that half the claims being filed today are by people who \nare not sick.\n  If you have asbestos exposure and you can see some scarring in a \nperson's lungs, the chance of that person getting sick are enhanced. \nAnd under this legislation they don't get paid right then. But if they \nare monitored medically, and if they become sick, they will get \ncompensation.\n  That is the best way to handle that, for sure.\n  If you get sick, you simply walk in with your doctor and with a \nreport that says what the degree of illness is, another doctor will \nprobably check that, and if it is verified, they will write you a \ncheck. You do not have to give a third, a fourth, or 40 percent to a \nplaintiffs' lawyer, and a defendant corporation isn't having to hire \nlawyers to defend against the lawsuit.\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin, is so eloquent and is a skilled lawyer. \nHe made an argument that I suppose people listening probably took a bit \nof an interest in and wondered about. He declared that the 10 companies \nwith the most exposure would pay substantially less under this trust \nfund than under a court process--$20 billion less.\n  Let me say two things about that.\n  It is not a question of how much they pay out, it is how much gets to \nthe victims, people who are sick. That is the most important question. \nHow do we get more money to people who are sick without having to have \nthe whole business collapse?\n  Second, he did not point out the fact about these tier I companies. \nThese are the companies that are in bankruptcy. They are in bankruptcy \nalready as a result of this litigation. There is only so much a company \ncan carry. If you kill off the company, what do you do then? How can \nanybody be paid?\n  You can't destroy the companies totally and take them out of business \nif you expect them to continue to pay, for 25 years, people who become \nsick.\n  That is why they already have protections in bankruptcy, and they are \npaying through the bankruptcy court less than they would be otherwise. \nTo keep these companies in the game, keep them alive, we give them a \ncertain amount they have to pay depending on how big the companies are. \nAnd some are big and can pay a sizable amount--and they will pay a \nsubstantial amount of money, but they won't be going bankrupt.\n  A lot of people do not understand this. If the company that is \nresponsible for exposing you to asbestos no longer exists, whom do you \nsue? If there are two people who have been exposed to asbestos, both of \nthem have serious lung damage and it reduces their capacity to \nfunction, let us say both of them are entitled to a $200,000 judgment. \nOne of them wants to sue a company that is gone, no longer exists, the \ncompany that is responsible, you would say: Well, they will be able to \nrecover somewhere. No. If the company no longer exists that exposed \nhim, that\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\nperson won't collect $200,000; he won't collect a dime. But the other \none happens to have been exposed by a company that is still in \nexistence and has money, or insurance, they can collect the full \n$200,000.\n  That is happening today.\n  To make it crystal clear, I will ask you about an automobile \naccident. Have you ever heard of people who have been run into, have an \nautomobile accident as a result of a drunk driver who is uninsured and \nsomebody is injured, they say, I am going to sue them and I am going to \nget a $1 million verdict. You know what the lawyer says? Does the \ndefendant have any money? Well, no. Does he have any insurance? No. \nWhat does he have? He has a rental, that is the only car he had, it is \na piece of junk, and it is not worth anything. The lawyer says: If you \nget a $50 million verdict, you will not collect one dime. It is not \nworth the trouble to go to court over.\n  This happens in America. It is the way the law is.\n  But this trust fund says whether the company that exposed them and \ninjured them is in existence or is not, they will be able to recover \ntoo out of a uniform trust fund. And companies that are bankrupt will \nbe able to pay at a level that allows them to stay in business and \ncontinue to pay into the trust fund.\n  Seventy-seven companies are already bankrupt. They say: Well, we are \ngoing to make more companies pay. We are going to make more companies \npay than are supposed to pay--somehow make them pay more than they are \nsupposed to pay. But let me say this to my colleagues or anyone who may \nbe listening. Now there are 8,400 companies being sued, being dragged \nin, and many of them have the most tenuous exposure.\n  I remember very vividly a man coming into my office. He bought a \ncompany that at one time sold asbestos and had not sold asbestos for \nmany years before he bought it. He buys it and makes it a part of his \ncompany. The next thing he knows, all of them are beginning to go at \nthat little company as a defendant which he bought, and he is liable \nfor it. Money is being sucked out of his whole, big company and going \ninto this fund.\n  These companies realize that. They may not be the main target today, \nbut the clever and sophisticated and determined plaintiff lawyers have \ndemonstrated a capacity to add on companies and make them liable more \nthan they were before. Many companies are willingly prepared to pay \ninto this fund so they won't be sued for the rest of their existence; \nso when they go to a stockholders' meeting and write a prospectus which \nshows what their liabilities are, they can say exactly what their \nasbestos liability is rather than being required to list 5,000 asbestos \ncases filed against them.\n\n  Somebody may say: How much is that going to cost? Well, we don't \nknow. Well, could it be $1 million each? Well, we do not know. We don't \nthink so. I may not want to invest in your company. I may not want to \nbuy stock in your company. I have to have some more certainty about how \nmuch you are going to pay.\n  That is one of reasons we are trying to pass this trust fund, so the \ndefendant companies can say to their stockholders and would-be \ninvestors and those who would contract with them what their future \nfinancial prospects are.\n  Isn't that a good public policy thing to try to do?\n  Veterans, if we don't pass this bill, you are not going to be able to \nrecover. Most of them have nobody to sue. You can't sue the Federal \nGovernment for this. A lot of other people already have found that the \npeople they are entitled to sue by law either have no money or no \nlonger exist.\n  I will say this: I think the legislation is headed in the right \ndirection. I believe that Senator Coburn is correct. We need to watch \nthis criteria. If we get that wrong, it can take this bill down. A \ndoctor knows that thousands of Americans every day who are not exposed \nto asbestos get colorectal cancer or get throat cancer or get prostate \ncancer.\n  If somehow anybody who had any exposure to asbestos is not going to \nbe able to come into the fund and demand that the fund pay them for \ncancer which they may have been genetically predisposed to, whether or \nnot they have been exposed to asbestos, we have done something that is \ndangerous and the fund may not be able to survive.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says this fund, as rewritten, will \nsurvive. But I believe it could be tightened up to make it better. I \nbelieve that the fund has a chance to be viable throughout its entire \nlife and fulfill its promise because we have done a better job in \nrecent years in dealing with exposure to asbestos.\n  There has been a sea of change in what has happened. In earlier days, \nthe companies did not warn the people who would be using their product \nabout how dangerous it was. Even after they knew it was dangerous, they \ndidn't warn them. Now everybody is warned. For 30 years, maybe 35 \nyears, there has been exceedingly great care utilized when asbestos is \nabout. You see people with masks on and all of that.\n  I think it is logical to assume that we will continue to see a \ndecline in the claims and also this bill will take out the unjustified \nclaims. Claims of people who have not been given any disability or \nsickness, even though they have been exposed and they get sick, they \nwill be paid. If they don't get sick, they won't be paid.\n  That will reduce a lot of the claims. It will come down to people \nwith legitimate illness. If a person comes in with that most grievous \ndisease, mesothelioma, which is generally a fatal disease, this would \nentitle them to claim $1.1 million dollars, be able to have half of it \npaid in 30 days and the other half in 6 months.\n  Today, they do not know what they will get, and most of the claimants \nare deceased before money is recovered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a woman who has worked \nhard to ensure the safety of southern Nevadans, and indeed all \nAmericans, for more than 24 years. Mrs. Ellen Knowlton recently retired \nfrom her position as Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Las Vegas \nfield office. As Special Agent Knowlton brings an end to her long and \ndistinguished career, I join her family and friends in offering our \ngratitude for her honorable and dedicated service in our community.\n  Ellen joined the FBI in 1982, and went on to serve in Bureau offices \nin California, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Washington, DC. In Washington, \nshe was deputy assistant director of the Bureau's National Security \nDivision Counterintelligence Operations. While in this capacity, Ellen \nsupervised the September 11 terrorist hijacking investigation, for \nwhich our Nation is indebted.\n  In March 2002, Ellen became Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Las \nVegas operations, bringing with her a wealth of knowledge and \nexperience from which Nevada continues to benefit. She refers to this \nappointment as the ``pinnacle'' of her career. However, I feel it is \nNevadans who are truly fortunate for that appointment. Her work in Las \nVegas has left a lasting impact on the State and our communities, \nparticularly the relationships Ellen forged with local law enforcement. \nHer work has set a gold standard of cooperation and goodwill.\n  Special Agent Knowlton's colleagues within the law enforcement \ncommunity often express their admiration for her. This speaks not only \nto her merits as a professional but to her character as an individual \nas well. Ellen has chosen a life of service and deserves all the praise \nand accolades she receives.\n  I am grateful for Ellen's untiring efforts on behalf of our country \nand leadership in our community. I wish her and her family the best as \nthey embark on this new phase of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S969-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PANDEMIC INFLUENZA PREPAREDNESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The input of this panel in November was important to \nthis committee as we worked to provide pandemic flu funding in the \nDecember Defense Appropriations bill.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee has taken a significant first \nstep in addressing this issue. We will continue to work with the \nSecretary of HHS and the White House to provide the funding necessary \nto prepare our country for an influenza pandemic. We realize these \nefforts require Federal and local governments, as well as private \nindustry, working together. I am pleased that these interests are all \nrepresented here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S969-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On June 8, 2005, in Brooklyn, NY, Dwan Prince a gay man, was savagely \nbeaten by three men who screamed anti-gay slurs during the assault. The \nattack took place outside Prince's apartment building in the \nBrownsville section of Brooklyn. Prince was immediately rushed to the \nhospital after the attack where he remained for close to a week.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S969-4", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EDUCATION FOR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in this era defined by rapid globalization \nand the fight against terrorism, an increased focus on international \nstudies and foreign language instruction in our schools is critical to \nmaintaining our country's global leadership position. In order to \nfoster the continued expansion of economic development and democratic \ninstitutions across the globe, we need citizens and workers who are \nknowledgeable of other cultures and languages.\n  This need has become painfully evident in recent years as our Armed \nForces, intelligence agencies, and diplomatic services have struggled \nto find personnel fluent in languages such as Arabic and Farsi and \nknowledgeable of the traditions and customs of the Middle East. At the \nsame time, growing economic opportunities in Asia have put a premium on \nknowledge of languages such as Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean.\n  Fortunately, we are seeing welcomed movement in confronting this \nchallenge. Recently, President Bush launched the National Security \nLanguage Initiative to increase the number of Americans learning \ncritical foreign languages. And today, the Committee for Economic \nDevelopment, CED, a nonpartisan organization of business leaders and \nuniversity presidents, has released a new policy statement, Education \nfor Global Leadership: The Importance of International Studies and \nForeign Language Education for U.S. Economic and National Security. \nThis report provides recommendations for the public and private sectors \nfor strengthening and expanding international studies and foreign \nlanguage instruction across all levels of learning.\n  I welcome these developments and encourage my colleagues to review \nthe CED's recommendations and join in this critical effort to enhance \nour economic and national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S969-5", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S969-S970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PATRIOT ACT DEAL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I understand that some of my friends and \ncolleagues in this body have come to an agreement with the White House \non reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act.\n  While I respect these Senators greatly, I am gravely disappointed in \nthis so-called deal. The White House agreed to only a few minor changes \nto the PATRIOT Act conference report that could not get through the \nSenate back in December. These changes do not address the major \nproblems with the PATRIOT Act that a bipartisan coalition has been \ntrying to fix for the past several years. We have come too far and \nfought too hard to agree to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act without fixing \nthose problems. A few insignificant changes just doesn't cut it. I \ncannot support this deal, and I will do everything I can to stop it.\n  I understand the pressure that my colleagues have been under on this \nissue, and I appreciate all the hard work that they have done on the \nPATRIOT Act. It has been very gratifying to work on a bipartisan basis \non this issue. It is unfortunate that the White House is so obviously \ntrying to make this into a partisan issue, because it sees some \npolitical advantage to doing so. Whether the White House likes it or \nnot, this will continue to be an issue where both Democrats and \nRepublicans have concerns, and we will continue to work together for \nchanges to the law. I am sure of that.\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\n  But I will also continue to strongly oppose any reauthorization of \nthe PATRIOT Act that does not protect the rights and freedoms of law-\nabiding Americans with no connection to terrorism. This deal does not \nmeet that standard; it doesn't even come close.\n  The PATRIOT Act conference report, combined with the few changes \nannounced today, does not address the core issues that our bipartisan \ngroup of Senators have been concerned about for the last several years. \nThe modest but critical changes we have been pushing are not included. \nI am not talking about new issues. We are talking about the same issues \nthat concerned us when we first introduced the SAFE Act more than 2 \nyears ago to fix the PATRIOT Act. And we have laid them out in detail \nin several different letters over the past few months.\n  First, and most importantly, the deal does not ensure that the \ngovernment can only obtain the library, medical and other sensitive \nbusiness records of people who have some link to suspected terrorists. \nThis is the section 215 issue, which has been at the center of this \ndebate over the PATRIOT Act. Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act allows the \ngovernment to obtain secret court orders in domestic intelligence \ninvestigations to get all kinds of business records about people, \nincluding not just library records but also medical records and various \nother types of business records. The Senate bill that this body passed \nby unanimous consent back in July would have ensured that the \ngovernment cannot use this power to go after someone who has no \nconnection whatsoever to a terrorist or spy or their activities. The \nconference report replaces the Senate test with a simple relevance \nstandard, which is not adequate protection against a fishing \nexpedition. And the deal struck today leaves that provision of the \nconference report unchanged.\n  Second, the deal does not provide meaningful judicial review of the \ngag orders placed on recipients of section 215 business records orders \nand National Security Letters. Under the deal, such review can only \ntake place after a year has passed and can only be successful if the \nrecipient proves that that government has acted in bad faith. The deal \nignores the serious first amendment problem with the gag rule under \ncurrent law. In fact, it arguably makes the law worse in this area.\n  And third, the deal does not ensure that when government agents \nsecretly break into the homes of Americans to do a so-called sneak and \npeek search, they tell the owners of those homes in most circumstances \nwithin 7 days, as courts have said they should, and as the Senate bill \ndid.\n  As I understand it, this deal only makes a few small changes. It \nwould permit judicial review of a section 215 gag order, but under \nconditions that would make it very difficult for anyone to obtain \nmeaningful judicial review. It would state specifically that the \ngovernment can serve National Security Letters on libraries if the \nlibrary comes within the current requirements of the NSL statute, a \nprovision that as I read it, just restates current law. And it would \nclarify that people who receive a National Security Letter would not \nhave to tell the FBI if they consult with an attorney. This last change \nis a positive step, but it is only one relatively minor change.\n  So this deal comes nowhere near the significant, but very reasonable, \nchanges in the law that I believe are a necessary part of any \nreauthorization package. We weren't asking for much. We weren't even \nasking for changes that would get us close to the bill that this body \npassed without objection last July. But the White House would not be \nreasonable and has forced a deal that is not satisfactory in an effort \nto serve their partisan purposes. I will oppose it, and I will fight \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S970-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S970-S973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ENEMY COMBATANTS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to put into the Record a letter \nthat Senator Graham and I recently sent to the Attorney General, and to \nrespond to misrepresentations that have been made in the press and by \nothers regarding the circumstances of the enactment of the Graham \namendment to last year's Defense Authorization bill. The letter \nresponds to similar misleading attacks that were made against the \nJustice Department at the beginning of this year. My office has \nreceived several inquiries about this letter, which was sent to the \nAttorney General on January 18. So that anyone interested in this \nmatter might review the letter, I will ask to have it printed in the \nRecord.\n  I ordinarily would not comment on the meaning of legislation that \nalready has been enacted into law. In this case, however, there has \nbeen a considerable amount of post-enactment commentary by others on \nthe meaning of the Graham amendment. Much of this commentary insinuates \nthat the Administration and the backers of the amendment are violating \nan agreement with members of the minority by characterizing the \namendment as governing pending litigation. Since the enactment of the \nGraham amendment last December, some critics have begun to paint a \nrevisionist history of this legislation. In this new account, the \nGraham amendment supposedly was intentionally modified by the Senate so \nas not to affect pending litigation. Also in this version of events, \nSenators relied on representations that the amendment was modified to \ncarve out pending litigation when they voted in favor of its final \npassage. This conspiracy theory is without foundation.\n  For those unfamiliar with the Graham amendment, the disputed \nprovision in the legislation changes the Federal habeas code by adding \na subsection providing as follows: ``Except as provided in section 1005 \nof the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, no court, justice, or judge \nshall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ \nof habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the \nDepartment of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.'' The amendment also \nprovides that ``[t]his section shall take effect on the date of the \nenactment of this Act.'' In addition, the amendment establishes \nsubstantive standards for limited judicial review of CSRT \ndeterminations and military-commission decisions, and provides that the \nparagraphs creating those review standards ``shall apply with respect \nto any claim whose review is governed by one of such paragraphs and \nthat is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.''\n  Some critics now assert that nothing in the amendment prevents pre-\nenactment habeas actions from going forward in their previous form. For \nreasons explained in the letter to the Attorney General, I believe that \nsuch an interpretation is untenable. In addition to the points made in \nthe letter, I would also add the following: the amendment states that \nthe changes that it makes to the habeas code ``shall take effect on the \ndate of the enactment of this Act.'' If the current pack habeas cases \nare allowed to go forward in their current form, the law's provision \nthat ``no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction'' to hear \nthose cases in that form will not be effective on the date of the law's \nenactment. Rather, the courts still would have jurisdiction over these \ncases after the date of enactment, and the law's all-encompassing \njurisdictional bar would become effective only when the current \nlitigation would exhaust itself--a date that likely would come only \nyears in the future. Such a result would not be consistent with the \nrequirement that the law's total jurisdictional prohibition ``take \neffect of the date of the enactment of this Act.''\n  Of those critics who argue that the amendment carves out pre-\nenactment habeas cases, I would simply ask, what part of ``no court, \njustice or judge'' do you not understand? How could this language \npossibly be more comprehensive? And how could any Senator possibly have \nbeen misled as to its effect?\n  Some of the recent criticism of the amendment in the press has taken \na new tack. A few critics have begun to suggest that even if the \nlegislative text of the Graham amendment does wipe out the pending \nhabeas cases, Senators were affirmatively misled about this aspect of \nthe final amendment. The allegation is that Senators were led to \nunderstand that the amendment that they were voting on would not affect \npending cases. I have reviewed the legislative record from the days \nleading up to the vote on final passage of the Graham amendment, and \nfind this suggestion wanting. Allow me to describe what was actually \nsaid about the original version of the amendment--the Graham/Kyl \namendment--as well as the final version, the Graham/Levin/Kyl \namendment, prior to their passage.\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\n  On November 10, Senator Levin stated with regard to the original \nGraham/Kyl amendment, ``I read the language as to how broad it is. It \neliminates explicitly any appeal: No court, justice, or judge shall \nhave jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of \nhabeas corpus, and that is the way an appeal goes to a court from one \nof these people. It is eliminated.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12665.) \nSimilarly, later that day, Senator Bingaman characterized the original \nGraham amendment as follows: ``It essentially denies all courts \nanywhere the right to consider any petition from any prisoner being \nheld at Guantanamo Bay.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12667.) And later, on \nNovember 15, Senator Durbin said the following about the original \nGraham/Kyl amendment: ``the amendment would eliminate habeas for \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay. . . . It would strip Federal courts, \nincluding the U.S. Supreme Court, of the right to hear any challenge to \nany practice at Guantanamo Bay, other than a one-time appeal to the \nD.C. Circuit. . . . It applies retroactively, and therefore also likely \nwould prevent the Supreme Court from ruling on the merits of the Hamdan \ncase, a pending challenge to the legality of the administration's \nmilitary commissions.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12799.)\n  Thus from the beginning, Senators recognized and emphasized to their \ncolleagues that the original Graham amendment language was \ncomprehensive. They also recognized and emphasized that the amendment \nbarred pending cases from going forward, including the Hamdan case in \nthe Supreme Court. These aspects of the original amendment not only \nwere generally acknowledged, but were a point of controversy during the \nSenate debate.\n  Had the subsequent Graham/Levin/Kyl amendment departed from the \noriginal amendment by carving out pending cases, this would have been a \nmomentous change. Aside from the fact that such a change would have \ngutted the amendment, it also would addressed one of the issues about \nwhich opposing Senators had expressed sharp concern. Surely, had such a \nchange been made or even intended to be made, the fact would have been \nnoted. Instead, it is the dog that did not bark.\n\n  First, neither Senator Graham nor I ever said anything in the days \nleading up to the final vote on the amendment that could possibly \nsuggest to anyone that the modified amendment exempted pending cases. \nSenator Graham is the lead sponsor and I am an original cosponsor of \nthe amendment that passed the Senate on November 10. We controlled the \namendment. No one was in a better position than we were to describe \nwhat the amendment does and does not do. Had such a major change to the \namendment been made, it is inconceivable that one of us would not at \nleast have commented on it. No such comment or even the suggestion of \nsuch a change was made by either one of us.\n  Indeed, the few statements that Senator Graham did make prior to \npassage of Graham/Levin/Kyl that describe the amendment's reach tend to \nconfirm that the amendment does not treat detainees differently based \non when they filed their claims. For example, on the evening of \nNovember 14, when the final amendment was introduced, Senator Graham \nnoted that ``[i]nstead of having unlimited habeas corpus opportunities \nunder the Constitution, we give every enemy combatant, all 500, a \nchance to go to Federal court, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12754.) ``What we have done, \nworking with Senators Levin, Kyl, and others, we have created that same \ntype of appeals process for all military commission decisions.'' Ibid.\n  During that same evening, Senator Levin also commented on the new \namendment. Although he said that the amendment did not ``strip \njurisdiction'' from the courts, he made clear that he meant that \njurisdiction remained in place because the pending cases--including \nchallenges to military-commission decisions--could go forward as claims \ninvoking the substantive review standards of the new amendment. Senator \nLevin stated: ``What we have done in this amendment, we have said that \nthe standards in the amendment will be applied in pending cases, but \nthe amendment will not trip the courts of jurisdiction over those \ncases. For instance, the Supreme Court jurisdiction in Hamdan is not \naffected.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12755.) Again, later: ``what our amendment \ndoes, as soon as it is enacted and the enactment is effective, it \nprovides that the standards we set forth in our amendment will be the \nsubstantive standards which we would expect would be applied in all \ncases, including cases which are pending as of the effective date of \nthis amendment.'' Ibid. And again: ``because it would not strip courts \nof jurisdiction over these matters where they have taken jurisdiction, \nit does, again, apply the substantive law and assume that the courts \nwould apply the substantive law if this amendment is agreed to.'' Ibid.\n  Whether the amendment, by barring one type of claim and authorizing \nanother type to take its place, strips the courts of jurisdiction, is, \nto some extent, a matter of perspective. It is a question of whether \nthe glass is half empty or half full. On the operative issue, however, \nSenator Levin's remarks on November 14 are consistent not only with my \nown and Senator Graham's characterization of the amendment (see, e.g. \n151 Cong. Rec. S14263), but also with the interpretation now advanced \nby the Justice Department: that the current claims can go forward, but \nonly as claims for review under the substantive standards created by \nthe new act.\n  It bears mention that the revised amendment's authorization of \njudicial review of military-commission decisions, though narrow and \nvenue-restricted, was a substantial departure from the original \namendment. As Senator Levin had emphasized on November 10, the original \namendment ``eliminates court review of the sentences of enemy \ncombatants before these commissions.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12664.) He \nstated that the amendment even ``eliminates the appeal of a conviction \nthat led to a capital offense.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12665.) Under the \noriginal Graham amendment, no appeal of any kind would have been \npermitted from the military-commission verdict in the Hamdan case.\n  The revised amendment does allow limited appeals of final military-\ncommission decisions. In fact, this change was described to Senators as \nthe principal difference between the original and revised Graham \namendments. Senator Levin noted on the morning of November 15, before \nthe vote on Graham/Levin/Kyl:\n\n       The amendment which was approved last Thursday, which is \n     the one now awaiting this amendment, would have provided for \n     review only for status determinations and not of convictions \n     by military commissions. . . . One of the reasons I voted \n     against the amendment last Thursday is that it did not \n     provide for that direct judicial review of convictions by \n     military commissions. That is the major change in the \n     amendment before the Senate, the so-called Graham-Levin-Kyl \n     amendment which is before the Senate. There are a number of \n     other changes as well, but of all the changes, what this \n     amendment does is add . . . a direct appeal for convictions \n     by military commissions. (151 Cong. Rec. S12754.)\n\n  Other Senators speaking about the amendment prior to the final vote \ndid not even view the detainee's glass as half full. On the morning of \nNovember 15, Senator Specter exhorted his colleagues to oppose the \namendment, stating: ``On the face of the Graham amendment, it .  .  . \neven takes away jurisdiction from the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12799.) He later stated that the amendment \nwould ``strip Federal courts of the authority to consider a habeas \npetition from detainees being held in U.S. custody as enemy \ncombatants,'' (151 Cong. Rec. 12801), and reiterated that the Graham/\nLevin/Kyl amendment was an amendment ``which on the face takes away \njurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States.'' Ibid. Senator \nSpecter's remarks should at least have placed any Senator on inquiry \nnotice that the final amendment might affect pending cases.\n  Finally, Senator Durbin also spoke about the final Graham amendment \nprior to the vote. As I mentioned earlier, on the morning of November \n15, Senator Durbin expressed concern that the original Graham/Kyl \namendment's jurisdictional bar would apply ``retroactively,'' and that \nit ``likely would prevent the Supreme Court from ruling on the merits \nof the Hamdan case.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12799.) Almost immediately after \nthese words, Senator Durbin also commented on the revised Graham \namendment. He stated:\n\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\n\n\n       The Graham-Levin substitute amendment would somewhat \n     improve the underlying amendment by expanding the scope of \n     review in the D.C. Circuit Court to include whether CSRT's \n     are legal, but not whether a particular detainee's detention \n     is legal. It would also allow for post-conviction review of \n     military commission convictions. However, the amendment would \n     still eliminate habeas review and overrule Rasul.\n\n  (151 Cong. Rec. S12799.) Again, no suggestion was made that the new \namendment might carve out pending cases, despite the Senator's \nexpressed concern about retroactivity. The Senator gave no hint that he \nexpected the new amendment to treat pending cases any differently than \ndid the old amendment. Senator Durbin does not appear to have been \nmisled about the effect of the final Graham amendment, nor did he \nmislead anyone else.\n  To be sure, two statements that do appear in the Record prior to the \nfinal vote on the Graham amendment both assert that the amendment would \nnot ``strip jurisdiction''--and both of these statements are unleavened \nby Senator Levin's accompanying clarification that pending cases would \nproceed under the substantive review standards of the new law. Both of \nthese statements, however, appear to have been introduced into the \nrecord following the final vote--both refer to that vote in the past \ntense. Neither Senator thus could have misled other Members about the \neffect of the amendment prior to the vote. Senator Kerry made clear in \nhis statement that his remarks were made only after the November 15 \nvote: ``Today, I voted in favor of Senator Bingaman's amendment No. \n2523, because it would have preserved judicial review . . . When the \nBingaman amendment failed, I voted for a second-degree amendment.'' \n(151 Cong. Rec. S12799.) Similarly, Senator Reid also emphasized that \nhis statement did not precede the actual vote: ``the Senate has voted \nto deny the availability of habeas corpus to individuals held by the \nUnited States at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I rise to explain . . . my votes \nin favor of the Bingaman amendment and the Graham-Levin amendment \nearlier today.'' (151 Cong. Rec. S12802.) Neither of these statements \nwas part of the information that was presented to Senators prior to the \nfinal vote on the Graham amendment.\n  To summarize, the legislative record is utterly devoid of any \nevidence that Senators were led to believe that the Graham/Levin/Kyl \namendment would carve out pending cases. Prior to the vote, several \nSenators spoke of the original amendment's breadth and the fact that it \nwould terminate pending cases. Senator Graham, drawing no distinction \nbetween pre- and post-enactment filers, stated that the revised \namendment would apply a uniform standard to all 500 Guantanamo \ndetainees. Senator Levin made clear that ``the standards we set forth \nin our amendment will be the substantive standards which we would \nexpect would be applied in all cases, including cases which are pending \nas of the effective date of this amendment.'' Senator Specter pointedly \nwarned that the final amendment would ``strip Federal courts of the \nauthority to consider a habeas petition from detainees'' and ``even \ntake[] away jurisdiction from the Supreme Court of the United States.'' \nOther Members who condemned the original amendment for terminating \npending cases gave no hint that they viewed the new amendment any \ndifferently. Quite simply, there is no evidence that anyone misled \nanyone else about the fact that the Graham amendment would only allow \npending cases to go forward under the limited review standards of the \nnew law.\n  On November 15, the Graham/Levin/Kyl amendment passed the Senate by a \nvote of 84-14. That same day, the entire Defense Authorization bill \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent and the Senate appointed \nconferees. One month later, on December 16, the House and Senate \nconferees agreed to file a conference report. In the days that \nfollowed, a new slew of statements were made in the Senate and even in \nthe House commenting on the meaning of the Graham amendment. Many of \nthese statements are simply the usual effort by the losers of \nlegislative battles to rewrite legislative history. The majority of the \nSenators, for example, who announced in these statements that the \nGraham amendment was not intended to affect pending cases also were \namong the 14 Senators who voted against the final Graham/Levin/Kyl \ncompromise. No one can seriously suggest that these members relied on \nany representations made by the backers of the amendment. And more \nimportantly, given the marked disagreement between the statements that \nwere made at this late stage about the effect of the amendment on \npending cases, no one could justifiably have relied upon one view \nrather than another to learn what the amendment does. Rather, it is up \nto members to examine the actual language of the amendment.\n  I hope that this review of the circumstances of the enactment of the \nGraham amendment will put to rest any accusation that members of \nCongress were misled about the amendment's impact on pending cases. \nWhether the amendment does in fact govern pending cases is another \nmatter. For the reasons expressed here and in the January 18 letter to \nthe Attorney General, I believe that it does so, but that, of course, \nis a matter for the courts to decide. In the event that the courts \nconcur with my and Senator Graham's interpretation of the amendment, \nhowever, no Member should be heard to complain that they were led to \nbelieve that the amendment would operate differently.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 2006.\n     Hon. Alberto Gonzales,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Attorney General: We understand that the Justice \n     Department has been criticized recently in the press and by \n     members of Congress for asserting in court proceedings that a \n     provision in the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense appropriations bill \n     that regulates legal actions brought by Guantanamo \n     detainees--the so-called ``Graham Amendment''--affects \n     pending litigation. Critics contend that the Administration's \n     actions violate an agreement with Members of Congress by \n     arguing that the Graham Amendment makes no exception for \n     pending cases.\n       We are the lead sponsor and an original cosponsor of the \n     Graham Amendment. We write to assure you that the attorneys \n     under your supervision have correctly interpreted the \n     disputed provision.\n       The Graham Amendment states in relevant part that \n     ``effect[ive] on the date of enactment of this Act,'' except \n     pursuant to special review procedures specified in the Act, \n     ``no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear \n     or consider'' a habeas application or any other action \n     relating to the detention of a Guantanamo detainee. All \n     Members of the Senate had access to this language before the \n     Senate voted on the final Graham Amendment and the final \n     Defense appropriations bill. The language cannot reasonably \n     be construed to leave intact any power in the courts to \n     entertain the current barrage of habeas petitions and other \n     actions brought by Guantanamo detainees. The Defense \n     appropriations bill was signed into law on December 30, 2005. \n     As of that date, literally ``no court, justice, or judge'' \n     has jurisdiction to entertain these lawsuits. That is what we \n     intended.\n       Had we intended to preserve some power in the courts to \n     continue to hear the current flurry of legal actions, we \n     would have done so. We did not. Moreover, as we made clear \n     when the final defense bill passed the Senate, we are well \n     aware that for over a century, American courts consistently \n     have interpreted legislation removing a court's jurisdiction \n     over a type of case to also remove its ability to hear \n     pending cases. Surely, this long line of precedent negates \n     any ambiguity as to the effect of the Graham Amendment on \n     pending cases.\n       We also note that a contrary interpretation of the \n     Amendment's effect would be inconsistent with the structure \n     of the Amendment. As mentioned above, other sections of the \n     Graham Amendment create special standards and procedures for \n     judicial review of the detention and trial of Guantanamo \n     detainees. The Amendment also states that these special \n     standards and procedures shall apply not only to relevant \n     claims filed after enactment, but also those ``pending on . . \n     . the date of the enactment of this Act.'' (Emphasis added.) \n     Obviously, no claim pending at the time of enactment sought \n     to invoke the review standards created by the same Act. This \n     provision calls on the courts and parties to construe pending \n     actions that challenge either the fact of detention or a \n     military trial as requests for review pursuant to the special \n     standards in the new law. And just as obviously, if all \n     pending lawsuits were exempted from the new law, no pending \n     case would be governed by the new review standards. To adopt \n     the construction advocated by the critics--that courts retain \n     jurisdiction to continue to hear all current lawsuits in \n     their current form--would render the statutory language \n     applying the new standards to pending cases a dead letter.\n       The original Graham-Kyl Amendment stated that its \n     jurisdiction-removing provisions\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\n     ``apply to [actions] pending on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.'' This language later was replaced \n     with language specifying that the Amendment ``shall take \n     effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.'' There were \n     two reasons for this substitution: first, the jurisdiction-\n     removing provision technically does not apply any new \n     standards to the pending cases. Rather, it eliminates the \n     forum in which those cases can be heard. Second, the original \n     language ``applying'' jurisdiction removal to pending cases \n     appeared to require that those cases be dismissed outright. \n     Such a result would have conflicted with subparagraph (h)(2), \n     which is designed to allow current cases to continue in the \n     D.C. Circuit as requests for review pursuant to the new \n     standards. Altering the effective-date language eliminated \n     this internal inconsistency and clarified that, rather than \n     requiring that pending cases be dismissed, the new law allows \n     the courts to construe those cases as requests for review \n     under the new standards and, where necessary, transfer them \n     to the appropriate forum.\n       This is all that we intended by this modification of the \n     Graham Amendment's effective-date language and, more \n     importantly, this is all that the language does. Nothing in \n     this modification preserves any jurisdiction in the courts to \n     continue the current actions in their present form after the \n     date of the enactment of the Act.\n       To the extent that anyone construing the Graham Amendment \n     might be tempted to subordinate actual statutory text to \n     expressions of Senators' private intent, two points are in \n     order: first, we are two of the three cosponsors on the \n     ``Graham-Levin-Kyl Amendment'' that was introduced in the \n     Senate on November 14, and one of us is the lead sponsor. \n     Both of us made clear in the Congressional Record at the time \n     that the final law passed the Senate that we understood, in \n     light of standard rules of statutory construction, that \n     removal of jurisdiction would eliminate pending cases--the \n     same interpretation now espoused by the Justice Department.\n       In addition, on November 14, the other cosponsor of the \n     amendment, Senator Levin, stated that ``[w]hat our Amendment \n     does, as soon as it is enacted and the enactment is \n     effective, it provides that the substantive standards we set \n     forth in our Amendment will be the substantive standards \n     which we would expect would be applied in all cases, \n     including cases which are pending as of the effective date of \n     this Amendment.'' 151 Cong. Rec. 12755. He also stated that \n     day: ``the standards in the Amendment will be applied in \n     pending cases.'' Ibid. The effective-date and pending-claims \n     language in the Amendment introduced on November 14 is \n     identical to that in the enacted statute. Thus, on the day of \n     introduction, all three original cosponsors of the Graham \n     Amendment understood it to operate in the same way: the \n     pending Guantanamo cases can go forward, but only under the \n     special review standards and procedures established by the \n     Amendment.\n       Finally, we should comment on the various other legislative \n     statements purporting to explain the intent behind the Graham \n     Amendment. By our count, at least nine Members of the \n     minority have introduced statements in the Congressional \n     Record announcing that the Graham Amendment was meant to have \n     no effect on pending litigation. For the record, the only one \n     of these Members who played any role in crafting the \n     Amendment is Senator Levin. Negotiations with Senator Levin \n     resulted in a substantial expansion of the scope of the \n     judicial review permitted under the special review procedures \n     established by the Amendment. None of the other Members \n     commenting on the intent behind the Amendment's effective-\n     date subsection played any significant drafting role of which \n     we are aware. Indeed, some of these minority Members who \n     purport to define the authorial intent also complain that the \n     Amendment was ``negotiated largely behind closed doors by the \n     White House and a select few majority Members of Congress'' \n     (151 Cong. Rec. 12201), or that ``all negotiations on this \n     provision have occurred in back rooms, without the \n     involvement of the vast majority of Congress, and without \n     even consulting most of the conferees.'' 151 Cong. Rec. \n     14170. Such complaints are not consistent with the \n     ``insider'' perspective that these Members purport to share \n     with the reader. Several of these Members also are among the \n     14 Senators who even voted against the final Graham-Levin-Kyl \n     Amendment when it was offered in the Senate on November 15. \n     Clearly, it would be inappropriate to allow those who opposed \n     the amendment to define the intent of the authors of the \n     amendment.\n       Of course, more important than any private intent harbored \n     by any Member of Congress is the actual legislative text that \n     was passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by \n     the President. As we noted previously, absent repudiation by \n     the federal courts of over a century of precedent construing \n     like statutes, the Graham Amendment unambiguously eliminates \n     the federal courts' power to hear Guantanamo detainees' cases \n     in their current form. Notwithstanding the accusations made \n     by some critics, your litigators have, in our view, properly \n     interpreted the Graham Amendment. And, at the end of the day, \n     we anticipate that the courts will make these jurisdictional \n     determinations in accord with their own rules, procedures, \n     precedent, and the plain language of the statute.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lindsey O. Graham,\n     U.S. Senator.\n     Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S973-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S973-S974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   GLOBAL NUCLEAR ENERGY PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my agreement with \nPresident Bush's belief that our country's security depends in large \npart on a diverse energy portfolio, one that is not overly reliant on \nany one energy source, especially sources of foreign origin. I agree \nwith the President that this country is overly dependent on foreign \noil. Consistent with that belief, the Bush administration has just \nannounced a potentially far-reaching energy program known as the Global \nNuclear Energy Partnership or GNEP. This program provides a wide-\nreaching, long-term plan for establishing a robust and sustainable \nfuture for nuclear energy in this country and abroad.\n  The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership promises to provide abundant \nenergy, without emitting greenhouse gases; to recycle used nuclear fuel \nin order to minimize waste; to safely and securely allow developing \nnations to deploy nuclear power to meet their energy needs, while \nreducing proliferation risks; to assure maximum energy recovery from \nstill-valuable used nuclear fuel; and to allow the U.S. to rely on a \nsingle geologic waste repository for the rest of this century.\n  Nuclear energy currently provides about 20 percent of this Nation's \nelectricity, and does so without emitting any carbon, greenhouse gases, \nor other air pollutants. All the waste generated by commercial nuclear \npowerplants is securely managed and destined for safe, permanent \ndisposal in a geologic repository.\n  However, according to current law, that repository can contain only \nslightly more than the amount of waste already stored at existing \nreactor sites. Even if the law is changed, the repository at Yucca \nMountain can only accommodate about the amount of spent nuclear fuel \nthat will be generated by the existing reactors in this country over \ntheir lifetimes. If nuclear power is to have a future in this country, \neven to maintain its current 20 percent share of electricity \ngeneration, either a second repository will need to be developed soon--\nwith many more to follow--or an alternative means of managing this \nwaste is needed.\n  After a single use, spent nuclear fuel retains more than 95 percent \nof its energy potential. That energy potential could be tapped by \nreprocessing the spent fuel, recycling the useable part and disposing \nof the rest as waste, which makes up only about 3-4 percent of the \nspent fuel. This could substantially reduce the amount of long-lived \nnuclear waste requiring burial in a geologic repository, and could \nextend the lifetime of the Yucca Mountain repository many fold.\n  But efforts to recycle spent fuel were abandoned in this country back \nin the 1970s, largely because of concerns about nuclear proliferation. \nThose concerns stemmed from the fact that, at that time, the method \nused to recycle spent fuel, the ``PUREX'' process, separated out pure \nplutonium, which might be used to construct a nuclear bomb.\n  During the 30-plus years since then, the U.S. has--through research \nat its National Laboratories--made considerable progress in developing \nnew methods for reprocessing spent fuel that are much less prone to \nproliferation risks, because they do not separate out pure plutonium, \nbut keep it mixed with other actinides. This mixture is not readily \nused for nuclear weapons.\n  Reintroducing recycling into this country's strategy for managing \nspent fuel is a major change in policy, and one that deserves serious \ndiscussion. That discussion should be based on fact and not emotion; \nshould address current technologies, not those from more than a \ngeneration ago; and should consider reasonable alternatives to \nmaintaining nuclear energy as a viable part of our Nation's energy \nsupply.\n  And what reasonable alternatives are there? Total electricity \nconsumption in the U.S. is projected to increase by about 40 percent by \n2025. Wind and solar energy cannot provide large-scale, base-load \nelectricity, because they are intermittent energy sources. Hydro \nprovides about 10 percent of our electricity right now, but building \nnew\n\n[[Page S974]]\n\ndams to fully accommodate the increased demand is not possible. Relying \nsolely on fossil fuels to make up the difference is environmentally \nirresponsible, and with the price of natural gas increasing \ndramatically, less economically appealing. Nuclear energy is the most \nenvironmentally sound technology capable of adequately meeting such \nincreased demand. But even simply maintaining the current share of \nelectricity generation provided by nuclear energy will require \nconstructing many new nuclear powerplants in this country.\n  So should we continue to push for opening Yucca Mountain to begin \naccepting waste as soon as possible? The answer is clearly yes. \nElectric utilities demand confidence that spent fuel will be managed \nresponsibly if they are going to continue to build new nuclearpower \nplants in the U.S.\n  But can we build many more Yucca Mountains to accommodate the \nadditional waste? I think the answer is clearly no.\n  Still, new nuclear powerplants are being planned--and not only in \nthis country, which has not ordered a new nuclear plant in 30 years, \nbut around the world. China, Russia, several European countries, and \nothers are planning--or building--new nuclear powerplants. Somewhere \nbetween 100 and 150 new nuclear plants are likely to be built in the \nnext 20 years or so. In fact, the U.S., despite having pioneered \nnuclear power, risks falling far behind in this home-grown technology.\n  Furthermore, the growth in nuclear power worldwide, while avoiding \nthe potential environmental impact of a similar number of fossil-fuel \npowerplants, raises serious concerns about nuclear proliferation. An \nincreasing number of countries are interested in developing nuclear \npower, and in some cases, developing or acquiring technologies that \ncould lead to their ability to produce nuclear weapons. North Korea and \nIran constantly remind us of the potential danger.\n  Therefore, the U.S. and other responsible nuclear-capable countries \nneed to work together to help developing countries acquire clean, \naffordable energy, but not the means to develop nuclear weapons.\n  And this is another farsighted goal of the Global Nuclear Energy \nPartnership. Through GNEP, this administration proposes to work with \ninternational partners to help developing nations deploy proliferation-\nresistant and emission-free nuclear energy by developing international \nfuel services and small-scale modular reactors.\n  Finally, if this country is to eventually wean itself off its \ndependence on foreign oil and gas, we need to develop a clean-burning \nfuel for transportation. In fact, even if nuclear power replaced all \nthe fossil-fueled powerplants in this country, it would make little \nimpact on our oil use. We would still need to import about 70 percent \nof our oil for transportation.\n  This need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, in addition to \nreducing carbon emissions, was the impetus for President Bush to \npropose his Hydrogen Initiative in the 2001 State of the Union, and he \nhas restated his convictions in all subsequent State of the Union \naddresses.\n  Consistent with President Bush's vision, we must continue our efforts \nto make the transition to a hydrogen-based economy, and we need to \ngenerate that hydrogen by using environmentally responsible \ntechnologies. Nuclear energy provides one such technology with high-\ntemperature reactors such as the Next Generation Nuclear Plant that \nwill be able to produce market-competitive hydrogen.\n  Nuclear power has the potential to provide clean, affordable, and \nemission-free electricity to an increasingly energy-hungry world, and \nthe next generation of nuclear plants will produce fuel for \ntransportation in an increasingly oil-starved world.\n  Access to affordable energy is crucial for improved quality of life \nand overall economic prosperity. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership \npromises to increase energy security, both here in the United States \nand abroad. It will encourage environmentally responsible energy \ndevelopment around the world, and will provide that energy with minimal \nimpact on the environment. I congratulate our President for his vision \nand commitment to helping make all this possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S974-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S974-S975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                           CORETTA SCOTT KING\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, earlier this week, our Nation \nmourned the passing and celebrated the life of one of the civil rights \nera's greatest leaders. Coretta Scott King was the wife of civil rights \nactivist Martin Luther King, Jr., and an incredible leader in her own \nright.\n  Mrs. King's death came just days after the Nation commemorated the \ncontributions her late husband made to our country and only a few \nmonths after the passing of Rosa Parks and Constance Baker Motley, two \npillars of our country's civil rights movement.\n  I spent Martin Luther King Day with my family. As we discussed the \nprogress our great country has made in its quest to be a more inclusive \nAmerica, I was reminded of the personal sacrifices of so many in the \nstruggle for equality and dignity.\n  Coretta Scott King was not troubled by these sacrifices. Years later, \nshe reflected ``I understood when I married Martin that I did not just \nmarry a man. I married a vision. I married a destiny.'' Upon his \nuntimely passing, Mrs. King carried on this vision, sharing his message \nwith other generations and even other continents.\n  Coretta Scott King was exposed to the injustice of segregation at an \nearly age. She grew up poor, in segregated Alabama, where she helped \nsupport her family by working in the cotton fields. She graduated first \nin her high school class, and she and her sister became the first two \nAfrican-American graduates of Antioch college in Ohio. She studied \neducation and music. After graduation she enrolled at the New England \nConservatory of Music. Through the course of her life, she received \nover 60 honorary doctorates from colleges and universities.\n  After her husband's assassination, Mrs. King continued raising her 4 \nchildren while her presence as a civil rights leader was growing. Only \nfour days after his death, she led a march of 50,000 people through the \nstreets of Memphis. The following year, she took her late husband's \nplace in the Poor People's Campaign at the Lincoln Memorial in June of \n1968.\n  But she did not simply represent her late husband. A unique role \nevolved over time for Mrs. King.\n  She made her own contributions through many venues, including more \nthan 30 Freedom Concerts during the 1960s. At these Freedom Concerts, \nMrs. King lectured, read poetry and sang to raise awareness and money \nfor the civil rights movement. In her lifetime she authored three \nbooks, and helped found dozens of organizations including the National \nBlack Coalition for Voter Participation and the Black Leadership \nRoundtable.\n  After the death of her husband, Mrs. King began gathering support for \nthe Martin Luther King, Jr., Center for Nonviolent Social Change in \n1969. She devoted herself tirelessly to the establishment of a national \nholiday to honor her late husband.\n  In 1983, she brought together more that 800 human rights \norganizations to form the Coalition of Conscience.\n  In 1985, Mrs. King and three of her children were arrested at the \nSouth African Embassy in Washington, DC for protesting apartheid. She \nstood with Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg when he became South Africa's \nfirst democratically elected president.\n  In 1987, she helped lead a national Mobilization Against Fear and \nIntimidation in the Forsyth March on Washington.\n  In preparation for the Reagan-Gorbachev talks, in 1988, she served as \nhead of the U.S. delegation of Women for a Meaningful Summit in Athens, \nGreece.\n  In 1993, Mrs. King was invited by President Clinton to witness the \nhistoric handshake between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and \nPalestinian Chairman Yassir Arafat at the signing of the Middle East \nPeace Accords.\n  She further lent her support to democracy movements worldwide and \nserved as a consultant to many world leaders.\n  In the later years of her life she struggled tirelessly fighting for \nwomen's rights and working to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. Mrs. King \nfulfilled\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\none of her life's major goals and Dr. King's birthday is now celebrated \nannually in over 100 nations.\n  I wish to commemorate the incredible message of this woman. Recent \ncelebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's \nlandmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education and the 40th anniversary \nof the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, remind us of just how far \nour country has come.\n  Mrs. King once remarked, ``Struggle is a never ending process. \nFreedom is never really won--you earn it and win it in every \ngeneration.'' Our country has lost a giant who took on the struggle for \nfreedom. If we truly wish to honor her, we must all assume the \nresponsibility to fight injustice and inequality.\n  I thank Mrs. King for her incredible contributions to this country \nand to the world. Her family will continue to be in my thoughts and \nprayers. While she will be deeply missed, her message will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S975-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    HONORING PHILIP A. FRANCIS, JR.\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I want to honor Philip A. \nFrancis, Jr., on his promotion as superintendent of the Blue Ridge \nParkway, and his departure from the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark. Since 1994, Philip A. Francis, Jr., has served as assistant \nsuperintendent of America's busiest national park. For more than 11 \nyears, Phil did an exemplary job of keeping the Smokies on track and \nmoving forward during a very dynamic period of the park's history. Phil \nserved under a succession of three different Smokies superintendents \nand acted as superintendent himself for well over 2 years of his \ntenure. His leadership provided an essential element of stability to \nthe park's operations and to improving its relationships with its many \npartners and surrounding gateway communities.\n  In recognition of his organizational management talents and his \nability to work with numerous and diverse stakeholders, Phil has \nrecently been chosen to become superintendent of the Blue Ridge \nParkway. With over 9 million annual visitors, the Smokies is the most \nvisited national park in the country. But the 470 mile-long Blue Ridge \nParkway, with nearly 19 million travelers a year, is the National Park \nService's busiest management unit.\n  While at the Smokies, Phil provided oversight and continuity to \nNational Park Service managers at all levels as they negotiated through \nthe complexities of making far-reaching decisions regarding the future \nof the immensely controversial Cades Cove and Elkmont Historic \nDistricts in the Tennessee portions of the park. And he has played a \nkey role in striving for a resolution to a 60 year-long debate over a \nproposed new road though the Smokies in North Carolina. Despite the \noften heated debate among the parties to these contentious discussions, \nPhil has gained a reputation for his willingness to listen to the \nconcerns of all sides and to look for solutions that recognize their \nneeds while still protecting the park's natural and cultural resources.\n  Phil has also been an influential proponent for the Smokies in \ncommunities outside the park's boundaries and in working with its ever-\nexpanding circle of support groups. Since their founding in 1993, the \nFriends of the Smokies has raised in excess of $15.5 million in support \nfor improvements at the Smokies. By combining Friends support with \nassistance from the Great Smoky Mountains Association, the park has \nbeen able to broaden its educational programs, undertake the world's \nfirst all species biodiversity inventory, and expand environmental \neducation opportunities. Phil has been a key participant in helping \ndevelop those new programs, and in creating new nonprofit organizations \nto manage them.\n  In 2002, the National Park Service faced a challenge in finding a new \nsuperintendent for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. For those \nwho care about the Smokies, as I do, there was lots of interest in who \nwould be selected. Director Fran Mainella made a great choice when she \nappointed Dale Ditmanson, and we have grown to appreciate Dale's \nabilities and passion over the last few years. One of the reasons for \nDale's strong start is the help he has gotten from Phil, and I look \nforward to working with Dale to preserve and carry on Phil's legacy in \nthe Smokies.\n  I join the park's many neighbors and friends in thanking Phil for his \nhard work and professionalism while at the Smokies. I extend my \ncongratulations and best wishes to Phil on his new assignment at the \nBlue Ridge Parkway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S975-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF DALLAS L.

This \nevent is part of a national initiative by the American Dental \nAssociation to focus attention on the epidemic of untreated oral \ndisease among disadvantaged children. As part of this program, 40,000 \ndental professionals and volunteers provided free educational, \npreventive, and restorative dental services to children from low-income \nfamilies at 2,000 locations across the country. In Mississippi, more \nthan 1,200 children from elementary schools in Jackson, MS, and the \nMississippi Delta visited the dental school and the School of Nursing \nMobile Dental Van for dental services.

AKA is now a 17,000 member \norganization with a broad mission to improve conditions in communities \nthrough volunteer service. AKA has made great strides in helping \nindividuals and communities develop and maintain constructive \nrelationships with others.

During the \n98th National Founders Day Weekend, a historic landmark was dedicated \nin Mound Bayou in the Mississippi Delta to commemorate the success of \nthe Mississippi Health Project and to serve as a reminder of AKA's \ncontinuing commitment to provide health services to families across the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\n  Through collaboration with the National Institutes of Health's \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the \nUniversity of Mississippi Medical Center, AKA hosted a health forum in \nJackson, MS, as part of the 98th National Founders Day Weekend. \nAdditional activities included health fairs in Jackson and the \nMississippi Delta, a special salute to AKA members affected by \nHurricane Katrina, and an African-American Heritage tour.\n  I applaud the accomplishments of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and \nrecognize the 98th National Founders Day Weekend as the first national \nAKA meeting in Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S976-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SISTER DOROTHY STANG\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSister Dorothy Stang, who was brutally murdered nearly a year ago on \nFebruary 12, 2005. Two hired assassins shot and killed her while she \nwas traveling to visit a remote rural settlement near the Trans-Amazon \nHighway. She was 73 years old.\n  In May 2005, I introduced a resolution here in the Senate to honor \nSister Dorothy--known as Dot to family and friends--for devoting her \nlife to the cause of justice for the dispossessed in Brazil. Refusing \nto back down in the face of death threats from those who opposed her \nefforts, she doggedly continued assisting impoverished families and \nworked to protect the rain forest. Her life exemplifies the highest \nideals of reverence for human dignity, compassion for those who lack a \nvoice in their own society, and respect for nature.\n  Born in Dayton, OH, Dot was one of nine children. While she was \ngrowing up, she expressed a wish to one day become a missionary. Her \nsiblings say their sister was always a strong, adventurous woman who \ntruly loved life.\n  After joining the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in 1948 and taking \nher final vows in 1956, Sister Dorothy taught elementary classes at St. \nVictor School in Calumet City and St. Alexander School in Villa Park in \nIllinois and Most Holy Trinity School in Arizona. She began working in \nBrazil in 1966, and in the early 1980s, she moved to a rural area 1,300 \nmiles north of Rio de Janeiro. There, she worked with the Catholic \nChurch's Pastoral Land Commission, an organization that seeks to \neradicate poverty and protect the environment by helping impoverished \nBrazilians to secure land.\n  Sister Dorothy's passionate commitment to this mission was an \ninspiration to many. She was known for riding a motorcycle and camping \noutside the offices of local officials when they refused to meet with \nher. She lived her lifelong passion for teaching by organizing peasant \ngroups and educating hundreds of families about sustainable farming \ntechniques, land tenure issues, and the importance of conservation. Her \nextensive knowledge of Brazilian law, which was entirely self-taught, \nwon her great respect from locals and other activists.\n  While she worked hard, she did not see her endeavors as a sacrifice. \nRather, she professed a love for the region and its people, becoming a \nBrazilian citizen and instructing her family that she would someday \nlike to be buried in the place about which she cared so deeply.\n  Last year, Sister Dorothy testified before a Brazilian congressional \ncommittee on deforestation and did not hesitate to name companies that \nwere engaged in illegal logging. Furthermore, only days before her \ndeath, she met with Brazilian human rights officials to voice her \nconcern about the dangers that she believed some loggers and landowners \nposed to the peasant farmers with whom she lived.\n  Although she received death threats for years, she told those around \nher that the Bible was the only weapon she needed. Sister Dorothy lived \nher commitment to her faith in the bravest of ways, demonstrating \ncourage and determination to the end. Witnesses recall that, when the \ngunmen confronted her, she read to her killers from the Bible before \nshe was murdered.\n  Sister Dorothy was a much beloved figure in the communities where she \nworked. Last year, the Brazilian state where she spent more than two \ndecades of her life named her ``Woman of the Year,'' and the Brazilian \nBar Association honored her with its Humanitarian of the Year award. At \nher funeral, thousands of peasants mourned the loss of a woman whom \nthey knew as both a determined leader and a fun-loving friend.\n  The Brazilian Government sent troops to stabilize the area following \nthe tragedy, and it also has honored Sister Dorothy's legacy by setting \naside disputed lands for a sustainable development program that she \nsupported. In addition, President Lula da Silva denounced the killing \nand restated his government's commitment to defending Brazil's rain \nforests from destruction and environmentally unsound development.\n  Despite these positive signs, many peasants in the areas where Sister \nDorothy worked remain landless; Brazil has one of the world's largest \nwealth gaps. Violence also continues in the region, which is widely \nrecognized as a place where federal Government control is often \ntenuous. During the past two decades, hundreds in the area have died in \nviolent clashes between poor settlers and landowners who resent \ngovernment attempts to resettle landless families and prohibit illegal \nlogging.\n  Sister Dorothy recognized the many daunting obstacles that face \nBrazil's poorest people and, rather than simply hoping for conditions \nto someday improve, happily devoted her life to fighting for what she \nbelieved was right. There is much to be done, but she has set an \noutstanding example of how one person can make a difference in the face \nof hopelessness. It is up to us to keep her memory alive and never \nforget her determination and her commitment to helping those most in \nneed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S976-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S976-S977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE CLIMATE OF TRUST PROGRAM\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Bay Area Council for Jewish Rescue and Renewal's Climate of Trust \nProgram. The council's work in combating ethnic and religious hatred \nwhile strengthening tolerance and moderation in Russian society has \nmade a great difference in the lives of all the program's participants.\n  In 1998, a wave of anti-Semitic activity terrorized the Jewish \npopulation in a provincial town in northwest Russia. In response, the \nBay Area Council established the Climate of Trust Program, a \ncollaborative partnership between American and Russian police officers, \nlocal officials, human rights activists, and ethnic and religious \ncommunity representatives dedicated to resolving conflicts peacefully \nand establishing an atmosphere of tolerance and mutual respect in \nRussia.\n  It is fitting that the pilot program for the Climate of Trust began \nin one of the most diverse cities in the world, my hometown of San \nFrancisco.\n  In 2000, representatives of the San Francisco Police Department, the \nDistrict Attorney's Office, the California Superior Court, and the \nAnti-Defamation League went to Russia to join their counterparts in a \nseminar on religious tolerance. The participants continued the dialogue \nwhen the Russian delegates traveled to San Francisco later that year.\n  In total, seven of these exchanges have now taken place. During these \nmeetings, attendees discuss a wide variety of issues including hate \ncrime laws in the United States, how hate incidents are investigated, \nelements of a hate crime and its impact on the community, diversity in \nthe police department, and community policing.\n  These interactions culminated in the establishment of four permanent \nregional tolerance centers in Russia. These centers design and \nimplement activities that promote tolerance and effective communication \nbetween law enforcement and the community.\n  Organized and run by Russian police officers and community members \nalike, the centers sponsor hate crimes courses for police cadets to \nidentify and handle ethnic or religious violence and produce a \ntolerance textbook for high school students.\n  From its modest beginning in 1998, the Climate of Trust has grown \ninto a far-reaching and effective program. Thousands of Russians, from \nsmall town police officers to federal government officials, have \nattended Climate of Trust seminars and workshops.\n  The success of this program is due in no small part to the hard work \nof the\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nBay Area Council, USAID, and, most importantly, the team of American \nvolunteers and their Russian counterparts who have worked together to \ndevelop new models for promoting tolerance and diversity.\n  We have all witnessed the tragic consequences of ethnic hatred and \nreligious intolerance. It is our solemn obligation to work together to \nensure that tolerance and understanding prevails. I commend and \ncongratulate the Climate of Trust Program of the Bay Area Council for \nJewish Rescue and Renewal for their tireless efforts in these areas, \nand I look forward to working with them again in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S977-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING BETTY FRIEDAN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life \nand legacy of my friend, Betty Friedan. She opened the minds of \nAmericans to the possibility of a new role for women in our country. \nShe provided the spark that has helped make the ambitions of so many \nwomen come true.\n  This spark helped me realize my own dreams. It allowed me to become a \nsocial worker, a Baltimore City councilwoman, a U.S. Congresswoman, and \nnow a U.S. Senator. Betty Friedan's spark inspired women to realize our \nfull potential.\n  Betty Friedan was born Bettye Goldstein in Peoria, IL, in 1921. She \ngraduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942 before accepting a \nfellowship for graduate study in psychology at the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley. She did not finish her fellowship at Berkeley, \nhowever, because a male friend at the time discouraged her from doing \nso. This may have been the beginning of Betty Friedan's awareness of \nthe troubled station women were expected to fill.\n  In 1947, Betty Goldstein married Carl Friedan. The newlyweds moved to \na home in suburban New York and started a family. It was during this \ntime that Ms. Friedan began to consider why she and so many of the \nwomen she knew yearned for more choices on how to live their lives. Her \nbook, the ``Feminine Mystique'', is considered one of the most \ninfluential works of the 20th century. In it, she examined the issues \nof limited choices and limited career prospects for American women. \n``The Feminine Mystique'' changed the face of America.\n  ``The Feminine Mystique'' challenged American society to reevaluate \nthe role of women in our country. The feminism that Betty Friedan \nembraced provided a spark for people like me to speak up and speak out.\n  Ms. Friedan founded the National Organization for Women in 1966, \nwhere she served as the first president, before going on to found NARAL \nin 1969.\n  Two years later, I entered my first race for public office and won a \nseat on the Baltimore City Council. I then joined Betty Friedan, Gloria \nSteinem and many other women in founding the National Women's Political \nCaucus.\n  Betty Friedan paved the way for women when she wrote ``The Feminine \nMystique'' and she devoted the rest of her life to the cause of \nequality, vaulting it to the forefront of the American conscience. Ms. \nFriedan was an unwavering advocate for equality, justice, women, and \npositive change.\n  I honor Betty Friedan for her courage and her creativity--and thank \nher for all that she did for me and for women everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S977-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     KETCHIKAN CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. I rise today to honor a very \nspecial person: Sherrie Slick of Ketchikan, AK, who was recently named \nCitizen of the Year by the Greater Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce during \nits annual banquet on January 14, 2006.\n  This year's award was given based on community service and \nvolunteerism. Before her name was announced, Alaska's Governor \ndescribed volunteers as ``quiet heroes who often are taken for granted \nbecause they're always there and doing their jobs, and doing something \nfor someone else is reward enough for them.'' For those who know \nSherrie, the ``quiet'' part of that description doesn't quite fit--but \nin every other respect, that was an almost perfect description of one \nof the most energetic and active people I know--a woman who could have \nbeen the model for the ``Energizer Bunny.''\n  I have known Sherrie for many years. I have been the recipient of her \nhospitality and now have the pleasure of working with her in her \ncapacity as the community representative for the Alaska congressional \ndelegation. When you need to know what is new, what is hot, and what is \nhappening in town, she is the woman to know.\n  Sherrie is a 32 year resident of Ketchikan with two children who \nattended the local schools. She is now immersed in her role as a \ngrandmother and loving it. Her dedication to family, community, and \ncareer is universally recognized by friends and associates.\n  Sherrie served on the local chamber of commerce's board of directors \nfor 9 years, including a stint as president, and continues to be active \non the chamber's transportation committee. She has spent 8 years on the \nKetchikan Visitors Bureau's board of directors, including a year as its \nchairman, and is a member of the group's marketing committee. She \nserved on the Ketchikan Overall Economic Development Committee for 4 \nyears. She participates each year in the development of Ketchikan's \nlegislative priorities and travels to Juneau as a representative of the \ncommunity to lobby the Alaska legislature for support on local \nprojects.\n  Sherrie put in many hours as the community organized public workshops \nand meetings for the Gravina Access Project. She helped provide \ninformation that was key to advancing the growth and economic \ndevelopment of the Ketchikan Shipyard and remains an active supporter \nof the Ketchikan elements of the southeast Alaska power intertie. She \nhelped facilitate the planning and preparation that helped bring the \nNOAA research vessel Fairweather to Ketchikan. For years, she has gone \nfar beyond the requirements of her job in counseling and providing \ninformation to local fishermen on high seas drift net legislation, the \nPacific Salmon Treaty, and innumerable other issues of concern.\n  Sherrie has played active roles with Ketchikan Theatre Ballet, \nKetchikan Soccer League, Ketchikan Killer Whales Swimming Club, \nCampfire Girls, Boy Scouts, Little League Baseball, and Junior High and \nthe KayHi Drill Teams.\n  Finally, as the Alaska congressional delegation's ``woman on the \nspot,'' she has been instrumental in assisting local governments, \nbusinesses, and individuals to prepare and advocate for Federal \ngovernment actions. She is an outstanding liaison between the \ncongressional delegation and its constituents, with an unparalleled \nunderstanding and knowledge not only of Ketchikan, but also of \nsurrounding communities; and there is no one better at planning the \ndetails so that every visit from a delegation member goes smoothly and \nproductively.\n  Sherrie is wise, energetic, and delightfully entertaining. Ketchikan \ncould have picked no finer person for this honor, and I am very proud \nto know this fine Alaskan. Congratulations, Sherrie Slick, ``Ketchikan \nCitizen of the Year.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S977-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S977-S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MITCH MUSTAIN\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat I rise today to honor an outstanding student athlete from \nSpringdale, AR, Mitch Mustain. As I am sure many of you know, Mitch was \nnamed the 2005 Gatorade National High School Football Player of the \nYear and the Player of the Year on Parade Magazine's 43rd annual All-\nAmerica High School Football Team. He received these awards not only \nfor his outstanding leadership and athletic skill but also for his \nacademic achievements and overall character.\n  During the 2005 season, senior quarterback Mitch Mustain led \nSpringdale High School to a No. 2 national ranking and the State Class \n5A title. He completed 190 passes for 3,817 yards and 47 touchdowns. He \nalso rushed for seven scores and was sacked only twice. In the school's \n54 to 20 state final win, Mitch connected on 17 passes for 5 \ntouchdowns.\n  I also take this opportunity to say how proud and excited I am that \nMitch Mustain has signed with my alma mater, the University of \nArkansas. I foresee great things ahead for the Razorbacks.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in ``Calling the \nHogs'' in\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\nrecognition of this future Razorback's outstanding accomplishments. We \nall look forward to following Mitch's career and anticipate that he \nwill make lasting contributions to his team and to the University of \nArkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S978-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COLLECTION OF HEARTS CAMPAIGN\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of the Keystone Soldiers organization based in Fleetwood, PA. \nThis all-volunteer organization provides continued support for our \nservice members currently deployed overseas through letters, emails, \nphone calls, and care packages. Keystone Soldiers has most recently \npartnered with Boscov's department stores in an effort to collect \nvalentines for deployed service members. The Collection of Hearts \ncampaign is just a small part of their effort to remind our deployed \ntroops that they have our continued support. I appreciate the \npatriotism of this organization in supporting our troops as they \ncontinue to serve our Nation.\n  Our brave service men and women are sacrificing so much for us; they \nare in harm's way each day, missing valuable time with their loved \nones. Showing support by sending care packages, letters, and emails is \na very small way to show our appreciation for their sacrifice.\n  I appreciate the selfless efforts of charitable organizations, such \nas Keystone Soldiers, for reminding our troops that they are \nappreciated. I encourage all Americans to show their support for our \ntroops by lending your support to organizations such as these.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S978-2", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:11 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 4297) to \nprovide for reconciliation pursuant to section 201(b) of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006, and asks a conference \nwith the Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon; and \nappoints the following members as the managers of the conference on the \npart of the House: Mr. Thomas, Mr. McCrery, Mr. Camp, Mr. Rangel, and \nMr. Stark.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4456.

A bill to provide greater accountability of taxpayers' \ndollars by curtailing congressional earmarking, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last Congress I introduced a rules change \nproposal to allow points of order to be raised against unauthorized \nappropriations and policy riders in appropriations bills and conference \nreports in an effort to reign in wasteful pork barrel spending. Today I \nam introducing a modified version of that proposal. I am pleased to be \njoined in this bipartisan effort today by Senators Feingold, Coburn, \nBayh, Sununu, Graham, Ensign, DeMint, and Kyl.\n  According to data compiled by the Congressional Research Service, in \n1994, there were 4,126 Congressional earmarks added to the annual \nappropriations bills. In 2005, there were 15,877 earmarks, the largest \nnumber yet, that's an increase of nearly 300 percent! The level of \nfunding associated with those earmarks has more than doubled from $23.2 \nbillion in fiscal year 1994 to $47.4 billion in fiscal year 2005.\n  Our bill, entitled the Pork-Barrel Reduction Act, would establish a \nnew procedure under Rule XVI, modeled in part after the Byrd Rule, \nwhich would allow a 60-vote point of order to be raised against \nspecific provisions that contain unauthorized appropriations, including \nearmarks, as well as unauthorized policy changes in appropriations \nbills and conference reports. Of importance is that successful points \nof order would not kill a conference report, but the targeted \nprovisions would be deemed removed from the conference report, and the \nmeasure would be sent back for concurrence by the House.\n  To ensure that Members are given enough time to review appropriations \nbills, our proposal would also require that conference reports be \navailable at least 48 hours prior to floor consideration. It also \nprohibits the consideration of a conference report if it includes \nmatter outside the scope of conference.\n  Additionally, our bill includes the provisions of S. 1495, the \nObligation of Funds Transparency Act, which Senator Corburn and I \nintroduced last July, to prohibit Federal agencies from obligating \nfunds for appropriations earmarks included only in congressional \nreports, which are unamendable.\n  To promote transparency, our bill requires that any earmarks included \nin a bill be disclosed fully in the bill's accompanying report, along \nwith the name of the Member who requested the earmark and its essential \ngovernmental purpose. Additionally, our bill would require recipients \nof Federal dollars to disclose any amounts that the recipient expends \non registered lobbyists.\n  In summary, this proposed rules change, if adopted, would allow any \nmember to raise a point of order in an effort to extract objectionable \nunauthorized provisions from the appropriations process. Our goal is to \nreform the current system by empowering all members with a tool to rid \nappropriations bills of unauthorized funds, pork barrel projects, and \nlegislative policy riders and to provide greater public disclosure of \nthe legislative process.\n  I would like to highlight just a few examples of recent earmarks, \nmany of which clearly do not belong in the measures that they were \nincluded:\n  From the Defense Conference Report for FY 2006: $500,000 to teach \nscience to grade-school students in Pennsylvania. $900,000 for \n``Memorial Day'' out of the Army Operations and Maintenance account. \n$4.4 million for a Technology Center in Missouri. $1 million to a Civil \nWar Center in Richmond, Virginia. $850,000 for an education center and \npublic park in Des Moines, Iowa. $2 million for a public park in San \nFrancisco. $500,000 for the Arctic Winter Games, an international \nathletic competition held this year in Alaska. $1.5 million for an \naviation museum in Seattle, $1.35 million for an aviation museum in \nHawaii, $1 million for a museum in Pennsylvania, and $3 million for the \nmuseum at Fort Belvoir. There's also $1.5 million for restoring the \nBattleship Texas. Funding for farm conservation. A provision protecting \njobs in Hawaii and Alaska. A provision transferring as a direct lump \nsum payment to the University of Alaska the unobligated and unexpended \nbalances appropriated to the United States-Canada Railroad Commission. \nAnd, of course, the ANWR provisions.\n  From the FY06 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill Conference Report \nStatement of Managers: $500,000 for the Burpee Museum of Natural \nHistory in Illinois. $500,000 for Chesapeake Bay submerged aquatic \nvegetation research. $600,000 to study fish passage in Mud Mountain, \nWashington. $3 million to study the beneficial uses of dredged material \nfor Morehead City, North Carolina. $1.25 million for the Sacred Falls \ndemonstration project in Hawaii. $2 million for the Desert Research \nInstitute, Nevada. $3.5 million for the Iroquois Bio-Energy Consortium \nEthanol Project, Indiana. $500,000 for the Washington State Ferries \nBiodiesel Demonstration Project, WA. $1 million for the Canola-based \nAutomotive Oil R, PA. $1 million for the Mt. Wachusett Community \nCollege Wind Project, MA. $7 million for the Arctic Energy Office, \nAlaska.\n  These Energy and Water projects that I just mentioned are just a few \nexamples of report language earmarks, none of which are subject to an \namendment to strike.\n  From the FY 2002 and 2003 Defense Appropriations Conference Reports: \nDuring conference negotiations on the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, unprecedented language was \ninserted into the final bill to allow the U.S. Air Force to lease 100 \nBoeing 767 commercial aircraft and convert them to tankers. The total \ncost to taxpayers, about $30 billion.\n  However, Congress did not authorize these provisions in the Act, or \nin any other bill for that matter. In fact, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee was not even advised of this effort by the Air Force \nSecretary during consideration of the authorization measure. Moreover, \nthese aircraft were not in the President's budget, the joint chiefs' \nunfunded priority list, or the pentagon's long range defense budget. \nAdditionally, the purportedly compelling need for these aircraft (which \nthe air force repeatedly cited for having taxpayers pay $6 billion more \nfor leasing these tankers than they would if the air force simply \nbought them outright) was, and continues to be, wholly unsupported by \nany serious study or analysis of alternatives.\n  Nonetheless, legislative language was again included in the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003 to modify \nthe previous year's bill language on the Boeing 767 tankers. And, once \nagain, the sweeping changes in procurement policy was made by the \nAppropriators without the input of the authorizing committee.\n  Ultimately, it was discovered that the Air Force broke a number of \nFederal budgetary and leasing rules; that the lease terms were fiscally \nirresponsible; that this deal would have set a horrible precedent for \nthe procurement of major defense systems; and that folks at the Air \nForce conspired with Boeing to break the law to make this deal happen \nin the first instance. Mr. President, with some people, as a result, \nnot only losing their jobs, but also serving time in jail, I think all \nof my colleagues know what an egregious mistake this turned out to be.\n  From Supplemental for War on Terror Conference Report (April 2005): A \nprovision directing the Secretary of the Interior to analyze the \nviability of a sanctuary for the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow in Rio \nGrande Valley, TX.\n  A provision stating that the $40 million set forth in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 for construction of a Port of \nPhiladelphia marine cargo terminal ``be used solely for the \nconstruction by and for a Philadelphia-based company.''\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\n  From the FY 2003 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report: The \nconference report contained provisions which allow a subsidiary of the \nMalaysian-owned ``Norwegian Cruise Lines'' the exclusive right to \noperate several large foreign-built cruise vessels in the domestic \ncruise trade. This provides an unfair competitive advantage to a \nforeign company at the expense of all other cruise ship operators, and \ncreates a de facto monopoly for Norwegian Cruise Lines in the Hawaii \ncruise trade. Interestingly, this provision stems from another earmark \nin 1998 that went awry.\n  The fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense Appropriation Bill granted \na legal monopoly for American Classic Voyages to operate as the only \nU.S. flagged operator among the Hawaiian islands. After receiving the \nmonopoly, American Classic Voyages secured a $1.1 billion loan \nguarantee from the U.S. Maritime Administration's, MARAD, Title XI loan \nguarantee program for the construction of two passenger vessels known \nas Project America. Project America's subsequent failure 4 years later \nresulted in the U.S. Maritime Administration paying out over $187.3 \nmillion of the American taxpayers' money to cover the project's loan \ndefault, and recovering only $2 million from the sale of some of the \nconstruction materials and parts. It is one hull and miscellaneous \nparts from these never-completed ships which cost the taxpayers nearly \n$200 million which are now going to be used in a foreign shipyard for \nbuilding the Norwegian Cruise ships that will operate in Hawaii under \nthis latest special interest provision.\n  The conference report included an agriculture policy change to make \ncatfish producers eligible for payments under the livestock \ncompensation program, even though hog, poultry, and horse producers are \nnot eligible.\n  Despite the fact that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had \nimplemented new organic food standards after lengthy negotiations, \nlanguage was added to the conference report to permit livestock \nproducers to certify and label meat products as ``organic'' even if the \nanimals had not been fed organic grain. Without any consideration or \ndebate, this last-minute rider was added to override these standards. \nInterestingly, a few months later, the Congress approved legislation as \npart of the War supplemental to repeal this provision and restore the \nprior organic food labeling standards.\n  Obviously, I could go on and on and on citing examples of \nunauthorized earmarks and policy riders in appropriations bills. But I \nthink you've got the picture. And I hope that we have finally reached \nthe point that we are going to do something to reform this very broken \nsystem of legislating.\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \nconcerns require that now, more than ever, we prioritize our Federal \nspending. But our appropriations bills do not always put our national \npriorities first. The process is broken and it needs to be fixed.\n  In his farewell address, President Dwight D. Eisenhower reflected on \nthe spending he believed to be excessive. His words then are all the \nmore powerful in today's out of control environment: ``As we peer into \nsociety's future,'' he said, ``we--you and I, and our government--must \navoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease \nand convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage \nthe material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also \nof their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive \nfor all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of \ntomorrow.''\n  And yet, if we cannot change, if we will not change, we risk \nprecisely that--becoming the insolvent phantom of tomorrow. I wonder \nwhat President Eisenhower would think of this mess. But, then, perhaps \nothers have contemplated the same question. After all, the Defense \nAppropriations bill we passed in December included a $1.7 million \nearmark for a memorial on the National Mall that would honor none other \nthan * * * Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 2268. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to deny Federal \nretirement benefits to individuals convicted of certain offenses, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, along with Senator Salazar, I am \nintroducing the Congressional Pension Accountability Act, to deny \nFederal pensions to members of Congress who are convicted of white \ncollar crimes such as bribery.\n  I strongly believe that Members of Congress must be held to the \nhighest ethical standards. This year, the Senate is expected to \nconsider legislation to reform our ethics laws. This is in response to \na series of scandals that have exposed Washington lobbyists and \nunfortunately even a Member of Congress who used undue and improper \ninfluence to represent special interests in their dealings with the \nFederal Government.\n  Last year, the now infamous Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded \nguilty to conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion charges in a plea \nagreement. The Justice Department is currently investigating his \nattempts to influence Federal Government policy in both Congress and \nthe Executive Branch.\n  In the largest bribery case in the Congress since the 1980s, \nRepresentative Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham recently resigned from the \nHouse of Representatives after pleading guilty in Federal court to \nreceiving $2.4 million in bribes from military contractors and evading \nmore than $1 million in taxes. In a plea agreement, former \nRepresentative Cunningham admitted to a pattern of bribery lasting \nclose to five years, with Federal contractors giving him Persian rugs, \na Rolls-Royce, antique furniture, paying travel and hotel expenses, use \nof a yacht and a lavish graduation party for his daughter.\n  As elected representatives, we must hold ourselves and all those who \nrepresent the Federal Government to the highest ethical standards. The \nprinciple is a simple one: public servants who abuse the public trust \nand are convicted of ethics crimes should not collect taxpayer financed \npensions.\n  Under current law, former Representative Cunningham and others \nconvicted of serious ethics abuses will receive a Congressional pension \nof approximately $40,000 per year--paid for by American taxpayers. Only \na conviction for a crime against the United States, such as treason or \nespionage, will cost a Member of Congress their pension. This law must \nbe changed to ensure that Congress does not reward unethical behavior.\n  The Congressional Pension Accountability Act will bar Members of \nCongress from receiving taxpayer-funded retirement benefits after they \nhave been convicted of bribery or other serious ethics offenses.\n  Together we can significantly improve our government by changing the \nway business is done in Washington. I believe this legislation will \nhelp ensure that our government once again responds to the needs of our \npeople, not special interests.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida):\n  S. 2269.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable credit against income tax to subsidize the cost of COBRA \ncontinuation coverage for certain individuals; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nHealth Care COBRA OffSet Tax Savings (COSTS) Act of 2006. This \nimportant legislation is a step forward in helping working families \nafford quality health care in this country.\n  Rewarding work is one of the most fundamental core values of our \nNation. Our founding fathers built a society on the notion that if you \nwork hard, you will have an opportunity to provide a better future for \nyour children and thus build a stronger, more competitive nation. And, \nas we've seen throughout our Nation's history, America's workers have \nnot disappointed.\n  Unfortunately, too many Americans are working hard every day, but are \nstill unable to make ends meet and provide even the most basic needs \nfor their family, such as food, shelter, or health care. The \nlegislation I'm introducing will help address one of these important \nchallenges: affordable, quality health care for working families.\n  The statistics are undeniable--almost 46 million Americans have no \nhealth insurance and more than 1 million of the uninsured are in my \nhome state of New Jersey. But that's just the beginning of the problem. \nEven families who are fortunate enough to have health insurance, are \nstruggling to pay the premiums, which in New Jersey, have increased at \nfour times the rate of earnings. Since 2000, the employee share of \nhealth care premiums in New Jersey increased almost 43 percent or \nalmost $400 a year. When family earnings increase by only 10 percent \nover the same period, it becomes clear just how challenging it is for \nour hard working families to get by.\n  The Health Care COSTS Act does not address the entire problem, but it \nwill help some workers afford to keep their health insurance when \nthey're between jobs. Currently, many workers who receive health \ncoverage through their employer are entitled to keep that coverage for \nup to 18 months after they leave their jobs. This coverage is known as \nCOBRA coverage. However, many don't take advantage of COBRA coverage \nbecause it's simply too expensive. The employee, who has just lost \ntheir job, has to pay the full cost of the coverage, making it \nprohibitively expensive for most families.\n  The Health Care COSTS Act helps moderate-income families with the \ncost of COBRA by providing an ``advanceable'' tax credit for half the \ncost of these health care premiums. The tax credit would go directly to \nthe health plan administrator, thus reducing the workers' monthly \npremiums by half. This is not a handout, but a helping hand for workers \nwho have contributed to the economic well-being of their community and \nhave earned the opportunity to care for their family while they get \nback on their feet and find another job.\n  Clearly, there is much more to do in addressing the health care \ncrisis in this country, but this is an important first step in helping \nworking families afford health care coverage during one of the most \ndifficult and vulnerable times a family might face. I hope this \nlegislation will be a starting point for discussion of the significant \nchallenges families face in affording quality health care in this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S982-1", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2745.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Millions of Americans have been exposed to forms of \n     asbestos that can have devastating health effects.\n       (2) Various injuries can be caused by exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos, including pleural disease and some forms \n     of cancer.\n       (3) The injuries caused by asbestos can have latency \n     periods of up to 40 years, and even limited exposure to some \n     forms of asbestos may result in injury in some cases.\n       (4) Asbestos litigation has had a significant detrimental \n     effect on the country's economy, driving companies into \n     bankruptcy, diverting resources from those who are truly \n     sick, and endangering jobs and pensions.\n       (5) The scope of the asbestos litigation crisis cuts across \n     every State and virtually every industry.\n       (6) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \n     Congress must act to create a more rational asbestos claims \n     system. In 1991, a Judicial Conference Ad Hoc Committee on \n     Asbestos Litigation, appointed by Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, found that the ''ultimate solution should be \n     legislation recognizing the national proportions of the \n     problem . . . and creating a national asbestos dispute \n     resolution scheme . . .``. The Court found in 1997 in Amchem \n     Products Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 595 (1997), that \n     ''[t]he argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating \n     victims of asbestos exposure.`` In 1999, the Court in Ortiz \n     v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 819, 821 (1999), found that the \n     ''elephantine mass of asbestos cases . . . defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation. \n     ``That finding was again recognized in 2003 by the Court in \n     Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Ayers, 123 S. Ct. 1210 \n     (2003).\n       (7) This crisis, and its significant effect on the health \n     and welfare of the people of the United States, on interstate \n     and foreign commerce, and on the bankruptcy system, compels \n     Congress to exercise its power to regulate interstate \n     commerce and create this legislative solution in the form of \n     a national asbestos injury claims resolution program to \n     supersede all existing methods to compensate those injured by \n     asbestos, except as specified in this Act.\n       (8) This crisis has also imposed a deleterious burden upon \n     the United States bankruptcy courts, which have assumed a \n     heavy burden of administering complicated and protracted \n     bankruptcies with limited personnel.\n       (9) This crisis has devastated many communities across the \n     country, but hardest hit has been Libby, Montana, where \n     tremolite asbestos, 1 of the most deadly forms of asbestos, \n     was contained in the vermiculite ore mined from the area and \n     despite ongoing cleanup by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, many still suffer from the deadly dust.\n       (10) The asbestos found in Libby, Montana, tremolite \n     asbestos, has demonstrated an unusually high level of \n     toxicity, as compared to chrysotile asbestos. Diseases \n     contracted from this tremolite asbestos are unique and highly \n     progressive. These diseases typically manifest in a \n     characteristic pleural disease pattern, and often result in \n     severe impairment or death without radiographic interstitial \n     disease or typical chrysotile markers of radiographic \n     severity. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and \n     Disease Registry previous studies by the National Institutes \n     of Occupational Safety and Health document significantly \n     increased rates of pulmonary abnormalities and disease \n     (asbestosis and lung cancer) among former workers.\n       (11) Environmental Protection Agency supported studies have \n     determined that the raw vermiculite ore mined and milled in \n     Libby, Montana contained 21 to 26 percent asbestos, by \n     weight. The milled ore, resulting from the processing in \n     Libby, which was shipped out of Libby contained markedly \n     reduced percentages of asbestos. A 1982 Environmental\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\n     Protection Agency-supported sutdy concluded that oreshipped \n     out of Libby contained 0.3 to 7 percent asbestos, by weight.\n       (12) In Libby, Montana, exposure pathways are and were not \n     limited to the workplace, rather, for decades there has been \n     an unprecedented 24 hour per day contamination of the \n     community's homes, playgrounds, gardens, and community air, \n     such that the entire community of Libby, Montana, has been \n     designated a Superfund site and is listed on the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List.\n       (13) These multiple exposure pathways have caused severe \n     asbestos disease and death not only in former workers at the \n     mine and milling facilities, but also in the workers' spouses \n     and children, and in community members who had no direct \n     contact with the mine. According to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, some potentially important alternative \n     pathways for past asbestos exposure include elevated \n     concentrations of asbestos in ambient air and recreational \n     exposures from children playing in piles of vermiculite. \n     Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency has \n     determined that current potential pathways of exposure \n     include vermiculite placed in walls and attics as thermal \n     insulation, vermiculite or ore used as road bed material, ore \n     used as ornamental landscaping, and vermiculite or \n     concentrated ore used as a soil and garden amendment or \n     aggregate in driveways.\n       (14) The Environmental Protection Agency also concluded, \n     ``Asbestos contamination exists in a number of potential \n     source materials at multiple locations in and around the \n     residential and commercial area of Libby. . . While data are \n     not yet sufficient to perform reliable human-health risk \n     evaluations for all sources and all types of disturbance, it \n     is apparent that releases of fiber concentrations higher than \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may \n     occur in some cases . . . and that screening-level estimates \n     of lifetime excess cancer risk can exceed the upper-bound \n     risk range of 1E-04 usually used by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency for residents under a variety of exposure \n     scenarios. The occurrence of non-occupational asbestos-\n     related disease that has been observed among Libby residents \n     is extremely unusual, and has not been associated with \n     asbestos mines elsewhere, suggesting either very high and \n     prolonged environmental exposures and/or increased toxicity \n     of this form of amphibole asbestos.''.\n       (15) According to a November 2003 article from the Journal \n     Environmental Health Perspectives titled, Radiographic \n     Abnormalities and Exposure to Asbestos-Contaminated \n     Vermiculite in the Community of Libby, Montana, USA, Libby \n     residents who have evidence of ``no apparent exposure'', \n     i.e., did not work with asbestos, were not a family member of \n     a former worker, etc., had a greater rate of pleural \n     abnormalities (6.7 percent) than did those in control groups \n     or general populations found in other studies from other \n     states (which ranged from 0.2 percent to 4.6 percent). \n     ``Given the ubiquitous nature of vermiculite contamination in \n     Libby, along with historical evidence of elevated asbestos \n     concentrations in the air, it would be difficult to find \n     participants who could be characterized as unexposed.''.\n       (16) Nothing in this Act is intended to increase the \n     Federal deficit or impose any burden on the taxpayer. The \n     Office of Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     this Act shall be privately funded by annual payments from \n     defendant participants that have been subject to asbestos \n     liability and their insurers. Section 406(b) of this Act \n     expressly provides that nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to create any obligation of funding from the United \n     States or to require the United States to satisfy any claims \n     if the amounts in the Fund are inadequate.

If \n     the amount of the amended settlement offer made by the \n     Administrator, claims facility, or participants equals 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund, \n     the claimant shall accept such settlement in writing.\n       (xii) Payment schedule.--\n\n       (I) Mesothelioma claimants.--For mesothelioma claimants--\n\n       (aa) an initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     30 days after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 6 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the participant, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent in 6 months and 50 \n     percent 11 months after the date the settlement offer is \n     accepted.\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\n       (II) Other terminal claimants.--For other terminal \n     claimants, as defined under section 106(c)(2)(B) and (C)--\n\n       (aa) the initial payment of 50 percent shall be made within \n     6 months after the date the settlement is accepted and the \n     second and final payment shall be made 12 months after date \n     the settlement is accepted; or\n       (bb) if the Administrator determines that the payment \n     schedule would impose a severe financial hardship on the \n     Fund, or if the court determines that the settlement offer \n     would impose a severe financial hardship on the participants, \n     the payments may be extended 50 percent within 1 year after \n     the date the settlement offer is accepted and 50 percent in 2 \n     years after date the settlement offer is accepted.\n\n       (III) Release.--Once a claimant has received final payment \n     of the accepted settlement offer, and penalty payment if \n     applicable, the claimant shall release any outstanding \n     asbestos claims.\n\n       (xiii) Recovery of costs.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Any participant whose settlement offer is \n     accepted may recover the cost of such settlement by deducting \n     from the participant's next and subsequent contributions to \n     the Fund the full amount of the payment made by such \n     participant to the terminal health claimant, unless the \n     Administrator finds, on the basis of clear and convincing \n     evidence, that the participant's offer is not in good faith. \n     Any such payment shall be considered a payment to the Fund \n     for purposes of section 404(e)(1) and in response to the \n     payment obligations imposed on participants in title II.\n       (II) Reimbursement.--Notwithstanding subclause (I), if the \n     deductions from the participant's next and subsequent \n     contributions to the Fund do not fully recover the cost of \n     such payments on or before its third annual contribution to \n     the Fund, the Fund shall reimburse such participant for such \n     remaining cost not later than 6 months after the date of the \n     third scheduled Fund contribution.\n\n       (xiv) Failure to make offer.--If participants fail to make \n     a settlement offer within the 30-day period described under \n     clause (ix) or make amended offers within the 10 business day \n     cure period described under clause (xi), the claimant shall \n     be entitled to recover 150 percent of what the claimant would \n     receive under the Fund before the stay being lifted under \n     subparagraph (B).\n       (xv) Failure to pay.--If a participant fails to pay an \n     accepted settlement offer within the payment schedule under \n     clause (xii), the claimant shall be entitled to recover 150 \n     percent of what the claimant would receive under the Fund \n     before the stay being lifted under subparagraph (B). If the \n     stay is lifted under subparagraph (B) the claimant may seek a \n     judgment or order for monetary damages from the court where \n     the case is currently pending or the appropriate Federal or \n     State court for claims arising after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (B) Stay terminated and reversion to court.--If 9 months \n     after a terminal health claim has been filed under \n     subparagraph (A), a claimant has not received a settlement \n     under subparagraph (A)(xii) and the Administrator has not \n     certified to Congress that the Fund or claims facility is \n     operational and paying terminal health claims at a reasonable \n     rate, the stay of claim provided under paragraph (1) shall be \n     lifted and such terminal health claimant, may immediately \n     seek a judgment or order for monetary damages from the court \n     where the case is currently pending or the appropriate \n     Federal or State court for claims arising after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.

If the court determines that \n     another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a \n     claim, the court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise \n     applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning \n     on the date the claim was filed and ending on the date the \n     claim is dismissed under this subparagraph.\n       (D) State venue requirements.--Nothing in this paragraph \n     shall preempt or supersede any State law relating to venue \n     requirements within that State which are more restrictive.\n       (E) Credit of claim and effect of operational or \n     nonoperational fund.--\n       (i) Credit of claim.--If an asbestos claim is pursued in \n     Federal or State court in accordance with this paragraph, any \n     recovery by the claimant shall be a collateral source \n     compensation for purposes of section 134.\n       (ii) Operational certification.--Operational certification \n     shall be a filing in the Federal Register confirming that the \n     Fund is capable of operating and paying all valid asbestos \n     claims at a reasonable rate.\n       (iii) Operational preconditions.--\n\n       (I) The Administrator may not issue a operational \n     certification until--\n\n       (aa) 60 days after the funding allocation information \n     required under section 221(e) has been published in the \n     Federal Register; and\n       (bb) insurers subject to section 212(a)(3) submit their \n     names and information to the Administrator within 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act and 60 days after the \n     Administrator publishes such information in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (iv) Operational fund.--If the Administrator issues an \n     operational certification and notifies Congress that the Fund \n     has become operational and paying all valid asbestos claims \n     at a reasonable rate, any non-terminal asbestos claim in a \n     civil action in Federal or State court that is not on trial \n     before a jury which has been impaneled and presentation of \n     evidence has commenced, but before its deliberation, or \n     before a judge and is at the presentation of evidence shall \n     be deemed a reinstated claim against the Fund and the civil \n     action before the Federal or State court shall be null and \n     void.\n       (v) Nonoperational fund.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, if the Administrator subsequently \n     issues a nonoperational certification and notifies Congress \n     that the Fund is unable to become operational and pay all \n     valid asbestos claims at a reasonable rate, all asbestos \n     claims have been stayed or not filed may be filed or \n     reinstated in the appropriate Federal or State court.\n       (4) Reservation of rights.--Except as otherwise provided in \n     this Act, participation in the offer and settlement process \n     under this subsection shall not affect or prejudice any \n     rights or defenses a party might have in any litigation.\n\n     SEC. 107.

GENERAL RULE CONCERNING NO-FAULT COMPENSATION.\n\n       An asbestos claimant shall not be required to demonstrate \n     that the asbestos-related injury for which the claim is being \n     made resulted from the negligence or other fault of any other \n     person.\n\n     SEC. 113. FILING OF CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Who May Submit.--\n       (1) In general.--Any individual who has suffered from a \n     disease or condition that is believed to meet the \n     requirements established under subtitle C (or the personal \n     representative of the individual, if the individual is \n     deceased or incompetent) may file a claim with the Office for \n     an award with respect to such injury.\n       (2) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``personal \n     representative'' shall have the same meaning as that term is \n     defined in section 104.4 of title 28 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations, as in effect on December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Limitation.--A claim may not be filed by any person \n     seeking contribution or indemnity.\n       (4) Effect of multiple injuries.--\n       (A) In general.--A claimant who receives an award for an \n     eligible disease or condition\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\n     shall not be precluded from submitting claims for and \n     receiving additional awards under this title for any higher \n     disease level for which the claimant becomes eligible, \n     subject to appropriate setoffs as provided under section 134.\n       (B) Libby, montana claims.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a \n     Libby, Montana claimant worsens in condition, as measured by \n     pulmonary function tests, such that a claimant qualifies for \n     a higher nonmalignant level, the claimant shall be eligible \n     for an additional award, at the appropriate level, offset by \n     any award previously paid under this Act, such that a \n     claimant would qualify for Level IV if the claimant satisfies \n     section 121(f)(8), and would qualify for Level V if the \n     claimant provides--\n\n       (I) a diagnosis of bilateral asbestos related nonmalignant \n     disease;\n       (II) evidence of TLC or FVC less than 60 percent; and\n       (III) supporting medical documentation establishing \n     asbestos exposure as a substantial contributing factor in \n     causing the pulmonary condition in question, and excluding \n     more likely causes of that pulmonary condition.\n\n       (ii) Subsequent malignant disease.--If a Libby, Montana, \n     claimant develops malignant disease, such that the claimant \n     qualifies for Level VI, VII, VIII, or IX, subparagraph (A) \n     shall apply.\n       (b) Statute of Limitations.--\n       (1) In general.--If a claim is not filed with the Office \n     within the limitations period specified in this subsection \n     for that category of claim, such claim shall be extinguished, \n     and any recovery thereon shall be prohibited.\n       (2) Initial claims.--An initial claim for an award under \n     this Act shall be filed within 5 years after the date on \n     which the claimant first received a medical diagnosis and \n     medical test results sufficient to satisfy the criteria for \n     the disease level for which the claimant is seeking \n     compensation.\n       (3) Claims for additional awards.--\n       (A) Non-malignant diseases.--If a claimant has previously \n     filed a timely initial claim for compensation for any non-\n     malignant disease level, there shall be no limitations period \n     applicable to the filing of claims by the claimant for \n     additional awards for higher disease levels based on the \n     progression of the non-malignant disease.\n       (B) Malignant diseases.--Regardless of whether the claimant \n     has previously filed a claim for compensation for any other \n     disease level, a claim for compensation for a malignant \n     disease level shall be filed within 5 years after the \n     claimant first obtained a medical diagnosis and medical test \n     results sufficient to satisfy the criteria for the malignant \n     disease level for which the claimant is seeking compensation.\n       (4) Effect on pending claims.--\n       (A) In general.--If, on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     an asbestos claimant has any timely filed asbestos claim that \n     is preempted under section 403(e), such claimant shall file a \n     claim under this section within 5 years after such date of \n     enactment, or any claim relating to that injury, and any \n     other asbestos claim related to that injury shall be \n     extinguished, and recovery on any such claim shall be \n     prohibited.\n       (B) Special rule.--For purposes of this paragraph, a claim \n     shall not be treated as pending with a trust established \n     under title 11, United States Code, solely because a claimant \n     whose claim was previously compensated by the trust has or \n     alleges--\n       (i) a non-contingent right to the payment of future \n     installments of a fixed award; or\n       (ii) a contingent right to recover some additional amount \n     from the trust on the occurrence of a future event, such as \n     the reevaluation of the trust's funding adequacy or projected \n     claims experience.\n       (c) Required Information.--A claim filed under subsection \n     (a) shall be in such form, and contain such information in \n     such detail, as the Administrator shall by regulation \n     prescribe.

ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND CLAIM AWARDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Review of claims.--The Administrator shall, in \n     accordance with this section, determine whether each claim \n     filed under the Fund or claims facility satisfies the \n     requirements for eligibility for an award under this Act and, \n     if so, the value of the award. In making such determinations, \n     the Administrator shall consider the claim presented by the \n     claimant, the factual and medical evidence submitted by the \n     claimant in support of the claim, the medical determinations \n     of any Physicians Panel to which a claim is referred under \n     section 121, and the results of such investigation as the \n     Administrator may deem necessary to determine whether the \n     claim satisfies the criteria for eligibility established by \n     this Act.\n       (2) Additional evidence.--The Administrator may request the \n     submission of medical evidence in addition to the minimum \n     requirements of section 113(c) if necessary or appropriate to \n     make a determination of eligibility for an award, in which \n     case the cost of obtaining such additional information or \n     testing shall be borne by the Office.\n       (b) Proposed Decisions.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     filing of a claim, the Administrator shall provide to the \n     claimant (and the claimant's representative) a proposed \n     decision accepting or rejecting the claim in whole or in part \n     and specifying the amount of the proposed award, if any. The \n     proposed decision shall be in writing, shall contain findings \n     of fact and conclusions of law, and shall contain an \n     explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the \n     proposed decision.\n       (c) Payments if No Timely Proposed Decision.--If the \n     Administrator has received a complete claim and, after the \n     Fund has been certified subject to section 106(f)(3)(E) has \n     not provided a proposed decision to the claimant under \n     subsection (b) within 180 days after the filing of the claim, \n     the claim shall be deemed accepted and the claimant shall be \n     entitled to payment under section 133(a)(2). If the \n     Administrator subsequently rejects the claim the claimant \n     shall receive no further payments under section 133. If the \n     Administrator subsequently rejects the claim in part, the \n     Administrator shall adjust future payments due the claimant \n     under section 133 accordingly. In no event may the \n     Administrator recover amounts properly paid under this \n     section from a claimant.\n       (d) Review of Proposed Decisions.--\n       (1) Right to hearing.--\n       (A) In general.--Any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator under subsection (b) shall be \n     entitled, on written request made within 90 days after the \n     date of the issuance of the decision, to a hearing on the \n     claim of that claimant before a representative of the \n     Administrator. At the hearing, the claimant shall be entitled \n     to present oral evidence and written testimony in further \n     support of that claim.\n       (B) Conduct of hearing.--When practicable, the hearing will \n     be set at a time and place convenient for the claimant. In \n     conducting the hearing, the representative of the \n     Administrator shall not be bound by common law or statutory \n     rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, \n     or by section 554 of title 5, United States Code, except as \n     provided by this Act, but shall conduct the hearing in such \n     manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For \n     this purpose, the representative shall receive such relevant \n     evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as \n     the representative determines necessary or useful in \n     evaluating the claim.\n       (C) Request for subpoenas.--\n       (i) In general.--A claimant may request a subpoena but the \n     decision to grant or deny such a request is within the \n     discretion of the representative of the Administrator. The \n     representative may issue subpoenas for the attendance and \n     testimony of witnesses, and for the production of books, \n     records, correspondence, papers, or other relevant documents. \n     Subpoenas are issued for documents only if such documents are \n     relevant and cannot be obtained by other means, and for \n     witnesses only where oral testimony is the best way to \n     ascertain the facts.\n       (ii) Request.--A claimant may request a subpoena only as \n     part of the hearing process. To request a subpoena, the \n     requester shall--\n\n       (I) submit the request in writing and send it to the \n     representative as early as possible, but no later than 30 \n     days after the date of the original hearing request; and\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n       (II) explain why the testimony or evidence is directly \n     relevant to the issues at hand, and a subpoena is the best \n     method or opportunity to obtain such evidence because there \n     are no other means by which the documents or testimony could \n     have been obtained.\n\n       (iii) Fees and mileage.--Any person required by such \n     subpoena to attend as a witness shall be allowed and paid the \n     same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district \n     courts of the United States. Such fees and mileage shall be \n     paid from the Fund.\n       (2) Review of written record.--In lieu of a hearing under \n     paragraph (1), any claimant not satisfied with a proposed \n     decision of the Administrator shall have the option, on \n     written request made within 90 days after the date of the \n     issuance of the decision, of obtaining a review of the \n     written record by a representative of the Administrator. If \n     such review is requested, the claimant shall be afforded an \n     opportunity to submit any written evidence or argument which \n     the claimant believes relevant.\n       (e) Final Decisions.--\n       (1) In general.--If the period of time for requesting \n     review of the proposed decision expires and no request has \n     been filed, or if the claimant waives any objections to the \n     proposed decision, the Administrator shall issue a final \n     decision.

Until 5 years after the Administrator certifies that \n     the Fund is paying claims at a reasonable rate, the \n     industries, occupations and time periods identified by the \n     Administrator shall at a minimum include those identified in \n     the 2002 Trust Distribution Process of the Manville Personal \n     Injury Settlement Trust as of January 1, 2005, as industries, \n     occupations, including proximity, and time periods in which \n     workers were presumed to have had significant occupational \n     exposure to asbestos. Thereafter, the Administrator may by \n     rule modify or eliminate those exposure presumptions required \n     to be adopted from the Manville Personal Injury Settlement \n     Trust, if there is evidence that demonstrates that the \n     typical exposure for workers in such industries and \n     occupations during such time periods did not constitute \n     substantial occupational exposure in asbestos.\n       (B) Claimants entitled to presumptions.--Any claimant who \n     demonstrates through meaningful and credible evidence that \n     such claimant was employed during relevant time periods in \n     industries and occupations identified under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be entitled to a presumption that the claimant had \n     substantial occupational exposure to\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\n     asbestos during those time periods. That presumption shall \n     not be conclusive, and the Administrator may find that the \n     claimant does not have substantial occupational exposure if \n     other information demonstrates that the claimant did not in \n     fact have substantial occupational exposure during any part \n     of the relevant time periods.\n       (C) Criteria requirements.--Nothing in subparagraphs (A) or \n     (B) shall negate the exposure or medical criteria \n     requirements in section 121, for the purpose of receiving \n     compensation from the Fund.\n       (6) Penalty for false statement.--Any false information \n     submitted under this subsection shall be subject to section \n     1348 of title 18, United States Code (as added by this Act).\n       (d) Asbestos Disease Levels.--\n       (1) Nonmalignant level i.--To receive Level I compensation, \n     a claimant shall provide--\n       (A) a diagnosis of bilateral asbestos-related nonmalignant \n     disease;

ASSESSMENT ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each defendant participant or affiliated \n     group shall pay to the Fund in the amounts provided under \n     this subtitle as appropriate for its tier and subtier each \n     year until the earlier to occur of the following:\n       (1) The participant or affiliated group has satisfied its \n     obligations under this subtitle during the 30 annual payment \n     cycles of the operation of the Fund.\n       (2) The amount received by the Fund from defendant \n     participants, excluding any\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\n     amounts rebated to defendant participants under subsections \n     (d) and (m), equals the maximum aggregate payment obligation \n     of section 202(a)(2).\n       (b) Small Business Exemption.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this subtitle, a person or affiliated group that \n     is a small business concern (as defined under section 3 of \n     the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)), on December 31, \n     2002, is exempt from any payment requirement under this \n     subtitle and shall not be included in the subtier allocations \n     under section 203.\n       (c) Procedures.--The Administrator shall prescribe \n     procedures on how amounts payable under this subtitle are to \n     be paid, including, to the extent the Administrator \n     determines appropriate, procedures relating to payment in \n     installments.\n       (d) Adjustments.--\n       (1) In general.--Under expedited procedures established by \n     the Administrator, a defendant participant may seek \n     adjustment of the amount of its payment obligation based on \n     severe financial hardship or demonstrated inequity. The \n     Administrator may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, in accordance with this \n     subsection. A defendant participant has a right to obtain a \n     rehearing of the Administrator's determination under this \n     subsection under the procedures prescribed in subsection \n     (i)(10). The Administrator may adjust a defendant \n     participant's payment obligations under this subsection, \n     either by forgiving the relevant portion of the otherwise \n     applicable payment obligation or by providing relevant \n     rebates from the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment \n     account created under subsection (j) after payment of the \n     otherwise applicable payment obligation, at the discretion of \n     the Administrator.\n       (2) Financial hardship adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment based on financial hardship at any time during the \n     period in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains \n     outstanding and may qualify for such adjustment by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation would constitute a severe financial \n     hardship.\n       (B) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), a financial hardship \n     adjustment under this subsection shall have a term of 3 \n     years.\n       (C) Renewal.--After an initial hardship adjustment is \n     granted under this paragraph, a defendant participant may \n     renew its hardship adjustment by demonstrating that it \n     remains justified.\n       (D) Reinstatement.--Following the expiration of the \n     hardship adjustment period provided for under this section \n     and during the funding period prescribed under subsection \n     (a), the Administrator shall annually determine whether there \n     has been a material change in the financial condition of the \n     defendant participant such that the Administrator may, \n     consistent with the policies and legislative intent \n     underlying this Act, reinstate under terms and conditions \n     established by the Administrator any part or all of the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation under the \n     statutory allocation that was not paid during the hardship \n     adjustment term.\n       (3) Inequity adjustments.--\n       (A) In general.--A defendant participant--\n       (i) may qualify for an adjustment based on inequity by \n     demonstrating that the amount of its payment obligation under \n     the statutory allocation is exceptionally inequitable--\n\n       (I) when measured against the amount of the likely cost to \n     the defendant participant net of insurance of its future \n     liability in the tort system in the absence of the Fund;\n       (II) when measured against the likely cost of past and \n     potential future claims in the absence of this Act;\n       (III) when compared to the median payment rate for all \n     defendant participants in the same tier; or\n       (IV) when measured against the percentage of the prior \n     asbestos expenditures of the defendant that were incurred \n     with respect to claims that neither resulted in an adverse \n     judgment against the defendant, nor were the subject of a \n     settlement that required a payment to a plaintiff by or on \n     behalf of that defendant;\n\n       (ii) shall qualify for a two-tier main tier and a two-tier \n     subtier adjustment reducing the defendant participant's \n     payment obligation based on inequity by demonstrating that \n     not less than 95 percent of such person's prior asbestos \n     expenditures arose from claims related to the manufacture and \n     sale of railroad locomotives and related products, so long as \n     such person's manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives \n     and related products is temporally and causally remote, and \n     for purposes of this clause, a person's manufacture and sale \n     of railroad locomotives and related products shall be deemed \n     to be temporally and causally remote if the asbestos claims \n     historically and generally filed against such person relate \n     to the manufacture and sale of railroad locomotives and \n     related products by an entity dissolved more than 25 years \n     before the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (iii) shall be granted a two-tier adjustment reducing the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation based on inequity \n     by demonstrating that not less than 95 percent of such \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures arose from asbestos \n     claims based on successor liability arising from a merger to \n     which the participant or its predecessor was a party that \n     occurred at least 30 years before the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and that such prior asbestos expenditures exceed \n     the inflation-adjusted value of the assets of the company \n     from which such liability was derived in such merger, and \n     upon such demonstration the Administrator shall grant such \n     adjustment for the life of the Fund and amounts paid by such \n     defendant participant prior to such adjustment in excess of \n     its adjusted payment obligation under this clause shall be \n     credited against next succeeding required payment \n     obligations; and\n       (iv) may, subject to the discretion of the Administrator, \n     be exempt from any payment obligation if such defendant \n     participant establishes with the Administrator that--\n\n       (I) such participant has satisfied all past claims; and\n       (II) there is no reasonable likelihood in the absence of \n     this Act of any future claims with costs for which the \n     defendant participant might be responsible.\n\n       (B) Payment rate.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     payment rate of a defendant participant is the payment amount \n     of the defendant participant as a percentage of such \n     defendant participant's gross revenues for the year ending \n     December 31, 2002.\n       (C) Term.--Subject to the annual availability of funds in \n     the defendant hardship and inequity adjustment account \n     established under subsection (j), an inequity adjustment \n     under this subsection shall have a term of 3 years.\n       (D) Renewal.--A defendant participant may renew an inequity \n     adjustment every 3 years by demonstrating that the adjustment \n     remains justified.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--\n       (i) In general.--Following the termination of an inequity \n     adjustment under subparagraph (A), and during the funding \n     period prescribed under subsection (a), the Administrator \n     shall annually determine whether there has been a material \n     change in conditions which would support a finding that the \n     amount of the defendant participant's payment under the \n     statutory allocation was not inequitable. Based on this \n     determination, the Administrator may, consistent with the \n     policies and legislative intent underlying this Act, \n     reinstate any or all of the payment obligations of the \n     defendant participant as if the inequity adjustment had not \n     been granted for that 3-year period.\n       (ii) Terms and conditions.--In the event of a reinstatement \n     under clause (i), the Administrator may require the defendant \n     participant to pay any part or all of amounts not paid due to \n     the inequity adjustment on such terms and conditions as \n     established by the Administrator.\n       (4) Limitation on adjustments.--The aggregate total of \n     financial hardship adjustments under paragraph (2) and \n     inequity adjustments under paragraph (3) in effect in any \n     given year shall not exceed $300,000,000, except to the \n     extent that--\n       (A) additional monies are available for such adjustments as \n     a result of carryover of prior years' funds under subsection \n     (j)(3) or as a result of monies being made available in that \n     year under subsection (k)(1)(A); or\n       (B) the Administrator determines that the $300,000,000 is \n     insufficient and additional adjustments as provided under \n     paragraph (5) are needed to address situations in which a \n     defendant participant would otherwise be rendered insolvent \n     by its payment obligations without such adjustment.\n       (5) Bankruptcy relief.--\n       (A) In general.--Any defendant participant may apply for an \n     adjustment under this paragraph at any time during the period \n     in which a payment obligation to the Fund remains outstanding \n     and may qualify for such adjustment by demonstrating, to a \n     reasonable degree of certainty, evidence that the amount of \n     its payment obligation would render the defendant participant \n     insolvent, as defined under section 101 of title 11, United \n     States Code, and unable to pay its debts as they become due.\n       (B) Information required.--Any defendant participant \n     seeking an adjustment or renewal of an adjustment under this \n     paragraph shall provide the Administrator with the \n     information required under section 521(1) of title 11 of the \n     United States Code.\n       (C) Limitation.--Any adjustment granted by the \n     Administrator under subparagraph (A) shall be limited to the \n     extent reasonably necessary to prevent insolvency of a \n     defendant participant.\n       (D) Term.--To the extent the Administrator grants any \n     relief under this paragraph, such adjustments shall have a \n     term of 1 year. An adjustment may be renewed or modified on \n     an annual basis upon the defendant participant demonstrating \n     that the adjustment or modification remains justified under \n     this paragraph.\n       (E) Reinstatement.--During the funding period prescribed \n     under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall annually \n     determine whether there has been a material change in the \n     financial condition of any defendant participant granted an \n     adjustment under this paragraph such that the Administrator \n     may, consistent with the policies and legislative intent \n     underlying this Act, reinstate under terms and conditions \n     established by the Administrator any part or all of the \n     defendant participant's payment obligation under the \n     statutory allocation that was not paid during the adjustment \n     term.\n       (6) Advisory panels.--\n       (A) Appointment.--The Administrator shall appoint a \n     Financial Hardship Adjustment Panel and an Inequity \n     Adjustment\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\n     Panel to advise the Administrator in carrying out this \n     subsection.\n       (B) Membership.--The membership of the panels appointed \n     under subparagraph (A) may overlap.\n       (C) Coordination.--The panels appointed under subparagraph \n     (A) shall coordinate their deliberations and advice.\n       (e) Limitation on Liability.--The liability of each \n     defendant participant to pay to the Fund shall be limited to \n     the payment obligations under this Act, and, except as \n     provided in subsection (f) and section 203(b)(2)(D), no \n     defendant participant shall have any liability for the \n     payment obligations of any other defendant participant.\n       (f) Consolidation of Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining the payment \n     levels of defendant participants, any affiliated group \n     including 1 or more defendant participants may irrevocably \n     elect, as part of the submissions to be made under paragraphs \n     (1) and (3) of subsection (i), to report on a consolidated \n     basis all of the information necessary to determine the \n     payment level under this subtitle and pay to the Fund on a \n     consolidated basis.\n       (2) Election.--If an affiliated group elects consolidation \n     as provided in this subsection--\n       (A) for purposes of this Act other than this subsection, \n     the affiliated group shall be treated as if it were a single \n     participant, including with respect to the assessment of a \n     single annual payment under this subtitle for the entire \n     affiliated group;\n       (B) the ultimate parent of the affiliated group shall \n     prepare and submit each submission to be made under \n     subsection (i) on behalf of the entire affiliated group and \n     shall be solely liable, as between the Administrator and the \n     affiliated group only, for the payment of the annual amount \n     due from the affiliated group under this subtitle, except \n     that, if the ultimate parent does not pay when due any \n     payment obligation for the affiliated group, the \n     Administrator shall have the right to seek payment of all or \n     any portion of the entire amount due (as well as any other \n     amount for which the affiliated group may be liable under \n     sections 223 and 224) from any member of the affiliated \n     group;\n       (C) all members of the affiliated group shall be identified \n     in the submission under subsection (i) and shall certify \n     compliance with this subsection and the Administrator's \n     regulations implementing this subsection; and\n       (D) the obligations under this subtitle shall not change \n     even if, after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     beneficial ownership interest between any members of the \n     affiliated group shall change.\n       (3) Cause of action.--Notwithstanding section 221(e), this \n     Act shall not preclude actions among persons within an \n     affiliated group with respect to the payment obligations \n     under this Act.\n       (g) Determination of Prior Asbestos Expenditures.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of determining a defendant \n     participant's prior asbestos expenditures, the Administrator \n     shall prescribe such rules as may be necessary or appropriate \n     to assure that payments by indemnitors before December 31, \n     2002, shall be counted as part of the indemnitor's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, rather than the indemnitee's prior \n     asbestos expenditures, in accordance with this subsection.\n       (2) Indemnifiable costs.--If an indemnitor has paid or \n     reimbursed to an indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or \n     otherwise made a payment on behalf of or for the benefit of \n     an indemnitee to a third party for an indemnifiable cost \n     before December 31, 2002, the amount of such indemnifiable \n     cost shall be solely for the account of the indemnitor for \n     purposes under this Act.\n       (3) Insurance payments.--When computing the prior asbestos \n     expenditures with respect to an asbestos claim, any amount \n     paid or reimbursed by insurance shall be solely for the \n     account of the indemnitor, even if the indemnitor would have \n     no direct right to the benefit of the insurance, if--\n       (A) such insurance has been paid or reimbursed to the \n     indemnitor or the indemnitee, or paid on behalf of or for the \n     benefit of the indemnitee; and\n       (B) the indemnitor has either, with respect to such \n     asbestos claim or any similar asbestos claim, paid or \n     reimbursed to its indemnitee any indemnifiable cost or paid \n     to any third party on behalf of or for the benefit of the \n     indemnitee any indemnifiable cost.\n       (4) Treatment of certain expenditures.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this Act, where--\n       (A) an indemnitor entered into a stock purchase agreement \n     in 1988 that involved the sale of the stock of businesses \n     that produced friction and other products; and\n       (B) the stock purchase agreement provided that the \n     indemnitor indemnified the indemnitee and its affiliates for \n     losses arising from various matters, including asbestos \n     claims--\n       (i) asserted before the date of the agreement; and\n       (ii) filed after the date of the agreement and prior to the \n     10-year anniversary of the stock sale,\n\n     then the prior asbestos expenditures arising from the \n     asbestos claims described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall not \n     be for the account of either the indemnitor or indemnitee.\n       (h) Minimum Annual Payments.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate annual payments of defendant \n     participants to the Fund shall be at least $3,000,000,000 for \n     each calendar year in the first 30 years of the Fund, or \n     until such shorter time as the condition set forth in \n     subsection (a)(2) is attained.\n       (2) Guaranteed payment account.--To the extent payments in \n     accordance with sections 202 and 203 (as modified by \n     subsections (b), (d), (f), (g), and (m) of this section) fail \n     in any year to raise at least $3,000,000,000, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (d) and (m), the balance needed to \n     meet this required minimum aggregate annual payment shall be \n     obtained from the defendant guaranteed payment account \n     established under subsection (k).\n       (3) Guaranteed payment surcharge.--To the extent the \n     procedure set forth in paragraph (2) is insufficient to \n     satisfy the required minimum aggregate annual payment, after \n     applicable reductions or adjustments have been taken \n     according to subsections (d) and (m), the Administrator shall \n     unless the Administrator implements a funding holiday under \n     section 205(b), assess a guaranteed payment surcharge under \n     subsection (l).\n       (i) Procedures for Making Payments.--\n       (1) Initial year: tiers ii-vi.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act, each defendant participant that is included in \n     Tiers II, III, IV, V, or VI shall file with the \n     Administrator--\n       (i) a statement of whether the defendant participant \n     irrevocably elects to report on a consolidated basis under \n     subsection (f);\n       (ii) a good-faith estimate of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures;\n       (iii) a statement of its 2002 revenues, determined in \n     accordance with section 203(a)(2);\n       (iv) payment in the amount specified in section 203 for the \n     lowest subtier of the tier within which the defendant \n     participant falls, except that if the defendant participant, \n     or the affiliated group including the defendant participant, \n     had 2002 revenues exceeding $3,000,000,000, it or its \n     affiliated group shall pay the amount specified for Subtier 3 \n     of Tiers II, III, or IV or Subtier 2 of Tiers V or VI, \n     depending on the applicable Tier;

The reductions under this paragraph \n     shall be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Tier 1, Subtiers 2 and \n     3, and class action trusts.\n       (2) Limitation.--The Administrator shall suspend, cancel, \n     reduce, or delay any reduction under paragraph (1) if at any \n     time the Administrator finds, in accordance with subsection \n     (c), that such action is necessary and appropriate to ensure \n     that the assets of the Fund and expected future payments \n     remain sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated \n     obligations.\n       (b) Funding Holidays.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments, taking into \n     consideration any reductions under subsection (a), are \n     sufficient to satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations \n     without the need for all, or any portion of, that year's \n     payment otherwise required under this subtitle, the \n     Administrator shall reduce or waive all or any part of the \n     payments required from defendant participants for that year.\n       (2) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under paragraph (1) every year.\n       (3) Limitations on funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the defendant participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n       (A) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (B) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all defendant participants, except with \n     respect to defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and 3 of Tier \n     I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (4) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all defendant \n     participants, except defendant participants in Subtiers 2 and \n     3 of Tier I and class action trusts, for that year.\n       (c) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Before suspending, canceling, reducing, or \n     delaying any reduction under subsection (a) or granting or \n     revoking a reduction or waiver under subsection (b), the \n     Administrator shall certify that the requirements of this \n     section are satisfied.\n       (2) Notice and comment.--Before making a final \n     certification under this subsection, the Administrator shall \n     publish a notice in the Federal Register of a proposed \n     certification and a statement of the basis therefor and \n     provide in such notice for a public comment period of 30 \n     days.\n       (3) Final certification.--\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator shall publish a notice \n     of the final certification in the Federal Register after \n     consideration of all comments submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Written notice.--Not later than 30 days after \n     publishing any final certification under subparagraph (A), \n     the Administrator shall provide each defendant participant \n     with written notice of that defendant's funding obligation \n     for that year.\n\n     SEC. 206.

DUTIES OF ASBESTOS INSURERS COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Determination of Insurer Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Definitions.--For the purposes of this Act, the terms \n     ``insurer'' and ``insurer participant'' shall, unless stated \n     otherwise, include direct insurers and reinsurers, as well as \n     any run-off entity established, in whole or in part, to \n     review and pay asbestos claims.\n       (B) Procedures for determining insurer payments.--The \n     Commission shall determine the amount that each insurer \n     participant shall be required to pay into the Fund under the \n     procedures described in this section. The Commission shall \n     make this determination by first promulgating a rule \n     establishing a methodology for allocation of payments among \n     insurer participants and then applying such methodology to \n     determine the individual payment for each insurer \n     participant. The methodology may include 1 or more allocation \n     formulas to be applied to all insurer participants or groups \n     of similarly situated participants. The Commission's rule \n     shall include a methodology for adjusting payments by insurer \n     participants to make up, during the first 5 years of the life \n     of the Fund and any subsequent years as provided in section \n     405(f) for any reduction in an insurer participant's annual \n     allocated amount caused by the granting of a financial \n     hardship or exceptional circumstance adjustment under this \n     section, and any amount by which aggregate insurer payments \n     fall below the level required under paragraph (3)(C) by \n     reason of the failure or refusal of any insurer participant \n     to make a required payment, or for any other reason that \n     causes such payments to fall below the level required under \n     paragraph (3)(C). The Commission shall conduct a thorough \n     study (within the time limitations under this subparagraph) \n     of the accuracy of the reserve allocation of each insurer \n     participant, and may request information from the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission or any State regulatory agency. Under \n     this procedure, not later than 120 days after the initial \n     meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall commence a \n     rulemaking proceeding under section 213(a) to propose and \n     adopt a methodology for allocating payments among insurer \n     participants. In proposing an allocation methodology, the \n     Commission may consult with such actuaries and other experts \n     as it deems appropriate. After hearings and public comment on \n     the proposed allocation methodology, the Commission shall as \n     promptly as possible promulgate a final rule establishing \n     such methodology. After promulgation of the final rule, the \n     Commission shall determine the individual payment of each \n     insurer participant under the procedures set forth in \n     subsection (b).\n       (C) Scope.--Every insurer, reinsurer, and runoff entity \n     with asbestos-related obligations in the United States shall \n     be subject to the Commission's and Administrator's authority \n     under this Act, including allocation determinations, and \n     shall be required to fulfill its payment obligation without \n     regard as to whether it is licensed in the United States. \n     Every insurer participant not licensed or domiciled in the \n     United States shall, upon the first payment to the Fund, \n     submit a written consent to the Commission's and \n     Administrator's authority under this Act, and to the \n     jurisdiction of the courts of the United States for purposes \n     of enforcing this Act, in a form determined by the \n     Administrator. Any insurer participant refusing to provide a \n     written consent shall be subject to fines and penalties as \n     provided in section 223.\n       (D) Issuers of finite risk policies.--\n       (i) In general.--The issuer of any policy of retrospective \n     reinsurance purchased by an insurer participant or its \n     affiliate after 1990 that provides for a risk or loss \n     transfer to insure for asbestos losses and other losses (both \n     known and unknown), including those policies commonly \n     referred to as ``finite risk'', ``aggregate stop loss'', \n     ``aggregate excess of loss'', or ``loss portfolio transfer'' \n     policies, shall be obligated to make payments required under \n     this Act directly to the Fund on behalf of the insurer \n     participant who is the beneficiary of such policy, subject to \n     the underlying retention and the limits of liability \n     applicable to such policy.\n       (ii) Payments.--Payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act shall be treated as loss payments for asbestos bodily \n     injury (as if such payments were incurred as liabilities \n     imposed in the tort system) and shall not be subject to \n     exclusion under policies described under clause (i) as a \n     liability with respect to tax or assessment. Within 90 days \n     after the scheduled date to make an annual payment to the \n     Fund, the insurer participant shall, at its discretion, \n     direct the reinsurer issuing such policy to pay all or a \n     portion of the annual payment directly to the Fund up to the \n     full applicable limits of liability under the policy. The \n     reinsurer issuing such policy shall be obligated to make such \n     payments directly to the Fund and shall be subject to the \n     enforcement provisions under section 223. The insurer \n     participant shall remain obligated to make payment to the \n     Fund of that portion of the annual payment not directed to \n     the issuer of such reinsurance policy.\n       (2) Amount of payments.--\n       (A) Aggregate payment obligation.--The total payment \n     required of all insurer participants over the life of the \n     Fund shall be equal to $46,025,000,000, less any bankruptcy \n     trust credits under section 222(d).\n       (B) Accounting standards.--In determining the payment \n     obligations of participants that are not licensed or \n     domiciled in the United States or that are runoff entities, \n     the Commission shall use accounting standards required for \n     United States licensed direct insurers.\n       (C) Captive insurance companies.--No payment to the Fund \n     shall be required from a captive insurance company, unless \n     and only to the extent a captive insurance company, on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insures the asbestos \n     liability, directly or indirectly, of (and that arises out of \n     the manufacture, sale, distribution or installation of \n     materials or products by, or other conduct of) a person or \n     persons other than and unaffiliated with its ultimate parent \n     or affiliated group or pool in which the ultimate parent \n     participates or participated, or unaffiliated with a person \n     that was its ultimate parent or a member of its affiliated \n     group or pool at the time the relevant insurance or \n     reinsurance was issued by the captive insurance company.\n       (D) Several liability.--Unless otherwise provided under \n     this Act, each insurer participant's obligation to make \n     payments to the Fund is several. Unless otherwise provided \n     under this Act, there is no joint liability, and the future \n     insolvency by any insurer participant shall not affect the \n     payment required of any other insurer participant.\n       (3) Payment of criteria.--\n       (A) Inclusion in insurer participant category.--\n       (i) In general.--Insurers that have paid, or been assessed \n     by a legal judgment or settlement, at least $1,000,000 in \n     defense and indemnity costs before the date of enactment of \n     this Act in response to claims for compensation for asbestos \n     injuries arising from a policy of liability insurance or \n     contract of liability reinsurance or retrocessional \n     reinsurance shall be insurer participants in the Fund. Other \n     insurers shall be exempt from mandatory payments.\n       (ii) Inapplicability of section 202.--Since insurers may be \n     subject in certain jurisdictions to direct action suits, and \n     it is not the intent of this Act to impose upon an insurer, \n     due to its operation as an insurer, payment obligations to \n     the Fund in situations where the insurer is the subject of a \n     direct action, no insurer subject to mandatory payments under \n     this section shall also be liable for payments to the Fund as \n     a defendant participant under section 202.\n       (B) Insurer participant allocation methodology.--\n       (i) In general.--The Commission shall establish the payment \n     obligations of individual insurer participants to reflect, on \n     an equitable basis, the relative tort system liability of the \n     participating insurers in the absence of this Act, \n     considering and weighting, as appropriate (but exclusive of \n     workers' compensation), such factors as--\n\n       (I) historic premium for lines of insurance associated with \n     asbestos exposure over relevant periods of time;\n       (II) recent loss experience for asbestos liability;\n       (III) amounts reserved for asbestos liability;\n       (IV) the likely cost to each insurer participant of its \n     future liabilities under applicable insurance policies; and\n       (V) any other factor the Commission may determine is \n     relevant and appropriate.\n\n       (ii) Determination of reserves.--The Commission may \n     establish procedures and standards for determination of the \n     asbestos reserves of insurer participants. The reserves of a \n     United States licensed reinsurer that is wholly owned by, or \n     under common control of, a United States licensed direct \n     insurer shall be included as part of the direct insurer's \n     reserves when the reinsurer's financial results are included \n     as part of the direct insurer's United States operations, as \n     reflected in footnote 33 of its filings with the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners or in published \n     financial statements prepared in accordance with generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       (C) Payment schedule.--The aggregate annual amount of \n     payments by insurer participants over the life of the Fund \n     shall be as follows:\n       (i) For years 1 and 2, $2,700,000,000 annually.\n       (ii) For years 3 through 5, $5,075,000,000 annually.\n       (iii) For years 6 through 27, $1,147,000,000 annually.\n       (iv) For year 28, $166,000,000.\n       (D) Certain runoff entities.--A runoff entity shall include \n     any direct insurer or reinsurer whose asbestos liability \n     reserves have been transferred, directly or indirectly, to \n     the runoff entity and on whose behalf the runoff entity \n     handles or adjusts and, where appropriate, pays asbestos \n     claims.\n       (E) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\n       (i) In general.--Under the procedures established in \n     subsection (b), an insurer participant may seek adjustment of \n     the amount of its payments based on exceptional circumstances \n     or severe financial hardship.\n       (ii) Financial adjustments.--An insurer participant may \n     qualify for an adjustment based on severe financial hardship \n     by demonstrating that payment of the amounts required by the \n     Commission's methodology would jeopardize the solvency of \n     such participant.\n       (iii) Exceptional circumstance adjustment.--An insurer \n     participant may qualify for an adjustment based on \n     exceptional circumstances by demonstrating--\n\n       (I) that the amount of its payments under the Commission's \n     allocation methodology is exceptionally inequitable when \n     measured against the amount of the likely cost to the \n     participant of its future liability in the tort system in the \n     absence of the Fund;\n       (II) an offset credit as described in subparagraphs (A) and \n     (C) of subsection (b)(4); or\n       (III) other exceptional circumstances.\n\n     The Commission may determine whether to grant an adjustment \n     and the size of any such adjustment, but except as provided \n     under paragraph (1)(B), subsection (f)(3), and section \n     405(f), any such adjustment shall not affect the aggregate \n     payment obligations of insurer participants specified in \n     paragraph (2)(A) and subparagraph (C) of this paragraph.\n       (iv) Time period of adjustment.--Except for adjustments for \n     offset credits, adjustments granted under this subsection \n     shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An insurer \n     participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating to the \n     Administrator that it remains justified.\n       (F) Funding holidays.--\n       (i) In general.--If the Administrator determines, at any \n     time after 10 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act, that the assets of the Fund at the time of such \n     determination and expected future payments are sufficient to \n     satisfy the Fund's anticipated obligations without the need \n     for all, or any portion of, that year's payment otherwise \n     required under this subtitle, the Administrator shall reduce \n     or waive all or any part of the payments required from \n     insurer participants for that year.\n       (ii) Annual review.--The Administrator shall undertake the \n     review required by this subsection and make the necessary \n     determination under clause (i) every year.\n       (iii) Limitations of funding holidays.--Any reduction or \n     waiver of the insurer participants' funding obligations \n     shall--\n\n       (I) be made only to the extent the Administrator determines \n     that the Fund will still be able to satisfy all of its \n     anticipated obligations; and\n       (II) be applied on an equal pro rata basis to the funding \n     obligations of all insurer participants for that year.\n\n       (iv) New information.--If at any time the Administrator \n     determines that a reduction or waiver under this section may \n     cause the assets of the Fund and expected future payments to \n     decrease to a level at which the Fund may not be able to \n     satisfy all of its anticipated obligations, the Administrator \n     shall revoke all or any part of such reduction or waiver to \n     the extent necessary to ensure that the Fund's obligations \n     are met. Such revocations shall be applied on an equal pro \n     rata basis to the funding obligations of all insurer \n     participants for that year.\n       (b) Procedure for Notifying Insurer Participants of \n     Individual Payment Obligations.--\n       (1) Notice to participants.--Not later than 30 days after \n     promulgation of the final rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), the Commission shall--\n       (A) directly notify all reasonably identifiable insurer \n     participants of the requirement to submit information \n     necessary to calculate the amount of any required payment to \n     the Fund under the allocation methodology; and\n       (B) publish in the Federal Register a notice--\n       (i) requiring any person who may be an insurer participant \n     (as determined by criteria outlined in the notice) to submit \n     such information; and\n       (ii) that includes a list of all insurer participants \n     notified by the Commission under subparagraph (A), and \n     provides for 30 days for the submission of comments or \n     information regarding the completeness and accuracy of the \n     list of identified insurer participants.\n       (2) Response required by individual insurer participants.--\n       (A) In general.--Any person who receives notice under \n     paragraph (1)(A), and any other person meeting the criteria \n     specified in the notice published under paragraph (1)(B), \n     shall respond by providing the Commission with all the \n     information requested in the notice under a schedule or by a \n     date established by the Commission.\n       (B) Certification.--The response submitted under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be signed by a responsible corporate \n     officer, general partner, proprietor, or individual of \n     similar authority, who shall certify under penalty of law the \n     completeness and accuracy of the information submitted.\n       (3) Notice to insurer participants of initial payment \n     determination.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Notice to insurers.--Not later than 120 days after \n     receipt of the information required by paragraph (2), the \n     Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice of \n     initial determination requiring payments to the Fund, which \n     shall be based on the information received from the \n     participant in response to the Commission's request for \n     information. An insurer participant's payments shall be \n     payable over the schedule established in subsection \n     (a)(3)(C), in annual amounts proportionate to the aggregate \n     annual amount of payments for all insurer participants for \n     the applicable year.\n       (ii) Public notice.--Not later than 7 days after sending \n     the notification of initial determination to insurer \n     participants, the Commission shall publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice listing the insurer participants that have \n     been sent such notification, and the initial determination on \n     the payment obligation of each identified participant.\n       (B) No response; incomplete response.--If no response is \n     received from an insurer participant, or if the response is \n     incomplete, the initial determination requiring a payment \n     from the insurer participant shall be based on the best \n     information available to the Commission.\n       (4) Commission review, revision, and finalization of \n     initial payment determinations.--\n       (A) Comments from insurer participants.--Not later than 30 \n     days after receiving a notice of initial determination from \n     the Commission, an insurer participant may provide the \n     Commission with additional information to support adjustments \n     to the required payments to reflect severe financial hardship \n     or exceptional circumstances, including the provision of an \n     offset credit for an insurer participant for the amount of \n     any asbestos-related payments it made or was legally \n     obligated to make, including payments released from an \n     escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy judicially confirmed \n     after May 22, 2003, but before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (B) Additional participants.--If, before the final \n     determination of the Commission, the Commission receives \n     information that an additional person may qualify as an \n     insurer participant, the Commission shall require such person \n     to submit information necessary to determine whether payments \n     from that person should be required, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       (C) Revision procedures.--The Commission shall adopt \n     procedures for revising initial payments based on information \n     received under subparagraphs (A) and (B), including a \n     provision requiring an offset credit for an insurer \n     participant for the amount of any asbestos-related payments \n     it made or was legally obligated to make, including payments \n     released from an escrow, as the result of a bankruptcy \n     confirmed after May 22, 2003, but before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (5) Examinations and subpoenas.--\n       (A) Examinations.--The Commission may conduct examinations \n     of the books and records of insurer participants to determine \n     the completeness and accuracy of information submitted, or \n     required to be submitted, to the Commission for purposes of \n     determining participant payments.\n       (B) Subpoenas.--The Commission may request the Attorney \n     General to subpoena persons to compel testimony, records, and \n     other information relevant to its responsibilities under this \n     section. The Attorney General may enforce such subpoena in \n     appropriate proceedings in the United States district court \n     for the district in which the person to whom the subpoena was \n     addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.\n       (6) Escrow payments.--Without regard to an insurer \n     participant's payment obligation under this section, any \n     escrow or similar account established before the date of \n     enactment of this Act by an insurer participant in connection \n     with an asbestos trust fund that has not been judicially \n     confirmed by final order by the date of enactment of this Act \n     shall be the property of the insurer participant and returned \n     to that insurer participant.\n       (7) Notice to insurer participants of final payment \n     determinations.--Not later than 60 days after the notice of \n     initial determination is sent to the insurer participants, \n     the Commission shall send each insurer participant a notice \n     of final determination.\n       (c) Insurer Participants Voluntary Allocation Agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the \n     Commission proposes its rule establishing an allocation \n     methodology under subsection (a)(1), direct insurer \n     participants licensed or domiciled in the United States, \n     other direct insurer participants, reinsurer participants \n     licensed or domiciled in the United States, or other \n     reinsurer participants, may submit an allocation agreement, \n     approved by all of the participants in the applicable group, \n     to the Commission.\n       (2) Allocation agreement.--To the extent the participants \n     in any such applicable group voluntarily agree upon an \n     allocation arrangement, any such allocation agreement shall \n     only govern the allocation of payments within that group and \n     shall not determine the aggregate amount due from that group.\n       (3) Certification.--The Commission shall determine whether \n     an allocation agreement submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     meets the requirements of this subtitle and, if so, shall \n     certify the agreement as establishing the allocation \n     methodology governing the individual payment obligations of \n     the participants who are parties to the agreement. The \n     authority of the Commission under this subtitle shall, with \n     respect to participants who\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\n     are parties to a certified allocation agreement, terminate on \n     the day after the Commission certifies such agreement. Under \n     subsection (f), the Administrator shall assume \n     responsibility, if necessary, for calculating the individual \n     payment obligations of participants who are parties to the \n     certified agreement.\n       (d) Commission Report.--\n       (1) Recipients.--Until the work of the Commission has been \n     completed and the Commission terminated, the Commission shall \n     submit an annual report, containing the information described \n     under paragraph (2), to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (C) the Administrator.\n       (2) Contents.--The report under paragraph (1) shall state \n     the amount that each insurer participant is required to pay \n     to the Fund, including the payment schedule for such \n     payments.\n       (e) Interim Payments.--\n       (1) Amount of interim payment.--Within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, insurer participants shall \n     make an aggregate payment to the Fund not to exceed 50 \n     percent of the aggregate funding obligation specified under \n     subsection (a)(3)(C) for year 1.\n       (2) Reserve information.--Within 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each insurer participant shall submit \n     to the Administrator a certified statement of its net held \n     reserves for asbestos liabilities as of December 31, 2004.\n       (3) Allocation of interim payment.--The Administrator shall \n     allocate the interim payment among the individual insurer \n     participants on an equitable basis using the net held \n     asbestos reserve information provided by insurer participants \n     under subsection (a)(3)(B). Within 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall publish in the \n     Federal Register the name of each insurer participant, and \n     the amount of the insurer participant's allocated share of \n     the interim payment. The use of net held asbestos reserves as \n     the basis to determine an interim allocation shall not be \n     binding on the Administrator in the determination of an \n     appropriate final allocation methodology under this section. \n     All payments required under this paragraph shall be credited \n     against the participant's ultimate payment obligation to the \n     Fund established by the Commission. If an interim payment \n     exceeds the ultimate payment, the Fund shall pay interest on \n     the amount of the overpayment at a rate determined by the \n     Administrator. If the ultimate payment exceeds the interim \n     payment, the participant shall pay interest on the amount of \n     the underpayment at the same rate. Any participant may seek \n     an exemption from or reduction in any payment required under \n     this subsection under the financial hardship and exceptional \n     circumstance standards established under subsection \n     (a)(3)(E).\n       (4) Appeal of interim payment decisions.--A decision by the \n     Administrator to establish an interim payment obligation \n     shall be considered final agency action and reviewable under \n     section 303, except that the reviewing court may not stay an \n     interim payment during the pendency of the appeal.\n       (f) Transfer of Authority From the Commission to the \n     Administrator.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall assume all the \n     responsibilities and authority of the Commission, except that \n     the Administrator shall not have the power to modify the \n     allocation methodology established by the Commission or by \n     certified agreement or to promulgate a rule establishing any \n     such methodology.\n       (2) Financial hardship and exceptional circumstance \n     adjustments.--Upon termination of the Commission under \n     section 215, the Administrator shall have the authority, upon \n     application by any insurer participant, to make adjustments \n     to annual payments upon the same grounds as provided in \n     subsection (a)(3)(D). Adjustments granted under this \n     subsection shall have a term not to exceed 3 years. An \n     insurer participant may renew its adjustment by demonstrating \n     that it remains justified. Upon the grant of any adjustment, \n     the Administrator shall increase the payments, consistent \n     with subsection (a)(1)(B), required of all other insurer \n     participants so that there is no reduction in the aggregate \n     payment required of all insurer participants for the \n     applicable years. The increase in an insurer participant's \n     required payment shall be in proportion to such participant's \n     share of the aggregate payment obligation of all insurer \n     participants.\n       (3) Credits for shortfall assessments.--If insurer \n     participants are required during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund to make up any shortfall in required insurer \n     payments under subsection (a)(1)(B), then, beginning in year \n     6, the Administrator shall grant each insurer participant a \n     credit against its annual required payments during the \n     applicable years that in the aggregate equal the amount of \n     shortfall assessments paid by such insurer participant during \n     the first 5 years of the life of the Fund. The credit shall \n     be prorated over the same number of years as the number of \n     years during which the insurer participant paid a shortfall \n     assessment. Insurer participants which did not pay all \n     required payments to the Fund during the first 5 years of the \n     life of the Fund shall not be eligible for a credit. The \n     Administrator shall not grant a credit for shortfall \n     assessments imposed under section 405(f).\n       (4) Financial security requirements.--Whenever an insurer \n     participant's A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard \n     and Poor's financial strength rating falls below A-, and \n     until such time as either the insurer participant's A.M. \n     Best's Rating or Standard and Poor's rating is equal to or \n     greater than A-, the Administrator shall have the authority \n     to require that the participating insurer either--\n       (A) pay the present value of its remaining Fund payments at \n     a discount rate determined by the Administrator; or\n       (B) provide an evergreen letter of credit or financial \n     guarantee for future payments issued by an institution with \n     an A.M. Best's claims payment rating or Standard & Poor's \n     financial strength rating of at least A+.\n       (g) Accounting Treatment.--Insurer participants' payment \n     obligations to the Fund shall be subject to discounting under \n     the applicable accounting guidelines for generally accepted \n     accounting purposes and statutory accounting purposes for \n     each insurer participant. This subsection shall in no way \n     reduce the amount of monetary payments to the Fund by insurer \n     participants as required under subsection (a).\n       (h) Judicial Review.--The Commission's rule establishing an \n     allocation methodology, its final determinations of payment \n     obligations and other final action shall be judicially \n     reviewable as provided in title III.\n\n     SEC. 213.

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--Amounts in the Fund shall be held for the \n     exclusive purpose of providing benefits to asbestos claimants \n     and their beneficiaries and to otherwise defray the \n     reasonable expenses of administering the Fund.\n       (b) Investments.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts in the Fund shall be administered \n     and invested with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence, \n     under the circumstances prevailing at the time of such \n     investment, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity \n     and manner would use.\n       (2) Strategy.--The Administrator shall invest amounts in \n     the Fund in a manner that enables the Fund to make current \n     and future distributions to or for the benefit of asbestos \n     claimants. In pursuing an investment strategy under this \n     subparagraph, the Administrator shall consider, to the extent \n     relevant to an investment decision or action--\n       (A) the size of the Fund;\n       (B) the nature and estimated duration of the Fund;\n       (C) the liquidity and distribution requirements of the \n     Fund;\n       (D) general economic conditions at the time of the \n     investment;\n       (E) the possible effect of inflation or deflation on Fund \n     assets;\n       (F) the role that each investment or course of action plays \n     with respect to the overall assets of the Fund;\n       (G) the expected amount to be earned (including both income \n     and appreciation of capital) through investment of amounts in \n     the Fund; and\n       (H) the needs of asbestos claimants for current and future \n     distributions authorized under this Act.\n       (c) Bankruptcy Trust Guarantee.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall have the authority to \n     impose a pro rata surcharge on all participants under this \n     subsection to ensure the liquidity of the Fund, if--\n       (A) the declared assets from 1 or more bankruptcy trusts \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, are not \n     available to the Fund because a final judgment that has been \n     entered by a court and is no longer subject to any appeal or \n     review has enjoined the transfer of assets required under \n     section 524(j)(2) of title 11, United States Code (as amended \n     by section 402(f) of this Act); and\n       (B) borrowing is insufficient to assure the Fund's ability \n     to meet its obligations under this Act such that the required \n     borrowed amount is likely to increase the risk of termination \n     of this Act under section 405 based on reasonable claims \n     projections.\n       (2) Allocation.--Any surcharge imposed under this \n     subsection shall be imposed over a period of 5 years on a pro \n     rata basis upon all participants, in accordance with the \n     relative aggregate funding obligations under sections \n     202(a)(2) and 212(a)(2)(A).\n       (3) Certification.--\n       (A) In general.--Before imposing a surcharge under this \n     subsection, the Administrator shall publish a notice in the \n     Federal\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\n     Register and provide in such notice for a public comment \n     period of 30 days.\n       (B) Contents of notice.--The notice required under \n     subparagraph (A) shall include--\n       (i) information explaining the circumstances that make a \n     surcharge necessary and a certification that the requirements \n     under paragraph (1) are met;\n       (ii) the amount of the declared assets from any trust \n     established under a plan of reorganization confirmed and \n     substantially consummated on or before July 31, 2004, that \n     was not made, or is no longer, available to the Fund;\n       (iii) the total aggregate amount of the necessary \n     surcharge; and\n       (iv) the surcharge amount for each tier and subtier of \n     defendant participants and for each insurer participant.\n       (C) Final notice.--The Administrator shall publish a final \n     notice in the Federal Register and provide each participant \n     with written notice of that participant's schedule of \n     payments under this subsection.

and\n       (ii) the resolution of claims for reimbursement or coverage \n     of liability or paid or incurred loss for which notice was \n     provided to the insurer before the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (E) Scheduled payment amounts.--The term ``scheduled \n     payment amounts'' means the future payment obligation to the \n     Fund under this Act from a defendant participant in the \n     amount established under sections 203 and 204.\n       (F) Unearned erosion amount.--The term ``unearned erosion \n     amount'' means, in the event of any early sunset under \n     section 405(g), the difference between the deemed erosion \n     amount and the earned erosion amount.\n       (2) Quantum and timing of erosion.--\n       (A) Erosion upon enactment.--The collective payment \n     obligations to the Fund of the insurer and reinsurer \n     participants as assessed by the Administrator shall be deemed \n     as of the date of enactment of this Act to erode remaining \n     aggregate products limits available to a defendant \n     participant only in an amount of 38.1 percent of each \n     defendant participant's scheduled payment amount.\n       (B) No assertion of claim.--No insurer or reinsurer may \n     assert any claim against a defendant participant or captive \n     insurer for insurance, reinsurance, payment of a deductible, \n     or retrospective premium adjustment arising out of that \n     insurer's or reinsurer's payments to the Fund or the erosion \n     deemed to occur under this section.\n       (C) Policies without certain limits or with exclusion.--\n     Except as provided under subparagraph (E), nothing in this \n     section shall require or permit the erosion of any insurance \n     policy or limit that does not contain an aggregate products \n     limit, or that contains an asbestos exclusion.\n       (D) Treatment of consolidation election.--If an affiliated \n     group elects consolidation as provided in section 204(f), the \n     total erosion of limits for the affiliated group under \n     paragraph (2)(A) shall not exceed 38.1 percent of the \n     scheduled payment amount of the single payment obligation for \n     the entire affiliated group. The total erosion of limits for \n     any individual defendant participant in the affiliated group \n     shall not exceed its individual share of 38.1 percent of the \n     affiliated group's scheduled payment amount, as measured by \n     the individual defendant participant's percentage share of \n     the affiliated group's prior asbestos expenditures.\n       (E) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section, nothing in this Act shall be \n     deemed to erode remaining aggregate products limits of a \n     defendant participant that can demonstrate by a preponderance \n     of the evidence that 75 percent of its prior asbestos \n     expenditures were made in defense or satisfaction of asbestos \n     claims alleging bodily injury arising exclusively from the \n     exposure to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or controlled \n     by the defendant participant (a ``premises defendant''). In \n     calculating such percentage, where expenditures were made in \n     defense or satisfaction of asbestos claims alleging bodily \n     injury due to exposure to the defendant participant's \n     products and to asbestos at premises owned, rented, or \n     controlled by the defendant participant, half of such \n     expenditures shall be deemed to be for such premises \n     exposures. If a defendant participant establishes itself as a \n     premises defendant, 75 percent of the payments by such \n     defendant participant shall erode coverage limits, if any, \n     applicable to premises liabilities under applicable law.\n       (3) Method of erosion.--\n       (A) Allocation.--The amount of erosion allocated to each \n     defendant participant shall be allocated among periods in \n     which policies with remaining aggregate product limits are \n     available to that defendant participant pro rata by policy \n     period, in ascending order by attachment point.\n       (B) Other erosion methods.--\n       (i) In general.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     method of erosion of any remaining aggregate products limits \n     which are subject to--\n\n       (I) a coverage-in-place or settlement agreement between a \n     defendant participant and 1 or more insurance participants as \n     of the date of enactment; or\n       (II) a final and nonappealable judgment as of the date of \n     enactment or resulting from a claim for coverage or \n     reimbursement pending as of such date, shall be as specified \n     in such agreement or judgment with regard to erosion \n     applicable to such insurance participants' policies.\n\n       (ii) Remaining limits.--To the extent that a final \n     nonappealable judgment or settlement agreement to which an \n     insurer participant and a defendant participant are parties \n     in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act \n     extinguished a defendant participant's right to seek coverage \n     for asbestos claims under an insurer participant's policies, \n     any remaining limits in such policies shall not be considered \n     to be remaining aggregate products limits under subsection \n     (a)(1)(A).\n       (4) Restoration of aggregate products limits upon early \n     sunset.--\n       (A) Restoration.--In the event of an early sunset, any \n     unearned erosion amount will be deemed restored as aggregate \n     products limits available to a defendant participant as of \n     the date of enactment.\n       (B) Method of restoration.--The unearned erosion amount \n     will be deemed restored to each defendant participant's \n     policies in such a manner that the last limits that were \n     deemed eroded at enactment under this subsection are deemed \n     to be the first limits restored upon early sunset.\n       (C) Tolling of coverage claims.--In the event of an early \n     sunset, the applicable statute of limitations and contractual \n     provisions for the filing of claims under any insurance \n     policy with restored aggregate products limits shall be \n     deemed tolled after the date of enactment through the date 6 \n     months after the date of early sunset.\n       (5) Payments by defendant participant.--Payments made by a \n     defendant participant shall be deemed to erode, exhaust, or \n     otherwise satisfy applicable self-insured retentions, \n     deductibles, retrospectively rated premiums, and limits \n     issued by nonparticipating insolvent or captive insurance \n     companies. Reduction of remaining aggregate limits under this \n     subsection shall not limit the right of a defendant \n     participant to collect from any insurer not a participant.\n       (6) Effect on other insurance claims.--Other than as \n     specified in this subsection, this Act does not alter, \n     change, modify, or affect insurance for claims other than \n     asbestos claims.\n       (b) Dispute Resolution Procedure.--\n       (1) Arbitration.--The parties to a dispute regarding the \n     erosion of insurance coverage limits under this section may \n     agree in writing to settle such dispute by arbitration. Any \n     such provision or agreement shall be valid, irrevocable, and \n     enforceable, except for any grounds that exist at law or in \n     equity for revocation of a contract.\n       (2) Title 9, united states code.--Arbitration of such \n     disputes, awards by arbitrators, and confirmation of awards \n     shall be governed by title 9, United States Code, to the \n     extent such title is not inconsistent with this section. In \n     any such arbitration proceeding, the erosion principles \n     provided for under this section shall be binding on the \n     arbitrator, unless the parties agree to the contrary.\n       (3) Final and binding award.--An award by an arbitrator \n     shall be final and binding between the parties to the \n     arbitration, but shall have no force or effect on any other \n     person. The parties to an arbitration may agree that in the \n     event a policy which is the subject matter of an award is \n     subsequently determined to be eroded in a manner different \n     from the manner determined by the arbitration in a judgment \n     rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no \n     appeal can or has been taken, such arbitration award may be \n     modified by any court of competent jurisdiction upon \n     application by any party to the arbitration. Any such \n     modification shall govern the rights and obligations between \n     such parties after the date of such modification.\n       (c) Effect on Nonparticipants.--\n       (1) In general.--No insurance company or reinsurance \n     company that is not a participant, other than a captive \n     insurer, shall be entitled to claim that payments to the Fund \n     erode, exhaust, or otherwise limit the nonparticipant's \n     insurance or reinsurance obligations.\n       (2) Other claims.--Nothing in this Act shall preclude a \n     participant from pursuing any claim for insurance or \n     reinsurance from any person that is not a participant other \n     than a captive insurer.\n       (d) Finite Risk Policies Not Affected.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, except subject to section 212(a)(1)(D), this Act \n     shall not alter, affect or impair any rights or obligations \n     of--\n       (A) any party to an insurance contract that expressly \n     provides coverage for governmental charges or assessments \n     imposed to replace insurance or reinsurance liabilities in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (B) subject to paragraph (2), any person with respect to \n     any insurance purchased by a participant after December 31, \n     1990, that expressly (but not necessarily exclusively) \n     provides coverage for asbestos liabilities, including those \n     policies commonly referred to as ``finite risk'' policies.\n       (2) Limitation.--No person may assert that any amounts paid \n     to the Fund in accordance with this Act are covered by any \n     policy described under paragraph (1)(B) purchased by a \n     defendant participant, unless such policy specifically \n     provides coverage for required payments to a Federal trust \n     fund established by a Federal statute to resolve asbestos \n     injury claims.\n       (e) Effect on Certain Insurance and Reinsurance Claims.--\n       (1) No coverage for fund assessments.--Subject to section \n     212(a)(1)(D), no participant or captive insurer may pursue an \n     insurance or reinsurance claim against another participant or \n     captive insurer for payments to the Fund required under this \n     Act, except under a written agreement specifically providing \n     insurance, reinsurance, or other reimbursement for required \n     payments to a Federal trust fund established by a Federal \n     statute to resolve asbestos injury claims or, where \n     applicable, under finite risk policies under subsection (d).\n       (2) Certain insurance assignments voided.--Any assignment \n     of any rights to insurance coverage for asbestos claims to \n     any person who has asserted an asbestos claim before the date \n     of enactment of this Act, or to any trust, person, or other \n     entity not part of an affiliated group as defined in section \n     201(1) of this Act established or appointed for the purpose \n     of paying asbestos claims which\n\n[[Page S1017]]\n\n     were asserted before such date of enactment, or by any Tier I \n     defendant participant, before any sunset of this Act, shall \n     be null and void. This subsection shall not void or affect in \n     any way any assignments of rights to insurance coverage other \n     than to asbestos claimants or to trusts, persons, or other \n     entities not part of an affiliated group as defined in \n     section 201(1) of this Act established or appointed for the \n     purpose of paying asbestos claims, or by Tier I defendant \n     participants.\n       (3) Insurance claims preserved.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act, this Act shall not alter, affect, or \n     impair any rights or obligations of any person with respect \n     to any insurance or reinsurance for amounts that any person \n     pays, has paid, or becomes legally obligated to pay in \n     respect of asbestos or other claims, including claims filed, \n     pursued, or revived under section 405(h), except to the \n     extent that--\n       (A) such claims are preempted, barred, or superseded by \n     section 403;\n       (B) any such rights or obligations of such person with \n     respect to insurance or reinsurance are prohibited by \n     paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (e); or\n       (C) the limits of insurance otherwise available to such \n     participant in respect of asbestos claims are deemed to be \n     eroded under subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 405.

\n     and\n       (2) to satisfy the Fund's debt repayment obligation, \n     administrative costs, and other financial obligations.\n       (d) Claims Analysis and Verification of Unanticipated \n     Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator concludes, on the \n     basis of the annual report submitted under this section, \n     that--\n       (A) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation exceeds 125 \n     percent of the number of claims expected to qualify for \n     compensation under that claim level or designation in the \n     most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-\n     injury claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall \n     conduct a review of a statistically significant sample of \n     claims qualifying for compensation under the appropriate \n     claim level or designation; or\n       (B) the average number of claims that qualify for \n     compensation under a claim level or designation is less than \n     75 percent of the number of claims expected to qualify for \n     compensation under that claim level or designation in the \n     most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of asbestos-\n     injury claims for any 3-year period, the Administrator shall \n     conduct a review of a statistically significant sample of \n     claims deemed ineligible for compensation under the \n     appropriate claim level or designation.\n       (2) Determinations.--The Administrator shall examine the \n     best available medical evidence and any recommendation made \n     under subsection (b)(5) in order to determine which 1 or more \n     of the following is true:\n       (A) Without a significant number of exceptions, all of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level or designation suffer from an injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor.\n       (B) A significant number of claimants who qualified for \n     compensation under the claim level or designation do not \n     suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (C) A significant number of claimants who were denied \n     compensation under the claim level of designation did suffer \n     from an injury or disease for which exposure to asbestos was \n     a substantial contributing factor.\n       (D) The Congressional Budget Office projections \n     underestimated or overestimated the actual number of persons \n     who suffer from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (3) Recommendations concerning claims criteria.--If the \n     Administrator determines that a significant number of the \n     claimants who qualified for compensation under the claim \n     level under review do not suffer from an injury or disease \n     for which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, or that a significant number of the claimants who \n     were denied compensation under the claim level under review \n     suffered from an injury or disease for which exposure to \n     asbestos was a substantial contributing factor, the \n     Administrator shall recommend to Congress, under subsection \n     (f), changes to the compensation criteria in order to ensure \n     that the Fund provides compensation for injury or disease for \n     which exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing \n     factor, but does not provide compensation to claimants who do \n     not suffer from an injury or disease for which asbestos \n     exposure was a substantial contributing factor.\n       (e) Recommendations of Administrator and Advisory \n     Committee.--\n       (1) Referral.--If the Administrator recommends changes to \n     this Act under subsection (d), the recommendations and \n     accompanying analysis shall be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 (in this subsection referred to as the ``Advisory \n     Committee'').\n       (2) Advisory committee recommendations.--The Advisory \n     Committee shall hold expedited public hearings on the \n     alternatives and recommendations of the Administrator and \n     make its own recommendations for reform of the program under \n     titles I and II.\n       (3) Transmittal to congress.--Not later than 90 days after \n     receiving the recommendations of the Administrator, the \n     Advisory Committee shall transmit the recommendations of the \n     Administrator and the recommendations of the Advisory \n     Committee to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (f) Shortfall Analysis.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Analysis.--If the Administrator concludes, at any time, \n     that the Fund may not be able to pay claims as such claims \n     become due at any time within the next 5 years and to satisfy \n     its other obligations, the Administrator shall prepare an \n     analysis of the reasons for the situation, an estimation of \n     when\n\n[[Page S1018]]\n\n     the Fund will no longer be able to pay claims as such claims \n     become due, a description of the range of reasonable \n     alternatives for responding to the situation, and a \n     recommendation as to which alternative best serves the \n     interest of claimants and the public. The report may include \n     a description of changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria of section 121 that the Administrator \n     believes may be necessary to protect the Fund. The \n     Administrator shall submit such analysis to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives. Any \n     recommendations made by the Administrator for changes to the \n     program shall, in addition, be referred to the Advisory \n     Committee on Asbestos Disease Compensation established under \n     section 102 for review.\n       (B) Range of alternatives.--The range of alternatives under \n     subparagraph (A) may include--\n       (i) termination of the program set forth in titles I and II \n     of this Act in its entirety;\n       (ii) reform of the program set forth in titles I and II of \n     this Act (including changes in the diagnostic, exposure, or \n     medical criteria, changes in the enforcement or application \n     of those criteria, enhancement of enforcement authority, \n     changes in the timing of payments, changes in contributions \n     by defendant participants, insurer participants (or both such \n     participants), or changes in award values); or\n       (iii) any measure that the Administrator considers \n     appropriate.\n       (C) Insurer shortfall assessments.--Beginning in year 6 of \n     the life of the Fund, if the Administrator determines that a \n     shortfall in payment of the annual amounts required to be \n     paid by insurer participants under section 212(a)(3)(C) is \n     the substantial factor that would cause the Administrator to \n     recommend the termination of this Act under subsection (g), \n     then the Administrator may impose shortfall assessments on \n     insurer participants in addition to the payments imposed \n     under section 212, except that the Administrator shall not \n     impose such assessments if the additional amounts would not \n     be sufficient to permit the Administrator to avoid \n     recommending termination of this Act. During any given year, \n     the total of such shortfall assessments shall not exceed the \n     amount by which, during the prior year, total payments by \n     insurer participants fell short of the aggregate amounts \n     required to be paid under section 212(a)(3)(C). Shortfall \n     assessments shall be allocated among insurer participants \n     using the methodology adopted by the Asbestos Insurers \n     Commission under section 212(a)(1)(B).\n       (2) Considerations.--In formulating recommendations, the \n     Administrator shall take into account the reasons for any \n     shortfall, actual or projected, which may include--\n       (A) financial factors, including return on investments, \n     borrowing capacity, interest rates, ability to collect \n     contributions, and other relevant factors;\n       (B) the operation of the Fund generally, including \n     administration of the claims processing, the ability of the \n     Administrator to collect contributions from participants, \n     potential problems of fraud, the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma, and inadequate flexibility \n     to extend the timing of payments;\n       (C) the appropriateness of the diagnostic, exposure, and \n     medical criteria, including the adequacy of the criteria to \n     rule out idiopathic mesothelioma;\n       (D) the actual incidence of asbestos-related diseases, \n     including mesothelioma, based on epidemiological studies and \n     other relevant data;\n       (E) compensation of diseases with alternative causes; and\n       (F) other factors that the Administrator considers \n     relevant.\n       (3) Recommendation of termination.--Any recommendation of \n     termination should include a plan for winding up the affairs \n     of the Fund (and the program generally) within a defined \n     period, including paying in full all claims resolved at the \n     time the report is prepared. Any plan under this paragraph \n     shall provide for priority in payment to the claimants with \n     the most serious illnesses.\n       (4) Resolved claims.--For purposes of this section, a claim \n     shall be deemed resolved when the Administrator has \n     determined the amount of the award due the claimant, and \n     either the claimant has waived judicial review or the time \n     for judicial review has expired.\n       (g) Sunset of Act.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Termination.--Subject to paragraph (4), titles I \n     (except subtitle A) and II and sections 403 and 404(e)(2) \n     shall terminate as provided under paragraph (2), if--\n       (i) the Administrator has begun the processing of claims; \n     and\n       (ii) as part of the review conducted to prepare an annual \n     report under this section, the Chief Financial Officer of the \n     Department of Labor, giving due consideration to the audit \n     conducted under subsection (h), determines that if any \n     additional claims are resolved, the Fund will not have \n     sufficient non-taxpayer resources and borrowing authorized \n     under section 221when needed to pay 100 percent of all \n     resolved claims while also meeting all other obligations of \n     the Fund under this Act, including the payment of--\n\n       (I) debt repayment obligations; and\n       (II) remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of a \n     debtor and the class action trust.\n\n       (B) Remaining obligations.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(ii), the remaining obligations to the asbestos trust of \n     the debtor and the class action trust shall be determined by \n     the Administrator by assuming that, instead of a lump-sum \n     payment, such trust had transferred its assets to the Fund on \n     an annual basis, taking into consideration relevant factors, \n     including the most recent projections made by the trust's \n     actuary before the date of enactment of this Act of the \n     amount and timing of future claim payments and administrative \n     and operating expenses.\n       (2) Effective date of termination.--A termination under \n     paragraph (1) shall take effect 180 days after the date of a \n     determination of the Administrator under paragraph (1) and \n     shall apply to all asbestos claims that have not been \n     resolved by the Fund as of the date of the determination.\n       (3) Resolved claims.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, all resolved claims shall be paid in full by \n     the Fund.\n       (4) Extinguished claims.--A claim that is extinguished \n     under the statute of limitations provisions in section 113(b) \n     is not revived at the time of sunset under this subsection.\n       (5) Continued funding.--If a termination takes effect under \n     this subsection, participants will still be required to make \n     payments as provided under subtitles A and B of title II. If \n     the full amount of payments required by title II is not \n     necessary for the Fund to pay claims that have been resolved \n     as of the date of termination, pay the Fund's debt and \n     obligations to the asbestos trusts and class action trust, \n     and support the Fund's continued operation as needed to pay \n     such claims, debt, and obligations, the Administrator may \n     reduce such payments. Any such reductions shall be allocated \n     among participants in approximately the same proportion as \n     the liability under subtitles A and B of title II.\n       (6) Sunset claims.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph--\n       (i) the term ``sunset claims'' means claims filed with the \n     Fund, but not yet resolved, when this Act has terminated; and\n       (ii) the term ``sunset claimants'' means persons asserting \n     sunset claims.\n       (B) In general.--If a termination takes effect under this \n     subsection, the applicable statute of limitations for the \n     filing of sunset claims under subsection (h) shall be tolled \n     for any past or pending sunset claimants while such claimants \n     were pursuing claims filed under this Act.

SHORT TITLE;'' in the bill \n     and insert the following:\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Asbestos and Silica Claims \n     Priorities Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Asbestos is a mineral that was widely used before the \n     mid-1970s for insulation, fireproofing, and other purposes.\n       (2) Many American workers were exposed to asbestos, \n     especially during the Second World War.\n       (3) Long-term exposure to asbestos has been associated with \n     mesothelioma and lung cancer, as well as with such non-\n     malignant conditions as asbestosis, pleural plaques, and \n     diffuse pleural thickening.\n       (4) Although the use of asbestos has dramatically declined \n     since 1980 and workplace exposures have been regulated since \n     1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     the diseases caused by asbestos often have long latency \n     periods and past exposures will continue to result in \n     significant claims well into the future.\n       (5) Asbestos related claims, driven largely by unimpaired \n     claimants, have flooded our courts such that the United \n     States Supreme Court has characterized the situation as ``an \n     elephantine mass'' that ``calls for national legislation'' \n     (Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corporation, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 2302 \n     (1999).\n       (6) The American Bar Association supports enactment of \n     Federal legislation that would allow persons alleging non-\n     malignant asbestos-related disease claims to file a cause of \n     action in Federal or State court only if those persons meet \n     the medical criteria in the ``ABA Standard for Non-Malignant \n     Asbestos-Related Disease Claims'' and toll all applicable \n     statutes of limitations until such time as the medical \n     criteria in such standard are met.\n       (7) Reports indicate that up to 90 percent of asbestos \n     claims are filed by individuals who allege that they have \n     been exposed to asbestos, but who suffer no demonstrable \n     asbestos-related impairment. Lawyer-sponsored x-ray \n     screenings of workers at occupational locations are used to \n     amass large numbers of claimants, the vast majority of whom \n     are unimpaired.\n       (8) The costs of compensating unimpaired claimants and \n     litigating their claims jeopardizes the ability of defendants \n     to compensate people with cancer and other serious diseases, \n     threatens the savings, retirement benefits, and jobs of \n     current and retired employees, and adversely affects the \n     communities in which the defendants operate.\n       (9) More than 73 companies have declared bankruptcy due to \n     the burden of asbestos litigation. The rate of asbestos-\n     driven bankruptcies is accelerating. Between 2000 and 2004, \n     there were more asbestos-related bankruptcy filings than in \n     either of the prior 2 decades.\n       (10) Bankruptcies have led plaintiffs and their lawyers to \n     expand their search for solvent peripheral defendants. The \n     number of asbestos defendants now includes over 8,500 \n     companies, affecting many small and medium size companies and \n     industries that span 85 percent of the United States economy.\n       (11) Efforts to address asbestos litigation may augment \n     silica-related filings.\n       (12) Silica is a naturally occurring mineral and is the \n     second most common constituent of the earth's crust. \n     Crystalline silica in the form of quartz is present in sand, \n     gravel, soil, and rocks.\n       (13) Silica-related illness, including silicosis can \n     develop from the inhalation of respirable silica dust. \n     Silicosis was widely recognized as an occupational disease \n     many years ago.\n       (14) Silica claims, like asbestos claims, often involve \n     individuals with no demonstrable impairment. Claimants \n     frequently are identified through the use of interstate, for-\n     profit, screening companies.\n       (15) Silica screening processes have been found subject to \n     substantial abuse and potential fraud in Federal silica \n     litigation (In re Silica Prods. Liab. Litig. (MDL No. 1553), \n     398 F. Supp. 2d 563 (S.D. Tex. 2005)) and it therefore is \n     necessary to address silica legislation to preempt an \n     asbestos-like litigation crisis.\n       (16) Concerns about statutes of limitations may prompt \n     unimpaired asbestos and silica claimants to bring lawsuits \n     prematurely to protect against losing their ability to assert \n     a claim in the future should they develop an impairing \n     condition.\n       (17) Sound public policy requires that the claims of \n     persons with no present physical impairment from asbestos or \n     silica exposure, be deferred to give priority to physically \n     impaired claimants, and to safeguard the jobs, benefits, and \n     savings of workers in affected companies.\n       (18) Claimant consolidations, joinders, and similar \n     procedures used by some courts to deal with the mass of \n     asbestos and silica cases can--\n       (A) undermine the appropriate functioning of the court \n     system;\n       (B) deny due process to plaintiffs and defendants; and\n       (C) further encourage the filing of thousands of cases by \n     exposed persons who are not sick and likely will never \n     develop an impairing condition caused by exposure to asbestos \n     or silica.\n       (19) Several states have enacted legislation to prioritize \n     asbestos and silica claims that serve as a model for national \n     reform including Texas, Ohio, Florida, and Georgia.\n       (20) Asbestos litigation, if left unchecked by reasonable \n     congressional intervention, will--\n       (A) continue to inhibit the national economy and run \n     counter to plans to stimulate economic growth and the \n     creation of jobs;\n       (B) threaten the savings, retirement benefits, and \n     employment of defendant's current and retired employees;\n       (C) affect adversely the communities in which these \n     defendants operate; and\n       (D) impair interstate commerce and national initiatives.\n       (21) The public interest and the interest of interstate \n     commerce requires deferring the claims of exposed persons who \n     are not sick in order to--\n       (A) preserve, now and for the future, defendants' ability \n     to compensate people who develop cancer and other serious \n     asbestos-related injuries; and\n       (B) safeguard the jobs, benefits, and savings of American \n     workers and the well-being of the national economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) give priority to current claimants who can demonstrate \n     an asbestos-related or silica-related impairment based on \n     reasonable, objective medical criteria;\n       (2) toll the running of statutes of limitations for persons \n     who have been exposed to asbestos or to silica, but who have \n     no present asbestos-related or silica-related impairment; and\n       (3) enhance the ability of the courts to supervise and \n     control asbestos and silica litigation.\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (F) the stay or dismissal would not result in unreasonable \n     duplication or proliferation of litigation.\n       (3) Waiver of statute of limitations defense.--A trial \n     court may not abate or dismiss a claim under this subsection \n     until a defendant files with the court, or with the clerk of \n     the court, a written stipulation that, with respect to a new \n     action on such claim commenced by the plaintiff, the \n     defendant waives the right to assert a statute of limitations \n     defense in all other States, districts, or divisions in which \n     such claim was not barred by limitations at the time such \n     claim was filed in the State where such claim was originally \n     filed as necessary to effect a tolling of the limitations \n     periods in those States --\n       (A) beginning on the date such claim was originally filed; \n     and\n       (B) ending on the date--\n       (i) such claim is dismissed; or\n       (ii) an abatement period of 1 year ends.\n       (4) Court duties.--A court may not abate or dismiss a claim \n     under paragraph (3) until a defendant files with the court, \n     or with the clerk of the court, a written stipulation that, \n     with respect to a new action on such claim commenced by the \n     plaintiff in another State, district, or division, that the \n     claimant and the defendant may--\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\n       (A) rely on responses to discovery already provided under \n     the rules of civil procedure of the State, district, or \n     division in which such claim was originally filed; and\n       (B) rely on any additional discovery that may be conducted \n     under the rules of civil procedure in another State, \n     district, or division.\n       (f) Venue.--\n       (1) In general.--An asbestos or silica claim filed after \n     the date of enactment of this Act may be filed only in the \n     county of the State or the district or division of the United \n     States where--\n       (A) the claimant resided for a period of at least 180 \n     consecutive days immediately prior to filing suit; or\n       (B) the exposed person had the most substantial cumulative \n     exposure to asbestos for an asbestos claim or to silica for a \n     silica claim, and that such exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to the asbestos or silica related \n     impairment on which such claim is based.\n       (2) Improper venue.--With respect to asbestos or silica \n     claims pending as of the date of enactment of this Act, and \n     in which the trial, or any new trial or retrial following \n     motion, appeal, or otherwise, has not commenced with \n     presentation of evidence to the trier of fact as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act, any claim as to which venue would \n     not have been proper if the claim originally had been brought \n     in accordance with paragraph (1) shall, not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, be transferred \n     to the court of general civil jurisdiction in the county, \n     district, or division of the State in which the action is \n     pending in which either--\n       (A) the claimant was domiciled at the time the asbestos or \n     silica claim originally was filed; or\n       (B) the exposed person had the most substantial cumulative \n     exposure to asbestos for an asbestos claim or to silica for a \n     silica claim, and that such exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to the asbestos or silica related \n     impairment on which the claim is based.\n       (3) Removal.--\n       (A) In general.--If a State court refuses or fails to apply \n     the provisions of this Act, any party in a civil action for \n     an asbestos claim may remove such action to a district court \n     of the United States in accordance with chapter 89 of title \n     28, United States Code.\n       (B) Jurisdiction over removed actions.--The district courts \n     of the United States shall have jurisdiction of all civil \n     actions removed under this paragraph, without regard to the \n     amount in controversy and without regard to the citizenship \n     or residence of the parties.\n       (C) Removal by any defendant.--A civil action may be \n     removed to the district court of the United States under this \n     paragraph by any defendant without the consent of all \n     defendants.\n       (D) Remand.--A district court of the United States shall \n     remand any civil action removed solely under this paragraph, \n     unless the court finds that--\n       (i) the State court failed to comply with procedures \n     prescribed by law; or\n       (ii) the failure to dismiss by the State court lacked \n     substantial support in the record before the State court.\n       (E) Limitation.--Civil actions in State court subject to \n     this Act may not be removed to any district court of the \n     United States unless such removal is otherwise proper without \n     regard to the provisions of this Act or is removed under this \n     paragraph.\n       (g) Preemption.--\n       (1) In general.--This Act shall govern all asbestos and \n     silica claims filed in Federal or State courts on or after \n     the effective date of this Act, or which are pending in \n     Federal or State courts on the effective date of this Act and \n     in which the trial, or any new trial or retrial following \n     motion, appeal or otherwise, has not commenced with \n     presentation of evidence to the trier of fact as of the \n     effective date of this Act, except for enforcement of claims \n     for which a final judgment has been duly entered by a court \n     and that is no longer subject to any appeal or judicial \n     review on the effective date of this Act.\n       (2) Greater limitations by states.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall limit or preempt any State law or precedent having the \n     effect of imposing additional or greater limits or \n     restrictions on the assertion or prosecution of an asbestos \n     or silica claim.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. CORNYN proposed an amendment to amendment SA 2748 \nproposed by Mr. Cornyn (for himself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nEnsign, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Martinez, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Thune, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Smith, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Sununu, Mr. \nChambliss, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Hagel) to the bill S. 852, to create a \nfair and efficient system to resolve claims of victims for bodily \ninjury caused by asbestos exposure, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n     This Act may be cited as the ``Asbestos and Silica Claims \n     Priorities Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Asbestos is a mineral that was widely used before the \n     mid-1970s for insulation, fireproofing, and other purposes.\n       (2) Many American workers were exposed to asbestos, \n     especially during the Second World War.\n       (3) Long-term exposure to asbestos has been associated with \n     mesothelioma and lung cancer, as well as with such non-\n     malignant conditions as asbestosis, pleural plaques, and \n     diffuse pleural thickening.\n       (4) Although the use of asbestos has dramatically declined \n     since 1980 and workplace exposures have been regulated since \n     1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \n     the diseases caused by asbestos often have long latency \n     periods and past exposures will continue to result in \n     significant claims well into the future.\n       (5) Asbestos related claims, driven largely by unimpaired \n     claimants, have flooded our courts such that the United \n     States Supreme Court has characterized the situation as ``an \n     elephantine mass'' that ``calls for national legislation'' \n     (Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corporation, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 2302 \n     (1999).\n       (6) The American Bar Association supports enactment of \n     Federal legislation that would allow persons alleging non-\n     malignant asbestos-related disease claims to file a cause of \n     action in Federal or State court only if those persons meet \n     the medical criteria in the ``ABA Standard for Non-Malignant \n     Asbestos-Related Disease Claims'' and toll all applicable \n     statutes of limitations until such time as the medical \n     criteria in such standard are met.\n       (7) Reports indicate that up to 90 percent of asbestos \n     claims are filed by individuals who allege that they have \n     been exposed to asbestos, but who suffer no demonstrable \n     asbestos-related impairment. Lawyer-sponsored x-ray \n     screenings of workers at occupational locations are used to \n     amass large numbers of claimants, the vast majority of whom \n     are unimpaired.\n       (8) The costs of compensating unimpaired claimants and \n     litigating their claims jeopardizes the ability of defendants \n     to compensate people with cancer and other serious diseases, \n     threatens the savings, retirement benefits, and jobs of \n     current and retired employees, and adversely affects the \n     communities in which the defendants operate.\n       (9) More than 73 companies have declared bankruptcy due to \n     the burden of asbestos litigation. The rate of asbestos-\n     driven bankruptcies is accelerating. Between 2000 and 2004, \n     there were more asbestos-related bankruptcy filings than in \n     either of the prior 2 decades.\n       (10) Bankruptcies have led plaintiffs and their lawyers to \n     expand their search for solvent peripheral defendants. The \n     number of asbestos defendants now includes over 8,500 \n     companies, affecting many small and medium size companies and \n     industries that span 85 percent of the United States economy.\n       (11) Efforts to address asbestos litigation may augment \n     silica-related filings.\n       (12) Silica is a naturally occurring mineral and is the \n     second most common constituent of the earth's crust. \n     Crystalline silica in the form of quartz is present in sand, \n     gravel, soil, and rocks.\n       (13) Silica-related illness, including silicosis can \n     develop from the inhalation of respirable silica dust. \n     Silicosis was widely recognized as an occupational disease \n     many years ago.\n       (14) Silica claims, like asbestos claims, often involve \n     individuals with no demonstrable impairment. Claimants \n     frequently are identified through the use of interstate, for-\n     profit, screening companies.\n       (15) Silica screening processes have been found subject to \n     substantial abuse and potential fraud in Federal silica \n     litigation (In re Silica Prods. Liab. Litig. (MDL No. 1553), \n     398 F. Supp. 2d 563 (S.D. Tex. 2005)) and it therefore is \n     necessary to address silica legislation to preempt an \n     asbestos-like litigation crisis.\n       (16) Concerns about statutes of limitations may prompt \n     unimpaired asbestos and silica claimants to bring lawsuits \n     prematurely to protect against losing their ability to assert \n     a claim in the future should they develop an impairing \n     condition.\n       (17) Sound public policy requires that the claims of \n     persons with no present physical impairment from asbestos or \n     silica exposure, be deferred to give priority to physically \n     impaired claimants, and to safeguard the jobs, benefits, and \n     savings of workers in affected companies.\n       (18) Claimant consolidations, joinders, and similar \n     procedures used by some courts to deal with the mass of \n     asbestos and silica cases can--\n       (A) undermine the appropriate functioning of the court \n     system;\n       (B) deny due process to plaintiffs and defendants; and\n       (C) further encourage the filing of thousands of cases by \n     exposed persons who are not sick and likely will never \n     develop an impairing condition caused by exposure to asbestos \n     or silica.\n       (19) Several states have enacted legislation to prioritize \n     asbestos and silica claims that serve as a model for national \n     reform including Texas, Ohio, Florida, and Georgia.\n       (20) Asbestos litigation, if left unchecked by reasonable \n     congressional intervention, will--\n       (A) continue to inhibit the national economy and run \n     counter to plans to stimulate economic growth and the \n     creation of jobs;\n       (B) threaten the savings, retirement benefits, and \n     employment of defendant's current and retired employees;\n       (C) affect adversely the communities in which these \n     defendants operate; and\n       (D) impair interstate commerce and national initiatives.\n       (21) The public interest and the interest of interstate \n     commerce requires deferring the claims of exposed persons who \n     are not sick in order to--\n       (A) preserve, now and for the future, defendants' ability \n     to compensate people who develop cancer and other serious \n     asbestos-related injuries; and\n       (B) safeguard the jobs, benefits, and savings of American \n     workers and the well-being of the national economy.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) give priority to current claimants who can demonstrate \n     an asbestos-related or silica-related impairment based on \n     reasonable, objective medical criteria;\n       (2) toll the running of statutes of limitations for persons \n     who have been exposed to asbestos or to silica, but who have \n     no present asbestos-related or silica-related impairment; and\n       (3) enhance the ability of the courts to supervise and \n     control asbestos and silica litigation.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Any verification that includes a \n     conclusion which states that the medical findings and \n     impairment are consistent or compatible with silica exposure \n     or silica-related disease does not meet the requirements of \n     this subsection.\n       (G) Copies of--\n       (i) the B-reading, pulmonary function tests (including \n     printouts of the flow volume loops, volume time curves, DLCO \n     graphs, and data for all trials, and all other elements \n     required to demonstrate compliance with the equipment, \n     quality, interpretation, and reporting standards established \n     in this Act);\n       (ii) lung volume tests;\n       (iii) reports of x-ray examinations and diagnostic imaging \n     of the chest;\n       (iv) pathology reports; and\n       (v) any other testing reviewed by the diagnosing, qualified \n     physician in reaching the physician's conclusions.\n       (h) Prima Facie Evidence of Physical Impairment for Silica-\n     Related Cancer.--\n       (1) In general.--No person shall bring or maintain a silica \n     claim related to an alleged silica-related cancer in the \n     absence of a prima facie showing of a primary cancer for \n     which exposure to the defendant's silica is a substantial \n     contributing factor.\n       (2) Prima facie showing.--A prima facie showing under \n     paragraph (1) shall be made as to each defendant and include \n     a detailed narrative medical report and diagnosis by a \n     qualified physician that includes:\n       (A) Evidence verifying that the diagnosing, qualified \n     physician has taken a detailed occupational and exposure \n     history from the exposed person or, if that person is \n     deceased, from a person who is knowledgeable about the \n     exposures that form the basis for the claim, including \n     identification of--\n       (i) all of the exposed person's places of employment and \n     exposure to airborne contaminants (including silica and other \n     disease-causing dusts, mists, fumes, and airborne \n     contaminants) that can cause pulmonary impairment; and\n       (ii) the nature, duration, and level of each such exposure.\n       (B) Evidence verifying that the diagnosing, qualified \n     physician has taken a detailed medical and smoking history \n     from the exposed person (or if the exposed person is \n     deceased, from the person most knowledgeable of that \n     history), including a thorough review of--\n       (i) the exposed person's past and present medical problems; \n     and\n       (ii) the most probable cause of each such medical problem.\n       (C) A determination by the diagnosing, qualified physician \n     that the claimant has--\n       (i) an ILO quality 1 chest x-ray (or a quality 2 chest x-\n     ray if the exposed person is deceased and a quality 1 chest \n     x-ray does not\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\n     exist) read by a certified B-reader as showing, according to \n     the ILO scale, bilateral predominantly nodular opacities (p, \n     q, or r) occurring primarily in the upper lung fields, graded \n     1/1 or higher;\n       (ii) an ILO quality 1 chest X-ray (or a quality 2 chest X-\n     ray if the exposed person is deceased and a quality 1 chest \n     X-ray does not exist) read by a certified B-reader as \n     showing, according to the ILO scale, A, B, or C sized \n     opacities representing complicated silicosis (also known as \n     progressive massive fibrosis); or\n       (iii) a pathological demonstration of classic silicotic \n     nodules exceeding 1 centimeter in diameter as set forth in \n     112 Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine 673-720 \n     (1988).\n       (D) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate--\n       (i) that at least 15 years have elapsed since the exposed \n     person's first exposure to silica; and\n       (ii) the date of any such diagnosis of the cancer.\n       (E) Verification that the diagnosing, qualified physician \n     has concluded that the exposed person's impairment was not \n     more probably the result of causes other than silica exposure \n     as revealed by the employment, medical, and smoking history \n     of the exposed person. Any verification that includes a \n     conclusion which states that the medical findings and \n     impairment are consistent or compatible with silica exposure \n     or silica-related disease does not meet the requirements of \n     this subsection.\n       (F) Copies of--\n       (i) the B-reading, pulmonary function tests (including \n     printouts of the flow volume loops, volume time curves, DLCO \n     graphs, and data for all trials, and all other elements \n     required to demonstrate compliance with the equipment, \n     quality, interpretation, and reporting standards established \n     in this Act);\n       (ii) lung volume tests;\n       (iii) reports of x-ray examinations and diagnostic imaging \n     of the chest;\n       (iv) pathology reports; and\n       (v) any other testing reviewed by the diagnosing, qualified \n     physician in reaching the physician's conclusions.\n       (i) Compliance With Technical Standards.--Evidence relating \n     to physical impairment under this section, including \n     pulmonary function testing and diffusing studies--\n       (1) shall comply with the technical recommendations for \n     examinations, testing procedures, quality assurance, quality \n     control, and equipment in the AMA's Guides to the Evaluation \n     of Permanent Impairment, the most current version of the \n     Official Statements of the American Thoracic Society \n     regarding lung function testing, including general \n     considerations for lung function testing, standardization of \n     spirometry, standardization of the measurement of lung \n     volumes, standardization of the single-breath determination \n     of carbon monoxide uptake in the lung, and interpretative \n     strategies for lung testing in effect at the time of the \n     performance of any examination or test on the exposed person \n     required by this Act;\n       (2) may not be based on testing or examinations that \n     violate any law, regulation, licensing requirement, or \n     medical code of practice of any State in which the \n     examination, test, or screening was conducted; and\n       (3) may not be obtained under the condition that a claimant \n     retains the legal services of an attorney or law firm \n     sponsoring the examination, test, or screening.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) No Presumption at Trial.--Evidence relating to the \n     prima facie showings required under section 4 shall not--\n       (1) create any presumption that a claimant has an asbestos \n     or silica-related injury or impairment; and\n       (2) be conclusive as to the liability of any defendant.\n       (b) Admissibility of Evidence.--No evidence shall be \n     offered at a trial, and a jury shall not be informed of--\n       (1) the granting or denial of a motion to dismiss an \n     asbestos or silica claim under the provisions of this Act; or\n       (2) the provisions of section 4 with respect to what \n     constitutes a prima facie showing of asbestos or silica-\n     related impairment.\n       (c) Discovery.--Until such time as a trial court enters an \n     order determining that a claimant has established prima facie \n     evidence of impairment, no asbestos or silica claim shall be \n     subject to discovery, except discovery--\n       (1) related to establishing or challenging such prima facie \n     evidence; or\n       (2) by order of the trial court upon--\n       (A) motion of 1 of the parties; and\n       (B) for good cause shown.\n       (d) Consolidation.--\n       (1) At trial.--\n       (A) In general.--A court may consolidate for trial any \n     number and type of asbestos or silica claims with the consent \n     of all the parties.\n       (B) Absence of consent.--In the absence of any consent \n     under subparagraph (A), a court may consolidate for trial \n     only asbestos claims or silica claims relating to the same \n     exposed person and members of the household of such exposed \n     person.\n       (2) Class actions.--No class action or any other form of \n     mass aggregation claim filing relating to more than 1 exposed \n     person, except claims relating to the exposed person and \n     members of the household of such exposed person, shall be \n     permitted for asbestos or silica claims.\n       (3) At discovery.--Any decision by a court to consolidate \n     claims under paragraph (1) shall not preclude consolidation \n     of asbestos or silica claim cases by a court order for \n     pretrial or discovery purposes.\n       (e) Forum Non Conveniens.--\n       (1) In general.--Any asbestos or silica claim filed on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, or that is pending \n     on the date of enactment of this Act, but that has not \n     commenced trial or any new trial or retrial following motion, \n     appeal, or otherwise with the presentation of evidence to the \n     trier of fact prior to the date of enactment of this Act, if \n     the court in which the such claim is pending, on written \n     motion of a party, finds that in the interest of justice and \n     for the convenience of the parties a claim or action to which \n     this Act applies would be more properly heard in a forum \n     outside the State, district, or division in which such claim \n     was filed, the court shall--\n       (A) decline to exercise jurisdiction under the doctrine of \n     forum non conveniens; and\n       (B) shall stay or dismiss such claim.\n       (2) Considerations.--In determining whether to grant a \n     motion to stay or dismiss a claim under paragraph (1), a \n     court shall consider whether--\n       (A) an alternate forum exists in which such claim or action \n     may be tried;\n       (B) the alternate forum provides an adequate remedy;\n       (C) maintenance of such claim in the court of the State in \n     which the claim was filed would work a substantial injustice \n     to the moving party;\n       (D) the alternate forum, as a result of the submission of \n     the parties or otherwise, can exercise jurisdiction over all \n     the defendants properly joined to such claim;\n       (E) the balance of the private interests of the parties and \n     the public interest of the State in which such claim was \n     filed predominate in favor of such claim being brought in an \n     alternate forum; and\n       (F) the stay or dismissal would not result in unreasonable \n     duplication or proliferation of litigation.\n       (3) Waiver of statute of limitations defense.--A trial \n     court may not abate or dismiss a claim under this subsection \n     until a defendant files with the court, or with the clerk of \n     the court, a written stipulation that, with respect to a new \n     action on such claim commenced by the plaintiff, the \n     defendant waives the right to assert a statute of limitations \n     defense in all other States, districts, or divisions in which \n     such claim was not barred by limitations at the time such \n     claim was filed in the State where such claim was originally \n     filed as necessary to effect a tolling of the limitations \n     periods in those States --\n       (A) beginning on the date such claim was originally filed; \n     and\n       (B) ending on the date--\n       (i) such claim is dismissed; or\n       (ii) an abatement period of 1 year ends.\n       (4) Court duties.--A court may not abate or dismiss a claim \n     under paragraph (3) until a defendant files with the court, \n     or with the clerk of the court, a written stipulation that, \n     with respect to a new action on such claim commenced by the \n     plaintiff in another State, district, or division, that the \n     claimant and the defendant may--\n       (A) rely on responses to discovery already provided under \n     the rules of civil procedure of the State, district, or \n     division in which such claim was originally filed; and\n       (B) rely on any additional discovery that may be conducted \n     under the rules of civil procedure in another State, \n     district, or division.\n       (f) Venue.--\n       (1) In general.--An asbestos or silica claim filed after \n     the date of enactment of this Act may be filed only in the \n     county of the State or the district or division of the United \n     States where--\n       (A) the claimant resided for a period of at least 180 \n     consecutive days immediately prior to filing suit; or\n       (B) the exposed person had the most substantial cumulative \n     exposure to asbestos for an asbestos claim or to silica for a \n     silica claim, and that such exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to the asbestos or silica related \n     impairment on which such claim is based.\n       (2) Improper venue.--With respect to asbestos or silica \n     claims pending as of the date of enactment of this Act, and \n     in which the trial, or any new trial or retrial following \n     motion, appeal, or otherwise, has not commenced with \n     presentation of evidence to the trier of fact as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act, any claim as to which venue would \n     not have been proper if the claim originally had been brought \n     in accordance with paragraph (1) shall, not later than 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, be transferred \n     to the court of general civil jurisdiction in the county, \n     district, or division of the State in which the action is \n     pending in which either--\n       (A) the claimant was domiciled at the time the asbestos or \n     silica claim originally was filed; or\n       (B) the exposed person had the most substantial cumulative \n     exposure to asbestos for an asbestos claim or to silica for a \n     silica claim, and that such exposure was a substantial \n     contributing factor to the asbestos or silica related \n     impairment on which the claim is based.\n       (3) Removal.--\n       (A) In general.--If a State court refuses or fails to apply \n     the provisions of this Act, any party in a civil action for \n     an asbestos claim may remove such action to a district court\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\n     of the United States in accordance with chapter 89 of title \n     28, United States Code.\n       (B) Jurisdiction over removed actions.--The district courts \n     of the United States shall have jurisdiction of all civil \n     actions removed under this paragraph, without regard to the \n     amount in controversy and without regard to the citizenship \n     or residence of the parties.\n       (C) Removal by any defendant.--A civil action may be \n     removed to the district court of the United States under this \n     paragraph by any defendant without the consent of all \n     defendants.\n       (D) Remand.--A district court of the United States shall \n     remand any civil action removed solely under this paragraph, \n     unless the court finds that--\n       (i) the State court failed to comply with procedures \n     prescribed by law; or\n       (ii) the failure to dismiss by the State court lacked \n     substantial support in the record before the State court.\n       (E) Limitation.--Civil actions in State court subject to \n     this Act may not be removed to any district court of the \n     United States unless such removal is otherwise proper without \n     regard to the provisions of this Act or is removed under this \n     paragraph.\n       (g) Preemption.--\n       (1) In general.--This Act shall govern all asbestos and \n     silica claims filed in Federal or State courts on or after \n     the effective date of this Act, or which are pending in \n     Federal or State courts on the effective date of this Act and \n     in which the trial, or any new trial or retrial following \n     motion, appeal or otherwise, has not commenced with \n     presentation of evidence to the trier of fact as of the \n     effective date of this Act, except for enforcement of claims \n     for which a final judgment has been duly entered by a court \n     and that is no longer subject to any appeal or judicial \n     review on the effective date of this Act.\n       (2) Greater limitations by states.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall limit or preempt any State law or precedent having the \n     effect of imposing additional or greater limits or \n     restrictions on the assertion or prosecution of an asbestos \n     or silica claim.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, over the last several weeks and months, we \nhave run into a situation where executive nominations are brought to \nthe floor, but they are being held up for a final vote for reasons that \nare totally unrelated to those individuals and the positions they seek.\n  It has been done historically to some extent, but it is done in a way \nthat one Member--not necessarily a Democrat or Republican but a Member \nin this body--uses that nomination in some way to focus attention on an \nissue or focus attention on something they need or want. Therefore, it \ncan be very useful leverage for an individual Senator, but it has now \ngotten to the point that it is unfair to that individual. We have \npublic servants who are dedicating their lives and have been nominated \nby the President of the United States for executive positions, and then \nthey are being stopped or held up for this unrelated matter. And, \ntherefore, in a systematic way we were going to address that.\n  Yesterday, on one such event, I filed a cloture motion on the \nnomination of Eric Edelman to be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. \nMr. Edelman had been reported out of the Armed Services Committee on \nJuly 29 of last year, 2005--came out of that Armed Services Committee \nand has been held up by someone on the other side of the aisle since \nthat time.\n  In order to overcome that, I filed a cloture motion to ensure that \nthe Senate was able to act on that nomination. We did that last night. \nThat vote would have occurred tomorrow morning on cloture, and, because \nit is one person holding up Mr. Edelman, we would have gotten cloture \nand then it would have required a rollcall vote.\n  I understand that the other side has agreed to vitiate the cloture \nvote, and has agreed to a voice vote now--this evening--instead of \nrequiring that cloture vote tomorrow and a rollcall vote. Our side \nappreciates that, and I think most Senators appreciate that since the \nvote would have probably been 100 to 0 if we had that vote.\n  What all this means is we will finally be able to move forward on a \nnomination, and we are not going to have to have a vote tomorrow. Some \nof my colleagues have said that we are expecting a vote tomorrow, and \nyou are going to have a vote that we need to have the vote. On the \nother hand, since cloture can be vitiated with this unanimous consent, \nwe will go ahead and approve it by a voice vote.\n  The larger issue is we need to systematically address executive \nnominations which are being held up for unrelated reasons.\n  Again, Mr. Edelman came out on July 29, and already we are in early \nFebruary of 2006.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S1044-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF ERIC S.

Mr. President, the Senate has been on the asbestos bill \nsince Monday. Tomorrow, we will complete a full week of debate and \nconsideration of this very important bill which, as has been said again \nand again, is a bill that addresses the fact that 150,000 people have \nlost their jobs, 77 companies have gone bankrupt, and many more are \nlikely to go bankrupt in the future. Most importantly, we have victims \nof asbestos exposure--whether it is lung cancer or mesothelioma--who \nare not being compensated in a timely and appropriate way. It is a \nsystem crying out for reform.\n  Tomorrow, we will not have any rollcall votes, given the earlier \naction we took on the Edelman nomination. We will be continuing debate \nand discussion of the asbestos bill over the course of the day \ntomorrow, Friday.\n  As we look to next week, we will have a busy week as we finish our \nwork for the Presidents Day recess. There will be votes each day next \nweek beginning with Monday as we wrap up our business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/02/09/senate-section/article/S1045-3", "month": "02", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
