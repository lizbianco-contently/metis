I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my \nremarks and the remarks of the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for consideration of Executive Calendar No. 3, Mike \nJohanns, to be Secretary of Agriculture; provided further that there be \n30 minutes of debate under the control of Chairman Chambliss, 15 \nminutes under the control of Senator Harkin, and 15 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Dayton; provided further that at the conclusion of \nthat time the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation and \nnomination with no intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask that the President then be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the consent be modified to delete the time for \nSenator Harkin and Senator Dayton.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe vote on the Johanns nomination, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Executive Calendar No. 2, Margaret Spellings, to be \nSecretary of Education; provided further that there be 45 minutes of \ndebate under the control of Chairman Enzi, 15 minutes under the control \nof Senator Kennedy, 10 minutes under the control of Senator Lautenberg, \n10 minutes under the control of Senator Wyden, and 10 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Dodd; provided further that at the conclusion of \nthat time the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination with no intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask that the President then be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that the consent be modified to have Senator Kennedy \nhave Senator Lautenberg's time if Senator Lautenberg does not claim it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the modified \nconsent?\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask further consent that at 3 p.m. on \nMonday, January 24, the Senate proceed to executive session for the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 1, Carlos Gutierrez, to be Secretary of \nCommerce; provided further that there be 2 hours of debate on the \nnomination, 1 hour under the control of Chairman Stevens and 1 hour \nunder the control of Senator Dorgan; further, that at the conclusion of \nthat time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask that the President then be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that today, \nfollowing the confirmation of the Spellings nomination, the Senate \nproceed to the confirmation of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of \nState; provided further that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided \nin the usual form, and that following that debate the Senate proceed to \na vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \nSenators who have been engaged in matters relating to what is going on \naround the world who, for the confirmation of the Secretary of State, \nwish to be able to speak. We have squeezed the time in as closely as we \ncould, and we have 4\\1/2\\ hours we need on our side. This has been \nexplained to the Republican leadership.\n  We would, of course, be willing to move forward on that tonight and \ntomorrow, but there are the inaugural festivities, and we all \nunderstand that. It certainly does not seem untoward in any way that \nthe Senators have some time to speak before this most important \nnomination, and I say as a matter of passing, at the White House today \nI had a fine conversation with Condoleezza Rice, and she said her main \ngoal was to make sure she was confirmed by the time the President gave \nhis State of the Union speech because she had a trip scheduled to go \noverseas after that. This confirmation will take place, at the latest, \nsometime Wednesday. So she will be able to make that with a lot of time \nto spare. So I object.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, some of us were just at a luncheon \nwhere I had a chance to speak with the current Secretary of State who \nis anxious to get back to tinkering with his cars. So he will note that \nobjection with some regret.\n  As I indicated, we anticipated an objection. Senator Reid had \nindicated there would be a problem on that side for any amount of \ndebate we would have today or tomorrow, so therefore I ask that on \nTuesday, January 25, at a time determined by the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the consideration of the Rice nomination; \nprovided further that during Tuesday's session there be 9 hours of \ndebate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  I further ask consent that when the Senate resumes the nomination on \nWednesday, January 26, there be an additional 40 minutes of closing \nremarks equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  Finally, I ask that following that debate, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action \nor debate, and that after the vote the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I was wondering if my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, has any time within that time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could, I ask the consent be modified to \nreflect the speakers for the Democrats at this time: Senator Byrd, 1 \nhour; Senator Boxer, 1 hour; Senator Reed of Rhode Island, 30 minutes; \nSenator Durbin, 30 minutes; Senator Kerry, 20 minutes; Senator Levin, \n15 minutes; Senator Kennedy, 15 minutes; Senator Lieberman, 10 minutes; \nSenator Corzine, 10 minutes; Senator Salazar, 10 minutes; Senator \nFeinstein, 10 minutes.\n  I would say to all my colleagues, we have only 5 minutes left, so \nthere would be no additional time but for the fact that Senator Boxer \nhas indicated she likely will not use her whole hour. She is always \nmost courteous with other Senators, and she will be happy to give some \nof that time on Tuesday to other Senators, if necessary.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the acting majority whip \nmodify that request?\n  Mr. REID. I ask to modify that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to modifying the \nconsent? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to the acting leader. Senator Biden has \nindicated he is going to get 20 minutes, but he is going to speak in \nfavor of the nomination. He said he could get that from Senator Lugar.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S78-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S78]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go to executive session and proceed to the nomination \nof Mike Johanns.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Mike Johanns, of \nNebraska, to be Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield as much time as he may consume to my colleague \nfrom Kansas, the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee \nunder whom I served, my dear friend, Pat Roberts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, and, I might add, the new chairman of the committee, for \nyielding this time to me. I look forward to working with him. On behalf \nof the man whose job it is to feed America in a troubled and hungry \nworld, we could not have made a better choice--I am using the editorial \n``we''--for a man to lead the Senate Agriculture Committee. He brings \nto the job extensive experience and commitment to represent not only \nthe producers of Georgia but those all throughout the Nation. So I \nthank the Chairman. I look forward to working with him.\n  I rise today to speak on the nomination of Governor Michael Johanns \nof Nebraska to serve as the next Secretary of Agriculture. But first I \nwould like to thank our outgoing Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary \nAnn Veneman. Ann has been a longtime and dear personal friend of mine. \nWhile she now has accepted a new challenge as head of UNICEF; that is, \nthe United Nations Children's Fund, I want to personally thank her for \nthe 4 years of service she has given to this Nation. Her steadfastness \non behalf of agriculture was inspiring to us all. So to Ann Veneman: A \njob well done.\n  Her legacy will be her commitment to trade and food and agricultural \nsecurity, which is in the best interest of all Americans. On her watch \nshe dealt\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\nwith some of the most difficult issues any Secretary could ever face: \nfirst, a threat of foot and mouth disease almost as soon as she took \noffice, later followed by BSE issues and the introduction of something \ncalled Asian soybean rust, which is a very severe problem. She handled \nall of these problems well. And she also established a plant and animal \ndisease monitoring system. Again, that will be her legacy.\n\n  I also wish Governor Johanns all the best as he becomes our new \nSecretary of Agriculture. It will not be an easy job, and he knows \nthat. Secretary Johanns will be forced to confront many of the same \nissues Secretary Veneman faced. He will face food safety and security \nsurprises that will make it all the more important to continue to \nprotect the safety and security of our food supply and the agricultural \nsector.\n  He will also face challenges with regard to budget pressures, the \nfarm bill reauthorization, and also continued competition--I want to \nemphasize this--if not an outright ambush to U.S. farm programs through \nthe World Trade Organization. That is going to be a very big challenge \nto all of us.\n  Mike Johanns is up to and qualified for this task. I had the pleasure \nto visit at length with the Governor prior to his confirmation hearing. \nI attended the entire hearing. Actually, I had the gavel when we moved \nthe nomination. Knowing the Governor from a neighboring State, I can \ntell you he has a passion for this job. He has committed to do well on \nbehalf of our farmers, ranchers, food safety, and our nutrition \nprograms.\n  The Department of Agriculture is an immense agency, and he is well \nqualified for this task. He was raised on a farm. He understands \nagriculture. Most important, he is someone who will be a bully pulpit \nchampion, if you will, for production agriculture. He is the type who \nwill certainly be willing to sit on the wagon tongue with the farmers \nand ranchers, asking for their advice and their suggestions.\n  I have heard many stories from the Kansas producers on the northern \nborders of Kansas who have told me of crossing the border to Nebraska, \nnot for a football game but simply on business, walking into the local \ncoffee shop, and there they would run into Governor Johanns and he \nwould be carrying on the coffee shop conversations with his farmers. \nThis is the kind of man we want in this position.\n  President Bush has picked an outstanding candidate in nominating Mike \nJohanns, the former Governor of Nebraska. I look forward to working \nwith him. I urge my colleagues to support the swift approval of his \nnomination.\n  I again thank the distinguished chairman and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his very kind \ncomments and also for his support of the nomination of Governor \nJohanns. I, of course, rise to support that nomination by the President \nof the United States of Governor Michael Johanns of Nebraska to serve \nas Secretary of Agriculture.\n  I, too, want to first thank our outgoing Secretary, Ann Veneman, for \nthe great job she has done. She has faced some very serious challenges \nover the last 4 years. I have continually pointed out to folks involved \nin agriculture, as I have spoken to groups around the country, the \nterrific job she personally as well as her Department did relative to \nthe potential BSE issue that arose in the northwestern part of our \ncountry several months ago.\n  I thought it was a prime example of the difference in the way our \nsystem works, particularly under APHIS, which is an organization that \ndoes exactly what it is supposed to do, and that is to make sure \nanimals are inspected in an appropriate way before they come into the \nUnited States, versus countries that simply do not have in place the \nmechanisms that we do to try to prohibit this very terrible disease \nfrom spreading among livestock. I thought Secretary Veneman herself, by \nengaging immediately on this issue, showed strong leadership. I believe \nit was because of that that this issue faded very quickly, as it should \nhave.\n  Following September 11, we have had a continuing issue of food \nsecurity. We have been very fortunate, but I believe it is more than \nthat. It is a situation where we have had strong leadership in USDA, \nunder Secretary Veneman, that has been on top of the issue of food \nsafety. As a result of that strong leadership, we have not encountered \na potential terrorist attack on our food system.\n  I compliment her for the great leadership she has shown. She was \nwilling to come to my State early on in her tenure. Having grown up and \nbeen involved in a peach farm in California, she particularly \nappreciated coming to a peach farm in Georgia where, as I told her, we \ngrow much sweeter peaches, but that is always for debate.\n  But she made herself very knowledgeable of southeastern agricultural \nissues, which are a little bit different from California issues. I \nappreciate her from that standpoint. We wish her well in her new \nendeavor, and I know she is going to be very successful there.\n  I want to say on behalf of Governor Johanns that he is \nextraordinarily well prepared and qualified for this new challenge \nwhich the President is giving him.\n  He grew up on a dairy farm in Iowa. He served two terms as mayor of \nLincoln, NB, and he is in his second term as Governor of that State. He \nhas shown outstanding leadership during his tenure as Governor, which \nwill serve him well in managing the diverse and important activities of \nthe Department of Agriculture. As leader of a major agricultural State, \nthe Governor is obviously familiar with the issues that are important \nto farmers and ranchers.\n  He has been a leader in the Western Governors Association on drought \nissues, and has led five trade missions to expand overseas markets for \nAmerican agricultural products.\n  I want to emphasize that all of us who have been involved in \nagriculture, as I have from the legislative side for the last 10 years, \nknow and understand that the future and survival of the American \nfarmers is their ability to export the finest quality of agricultural \nproducts that are grown anywhere in the world. Those export markets are \ncritical. Governor Johanns brings a particularly unique strength and \nperspective to that aspect of agriculture. I am very pleased about that \nfact.\n  He has also been a leader on other issues that are critical to the \nvery diverse mission of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He has been \na strong voice for rural economic development. He is a past chairman of \nthe Governors Ethanol Coalition, and knows the potential of value-added \nagriculture. He serves as chairman of the Governors Biotechnology \nPartnership, and has fostered electronic government and technology \napplications in his State.\n  On January 6, Governor Johanns appeared for his nomination hearing \nbefore the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry which I \nhave the privilege to chair. For nearly 3 hours he answered questions \non a wide range of subjects, and made a clear and positive impression \non members of the committee. His compassion and understanding of the \nissues was so evident that committee members voted to approve his \nnomination that same day by a unanimous vote of 20 to zero.\n  Today in his inauguration address, the President made a direct \noutreach to all Members of the Senate, and showed a willingness to \ncooperate in a bipartisan way to try to enact positive legislation in \nthis body.\n  I am very proud of the fact that the committee which I chair in a \nvery bipartisan fashion, including the Presiding Officer, voted out \nunanimously the nomination of Governor Johanns.\n  To my ranking member, Tom Harkin, I appreciate his cooperation in \nthis effort. He has been very forthright in his discussions with \nGovernor Johanns, and he has also been very forthright and forceful in \nhis support of Governor Johanns for this nomination.\n  I congratulate the President on his choice to lead the Department of \nAgriculture for the next 4 years.\n  I appreciate Governor Johanns' commitment to continue an outstanding \nrecord of public service, and I recommend to my colleagues that they \nall support his nomination.\n  At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Hagel.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n  I first offer my congratulations to the new chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. We are pleased about Senator Chambliss's new \nassignment and responsibilities. I very much appreciate his taking on \nthese new responsibilities at a time that will be critical for American \nagriculture as we work our way toward the reform bill, as well as \ncentral issues that will face our country directly connected to \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I rise this afternoon to add my congratulations to the President's \nnominee for Secretary of Agriculture, the Nebraska Governor, Mike \nJohanns. I have known Mike Johanns for many years. We have worked very \nclosely over the last few years. He has ably served the State of \nNebraska during a difficult time.\n  As the Agriculture Committee noted in its hearings for Governor \nJohanns, he is eminently qualified. His background is well known. He is \nprepared, and he will be a very effective Secretary.\n  I might add, one of the reasons many of us are so enthusiastic about \nMike Johanns doing this job is that he understands not only American \nagriculture but he understands trade. He understands geopolitical \nstrategic issues that are connected to our agriculture, our economy, \nand trade.\n  He understands that these great issues of our time are woven into the \nsame fabric. They are within the great arc of national interest for \nAmerica. He has the kind of stature and the kind of character that we \nnever see enough of in Washington.\n  For those reasons, and for many others, I am enthusiastic, as are so \nmany of us, about Mike Johanns taking on the job of Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  We will miss him in Nebraska. His steady leadership has brought \nNebraska through a difficult time of deficits, not unlike other States. \nHe has performed not only well but he has built a value-added system \nnot only in our economy but in our government in Nebraska. He will be \nsucceeded by a very able Lieutenant Governor, Dave Heineman, whom we \nalso wish well.\n  As I conclude, I add my thanks to Secretary Veneman's service to our \ncountry and to American agriculture over the last 4 years. She too has \nhad to deal with many of the uncontrollables that are part of that \nportfolio--a difficult job. She deserves recognition for the kind of \njob she has done. She has done it just as Mike Johanns will do his \njob--with class, with dignity, always reaching out to others, as well \nas working closely with the Congress.\n  The last point I will make is whatever was said by the Senator from \nKansas about Nebraska football is not to be taken seriously.\n  Other than that, I think my time is up. Thank you, Mr. President. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, we will not ask for bowl scores at this \ntime.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the position of Secretary of Agriculture, \nin my estimation, is one of the most important, yet too often \nunheralded, positions in the Federal Government. Good leadership by the \nSecretary is vitally important in my State of Iowa, where agriculture \nis critical to our economy and we treasure our way of life in small \ntowns and rural communities. Yet no matter where one lives, we all \ndepend on agriculture for food, fiber and, increasingly, for energy and \nother farm-based products. The day-to-day responsibilities of the \nSecretary of Agriculture truly touch the lives of every American as \nwell as millions of others around the world.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate Governor Michael Johanns of \nNebraska on his confirmation to be the next Secretary of Agriculture. I \nhave spoken with Governor Johanns in some depth on several occasions \nand believe he has the qualities and potential to be a very good \nSecretary. I might add, his Iowa pedigree is certainly a plus. I also \nthank and commend Secretary Ann Veneman, as she departs, for her good \nwork and her cooperation and communication with me, as well as the same \nbetween our staffs, over the years.\n  As we look ahead to the next 4 years, there are many challenges and \nmany opportunities ahead. We passed a good farm bill in 2002, President \nBush praised it and signed it. For the most part it has been working, \nbut too many of the key initiatives in that bill have suffered from \nmisguided or delayed implementation. Yet even though we stayed within \nour budget in writing the farm bill, since then agriculture and farm \nbill funding has been very damagingly siphoned off. Those budget \nthreats seem certain to intensify. The risks to food safety and \nsecurity from bovine spongiform encephalopathy or other animal and \nplant diseases continue to make headlines. The new Secretary will have \nto deal with some very serious issues many of them very soon.\n  At the same time, we have some great opportunities in agriculture and \nthe rural economy; that is, if only we will seize them. I am encouraged \nthat Governor Johanns understands the importance of capitalizing on \nthese opportunities, specifically value-added agriculture spanning the \nrange from pork and beef to the great potential to produce energy and \nbiobased products from farm fields across the country.\n  For instance, we adopted a provision in the farm bill to require all \nFederal departments and agencies to give a preference to procuring \nbiobased products whenever feasible thus creating a huge potential \nmarket. While USDA has issued final rules to carry out this program, \nnothing will actually be purchased until a list of eligible products is \npublished. I have urged Governor Johanns to move to implement this \nprogram fully and without further delay in order to begin realizing the \neconomic and environmental benefits of this biobased initiative.\n  We also included a very robust conservation title in the 2002 farm \nbill, one that was touted by the president when he signed the bill into \nlaw. Unfortunately, many of those initiatives, including the \nConservation Security Program, have been undermined by funding cuts and \ntoo-often poor execution. I have talked with Governor Johanns about \nthese problems, and I am hopeful that we will work together to fulfill \nthe promise of the farm bill and move forward on these important \nconservation initiatives so that farmers and ranchers have the tools \nthey need to be the best stewards of the land they can be.\n  We also have a history of bipartisan cooperation to meet our \nresponsibilities to alleviate hunger and malnutrition through Federal \nand international food and nutrition assistance. And increasingly, we \nface compelling challenges in improving diets and nutrition in order to \npromote healthier and longer lives.\n  Many other issues important to prosperity and quality of life in \nrural America must be addressed ranging from providing broadband access \nto boosting locally owned businesses and jobs to ensuring opportunities \nfor family-size farms and independent producers.\n  I am optimistic that we can make real progress in addressing these \nand other challenges in food, agriculture and rural issues. I welcome \nGovernor Johanns to Washington, congratulate him on his confirmation as \nthe next Secretary of Agriculture and remind him that my door is always \nopen.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the United States is blessed \nwith an abundance of natural resources and cutting-edge technology that \nleads the world in agriculture. We all agree that the richest resource \nof American agriculture is its people the--farm and ranch families--\nwhose efforts drive the productivity of our Agriculture industry for \nfood, fiber and fuel.\n  American agriculture today is a complex business, very different from \nwhat it was even a decade ago. Adoption of modern technology, improved \nmechanization, and changing methods of production, marketing, and \nfinancing by energetic farmers and ranchers has changed the landscape \nof our rural areas. Our producers, diversified by size and enterprise, \nsupport an economic system that is, without doubt, the envy of the \nworld.\n  It's critical to understand the diversity of American agriculture and \nhow it influences our daily lives--whether we work or we don't work in \nagriculture or whether we live or we don't live on a farm. This is why \nI support the nomination of Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns to lead this \nagency that is responsible for the safety of meat, poultry and egg \nproducts, for opening new markets and reopening those currently closed \nto U.S. agricultural products, for providing food aid to those who have \nthe need, for protecting soil,\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\nwater and wildlife, and for administering food nutrition programs.\n  Governor Johanns' qualifications to lead the Department of \nAgriculture are--at the core--his upbringing and his receptiveness to \nchange and diversification--essential elements for an industry driven \nby ingenuity and fair competition.\n  Nebraska is a world-class leader in producing a high-quality, \nabundant, and affordable food supply. It leads the Nation in total red \nmeat and dry bean production, and is a significant player in the \nproduction of alfalfa hay, corn, grain sorghum, soybeans, winter wheat, \nlivestock, and popcorn.\n  Nearly 8 million acres of Nebraska's field crops benefit from \nirrigation, through approximately 24,000 miles of streams and rivers, \nreservoirs and aquifers. In recent years, the importance of maintaining \nwater quality and quantity in times of severe drought conditions has \nadded to the complexity of agricultural production. Mike Johanns has \ngoverned in these times of great uncertainty and is well aware of the \ncontinuing needs to deal with these most difficult times.\n  Governor Johanns presents a list of qualifications that will be of \nconsiderable benefit not only to Nebraska and the Midwest, but \nthroughout the nation.\n  He is an experienced leader and a strong advocate with solid common \nsense solutions to the difficult questions presented to him. We've \ntalked about the need for a bipartisan approach in this important job \nand I know he agrees how important that will be.\n  I look forward to continue working with Governor Johanns, as \nSecretary of Agriculture to improve drought monitoring and forecasting, \nto advance renewable fuels initiatives increasing the use of ethanol \nand biodiesel in our transportation fuels just to name a few. In \naddition, the opportunity to create new and innovative rural \ndevelopment programs and reverse the trend of out-migration from the \nsmallest communities has never been more important. Today's nominee not \nonly has the leadership experience but he also has the experience of \nhaving worked to develop such programs.\n  Governor Johanns and I have discussed and agree that it is important \nfor the Secretary of Agriculture to work in a bipartisan manner with \nCongress. With a Farm Bill reauthorization effort nearing, I look \nforward to working cooperatively with him to develop a practical \napproach to our national agriculture policy that will support and \npromote our agriculture products and producers. The new Farm Bill \nshould further the goals of consumer safety and confidence in our \nnation's food supply, without compromising the ability of our producers \nto compete--freely and fairly--in the global marketplace.\n  I was pleased to learn of the administration's selection of Mike \nJohanns as the Secretary of Agriculture. I have said repeatedly, and \nbelieve thoroughly, the person who will administer the farm bill and \nbuild for the future of agriculture in America needs to be somebody \nwith Midwestern agricultural experience. Governor Johanns has that kind \nof experience and that perspective and in my opinion will serve the \nadministration and the country well.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today the Senate is expected to confirm \nthe nomination of Governor Michael Johanns of Nebraska to be the next \nSecretary of Agriculture.\n  As we vote on this nomination, we should all recognize just how \nimportant this position is to America's farmers and ranchers. Beyond \nthat, the Secretary's responsibilities touch the lives of every \nAmerican consumer as well as millions of people overseas. This is a \npoint that is being made daily as we seek to provide the needed food \naid and assistance to those who have suffered such terrible losses as a \nresult of the recent tsunami.\n  There isn't any question that American agriculture faces significant \nchallenges on many fronts. It is incumbent upon all of us to be the \nstrongest advocates we can be for our producers and their communities. \nHowever, the Secretary of Agriculture is unique. The Secretary must \nprovide national leadership and advocacy to promote a greater \nunderstanding of the important role our agricultural producers play in \nour own society and the world.\n  The Secretary's role must be more than just the spokesperson for the \nadministration on agricultural issues. In fact, I believe that one of \nthe most important responsibilities of this position is to be an \nadvocate within the administration to ensure our producers, consumers \nand rural communities are not short-changed in the domestic and \ninternational policy and political processes.\n  Governor Johanns will have a very big job as we confront the \npressures that are being placed on agriculture as a result of the \nbudget deficit, weather related disasters, increased food safety and \nbio-terrorism concerns, environmental issues and opportunities related \nto agriculture, the economic development needs in rural America, and \nthe level of insecurity that an increasing number of farmers, ranchers \nand rural main street businesses are feeling as a result of \nglobalization.\n  I am hopeful our new Secretary of Agriculture will provide the \nleadership necessary to address these issues in a way that advances the \ninterests of all agricultural sectors while enhancing the appreciation \nof Americans for our agricultural heritage.\n  Two weeks ago I supported the action of the Senate Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry Committee to advance this nomination to the full \nSenate with a positive recommendation. Today I offer my support for the \naction the Senate is about to take in confirming Governor Michael \nJohanns as our next Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Governor Mike Johanns as the Secretary of Agriculture. As the \nGovernor of Nebraska, and a fellow Midwesterner, Johanns has a strong \nbackground in agriculture and is well suited for the role of Secretary \nof Agriculture.\n  I was able to meet with Governor Johanns yesterday and I was very \nimpressed with his view on the future of agriculture, food safety and \nrural issues. The next four years are going to be an important time as \nwe face the reauthorization of the farm bill, food safety concerns, \nnutrition and trade.\n  Agriculture is important to my home State of Illinois. Illinois is \none of our country's most important agricultural contributors. Illinois \nfarm land, which accounts for about 28 million acres, is considered \nsome of the most productive in the world. More than 76,000 farm \nfamilies in the State produce corn, soybeans, wheat, beef, pork, dairy \nproducts, and specialty crops. Illinois is the number one soybean-\nproducing State in the country and number two in corn. Illinois ranks \nsecond nationally in the export of agricultural commodities with nearly \n$4 billion worth of goods shipped to other countries each year. The \nState's agribusiness activity is vibrant. From the Chicago area to \nDecatur and throughout Illinois, agricultural processing employs \nthousands of people. And researchers at the University of Illinois as \nwell as at other institutions, continue to help provide answers to some \nof the most common as well as the most complex, agricultural questions \nwe face.\n  Since Governor Johanns was the past chairman of the Governors' \nEthanol Coalition, I know he sees the potential of value added \nagriculture. Adding values to commodities adds real promise for \nboosting farm income and jobs and economic growth in rural America. \nIllinois ranks second in the nation in corn production, with more than \n1.5 billion bushels produced annually, and is the nation's leading \nsource of clean-burning ethanol. Corn grown in Illinois is used to make \n40% of the ethanol consumed in the United States. In Illinois, roughly \none in every six rows of corn--approximately 280 million bushels--is \nthe source for ethanol.\n  As the Secretary of Agriculture, Governor Johanns will face \nunprecedented challenges in protecting the safety and security of our \nfood supply.\n  The recent discovery of two more cows with BSE, or ``mad cow \ndisease,'' in Canada reminds us that we cannot ignore the threat of \nBSE. We must shore up the firewalls that prevent BSE from spreading in \nthis country, to give American consumers confidence that the beef they \nfeed to their families is safe to eat.\n  We need a scientifically sound testing program that will tell us \nwhether our BSE control efforts are working. A\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nsurveillance program should include older cattle that appear healthy \nbut that can still harbor BSE. Almost a year ago, USDA promised to \ninclude cattle in this population in its surveillance, but still hasn't \nstarted this testing.\n  We must stop feeding cows to other cows, the practice that is thought \nto have led to the spread of mad cow disease in Europe. We have had a \nfeed ban in this country since 1997, but we need to close loopholes in \nthe ban and redouble our efforts to make sure that the ban is being \nfollowed.\n  We must make sure that the parts of cattle that pose the highest risk \nof infection are being correctly and completely removed.\n  Our primary goal should be to protect the health of the public, and \nthe health of the animal herds in the United States.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary-Designate Johanns to make \nsure our nation's BSE prevention and control program earns and deserves \nthe public's confidence.\n  An issue I care deeply about is food safety. When HHS Secretary Tommy \nThompson announced he was stepping down last month, he noted several \nitems of unfinished business that the government must address. Among \nthem, he mentioned the importance of improving the nation's food \nsecurity.\n  Secretary Thompson said that he worries ``every single night'' about \na massive attack on the U.S. food supply. Thompson said: ``I, for the \nlife of me, cannot understand why the terrorists have not, you know, \nattacked our food supply, because it is so easy to do.''\n  If this is not a clear call to action, I don't know what is.\n  I hope to count on Secretary Johanns for support of legislation I \nplan to roll out in the next few weeks that will give the Agriculture \nDepartment and the Food and Drug Administration the tools they need to \nimprove the security of our food supply.\n  My bill would give these agencies authority to oversee implementation \nof food security measures at food processing plants; give these \nagencies the same recall authority over food that agencies like the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission exercise over toys; and improve \ninformation coordination among the food safety agencies to diffuse \npotential threats to the food supply.\n  I also hope Secretary Johanns will be able to see beyond the \nbureaucratic morass that has developed at the agencies charged with the \nsafety of our food and help us move towards making the vision of \ncreating a single agency responsible for food safety a reality.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 76 \nmillion people suffer from food poisoning every year, with children and \nthe elderly suffering a disproportionate amount of the most serious \ncases. We need, at the very least, to improve the coordination of the \nfood agencies' oversight while working towards the goal of developing a \nsingle food safety agency.\n  I would also hope that Johanns plans to play a key role in advising \nthe administration on the appointment of a new food safety chief to \nreplace the outgoing Elsa Murano at the Food Safety and Inspection \nService. We need a person in this important position that has a \ncommitment to food safety over other agricultural interests as the \nagency faces challenges including implementing a strategy to keep Mad \nCow disease out of the country.\n  In my meeting with Governor Johanns I was pleased to hear him mention \ntrade. As I mentioned before, Illinois ranks second nationally in the \nexport of agricultural commodities with nearly $4 billion worth of \ngoods shipped to other countries each year. Japan has closed its \nmarkets to our beef for over a year. We must take a strong position to \nreopen this market. Our trading partners have got to be held \naccountable for dealing with our country in a straightforward way.\n  As the leader of a major agriculture state, Governor Johanns is \nfamiliar with issues of importance to farmers and ranchers. I will \nsupport his nomination as Secretary of Agriculture and look forward to \nworking with him on issues facing the Department of Agriculture.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm the nomination of \nSecretary-Designate Mike Johanns to serve our Nation as United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, Secretary. It is with no small \nobligation or minor imposition that this honor and responsibility fall \nupon Mr. Johanns, as he functions in his best capacity to fairly \nrepresent our varied and diverse regional issues in American \nagriculture. Our national agriculture sector is highly fractionalized \nas States seek to ensure representation for specific commodities and \nFarm Bill programs, and I am concerned, however optimistic, that Mr. \nJohanns will do his due diligence to ensure our South Dakotan and \nplains states interests are well represented at the Federal level and \nby USDA.\n  Of immediate concern is the current status of the beef industry. \nWhile USDA forges ahead with their final rule to allow the importation \nof live Canadian cattle and ruminant products, I am alarmed for the \nimplications on our beef sector and our producers' ability to make the \nbottom line. I am concerned for the inaccessible export markets that \ncontinually seem less reachable with USDA's treatment of this issue. I \nam continually dismayed that USDA appears to place the interests of \nCanadian cattle producers above the interests of domestic producers, \nand I am hopeful that Mr. Johanns will place this issue at the \nforefront of his agenda while assuming his position as Secretary. I am \nhopeful that Mr. Johanns will listen to the voice of the American \nagricultural producer and recognize the immediacy and timeliness of the \nissue.\n  I am optimistic that Mr. Johanns will implement mandatory Country of \nOrigin Labeling, COOL, which, while signed into law by this current \nPresident under this most recent arm Bill, has yet to be implemented. \nIt is with increasing frustration that our producers await the benefits \nof this common sense program, and while it has been no secret that the \nadministration is not favorable toward a mandatory food labeling \nprogram, I am hopeful that Mr. Johanns will honor the voice of Congress \nand of the American producer and move forward with the implementation \nprocess in a reasonable and honorable manner.\n  The business of agriculture is becoming increasingly challenging for \nour small farmers and producers. Market concentration and vertical \nintegration, unreasonable contract obligations, maintaining and \ndeveloping export markets to garner a fair commodity price, and a \nserious disconnect between urban and rural America are driving our \nsmaller farmers out of business on a daily basis. It is with no small \nsense of urgency that I emphasize the need to address these issues. I \nam hopeful, that as promised, Mr. Johanns will maintain an open door \npolicy for members of Congress to discuss these issues and arrive at \nreasonable policy solutions that are valuable and substantive for the \nagriculture producer, in South Dakota and across America.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as the U.S. Congress begins its 109th \nsession, the Senate is performing its constitutional duty of providing \nits advice and consent on the President's nominees for cabinet \npositions.\n  I take the Senate's responsibility to evaluate Presidential \nnominations very seriously. The process is important to ensuring strong \nleadership at the very highest levels of the federal government. It \nalso provides an opportunity for Senators to have focused discussions \nwith nominees on issues of particular importance to their respective \nconstituencies.\n  Today the Senate will confirm several nominees, including the \nnomination of Nebraska Governor Mike Johanns, the President's selection \nto succeed Secretary Veneman at the Department of Agriculture.\n  While I am not a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry, I am confident that Chairman Chambliss, ranking \nmember Harkin and the rest of the committee's members conducted a \nthorough examination of Governor Johanns' record. I will support the \ncommittee's recommendation and vote in favor of his nomination.\n  That being said, I have come to the floor today to express my \nthoughts on two specific agricultural issues that are important to \nWashington state's renowned beef industry: mad cow disease and country \nof origin labeling.\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\n  On December 23, 2003, the first known case of mad cow disease ever \ndiscovered on U.S. soil was found in Washington State. The discovery \nsent a ripple effect across the country as U.S. ranchers watched in \nshock while our trading partners closed their doors to U.S. beef \nexports.\n  An investigation was conducted and DNA tests confirmed that this cow \nlikely originated in a herd from Alberta, Canada, but this was little \nconsolation to consumers here and abroad who immediately began to \nquestion whether U.S. beef was safe to eat.\n  While the exact cause of infection could not be confirmed, it is \nwidely accepted by the science community that this cow became infected \nwhile eating contaminated feed before Canada had implemented its 1997 \nruminant-to-ruminant feed ban.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \nAdministration and U.S. Department of Agriculture responded by \nannouncing a number of new rules to strengthen protections over the \nhuman food. Most importantly, USDA and FDA banned specified risk \nmaterials, such as brain and central nervous system tissues from \nentering the human food supply. These materials have been shown to \npresent the greatest risk of transmitting mad cow disease through \ncattle herds and to humans.\n  Unfortunately, FDA failed to stand firm on its stated commitment to \nclose four specific loopholes in feed regulations, measures that Acting \nFDA Commissioner Crawford made a commitment to do on January 26, 2004 \nand something that I believe was and is necessary to fully ensure the \nsafety of U.S. beef.\n  As we know, feeding ruminant parts back to ruminants represents one \nof the greatest risks of spreading mad cow disease and that's why the \nU.S., like Canada, implemented a rule to ban this practice in 1997. But \nexisting feed loopholes, such as the poultry litter loophole and plate \nwaste loophole allow for the possibility of ruminant materials to find \ntheir way into ruminant feed through cross contamination.\n  To address this possibility, I introduced legislation during the \n108th Congress, entitled the Animal Feed Protection Act, which would \nban these materials from being used in any animal feed. This is \nimportant legislation that will strengthen existing feed rules to help \nmitigate the chance of cross contamination and ensure that ruminant \nmaterials are not accidentally fed to cattle.\n  Although my legislation did not pass last year, I plan to reintroduce \nthe Animal Feed Protection Act for consideration during the 109th \nCongress next week. U.S. beef is arguably the safest in the world, but \neven so, critical export markets including Japan and South Korea still \nremain closed to U.S beef exports. It is imperative that we do \neverything possible to prove to consumers abroad that the measures we \nhave in place to prevent further cases of mad cow are robust and \ncomprehensive.\n  It was reassuring to hear Governor Johanns state, during his \nnomination hearing, that working to regain exports to Japan's market is \npriority number one for the U.S. beef industry.\n  As I know the Governor understands, access to these markets is the \nkey to bringing prosperity back to U.S. cattle producers, feeders, \nprocessors and beef packers. No one understands the importance of the \nJapanese and South Korean markets better than the ranchers in \nWashington state, who exported nearly $250 million of Washington beef \nto these markets in 2003. It is hard to overstate the extent to which \nWashington ranchers and the U.S. beef industry at large continue to \nsuffer from the loss of these exports.\n  Although progress has been made, recent discoveries of mad cow in \nCanada could present a major setback to our ongoing negotiations with \nJapan and South Korea if it is determined that the risk of mad cow in \nCanada has not been adequately addressed.\n  Canada's discoveries of mad cow on January 2 and January 11 came just \ndays after USDA announced a rule recognizing Canada as a minimal-risk \nregion with regard to the mad cow disease.\n  The USDA defends this decision by citing the results of a risk \nanalysis that the agency conducted in 2004. That analysis examined the \nreliability and adequacy of Canada's mad cow firewalls in eradicating \nthis disease in its herds. The agency's analysis determined that Canada \nhad a robust and comprehensive system in place to address all of the \nnecessary risks of transmitting mad cow disease and had implemented \nproper safeguards to ensure the safety of its beef.\n  Thus, the USDA published a minimal risk rule in the January 4, 2005 \nFederal Register. That rule will authorize the reopening of our border \nto the importation of Canadian live cattle under the age of 30 months \nand other beef products from cattle over the age of 30 months beginning \non March 7 of this year.\n  However, Canada's latest discovery of mad cow on January 11 has \nraised serious questions regarding the possibility of non-compliance of \nfeed regulations in Canada and questions as to the reliability of \nCanada's system to enforce its mad cow firewalls. Because the cow was \ndetermined to be less than seven years of age and thus was born after \nCanada implemented its 1997 ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban, many have \nspeculated that non-compliance of feed rules represents the most likely \nsource of this infection.\n  In responding to this discovery, Administrator Ron DeHaven of the \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, announced that the \nagency would expedite sending a technical team to Canada to investigate \nthe circumstances surrounding these recent discoveries.\n  Last Friday, I sent a letter to Secretary Veneman and Governor \nJohanns requesting that this audit being conducted by APHIS inspectors \nbe given time for a full and fair analysis. I think it is prudent for \nthe USDA to provide the time and resources necessary to reach a \ndetermination as to the safety of Canadian beef before we reopen our \nborder to its importation.\n  I believe that USDA must reevaluate reopening the border should \nserious non-compliance of feed regulations or lapses in Canada's \nenforcement of mad cow firewalls be uncovered.\n  Reestablishing the once dominant global market share enjoyed by U.S. \nbeef producers is ultimately about product reliability and consumer \nconfidence.\n  It is vital that we address Canadian safety issues now, so that we \ncan prevent running the risk of importing potentially unsafe products. \nWhile I understand that reopening the border is important to the \nCanadian beef industry, our primary responsibility is to ensure the \nsafety of our food supply here at home.\n  As world markets continue to converge becoming more and more \ninterdependent, securing our domestic food supply requires much more \nwork than it once did. We have an opportunity to aid our consumers by \nimplementing mandatory country of origin labeling.\n  I believe such labeling is important for two major reasons--first, \nthe security of our food supply; and second, the American consumer's \nright-to-know where their food was produced.\n  In 2002, I joined with my Senate colleagues in support of the farm \nbill, which, among other things, required that the USDA implement \nmandatory country of origin labeling standards by 2004. These \nprovisions were supported by a wide margin of members in Congress, \nreceiving nearly two-thirds support in the House. Even so, some who \nhave fought the implementation of mandatory country of origin labeling \nevery step of the way.\n  Last year, Congress decided to push back the date of implementation \nof mandatory labeling until September 2006 on all goods except for fish \nand shellfish. The justification was that we needed to ``reconsider'' \nits economic implications.\n  While I understand that labeling will come with increased costs, I \nbelieve that a failure to establish full accountability as to where our \nfood is coming from could end up costing our consumers, businesses and \ngovernment far more, should tainted beef or other unsafe products enter \nour food supply.\n  Whether in the case of an outbreak of mad cow or a biological \nterrorist plot that infects food imported into our country, we need to \nhave a definite and immediate system to target the source of our food \nand, if necessary, provide the American people a clear way to identify \nthe food and stop consumption.\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\n  The expansion of international agricultural trade has exponentially \nincreased the options available to Americans as they peruse the shelves \nat their local grocery store. Imported foods are grown in widely \nvarying conditions around the world, often in countries with \ndrastically different regulatory contexts that allow the utilization of \npesticides and growing practices which are banned here in the U.S.\n  As I previously stated, I support labeling for the benefits that it \nwill bring to ensuring safety, but also because I believe that American \nconsumers have the right to know where their food comes from. We have \nno control over the methods utilized by other countries to produce \ntheir goods, but we can control whether or not foreign products \nmaintain the information necessary for American consumers to make an \ninformed decision.\n  American consumers must be able to assess information on imported \nproducts to determine whether it is important to them.\n  Today, consumers are increasingly faced with the daunting task of \nsifting through vast amounts of packaging and labeling to obtain the \ninformation most critical to them.\n  Americans, for too long, have been knowingly exposed to foreign \nproducts without being provided with adequate information.\n  The issue of labeling our agricultural products, including beef, \ncomes down to this: Do we want consumers to have confidence--and do we \nwant consumers to have choice? Even though public opinion surveys show \nthat U.S. consumers want to buy american products, those consumers \ndon't always have the information necessary to make that choice.\n  I know that most consumers from my State would much rather buy and \nconsume U.S. beef. This is because it is important to them that they \nare able to rely on the quality of the product and the safety of \nmethods used in its production.\n  It is important to Washingtonians that the beef they purchase comes \nfrom a cow that was fed under American standards for feed safety--beef \nthat had to be processed under strong American standards and beef that \nhas met a set of standards that allows consumers to feel confident of \nits safety and its quality.\n  Some will argue that we already use USDA labels to indicate whether \nbeef is produced in the U.S. however, the grade label from the USDA, \nwhich a lot of consumers might think means that beef was American made, \nis often stamped on packages that contain imported beef mixed in with \njust a small percentage of American beef.\n  Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, cattle and other bulk or non-\nprocessed products must be clearly labeled as to their country of \norigin. However, once those products are brought into the U.S. and \nvalue-added processing occurs, the law does not mandate that \ninformation indicating the country of origin be included on the final \nproducts that ultimately reach the consumer.\n  This is an important issue that Congress must address.\n  Families sitting at the dinner table should not have to wonder about \nwhat went into the food they eat. They should be provided the \ninformation to know what they are consuming. To put it simply, \nconsumers deserve better accountability.\n  Cattlemen in Washington State are proud of the beef they raise and \nare willing to trust their livelihood to the choices made by informed \nAmerican consumers.\n  The USDA stamp should represent the quality and safety of American \nproducts--not a mark that in some instances will mislead consumers into \njust thinking that they are buying American quality. A product's \ncountry of origin should be information that is included all of the way \nfrom the border to the store shelf.\n  Last fall, Craig Grub, a Medical Lake rancher said: ``Consumers \ndeserve to be able to make an educated choice. They should have \nimplemented Mandatory labeling years ago.'' Producers like Mr. Grub \nsupport mandatory county of origin labeling because they understand and \nappreciate the importance of food safety and consumer choice in \nAmerica.\n  Regardless of whether we work through the legislative or rulemaking \nprocesses, I believe that the implementation of a greater standard of \naccountability over imported products is imperative to better ensure \nfood safety for our consumers here at home.\n  There is a lot of work that remains in order for this country to \nachieve this goal and I am confident that Governor Johanns is committed \nto working to this end. I will vote in support of his nomination. I am \neager to begin working with him on reopening Asian markets to U.S. beef \nas well as to collaborate and promote opportunities for all U.S. \nagricultural products abroad.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nGovernor Johanns to be Secretary of Agriculture. I very much look \nforward to working with him on issues of importance to Colorado's rural \ncommunities--its ranchers, farmers, agribusinesses and consumers.\n  I also look forward to putting into action my own experience as a \nfarmer and rancher and learning from the experience and leadership of \nthe Governor from Nebraska, a neighboring State that is struggling with \nmany of the same challenges that Colorado faces.\n  I anticipate that Governor Johanns will be confirmed today, and that \nis as it should be because he has a lot of work waiting for him.\n  I fear that many in the country do not recognize the challenges \nfacing farmers, ranchers and rural towns in Colorado and across America \ntoday. Farming, ranching and agri-related businesses play a vital role \nto rural communities, and it is the job of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and the United States Department of Agriculture to help those \ncommunities preserve this way of life and ensure that it will sustain \nmany more generations of families. Governor Johanns has assured me that \nhe understands this and that as Secretary of Agriculture he will rise \nto meet this challenge.\n  One of the first important challenges that Governor Johanns will have \nto address is the issue of mad cow disease and the Canadian border. The \nGovernor must direct the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, \nthe Food Safety Inspection Service, as well as work with the Food and \nDrug Administration to thoroughly examine and fully understand the \nimplications that reopening the border to Canadian live cattle will \nhave on farmers, ranchers, consumers and agricultural organizations and \nindustries across the U.S.\n  In addition, the Governor will have the challenge of reviewing the \ntestimony and comments of farmers and ranchers, consumers and other \nagricultural industries and organizations whose livelihoods and \nfamilies will be directly impacted by USDA's decision. I look forward \nto the Governor and USDA's review of each of these items and, as a \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, will enjoy our further discussions \non their findings and final decision.\n  Furthermore, this ongoing mad cow issue underscores another challenge \nfor Governor Johanns as well as a matter of vital importance: country-\nof-origin labeling, COOL. American consumers have the right to know \nwhere their food is coming from, and I think that common sense dictates \nthat if we can label where our shirts and socks are made, we can surely \nlabel where our meat and food comes from. I hope that Governor Johanns \nwill work with us to ensure that COOL will go ahead once and for all, \nas passed by law.\n  During Governor Johanns' nomination hearing in the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, he spoke about the need to encourage and explore biotech \nopportunities, open new markets, and provide expanded opportunities for \nproductivity in agriculture. Important value-added initiatives such as \nthese will be an essential factor to ensure a viable future for rural \nareas.\n  Toward that end, early next month the President will release his \nbudget for the upcoming fiscal year. That will provide a good indicator \nof his priorities for rural residents across the country. In last \nyear's budget, the administration cut funding for rural development and \neliminated or severely limited funding for programs to get rural \ncommunities broadband access, promote rural investment and help rural \nfirefighters. Knowing of the Governor's commitment to expand \nopportunities for rural communities, I look forward to his help in \nprotecting important programs such as these.\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n  Earlier this week, I also received written answers to questions I had \nsubmitted to Governor Johanns. While I certainly appreciate Governor \nJohanns' timely reply, I also look forward to hearing more detailed \nanswers on the questions that he did not respond to, including an \nimportant issue to Colorado that has to do with a proposed development \nat the base of a ski area at Wolf Creek Pass.\n  The Governor also spoke of the importance of the spirit of \ncooperation. I agree that we must cooperate to provide our rural \nresidents with increased rural development and sustainable agricultural \nopportunities as well as reasonable commodity supports and eligibility \nguidelines to ensure that federal supports go to the family farmers who \nare the intended beneficiaries. Part and parcel of protecting our \nfamily farmer and rancher is ending the monopolization of the \nmeatpacking industry and helping small, family agri-businesses to \ncompete.\n  Our family farmers, ranchers, and rural business people deserve fair \nfarm, rural development and conservation programs as well as a safe \nfood supply and other policies that help create more successful \ncommunities.\n  I send my thanks to Governor Johanns for his service to Nebraska and \nhis willingness to serve the Federal Government, and I look forward to \nworking with him on these important issues.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reed, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of Mike \nJohanns to be Secretary of Agriculture and look forward to working with \nhim in my capacity as the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee. We will have occasion to work together on \nmany different topics in the months to come.\n  One topic of particular interest to me is the Milk Income Loss \nContract, MILC, program. This counter-cyclical support program was \nincluded in the 2002 farm bill and provides critical safety net for \nAmerica's dairymen.\n  In 2002 and the first half of 2003, dairy prices reached 25-year \nlows. During that time, the MILC program provided dairy producers with \nmuch, needed assistance. It helped to preserve the productive capacity \nof Wisconsin's dairy farms and stemmed the tide of losses that dairy \nfarmers had experienced in previous periods of price downturn.\n  Unfortunately, the MILC program is scheduled to expire in September \n2005, 2 years earlier than the rest of the farm bill commodity \nprograms. I believe that is unacceptable and will be joining soon with \na bipartisan, multiregional coalition of Senate colleagues to introduce \nlegislation that would extend the MILC program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter that several of my colleagues \nand I recently sent to the President on this topic be printed in the \nRecord. I look forward to working with Secretary Johanns on this issue \nin the months to come.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 2005.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to commend your strong \n     statements during the Presidential Campaign in support of the \n     Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program. Your pledge to work \n     toward reauthorization so that ``dairy farmers all across \n     this country can count on the support they need,'' is \n     critical.\n       Under current law the MILC program is set to expire at end \n     of September of 2005, two years prior to other farm bill \n     programs. We are seeking a two-year extension of MILC to \n     bring it in line with other agriculture support programs. To \n     allow MILC's expiration would eliminate a critical safety net \n     for dairy farmers at a time when milk prices are on the \n     decline.\n       We greatly appreciate your expression of support for \n     extension of the MILC program and look forward to seeing that \n     commitment reflected in your Fiscal Year 2006 budget. We hope \n     to work closely with your Administration in active support of \n     the MILC extension legislation in the coming months.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter,\n     Mark Dayton,\n     Herb Kohl,\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n       U.S. Senators.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to support \nthe President's nomination of Governor Michael Johanns of Nebraska to \nserve as the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Governor Johanns is extraordinarily well-prepared and qualified for \nthis new challenge. He grew up on a dairy farm in Iowa. He has served \ntwo terms as Mayor of Lincoln, NE, and is in his second term as \nGovernor of that State. He has shown outstanding leadership during his \ntenure as Governor which will serve him well in managing the diverse \nand important activities of the Department of Agriculture.\n  As leader of a major agriculture state, the Governor is obviously \nfamiliar with the issues that are important to farmers and ranchers. He \nhas been a leader in the Western Governors' Association on drought \nissues and has led five trade missions to expand overseas markets for \nAmerican agricultural products.\n  He has also been a leader on other issues that are critical to the \nvery diverse mission of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He has been \na strong voice for rural economic development. He is a past Chairman of \nthe Governors' Ethanol Coalition and knows the potential of value-added \nagriculture. He serves as Chairman of the Governors' Biotechnology \nPartnership and has fostered electronic-government and technology \napplications in his state.\n  Mr. President, on January 6th Governor Johanns appeared for his \nnomination hearing before the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, which I have the privilege to chair. For nearly 3 hours he \nanswered questions on a wide range of subjects and made a clear and \npositive impression on the entire Committee. His compassion and \nunderstanding of the issues was so evident that Committee members voted \nto approve his nomination that same day by a unanimous 20 to 0 vote.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the President on his choice to lead the \nDepartment of Agriculture for the next 4 years. I appreciate Governor \nJohanns' commitment to continue an outstanding record of public service \nand I recommend to my colleagues that they all support his nomination.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I strongly support the confirmation of \nMargaret Spellings as the eighth Secretary of Education. Ms. Spellings \nis a longtime public servant who for the past 4 years has served as \nPresident Bush's chief domestic policy adviser. In her White House \nefforts, she has helped implement policies on education, health, labor \nand housing. Her familiarity with America's students and teachers will \nprove invaluable in her new role managing our public educational \nsystem.\n  Ms. Spellings also assisted President Bush when he was Governor of \nour home State of Texas, where they worked together on a number of \nimportant education programs including the Texas Reading Initiative to \nimprove literacy, the Student Success Initiative to eliminate social \npromotion, and the State's accountability standard which is the \nforerunner to the No Child Left Behind Act. Because of her educational \naccomplishments, each year the United States develops more qualified \nteachers, better facilities and superior resources.\n  A veteran of the Texas Association of School Boards, Ms. Spellings \nknows firsthand the advantages afforded by education and has pledged to \nensure every child acquires the skills necessary to realize the \nAmerican Dream. I am proud to support her in that effort, and to \nsupport her confirmation so she may continue her important work.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconfirmation of Mike Johanns to be Secretary of Agriculture. As the \nformer Governor of Nebraska, Mike Johanns knows how important \nagriculture is to this country. Through his dedicated public service he \nhas shown a great understanding of the complex nature of the industry \nand the problems facing it.\n  Growing up on an Iowa dairy farm, Mike Johanns learned from an early \nage that agriculture is the backbone of this great nation. For over two \ncenturies, hardworking men and women like Mr. Johanns have dedicated \ntheir lives to protecting the vitality of the food and fiber industry. \nThe nomination of Mike Johanns for the position\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nof Secretary of Agriculture is a tribute to his commitment, and I have \nno doubt that this commitment will bring distinction to the position of \nSecretary of Agriculture.\n  Throughout his professional career, Mike Johanns has been committed \nto the wellbeing of America's farmers and ranchers. As Governor, Mr. \nJohanns emphasized the importance of value-added agriculture, renewable \nfuels such as ethanol, and job creation in rural areas. Additionally, \nMr. Johanns has demonstrated a keen knowledge of international trade \npolicy, a subject that will continue to increase in importance as the \nworld moves towards a more globalize economy. I look forward to working \nwith Mr. Johanns to ensure that future trade agreements with the food \nand fiber industry are treated equitably.\n  Mr. Johanns has also been an important leader on drought policy, a \nsubject that is very important to many communities in the west. I \nbelieve that with his experience in this area, the country can move \nforward in establishing a concrete and coherent drought policy that \nprovides tangible benefits for those affected by this serious problem.\n  I know that Mr. Johanns will serve the agriculture community the \nutmost integrity and fairness and I look forward to working with him in \nthe future.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise to \nsupport the nomination of Governor Mike Johanns to lead the Department \nof Agriculture. I applaud the President for his outstanding choice. The \nNebraska Governor enjoys strong support from both sides of the aisle, \nincluding from his two home State Senators, Chuck Hagel and Ben Nelson. \nThe Governor's nomination was approved unanimously in committee and I \nexpect swift action on his confirmation today.\n  Governor Johann's story starts in Mitchell County, IA, on his \nfamily's dairy farm. Long hours working on the farm taught him the \ndemands of the business, the hard work, discipline and resiliency it \ntakes to succeed in agriculture. It also taught him a deep respect for \nthe land and a sturdy work ethic which he says defines him to this day.\n  As Governor of Nebraska, Mr. Johanns has been a true friend of \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers. He has traveled the world to open new \nmarkets. Nebraska is the largest beef processing state in the country \nand the fourth largest exporter of agricultural products. Under \nGovernor Johanns' leadership, Nebraska's exports to China have more \nthan doubled, from $51 million dollars in 1999 to $110 million in 2003.\n  He has also been a tireless advocate for his State's agricultural \nworkers. As Governor, he developed the Meatpackers Bill or Rights to \nprotect the mostly Hispanic work force from poor working conditions. It \nwas a controversial bill, but the Governor was determined to stand up \nfor the right of his workers to safe working conditions. As he put it, \n``people have a right to a safe work environment whether they earn five \nor fifty dollars per hour.''\n  As Secretary of Agriculture, he will continue to grow and strengthen \nour farm economy. There will be challenges, including protecting the \nfood supply, and developing alternative energy sources like ethanol. \nBut Governor Johanns' lifetime of experience and leadership makes him \nsuperbly and uniquely qualified to meet these challenges.\n  Governor Johanns says his father cried when he learned that his son \nwas going to become a lawyer instead of a farmer. I hope today is cause \nfor celebration.\n  I look forward to the swift confirmation of Governor Johanns, and I \nlook forward to working with him to keep America moving forward.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I know of no other speakers on either \nside.\n  I ask that all time be yielded on the nomination of Governor Johanns \nfor Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time is yielded.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Mike Johanns, of Nebraska, to be Secretary of Agriculture?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The President will be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S86-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S86-S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE NOMINATION OF MARGARET SPELLINGS TO BE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION\n\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Margaret Spellings, of \nTexas, to be Secretary of Education.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to bring before the Senate the \nnomination of Margaret Spellings to be the Secretary of Education.\n  On January 6, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nheld a hearing to review the qualifications of Ms. Spellings for the \nposition. As chairman of the committee, I am pleased to note that the \ncommittee members found her qualifications to be exemplary and well \nsuited to the Cabinet level position. She has been enthusiastic and \nwell informed.\n  As the President's domestic policy adviser, Ms. Spellings was \ninstrumental in developing the No Child Left Behind Act, and other \nimportant legislative initiatives.\n  Today I stand with Senator Kennedy, the ranking member and the former \nchairman of the HELP Committee, in bipartisan support of her \nnomination. I thank Senator Kennedy and his staff for helping us bring \nthis nomination to the floor in a very timely manner.\n  In addition, I am joined by Senator Alexander, who will be the chair \nof the HELP Committee's Subcommittee on Education and Early Childhood \nDevelopment.\n  We look forward to working with Ms. Spellings in her new position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate my friend and colleague, \nSenator Enzi, on his appointment as the chairman of our committee. He \nis my favorite chairman to the year 2007. I thank him very much.\n  I am glad to withhold if the Senator desires. As always, he is very \ngracious, but I am glad to wait until he has completed his remarks. \nThen I intend to talk about education.\n  Mr. ENZI. I concluded my initial statement, and I will see if another \nis necessary.\n  I yield to the ranking member if he so desires.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I sincerely look forward to working with \nmy friend from Wyoming. We had a great tribute the other evening from \nvarious education groups. Senator Enzi met with more than 95 different \ngroups, and in his typical fashion said he was willing to sit down and \nlisten to each and every group. It was a bold action on his part. It is \na clear indication he is going to be an active leader in the field of \neducation as he has been in so many other areas of our committee.\n  I join with him in the strong support of Margaret Spellings to serve \nas the Secretary of Education.\n  There is no more important position in a President's cabinet. And I \nbelieve that Margaret Spellings has the knowledge, commitment, and \nleadership to improve the quality of education across our land.\n  The strength of America depends on the strength of our public \nschools.\n  Education is the key to opportunity and a strong economy. Our schools \nand teachers prepare young Americans to compete and succeed in a an \never-changing economy.\n  Education is key to our national security. We cannot protect America \nand maintain our progress in the world without skilled and well-trained \ncitizens.\n  Edcuation is the key to good citizenship. Good schools can shape the \ncharacter of our citizens and train Americans to participate in our \ndemocracy, to serve our country and our communities.\n  In short, our schools are key to the American dream.\n  From our earliest days as a Nation, our country's founders understood \nthis. John Adams, in drafting the Massachusetts constitution in 1780, \naffirmed that education of the people was ``necessary for the \npreservation of their rights and\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nliberties.'' And many other States since have included similar \ncommitments in their founding documents.\n  With every new age and each new challenge, part of the genius of \nAmerica is that we have adapted. We have risen to the challenge. As \nThomas Jefferson reminds us, ``Every generation needs a new \nrevolution.'' I believe that the revolution for this generation at this \ntime is to master our own destiny and guide the currents of \nglobalization for our own purposes.\n  No nation is guaranteed a position of lasting prosperity and \nsecurity. We have to work for it. We have to fight for it. We have to \nsacrifice for it. And above all else, we must equip our citizens to use \ntheir God-given talents to compete in the global economy, not by \nlowering their wages but by raising their skills.\n  The price of failure is enormous. Already, millions of Americans have \nseen their good jobs shipped overseas. Last year, the new jobs created \nhere at home paid 41 percent less than the jobs lost. And American \nfamilies are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet--harder and \nharder to live the American dream.\n  To restore that dream in a global economy, we must remove every \nobstacle to our vision and look beyond the horizons of today. Of \ncourse, we must strengthen our economy so that it works for everyone. \nAnd we must invest in new growth industries that will create the well-\npaying jobs of the future.\n  Most of all, we must stand with all Americans to ensure that they \nhave the skills and the opportunities they need for the future. We must \nencourage the study of math and science, and once again create a \nculture of innovation and progress in America.\n  That's the mission of the Department of Education in these times.\n  It is why I welcome President Bush's nomination of Margaret Spellings \nto be the next Secretary of Education.\n  Ms. Spellings has an impressive record on domestic policy. During her \n4 years in the White House, she has worked on a range of issues for \nPresident Bush, including transportation, housing, health, and labor.\n  Most impressive is her work on education. Ms. Spellings has been a \nconsistent champion for improving and strengthening public education, \nfrom her days as an advisor to Texas Governor Bush to her later role as \nthe President's principal advisor on the No Child Left Behind Act. Over \nthe years, she has worn many different hats in public education--\nadvocate, parent, and policymaker. Her steadfast commitment to children \nand to the institutions that serve them has never wavered.\n  I look forward to working with her in the years ahead to strengthen \nour schools and universities, and forge a national commitment in \neducation.\n  More than a basic value or a founding belief, education has been a \nforce to move America forward. It has been the engine of the American \ndream.\n  During the industrial revolution, we made a national commitment to \nexpand access to high schools and propel America forward.\n  In the 1940's, the GI Bill opened the doors of college to a great \ngeneration and launched a renewal of our economy.\n  After Sputnik's launch, we passed the National Education Defense Act \nto ensure our global competitiveness and national security by providing \nlow-interest college loans for students studying math, science and \nforeign languages.\n  Again today, we face national and international challenges to \nachieving the American dream--some new and others familiar.\n  The destructive forces of poverty and inequality continue to prove \nobstacles to opportunity and progress. International challenges, such \nas outsourcing of jobs and the rising investment of other nations in \nmathematics and science, mark a new global standard to drive the \nworld's economy.\n  In the face of these changes, we need a national education strategy \nto assure that America can advance--not retreat--in the days ahead. As \nPresident Bush challenged the nation in his Inaugural Address today, we \nmust ``bring the highest standards to our schools.''\n  To meet this goal, we must do more to see that No Child Left Behind \ntruly means no child.\n  It's not just a slogan. For us, it's a moral commitment. It's a \nsolemn oath to our children, to parents, and to communities that we \nwill fight for them every single day.\n  It's a promise that they will see qualified teachers, afterschool \ninterventions, and supplemental services. It's a promise that they will \nsee high academic standards, research-based instruction, and targeted \nhelp when they need it.\n  It's also a promise that every child counts--Black or White, Hispanic \nor Asian, rich or poor. Our promise to leave no child behind means that \nchildren with disabilities receive access to a highly-qualified teacher \nand to the individualized support that they need to succeed in school \nand in life. It means that schools are held accountable for their \nprogress, too.\n  No Child Left Behind is an expression of our basic values that we're \nwilling to make the tough choice and the hard sacrifices to invest in \nand improve our public schools, because they are the ever widening \ngateways to opportunity and success for every one of our children.\n  Our commitment cannot stop there. We must do more to help students \nprepare for college, afford college, enter college, and complete \ncollege.\n  I point out briefly what has been happening when we look at the costs \nof college tuition that are effectively out of control. From 2001 to \n2004 or 2005, the increase of public college education for 4 years has \nincreased 35 percent.\n  There has been an effort to recognize everyone has some role in \nmaking college affordable. The individual has a role. Some have \nresources, others do not. If they do not have the resources but have \nthe academic skill, we at the Federal level ought to be able to put \ntogether the kind of package so they are able to attend college. We did \nthat in the 1980s.\n  Twenty years ago in Higher Education Aid, we had almost 60 percent of \nthe assistance in grants and 40 percent in loans; now that has \nreversed. Now we find 58 percent and 41 percent in grants. As a result \nof this development and phenomena, there are hundreds of thousands of \nchildren in this country who do well and are admitted to the finest \nschools and colleges and universities of this country who will not \nattend because they do not have the resources. That is wrong. We have \nto address this.\n  A college education means more today than it ever has. Today's demand \nfor highly skilled workers has moved beyond the 1950s, when only 15 \npercent of jobs required advanced skills. In 2005, more than 60 percent \nof all jobs require some post-secondary education. Of the fastest \ngrowing jobs, half require a college degree and the other half require \nstrong information technology skills.\n  Despite growing demand, in the future, it is estimated that the \nnumber of college degrees earned will slow to one-third of its current \nrate.\n  Yet, last year, 400,000 college-ready students didn't attend a 4-year \ncollege on a full-time basis because they couldn't afford to do so.\n  In America, surely we can agree that cost should never be a barrier \nto a college education.\n  There is another area I want to mention. I know my colleagues are \nhere and want to speak. I will not take more than my share of the time. \nOne other very important feature I hope we can work with the \nadministration on is early education. I touched briefly on college. I \nthink we have to do a great deal more in the areas of math and science. \nWhen you look at what our competition is doing in China, in India, in \nterms of math and science and engineering and research, we cannot take \nfor granted our own prosperity and our own national security.\n  The best dollar invested in children is in early education. This \nchart shows results from the High Scope Perry Preschool Study, in \nYpsilanti Michigan, which has been peer reviewed, the Beethoven Early \nChildhood Program Study, and the Chicago Child/Parent Centers Study in \nChicago. They all reached the same conclusions: with early education a \nyoung person is more likely to complete school, more likely to get a \nskilled job, less likely to be held back a grade, and less likely to \nneed special education. The results are dramatic. The results are even \nmore dramatic that they are more likely to complete high school on \ntime.\n  The wonderful book Jack Shonkoff wrote, ``From Neurons to \nNeighborhoods,'' brings together three National\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\nAcademy of Sciences Studies. All of them reach the same conclusion, \nthat the opportunity to make progress with children in the earliest of \nmonths, virtually since the time they are born--even prior to the time \nthey go to Head Start or a preschool program--is immense, and we have \nthe proof.\n  This is an area Mrs. Bush is interested in. I am very hopeful we can \nfind common ground and work on this area.\n  I believe that every child in America, upon reaching eighth grade, \nshould be offered a contract. Let students sign it, along with their \nparents and Uncle Sam. The contract will state that if you work hard, \nif you finish high school and are admitted to college, we will \nguarantee you the cost of earning a degree. Surely, we have reached a \nstage in America where we can say it and mean it--cost must never again \nbe a bar to college education.\n  We must also inspire a renaissance of math and science in our schools \nand colleges. Over the last 30 years, America has fallen from 3rd to \n15th in producing scientists and engineers. In a major study released \nlast month, we ranked 29th among 40 industrialized nations in math.\n  This revival begins in our elementary and high school classrooms.\n  Last week, President Bush called for increased investments in the \ntraining of math and science teachers in our middle schools and high \nschools. This is an important first step.\n  In addition, the courses that students take--as well as the quality \nof teaching--matter greatly. We know that the higher the level of math \ncourses that students take in high school, the more likely they are to \nearn a bachelor's degree.\n  National standards in math and science have existed for more than a \ndecade. We ensure that those standards are competitive with \ninternational norms, and align them with the skills that students need \nto be successful in college and in the workforce. We should offer \nincentives and supports for schools to develop and implement rigorous \nstandards and courses. High standards and high-quality curriculum are \nthe pillars of reform in our schools.\n  We must strengthen the pipeline of math and science into higher \neducation. In the 1950s, after the launch of Sputnik, the National \nDefense Education Act resulted in a doubling of the federal expenditure \nin education, and helped secure the advancement and later dominance of \nthe United States in the arms race and in the global economy.\n  But today, out of 15 million college students, less than 400,000 \ngraduate with a bachelor's degree in math, science, engineering, or \ntechnology. Only 75,000 go on to obtain Master's degrees in those \nfields. We need a new National Defense Education Act.\n  We can double the number of future American scientists by 2010 if we \npursue three key strategies.\n  First, we need more and better math and science teachers in grade \nschools. We should make college free--no loans whatsoever--for any \nstudent, regardless of their family income, training to become a math \nor science grade school teacher.\n  Second, even for those not going into teaching, we should make \ncollege and graduate school tuition free for middle class and low-\nincome math and science students. These fields are critical to \nAmerica's future and we should dedicate resources toward strengthening \nthem in particular.\n  Third, we should expand the capacity of colleges and universities to \neducate future scientists and engineers by growing the Tech Talent \nprogram at the National Science Foundation. Tech Talent enables \ncolleges to hire additional math and science faculty, develop \nadditional math and science courses, make sure that math and science \nclasses are small and accompanied by up to date lab facilities, and \nsupports paid summer internships for math and science college students.\n  Finally, we can't expect to maintain a competitive standing in the \nglobal economy without paying attention to education in the early \nyears. Learning begins at birth, and research has proven that what we \ndo for our children's early education and development does more to \nensure their success later in school and later in life than any other \ninvestment.\n  Today, two-thirds of fourth graders are not proficient readers. Less \nthan a third of American students are proficient in math and science. \nAnd one-third of students who begin high school fail to earn a diploma.\n  Early education can change all of that. Students who participate in \nhigh-quality, comprehensive early childhood programs are less likely to \nbe held back a grade, and less likely to need special education. Later \non, they are more likely to complete high school on time. Later in \nlife, they are more likely to hold a skilled job or a college degree.\n  It's time that we made early childhood education a priority in \nAmerica. We need to ensure that every child has access to a high \nquality early education program.\n  We need to coordinate the wide variety of programs and services \ncurrently available for children. And we must also ensure that all \nthose caring for children have the skills and qualifications necessary. \nIf we are to expect quality care for our children in these settings, \nthen they need quality teachers, who are supported, trained, and \nadequately compensated to do the job.\n  America has always dedicated itself to expanding opportunity and \nembracing the future. These are our highest values, and we must draw \nupon them to approach the challenges that lie ahead with strength, \nskill, and confidence.\n  In short, we must stand ready to embrace the American dream by \nimproving the quality of education in America.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues and friends to give overwhelming \nsupport for this nominee. Margaret Spellings does not always say no. \nShe is not always going to say yes, but she is not always going to say \nno. We on this side of the aisle are looking forward to working with \nour chairman to try to make a real difference in enhancing the quality \nof education for children all over this country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nTennessee as he might consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, while the chairman and Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Dodd are here, I want to say that I appreciate Senator \nKennedy's remarks and strong support for Margaret Spellings. I \nappreciate the work he and Mike Enzi and Senator Dodd have done in \neducation and early childhood education, and I hope that is a signal \nthat over the next couple of years we can do more together.\n  Senator Kennedy and I worked on legislation that affects American \nhistory, and we have another pending bill on that. Senator Dodd and I \nhave worked together on legislation that affects premature birth. We \nhave some differences of opinion, and we will make those differences of \nopinion, but I am confident at least the chairman and I, and I believe \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Dodd, will work together on Education \nCommittee issues to do our very best to make sure we put children first \nand our country's competitive position first. I relish the opportunity \nto work with them. I know of no three more effective Senators than the \nchairman, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Dodd. I wanted to say that while \nthey were all here.\n  I once held the same job President George W. Bush hopes Margaret \nSpellings will hold. I was appointed Secretary of Education by the \nfirst President Bush. As I said at the hearing for Ms. Spellings, at my \nfirst Cabinet meeting I learned that not everyone in Washington thinks \nit is the most important job in Washington, because I learned at my \nfirst Cabinet meeting that the Secretary of Education sits at the end \nof the Cabinet table and is the last to be evacuated in the case of a \ncrisis. In fact, I used to tell my friends, if they woke up in the \nmorning when I was in the Cabinet and saw me assuring them that \neverything was all right, they should know that everything was not all \nright because that would mean they had worked all the way down to rest \nof the Government before they got to me.\n  But I agree with what the Senator from Massachusetts said a little \nearlier. I do not think there is any more important job in Washington \nthan that of Secretary of Education, who does not manage education. \nEducation is in the homes and communities and\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\nschools, and it is paid for, 93, 94 percent, outside of Washington. But \nthe Education Secretary can help our President put a priority on \neducation.\n  A lot of improving education is simply valuing education. I used to \nsay down in Tennessee, when I was Governor, trying to get our State to \nvalue it more than that, the reason the Minnesota schools are better \nthan the Tennessee schools is that in Minnesota they value education \nmore, that we were valuing fast cars and football games and they were \nvaluing high scores in math and science, and we were getting the \nfastest cars and they were getting the highest scores in math and \nscience.\n  So having the President and respective Members of the Senate put this \nupfront and having a competition for who can have the best ``better \nschools'' program and the best new initiative, that is the way we \nshould be doing it. I look forward to that.\n  I believe Margaret Spellings can help President Bush complete 8 years \nas a genuine education President. Because she knows him. She worked \nwith him in Texas. She helped him introduce one of the strongest \naccountability programs any State has. She was able to work with the \nCongress, helping him work in a bipartisan way with the No Child Left \nBehind bill, in a very strong example of bipartisanship, not just a \npassive one. But to continue to support it, she worked for the school \nboard association there.\n  So she knows the President. She knows the subject. She knows \npolitics. She knows the Congress. She knows the White House. And she \nought to be good. So I am delighted the President has chosen her. I \nlook forward to working with her.\n  Now, Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi made some mention of a few \nsubjects they believe are important, especially important right now, \nthat they hope the President and his new Secretary will put a focus on. \nI would like to do the same, in brief.\n  No. 1, I would like to see this new Secretary and this President \nestablish a point person within the administration for higher \neducation. One of my great regrets, as I left the Secretary of \nEducation's office in 1992--other than I had to leave it because we \nlost the election--one of my great regrets was I did not go to the \nfirst President Bush and say: Let me be the point person for all the \nFederal Government does on higher education. And why is that? It is \nbecause the National Academy of Sciences estimates that one-half of our \nnew jobs since World War II have come from advances in science and \ntechnology; in other words, from our brainpower. That is where it has \ncome from. And much of that advance in science and technology has come \nfrom about 50 great research universities and the national laboratories \nwe have that are run by the Department of Energy.\n  No other country in the world has anything that compares with those \nresearch universities and those national laboratories. And just as they \nwere for the last 50 years, they will be for the next 5, 10, 50 years \nthe key to our ability to keep our standard of living. We need to \nremember that we are only 5 to 6 percent of the population in the \nworld, and we may have a third of all the dollars. Now the rest of the \nworld is going to be catching up, and they are already doing that.\n  India and China are busy keeping their brightest people home. They \nare busy working on building greater universities. While we may be \ntaking for granted this superior system of higher education we have \ntoday, Senator Kennedy pointed out the rising tuition. I will tell you \nwhy the tuition is rising. It is not because the Federal Government is \nnot putting more money in. It is because the State governments are \nputting in less.\n  In Tennessee, when I left the Governor's office in 1987, 51 cents out \nof every State tax dollar was being spent on education, and 14 cents on \nhealth care. Today, it is 40 cents on education, and 26 cents on health \ncare; and health care is going up. That same story is true in virtually \nevery State in the country, and the money that was being spent on \neducation and now being spent on health care is coming, for the large \npart, out of higher education. So if we shortchange higher education, \nwe are shortchanging our ability to keep good jobs in the United \nStates.\n  We have a number of other issues that have to do with higher \neducation that we need to focus on. Visas for foreign students: The \nSenator from Minnesota has been as active, perhaps more active, than \nany other Senator in pointing out there is a dramatic drop in the \nnumber of foreign students at our universities. People might say, so \nwhat? They do not speak English very well, anyway, when they teach \ncourses in graduate school.\n  Here is so what. They are among the smartest people in the rest of \nthe world, and they come here, go to our universities, and they create \nideas and jobs for us. They help make our universities the best. \nFrance, Germany, India and China are trying to keep them home, and we \nare making it hard for them to get here. We are going to pay the price \nfor that.\n  The President has made some comments about year-round Pell grants. We \nhave held a hearing about that. Senator Kennedy talked about the \nadequacy of Pell grants. We need to look at that. I believe our \nuniversities are strong because, first, we recognize their autonomy.\n  In other words, we don't tell them what to do. We encourage autonomy, \nand then we give the money to students and let the money follow the \nstudents to the academic institution of their choice. We don't say you \ncan't go to Notre Dame or you can't go to Yeshiva or you can't go to \nHoward. Sixty percent of American college students have a grant or a \nloan from the Federal Government that follows them to the school of \ntheir choice. We ought to continue to respect that autonomy and not \nrestrict it.\n  Colleges of education, distance learning, community colleges, \nincreased spending for the physical sciences that support our research \nefforts, political correctness in colleges and universities, the \nrelationship of research universities and the National Laboratories, \nhaving an administration-wide inventory of all the Federal Government \ndoes in support of higher education would help us put a focus on higher \neducation, and the fact that better schools, colleges, and universities \nmean better jobs.\n  There are two or three other areas I hope the President and the new \nSecretary will pay attention to, such as finding more ways to involve \nparents in the education of their children by giving them more choices \nof educational opportunities. I believe the genius behind our superior \nsystem of colleges and universities is because we don't try to run them \nfrom here. We respect the autonomy of the universities and we allow \nstudents money and allow them to choose the schools. If it helped \ncreate the best colleges, I don't know why we don't use more of that to \nhelp create the best schools.\n  A third area is to make sure we are spending Federal dollars for \nchildren age 0 to 5 as well as possible. This is an area the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts mentioned. It is one in which the Senator from \nConnecticut is interested. The Federal Government spends $18 to $21 \nbillion a year through 69 different programs that dedicate part of \ntheir budget toward early education and care programs that serve \nchildren under the age of 5. That is in addition to all the money that \ngoes to children because of the Medicaid Program. The Department of \nEducation administers 34 of those 69 programs. We ought to take a look \nat the spending of the $18 to $21 billion and find out how well it is \nbeing spent.\n  Head Start is just about a third of it. Head Start is not all we do \nfor early children. We ought to see where the gaps are. We ought to \nunderstand what the States are doing, what the cities are doing, and \nthen see what else the Federal Government might need to do additionally \nor what we might change to do better.\n  Next, make sure No Child Left Behind is funded, flexible, and \nworking. The President has asked us to expand it to high school, or has \nindicated his intention to do so. We ought to take a look at what we \nare already doing first and see if there are some lessons that we need \nto learn from how No Child Left Behind was implemented in the first 3 \nyears so that we can avoid any mistakes we made when we consider going \non into high school.\n  I am a convert to No Child Left Behind. I am a convert primarily \nbecause we have a third of our eighth graders who score below basic on \nreading and\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\nmath, which is disgraceful. At least we need to know that and need to \nknow who is falling behind. But this is a huge program, and there is a \nlot to look at: Achievement in State standards, what constitutes highly \nqualified teachers, the choice in supplemental service provisions, how \nNo Child Left Behind affects rural areas as compared to urban, the very \nimportant U.S. history subject and learning English subject. And we \nneed to look at funding.\n\n  Last time I checked, the President does not appropriate a penny. The \nCongress might as well give itself some credit for this. Federal \nfunding for K-12 is up 36 percent. That is a lot. It is as much as \nSenator Kennedy said tuition was up in the last 4 years. State funding, \nat least in my State, is up about 11 percent. So Federal funding for \nkindergarten through the 12th grade is up three times as much in the \nlast 4 years as State funding for kindergarten through the 12th grade. \nBut still we need to take an honest look to see.\n  We put some new requirements, through No Child Left Behind, on State \nand local governments. Did we properly fund that? That is an \nappropriate question. We should ask that question.\n  Finally, I would like to see more work done on the subject that \nSenator Kennedy and I and the new Democratic leader, Senator Reid, have \nworked on. That is restoring the civic mission of our public schools. \nThe President talked about that today in his inaugural address: What \ndoes it mean to be an American? He gave the kind of speech I hoped he \nwould give: What are the values in our country? What is important to \nus? We can get all the programs later. He did that beautifully.\n  The late Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of \nTeachers, once said the reason we have public schools is to teach the \nthree Rs to the immigrant children and teach them what it means to be \nan American with the hope that they will go home and teach their \nparents. We should be embarrassed that the lowest score that high \nschool seniors make on the national assessment for educational progress \ntest is in U.S. history, our own history. If we don't know our own \nhistory, we don't know why we are in Iraq. We don't know why we say \nanything is possible. We don't know why we say no child is left behind. \nWe don't know why we debate illegal immigration. We could have no \ndiscussion in the Senate Chamber that made any sense at all unless we \nhad some understanding of U.S. history.\n  Senator Reid and I cosponsored legislation that passed last year to \nhelp create summer academies, presidential academies for the teachers \nof American history, and congressional academies for students of \nAmerican history. Senator Kennedy and I will introduce again this year \nlegislation that will add State-by-State tests and NEAP tests in U.S. \nhistory, giving States that option so they can compare their scores. We \nare looking for many different ways to restore the civic mission of our \npublic schools.\n  There is a lot to do. I believe there are three great challenges \nfacing our country: One is terrorism; one is preserving our common \nculture; and one is keeping our jobs in a competitive world \nmarketplace. And the key to that is brainpower and education. Better \nschools, colleges, and universities will mean better jobs. And with the \nexperience that we have in this Chamber and the high level of interest \nwe have in education and the history we have had recently of bipartisan \ncooperation, we ought to be able to make some significant progress.\n  I look forward to being a part of that, working with Chairman Enzi \nand Ranking Member Kennedy.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \ntotal enthusiasm on this issue. We are so fortunate to have him as the \nchair of the Subcommittee on Education and Early Childhood. You have \njust seen a demonstration of the passion that he puts into education. \nOf course, he has covered it from the perspective of being Governor, of \nbeing a college president. Probably more important, he has covered it \nfrom the perspective of being the Secretary of Education of the United \nStates. Now as a Senator, he is going to make a difference in policy by \npursuing that committee vigorously, as we can tell from his comments.\n  I also appreciate the earlier comments of Senator Kennedy and the \ntremendous cooperation that we have had not only on the hearings that \nwe have had but also on the personal discussions on the workload that \nwe have by September 5, when 28 reauthorizations expire. We have to get \nthose done.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am glad our colleague from Tennessee has \nremained. People may assume I am fulfilling some collegial courtesy to \nextend comments about the experiences of the members of the committee, \nbut as Senator Enzi has just said, we are very fortunate to have Lamar \nAlexander as a Member of this body and as a member of the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The Senator from Wyoming \ntouched on the experiences that Senator Alexander has had, except one, \nand that was as a Presidential candidate. He spoke eloquently, \nthroughout those months in which he sought the highest office in the \nland, about the importance of education. So, we are fortunate to have \nhim on our Committee.\n  I can't tell the Chairman of the Committee how much I look forward to \nworking with him as well. I am optimistic about the work we can do on \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  I will support the nomination of Margaret Spellings as Secretary of \nEducation. The mission of the Department of Education is ``to ensure \nequal access to education and to promote educational excellence for all \nAmericans.'' If we succeed in making our education system as good as it \ncan be, there is no national priority that will not benefit. If we do \nnot succeed, we leave things to chance. So I believe that the Secretary \nof Education is one of the most, if not the most, important positions \nin the President's Cabinet.\n  Ms. Spellings comes to the Department of Education with strong \ncredentials as a policymaker in the area of education. She currently \nserves as the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. In that \nrole, she is responsible for the development and implementation of \nWhite House policy on education, health, labor and other elements of \nthe President's domestic agenda. Prior to her White House appointment, \nshe worked for 6 years as one of Governor Bush's senior advisers, a \nrole in which she had responsibility for the development and \nimplementation of his education agenda. Many of the initiatives she \nworked on were incorporated into the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLBA. \nIn fact, Ms. Spellings was one of the administration's primary \narchitects of the No Child Left Behind Act, working with Members of \nthis body, and others, to craft this law.\n  As Ms. spellings said at her hearing, there is no more important \nobligation each of us has to the American people than to educate our \ncitizens. Like her, I believe that a high-quality education must be \navailable to each and every American regardless of where they live, \ntheir economic status, whether they attend urban, rural or suburban \nschools, and whether they are a first or fifth generation American. I \nwas impressed at her nomination hearing by the breadth of her knowledge \nand her ability to respond to a wide range of questions on so many \naspects of education policy. Her intimate knowledge of No Child Left \nBehind will be the key to successful future implementation of this law, \nand I am hopeful that she is up to the task of working with this body \nto ensure that a greater degree of reasonableness is taken into account \nin implementing it.\n  I do not in the least question this nominee's qualifications or \ncommitment. She is in these respects truly impressive. I do, however, \nquestion the policies of the administration she is duty-bound to \nrepresent.\n  I had high hopes when this administration came to office. I supported \nwhat is widely touted as this administration's landmark education \ninitiative, the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  I supported No Child Left Behind because I care about improving the \nquality of education in America for all of our children. I believed \nthat this law would help to achieve this goal by establishing more \nrigorous standards for measuring student achievement, by helping \nteachers do a better job of instructing students, and by providing\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\nthe resources desperately needed by our schools for even the most basic \nnecessities to help put the reforms we passed into place. Regrettably, \nthe high hopes that I and others had for No Child Left Behind have not \nbeen realized. The law is being implemented by the administration in a \nmanner that is inflexible, unreasonable, and unhelpful to students.\n  Worse still, the administration's promise of sufficient resources to \nimplement No Child Left Behind's much-needed reforms is a promise that \nhas yet to be kept. Currently, the law is underfunded by $9.8 billion. \nAs a result of the failures of the administration to fulfill its \ncommitment to our Nation's schoolchildren under the Law, children and \ntheir teachers are shouldering new and noteworthy hardships. Students, \nteachers, administrators, parents, and communities, are struggling to \nwork with requirements that are often confusing, inflexible, and \nunrealistic. And they are struggling to do so without the additional \nresources they were promised to put them into place.\n  As I have said on numerous occasions in the past, resources without \nreforms are a waste of money. By the same token, reforms without \nresources are a false promise--a false promise that has left students, \ntheir teachers, and taxpayers, grappling with new burdens and little \nhelp to bear them.\n  Just last week, the President announced a new education initiative \nthat would expand No Child Left Behind testing at the high school \nlevel. New testing, combined with new requirements already scheduled \nover the next 2 years--including the deadline for teachers to be highly \nqualified--will require a great infusion of resources. And yet, we have \nrecently been told that one-third of the States will see a decline in \nNo Child Left behind funds this coming year.\n  No Child Left Behind is not the only law which remains underfunded. \nToday, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, IDEA is \nfunded at less than half of the 40 percent we committed to provide when \nwe passed the law 30 years ago. This means that States continue to bear \nmore than their fair share of responsibility for meeting disabled \nstudents' needs. States that, mind you, are facing astronomical \ndeficits as a whole. States that often have no choice but to pass these \ncosts on to municipalities which then pass them on to everyday, average \nAmerican taxpayers through their local property taxes.\n  Just as disheartening is this administration's lack of support for \nstudent financial aid. Since coming into office, it has done little to \nhelp the average American taxpayer send their children to college. The \nmaximum Pell Grant award remains frozen at $4,050 for the fourth \nconsecutive year, enough to pay just 34 percent of the average annual \ncost of attending college. In the meantime, public college tuition has \ngone up 35 percent over the last 4 years.\n  A college graduate earns close to double the amount of an individual \nwho has only graduated from high school. Without additional financial \naid in the form of loans--and more importantly, grants--many American \nstudents may not be able to afford a college education. Prohibitive \ncosts may be keeping some of our best minds from fulfilling their \ndreams of a higher education. And yet, this administration has done \nvirtually nothing to make college more financial accessible. Qualified \nstudents with the will to achieve should be given the change to do so. \nUntil recent announcements of expanding the Pell Grant program, this \nadministration has done little if anything to give these students that \nchance. And while I am happy to hear that higher education is receiving \nlong over due attention, I am concerned by indications that the \nadministration may pay for new initiatives simply by cutting others.\n  Outside of funding, I am concerned about President Bush's proposal to \nmove Head Start from the Department of Health and Human Services to the \nDepartment of Education and to change the program's focus to reading. I \ndo not object to exploring innovative ways to help children read. \nHowever, it is the comprehensive nature of Head Start that makes a \ndifference for poor children. Head Start is just as much about ensuring \nthat children have proper health care, dental care, vision and hearing \nscreening, as well as screening for developmental delays. Head Start is \nabout the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development of \nchildren. To focus only on cognitive development would ignore the other \npillars of school readiness. We need to be cautious about changing a \nprogram that does so much good for so many children and families. Our \nfocus need to remain in the development of the ``whole'' child.\n  I sill support Margaret Spellings' nomination because she is well-\nqualified for the position and has demonstrated seriousness of purpose. \nHowever, my concerns about the nominee are not her personal \nqualifications but the policies of the administration she represents. I \npledge my best effort to work with her and others to find common \nground. But, by the same token, I will respectfully dissent where this \nadministration pursues policies that I believe are harmful to our \nNation's children.\n  Again, even though I am supportive of this nomination, it does not \nmean that Ms. Spellings is going to agree with the Senator from \nConnecticut on everything. I suspect she will not. But I know when I \nmake a call to her, I have somebody on the line who will listen and \nwill consider sound arguments about why or why not we ought to do \ncertain things. I very much look forward to working with her and this \ncommittee in the coming months.\n  I have often quoted Thomas Jefferson who made the comment just over \n200 years ago that any nation that ever expects to be ignorant and free \nexpects what never was and what never possibly could be. That was his \nstatement at the beginning of the 19th century. It is just as true \ntoday. That is why the nomination before us is of the utmost \nimportance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do not want to turn this into a bouquet-\ntossing process, but I also want to commend our friend from Wyoming. I \nthink he is going to do an excellent job in his new position. At the \nend of last year, we got a little bit more flexibility in terms of the \ninterpretation of Leave No Child Behind Act because of the efforts with \nrespect to hiring of rural teachers, and I thank him for his work on \nthat, and certainly the bipartisan firm of Senators Kennedy, Dodd, \nEnzi, and Alexander is a force to contend with, and I am looking \nforward very much to working with them.\n  The confirmation of the Secretary of Education by the Senate, \nimportant as it is, is not the only important development in American \neducation this week. I am sure many of our colleagues have heard about \nthe remarks made by Harvard President Larry Summers this week, remarks \nthat in effect said women may be underrepresented in math and sciences \nbecause of innate differences between men and women.\n  I spoke with Dr. Summers this morning. He made it clear to me that he \nis acutely aware that remarks he intended to be thought-provoking \ncrossed the line. He knows that as president of one of America's most \ndistinguished institutions, his views are heard worldwide. I expect he \nwill continue to express his contrition to the Harvard community and \neducators around the country.\n  I have devoted a lot of time to this issue myself. In 2002, when I \nbecame chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, I pursued this issue on \na bipartisan basis, particularly with Senator Allen of Virginia. Today \nI ask my colleagues the question of what ought to be on the table at \nthis point, and that is what is going to be done now, what is going to \nbe done immediately, to create more opportunities for girls and women \nto advance in science, math, engineering, and related fields?\n  It is very seldom, when a problem such as this comes up, that there \nis literally a tool right at our fingertips to solve the problem, but \nin studying this issue, in holding hearings on this issue, I became \nconvinced that title IX of the Education Act can be the key to ensuring \ngender equity in critical academic fields for women.\n  Here is how title IX reads: No person in the United States shall, on \nthe basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the \nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\n  It means any institution receiving Federal funds must make sure that \nwomen are treated equitably.\n  In the Senate, and certainly around the country, there is a common \nmisconception that title IX is about sports. I think very few people \nare aware that primarily, at its roots, it is an academic statute. \nAthletics are certainly where we have seen the most progress under \ntitle IX. Before title IX, 1 in 17 girls in school played sports. Now \nit is 1 in 2.5, or 40 percent.\n  So I ask my colleagues, imagine if those same changes could be seen \nin math, science, and engineering, from the 20 percent of science \nundergraduates who are women today, to 40 percent or 50 percent; from \nthe 6 percent of engineering professors who are women today to 40 \npercent.\n  The potential of title IX is enormous. Enforcing it in academic \nfields could revolutionize the study and application of math and \nscience in our country.\n  Educators of good conscience should not wait for a Federal reprimand \nto comply with a Federal law that benefits all of us. Title IX ought to \nbe a guiding principle in hiring, tenure, scholarships, and lab space \nfor all scholars on all the academic campuses around our country. Title \nIX can finally give women studying science a fair shake where they have \nnot gotten one before. It does not sound like a tall order, but it is \nnot happening. Unfortunately, the Federal Government is not taking the \nlead in terms of tackling the issue.\n  For example, I asked the General Accounting Office to examine whether \nthe Federal Government is following the law and enforcing title IX. \nWhat the General Accounting Office found was disappointing at best. \nThey looked at the Department of Education, NASA, the Department of \nEnergy, and the National Science Foundation, and they found that little \nor no efforts were being made to ensure compliance with title IX \nrequirements for grantees getting Federal dollars. Of all the agencies \nreviewed, the Department of Education was the only Federal agency that \nconducted any title IX compliance reviews. But they have not conducted \na single review--not one--since 1995.\n\n  The Federal Government is not doing its part to ensure that title IX \nis being enforced for women and girls with the ability and the desire \nto work in math and science. I have asked Secretary of Education Paige \nand the President that title IX be enforced as intended. But today, \ncolleagues, I formally call on the individual who will shortly be \nconfirmed as the Secretary of Education, Margaret Spellings, to work to \nensure that girls and women in our federally funded schools do not \nsuffer discrimination in math and the sciences. I will tell you, it is \nan issue of economics, and it is also an issue of national security. A \nreport from the Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security to 2025 \nwarned that America's failure to invest in science and to reform math \nand science education was the second biggest threat to our national \nsecurity. It warned that only the threat of a weapon of mass \ndestruction in an American city was a greater danger. In fact, the \nCommission unanimously concluded that the danger from underinvesting in \nmath and science and failing to reform math and science education was \ngreater than the danger from any conceivable conventional war.\n  I do not see how America can meet its national security needs if it \nis not giving women a fair shake as it relates to opportunity in math \nand science. So on this Inauguration Day, I call on the new Education \nSecretary, the individual we will shortly confirm, to take this message \nof economic fairness and national security to heart.\n  The remarks that Dr. Summers has made, which have triggered such \ndebate, have generated a new and important discussion about this issue. \nAs the Senate confirms a new Education Secretary, I believe there is no \nbetter time to return our attention to the issue of how this body can \nadvance opportunities for women in math and science, not by writing any \nnew laws but by enforcing the laws on the books.\n  Colleagues, I would say--our new chair is here--it is one thing if \nChairman Enzi has to get together with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nAlexander and Senator Dodd and write a whole new law. Here we have a \nlaw on the books, but the conception is that it is just for sports, and \nit has been a good sports statute. What I am saying is we can \nrevolutionize opportunities for women in math and science if we use the \nlaw as it was originally intended.\n  Go talk to our former colleague, Senator Birch Bayh. Senator Bayh, \nwho testified before my subcommittee, said this was primarily an \nacademic statute, and he would very much like to see it used for \nopportunities for women.\n  The conversation I had with Dr. Summers this morning certainly was \nnot over when we hung up the phones. What began as a controversy this \nweek I hope is going to end with a bipartisan effort, like the one that \nSenator Allen and I launched several years ago, to make sure there are \nmore opportunities for women and girls to enter the math and science \nfields. That is what I intend to pursue. I intend to do it on a \nbipartisan basis, working with our new chair and colleagues whom I know \nshare this interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes and 56 seconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have been requested by the Senator from Tennessee to \nyield 3 minutes to discuss the issue that has just been brought up.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I was here to hear the \nSenator from Oregon. I want to think about what he said and make two \ncomments. It is a noble and good effort for us to think about how can \nwe make certain young girls as well as young boys have the opportunity \nto learn more about science and math and to make careers of science and \nmath should they choose to do that. I would like to urge some caution \nin the application of title IX to cause that. We may want to be more \nselective in our approach.\n  I watched the good title IX can do. I was president of a university \nwhich saw a fantastic women's sports program, as an example, develop \nbecause of that--at the University of Tennessee. At least it encouraged \nthat. But it might have some unintended consequences because, in many \ncases, girls are doing better than boys. Almost every liberal arts \ncollege in America today is having a hard time recruiting males, not \nfemales. In many of the graduate professional schools across the \ncountry we are finding growing numbers of women, which is a wonderful \ndevelopment, and they are in the majority. Were we to begin to apply \ntoo strict an application of title IX, we might find it restricting \nmoney spent for females because they are doing better than the males.\n  One of the greatest problems affecting our country is why African-\nAmerican males are not doing as well in high schools, so I would like \nto discuss that some more. I appreciate his bringing it up. I am glad I \nwas here to hear it.\n  Second, I have read the comments about Dr. Summers and his comments. \nHe may wish he said what he said in a little different way, but I am \nalso a little concerned about the controversy. I understand what he \nsaid is he raised the question: Is it possible that there is an innate \ndifference between men and women that might contribute to the smaller \nnumber of women who study math and science and make careers of it?\n  If he were a politician on the Senate floor, he might think twice \nabout saying that because he might be misinterpreted. But if you are on \nthe campus of a university, you are supposed to be able to ask \nquestions, even questions that are a little offbeat, even questions \nthat are incorrect. I can guarantee you, having been temporarily on the \nfaculty there at Harvard with an appointment, there are many more \nbizarre ideas than that that are regularly asked and regularly \nexpressed. So he may be wrong; the answer to the question is no, there \nare no innate differences between men and women that contribute to the \nreason why fewer women follow math and science, but I think certainly a \nfaculty member of Harvard or the president of Harvard ought to be free \nat least to discuss the question without being roundly condemned across \nthe country.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for his thoughtful comments. I would \nlove to talk with him more about whether the application of title IX \nwould actually have some unintended consequences, consequences he might \nnot\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\nintend. I hope on all of our campuses and universities, even presidents \nare free to ask questions and have a free inquiry. I believe that is \nwhy we have those institutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will not belabor this. I do believe I \nhave to make a couple of responses with respect to the remarks made by \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Wyoming yield time?\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield 2 minutes for a quick response. This is a very \nimportant topic. Everybody has a common interest in making sure there \nis a quality in education all the way through. I would appreciate the \ncomments of the Senator from Oregon, briefly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I want to say first of all, I am talking about enforcing a \nlaw that is on the books. All I am talking about is the original intent \nof a law that is on the books, which is applied primarily to the \nacademic field--not sports.\n\n  I want it understood that I am not talking about anything new. I am \ntalking about enforcing the law that is on the books.\n  Second, making sure that I am specific with respect to what the \nSenator from Tennessee has said, all I am talking about is that women \nwould get an equal shot at all of the slots in math and science. We \nknow there can be different results based upon the qualifications of an \nindividual. And universities don't need to have the exact same number \nof men and women for every position on their faculties. But what I want \nus to do--and what title IX is all about--is make sure that women have \nan equal shot at all of the slots that are available. It seems to me, \nif we don't do that, we are not complying with the law that is on the \nbooks.\n  I will tell you that we are not going to be able to meet the economic \nand national security needs of our country.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is always very gracious. I am anxious to \nwork with him in these areas. I want to make sure and emphasize that I \nam talking about equal opportunity--an equal shot. That is the call \nthat I am making today on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pension Committee reported to the Senate the \nnomination of Margaret Spellings for confirmation as Secretary of \nEducation. I am very pleased that the nomination was unanimously \nreported and I intend to vote in support of her confirmation for this \nimportant post.\n  Over the past 4 years since passage of the No Child Left Behind, \nNCLB, Act, there have been--and continue to be--many questions \nregarding funding and implementation of the Act. During this period, \npromises were made to Congress, the education community and parents \nthat adequate funding would be provided to ensure that the various \nrequirements relating to teacher quality and accountability could be \nimplemented without creating an additional financial burden for States \nand local communities. Additionally, States were assured that \nsufficient flexibility would be provided to States for the development \nand implementation of State plans to meet the requirements under NCLB. \nRegrettably, these two key goals have not been met.\n  The nomination of Margate Spellings is an encouraging development \nregarding our national education policy. Margaret Spellings brings to \nthis office very significant credentials, including her service as the \nprincipal education advisor to President Bush during his term as \nGovernor of Texas. She is recognized for her expertise on education \nreform and has distinguished herself as Assistant to the President for \nDomestic Policy. Additionally, Margaret Spellings played a key role in \ndevelopment of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Most importantly, Margaret Spellings nomination represents a \nwonderful opportunity for the Department of Education to work more \nclosely with Congress, States and the education community in a \nrealistic implementation of NCLB. Congress supports the goals of \nimproving teacher quality and ensuring that students are fully prepared \nupon graduation to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It's \nabsolutely essential, however, that the Department of Education be a \nstrong and realistic partner in the implementation of the Act. State \nand local officials and educators must also be assured that they will \nnot be saddled with extraordinary unfunded mandates or regulations to \ncomply with the act.\n  I commend Margaret Spellings for her commitment to education and am \npleased to vote in support of her confirmation as Secretary of \nEducation. I look forward to working with her on critical education \nissues on a national level and to addressing the very real concerns of \neducators and school officials in North Dakota on teacher quality, \nespecially the issue of highly qualified teachers and education \nfunding. The No Child Left Behind Act must be an initiative of \ncooperation and partnership among all parties in the education \ncommunity and the Federal Government if it is to succeed in improving \neducation for our children.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider and vote \non the nomination of Margaret Spellings as the new Secretary of \nEducation. I will support her nomination. Ms. Spellings is a capable \nleader, having been principally involved in shaping education policy on \nboth State and Federal levels for over a decade. Her commitment to \nworking on both sides of the political aisle and alongside our teachers \nand educators illustrates her dedication to strengthening our schools.\n  In today's global marketplace, ensuring access to high-quality \neducation--from a continuum that starts in early childhood to grade \nschool, moving on to college and beyond--is central in maintaining \nAmerica's competitive edge. To meet this goal, adequate funding of our \npublic schools and post-secondary institutions is necessary to keep our \nstudents on the path toward achievement. I am confident that Ms. \nSpellings will uphold this responsibility as the head of the \nDepartment.\n  Meeting the needs of learners at all ages and targeting approaches \nthat prepare them to be successful is a priority. By investing in \neducation, we are empowering our economy. I am eager to work with Ms. \nSpellings on strengthening our education system, making sure that every \nstudent reach his or her full potential and improving the quality of \nlife for all families.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconfirmation of Margaret Spellings to be Secretary of Education. \nMargaret Spellings has devoted her career to working to improve \neducation for children in Texas and across the Nation. Her experience \nand dedication make her eminently qualified to serve as Secretary of \nEducation.\n  Margaret Spellings is the ideal person to work with States and \nGovernors of both parties to achieve the goal of raising student \nachievement for all students in all schools. As the Assistant to the \nPresident for Domestic Policy, Ms. Spellings has been responsible for \nthe development and implementation of White House policy on education, \nhealthcare, labor, housing and many other elements of President Bush's \ndomestic agenda. She has also served with distinction as the senior \nadvisor to then-Governor George W. Bush in Texas with responsibility \nfor State education policy, and as associate executive director of the \nTexas Association of School Boards.\n  Throughout her professional career, Margaret Spellings has had in-\ndepth discussions with teachers, administrators and school board \nmembers. She understands about school reform and the Federal role in \neducation. In Texas, she was responsible for developing and \nimplementing the State's strong school accountability system, and she \nwas also instrumental in the State's strong reading and charter school \nefforts. As a top domestic advisor to the President, she was integral \nto the development of the No Child Left Behind Act, which is producing \nsolid improvements in reading and math for America's students and is \nhelping students by transforming our public education system.\n  The fact that President Bush has chosen one of his closest and most \ntrusted advisors to become Education Secretary is a clear sign that \neducation will continue to be a top domestic priority for this \nadministration during the next 4 years. I look forward to working with \nMargaret Spellings in her new role as Education Secretary to help make \npublic schools great for every child.\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure and honor to \nsupport the nomination of Margaret Spellings to lead the Department of \nEducation.\n  Ms. Spellings has been a close and trusted adviser to the President \nfor over a decade. She will bring to the post both local and national \nexperience. In Texas, Ms. Spellings led the Texas Association of School \nBoards and advised two Governors on education policy, including then-\nGovernor Bush. In Washington, she has served as the top domestic policy \nadvisor to the President and was one of the key architects of the \nhistoric No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Ms. Spellings has earned a solid reputation as one of the sharpest \nminds in education policy. She is passionate about America's schools, \nand more importantly, passionate about America's school children. Like \nall of us in this chamber, she believes that every child has the right \nto learn. Education is the path to achieving the American dream. As a \nresult of her work on the No Child Left Behind Act, students of every \nbackground are making strides.\n  As the Secretary of Education, Ms. Spellings pledge to improve the No \nChild Left reforms and extend them to the high school level. She is \nalso committed to enhancing college aid to assist older and \ndisadvantaged students. As she told the HELP committee, reforms to No \nChild Left Behind need to be sensible and workable.\n  Ms. Spellings' nomination comes to the Senate floor with strong \nbipartisan support. She was unanimously voted out of committee. Both \nsides of the aisle recognize and honor her leadership and experience. \nIn Ms. Spellings, America's education system will have a thoughtful, \nflexible, and effective leader.\n  Karl Rove once said that Margaret Spellings is the most powerful \nwoman in Washington, whom no one knows. As a key Cabinet Secretary, she \nwill be one of Washington's most luminous stars.\n  I am pleased to support her nomination. I expect a swift and \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote to make Ms. Spellings America's eighth \nSecretary of Education.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need to \nconclude this debate.\n  We have had a wonderful afternoon talking about some of the basic \neducation policies that we need to be on top of for the kids of this \ncountry. I am excited about the bipartisanship that has been shown in \nthis discussion this afternoon.\n  We have had a pretty good covering of a lot of the different issues \nthat will be coming before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. But, of course, the real purpose of this discussion was to \nhave a very brief discussion on the approval of the nomination of Mrs. \nSpellings to be our Secretary of Education. I am pleased there were no \nadverse comments during the entire time that we allowed, and there were \nnone at the hearing we had for her.\n  During that hearing, we discussed the President's education agenda \nand the future of the educational system. We asked Mrs. Spellings a lot \nof questions about her views on these issues and about her plans to \ncontinue to improve our schools. We were all impressed with her \nanswers.\n  It was evident from the comments of the Members there that Mrs. \nSpellings enjoys strong bipartisan support. I think that has been shown \nhere today, too.\n  As her record clearly shows, Mrs. Spellings is no stranger to the \nissues of education that will affect every child and every schoolroom \nthroughout the United States.\n  As the President's domestic policy adviser, Mrs. Spellings was the \nkey part of the effort to emphasize the accountability and the \nimportance of getting results in the classroom as part of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act.\n  Thanks to that important legislation, our Nation's classrooms are \nmore effective. They are more efficient. They are places of learning, \nand our children are benefiting from that.\n  Mrs. Spellings believes, as I do, that every school can be a good \none, and every student can be a star student.\n  It is no secret that good skills lead to good jobs. Maintaining those \nskills through a lifetime of learning will lead to a good career.\n  That has been my experience as a father of three college graduates, \nand also the husband of a wife who got a college graduate degree on \nline from the University of Wyoming while we were here in Washington. \nThere is a little time difference between here and Wyoming. A lot of \nher classes started pretty late at night. But she stuck with it and got \na graduate degree. All of us are proud of her for that.\n  I am proud of all three of my kids who have their degrees. One of \nthem is a teacher. She has gotten a couple of degrees since she became \na teacher. One of those got her a certification to be a principal.\n  I get comments from that lobby very strongly. I am so pleased with \nthe comments I get.\n  I would also be remiss if I did not mention my sister, who is a \nbusiness major for the Sheridan School District, which is one of the \nbig school districts in Wyoming. She is actually the smartest of us two \nchildren. She is also an accountant and does an outstanding job of \nkeeping track of every dime of education money and informs me of ways \nwe messed up the law when we were doing that. I get a lot of good \nadvice from there.\n  But it is also my hope as a grandfather of a little boy who looks at \nme with trusting eyes certain that his grandpa has it under control--\nand just looking at him, I can tell that he is counting on his grandpa \nand the other parents and grandparents of this body to ensure that he \nreceives the kind of education he will need to find a good job, and the \nconstant training and upgrading of skills to ensure that he will be \nable to keep it.\n\n  I was just reading a book called ``The Jobs Revolution.'' A child \nstarting school today probably will not be able to do like his parents \nor grandparents did, starting one job and continuing that for 30 years \nand then retiring. The average child starting school today will have 14 \ndifferent careers. Here is the key part: Ten of those haven't even been \ninvented yet, which means the level of education that we have now has \nto have the flexibility to teach them to get the continuing education \nto get the new jobs so that the best jobs are maintained in the United \nStates.\n  Someday my grandson will take his place in the workplace, and we must \nmake available to him, and to every worker who will give our workforce \nan advantage, a lifetime of learning to ensure that the United States \nretains its competitive edge in the global market.\n  Mrs. Spellings understands this--the fact that the workplace isn't \nwhat it used to be.\n  In this global, technology-driven economy, school can never be out. \nToday's workplace demands an ever-changing workforce that can adapt to \nthe requirements and skills of the new high-tech jobs that are in such \nhigh demand.\n  Keeping workers' abilities current will be vital if they are to \ncontinue to find every job they will need to support their families and \nmaintain consistently higher standards of living.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions, I am looking forward to working with Mrs. Spellings on these \nissues and many more--such as the importance of using advanced \ntechnology to improve our rural schools.\n  As we work to address this and the other challenges of rural school \nsystems, we must continue to be flexible in our approach.\n  That is the only way we can ensure every child has access to a \nquality education and that our school systems are run in a manner that \nmakes more sense for the population they serve.\n  Having spoken with Mrs. Spellings, I am certain she shares my concern \nabout rural education and that she will work together with this \nCongress to continue to make the changes that will be needed to keep \nour educational system and the lifetime of learning it must provide \nmoving forward.\n  As committee chairman, I am honored to be able to join the \ndistinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator Kennedy, in \nsupporting the confirmation of Mrs. Margaret Spellings to be the next \nSecretary of Education.\n  I am extremely pleased that we worked in a bipartisan manner in order \nto have Mrs. Spellings confirmed by the date of the President's second \ninauguration.\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\n  Today, this body has the opportunity to confirm an excellent nominee \nwith the skills, with the experience, and the character to help bring \nour students of all ages and backgrounds along the pathway to fulfill \ntheir own version of the American dream. I am confident we can do so, \nand provide our children and students of all ages with an effective \nadvocate at the Department of Education.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I think all Members who wish to speak on \nthis have spoken.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all time remaining on both sides be \nyielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask the Senate to proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Margaret Spellings, of Texas, to be \nSecretary of Education?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President will be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S95-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, first, let me congratulate the new \nchairman of the HELP Committee, the Senator from Wyoming, for his \nleadership. I wish him the same level of success for everything he \nbrings to the floor--that it be both bipartisan and moved through so \nquickly. I think our decision to move the Secretary of Education so \nquickly was the right decision. I was happy to join in that vote.\n  I wish the chairman the very best in his new assignment on the \ncommittee.\n  There are several nominations that are likely to move through with \nequal dispatch--if not today, within the next few days.\n  It has been my honor to meet with the new Secretary of Commerce-\nDesignate, Carlos Gutierrez, who was formerly the CEO of Kellogg, and \nis now taking on this post. He is new to Government but he brings an \namazing perspective to the Department of Commerce. I am certain his \nnomination will move through very quickly. I am certain he will do a \nvery good job.\n  The same thing can be said of the Governor of Nebraska, Mike Johanns, \nwho has been tapped by the President to serve as the new Secretary of \nAgriculture. He and I had a very positive conversation and dialog \nyesterday. He is from Iowa originally. He went to law school in \nNebraska and made it his home. He was elected Governor. Having grown up \non a dairy farm in Iowa, he understands farming first hand. We had a \nvery positive conversation. He succeeds an excellent Secretary, Ann \nVeneman, who now will go on to be the head of UNICEF.\n  Mike Johanns was an excellent choice by President Bush and was \nconfirmed without any debate or controversy. I say that because many \npeople think when it comes to the Senate floor it is nothing but a \nfistfight every single day. That is not a fact. We will disagree, but \nin many instances the President's recommendations are approved without \ncontroversy and without debate. Every White House prays that every \nrecommendation, every nomination, and every bill will have the same \noutcome. That is never the case. We will do our best to work with this \nPresident. Coming together today, in this session, immediately after \nthe inauguration, is an indication of our efforts to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S95-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S95-S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              INAUGURATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will speak for a moment about the \ninauguration we just attended. First, I address an issue of style which \nwas brought to my attention earlier this week in Chicago. One of my \nacquaintances is a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. His name is \nNeil Steinberg. Mr. Steinberg recently wrote ``Hatless Jack.'' It is \nthe story about men wearing hats in America. It was a good conversation \nwe had about his book.\n  It starts with the premise that some 44 years ago today with the \ninauguration of John Kennedy, there was a change in fashion in America \nand men stopped wearing hats. Mr. Steinberg debunks that notion but \ngoes into a very interesting history of not only John Kennedy wearing a \nhat but also hats in America.\n  People remember that inauguration 44 years ago. Seven inches of snow \nfell the day before. Some 3,000 soldiers were on the street overnight \nshoveling the snow, using flamethrowers to try to melt the snow to make \nway for the inauguration the next day.\n  The inauguration started an hour late. Senator Kennedy, of course, \nbecame the President and gave his famous speech: Ask not what America \ncan do for you but what you can do for your country. Robert Frost was \nat that occasion. People seem to remember there were no hats there, \nthat John Kennedy did not wear a hat. They mistakenly blame him for \nkilling an industry.\n  I wish those same people could have been out today for the \ninauguration and seen my colleagues in the House and Senate. There were \nsome amazing hats being worn. There are very few other times my \ncolleagues would wear one. We had Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch in \ncowboy hats, Senator DeWine in his bowler, Alan Greenspan with his \nYankees baseball hat--quite an array, not to mention Justice Scalia's \nhat, which I cannot describe.\n  I say this by way of introduction. There is a style issue here that \nsomeone should report. I thank Mr. Steinberg for bringing this \nhistorical notion to our attention, that the inauguration today raises \nquestions which I am sure an enterprising journalist will follow up on.\n\n  Let's go to the substance of the speech and what happened today. \nClearly, there were disappointments on the Democratic side of the \naisle. Many Members worked long and hard for our colleagues John Kerry \nand Senator John Edwards on their candidacy. I served as vice chairman \nof the Democratic National Committee and traveled to many of the \nbattleground States on their behalf. I saw an outpouring of volunteer \nsupport for that campaign that I had never seen before in any previous \ncampaign. There was also an outpouring of small donations, an \nindication of the interest the American people had in that campaign.\n  Of course, there was a bitter disappointment among those on the \nDemocratic side with the outcome on November 2. I am glad Senator Kerry \ncame forward on November 3 and said, clearly, that he was conceding the \nelection and that America should move on with its new President, \nPresident George Bush, who was then reelected.\n  Many people contacted me and expressed the sadness and bitterness and \ndisappointment, as you might expect, after a hotly contested election. \nIt is a fact of life that America is very closely divided politically. \nHad one State, the State of Ohio, gone the other way and the electors \npledged to John Kerry rather than to President Bush, we would have \nsworn in John Kerry today as President of the United States. The margin \nin Ohio was 118,000 votes. So still we see our Nation divided, blue \nStates and red States, though there is a lot of commonality within \nthose States on issues of importance.\n  I listened to the President's speech today. It was a good one. Many \npeople mistakenly believe the inaugural address is the State of the \nUnion. It is not. Most Presidents use the inaugural address to make a \nstatement that will stand the test of time, that will last through \nhistory. It does not address the morning paper so much as the summation \nof what has happened in America over the last year, two, three, or \nfour. That is what President Bush did in his speech today.\n  I thought the direction of that speech toward freedom was an \nimportant point. It is one that every American and every American \nPresident would share--not only that we value our own\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\nfreedom but want to see other nations reach that same goal. I agree \nwith the President completely.\n  He also spoke about what the freedoms would mean to Americans. He is \nnot the first President to address that issue, of course. We can all \nremember the famous speech by Franklin Roosevelt, the ``Four Freedoms'' \nspeech, in his address to Congress on January 6, 1941.\n  Franklin Roosevelt, in that speech, laid out what he considered to be \nthe four essential human freedoms: first, freedom of speech and \nexpression everywhere in the world; second, freedom of every person to \nworship God in his own way, everywhere in the world; third, freedom \nfrom want, which translated into world terms means economic \nunderstandings, which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime \nlife for its inhabitants everywhere in the world; and the fourth, \nfreedom from fear, which translated into world terms means a worldwide \nreduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion \nthat no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical \naggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world.\n  That speech of the Four Freedoms was given about 12 months before the \nattack on Pearl Harbor. As we read about the freedom from fear, we put \nit in the context of what followed: one of the bloodiest wars in the \nworld. What President Bush spoke to was the freedom from fear from \nterrorism, recounting our tragic national experience on September 11. \nHe also talked about the freedom from want, which President Roosevelt \nraised, as well. We all want the people of this country to have the \nbest. We all want to do our part to make that happen.\n  We just heard an extraordinary exchange between Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate on the issue of education. What struck me in \nlistening to Senator Alexander of Tennessee, Senator Enzi of Wyoming, \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Senator Wyden of Oregon was the \ncommonality, so many things they agreed on, the importance of \neducation. We will see in a few weeks how important education really \nis. This administration will present to Congress its budget resolution. \nWe can give a lot of speeches in the Senate, we can pledge that we have \ngreat interest in issues, but the real test is if we put our resources \nand our energy behind those interests.\n  The budget resolution is the first test. We can look to that budget \nresolution to see if the values of the inaugural address are expressed \nin the budget of the President. It is one thing to speak of those \nvalues on January 20; it is quite another to present a budget \nresolution which meets that test.\n  We can look to several items. First, will there be more money for No \nChild Left Behind? This is a program I voted for, a program of \naccountability in schools to make certain that the kids are \nprogressing. But there has been a real complaint from local school \nadministrators, Governors, that we have created a Federal mandate for \ntesting and accountability but no resources to take care of the \nproblems. When we identify special ed students or students from \nstruggling families or disadvantaged households who are not doing well \non tests, what do we do as a Federal Government to help the school \ndistrict?\n  In my home State of Illinois, we are in a desperate situation. School \ndistricts are bankrupt all over the State. We have had a terrible time \nbecause of the turn down in the economy. Our Governor is struggling to \nbalance his budget. The amount of money for education certainly should \nbe increased. Instead, the Federal Government identifies problems, \ncreates this category of so-called failing schools, and then does not \nprovide the resources to take care of the problem.\n  In a few weeks we are going to see a budget resolution from this \nadministration. When it comes to education and all that we have heard \non the Senate floor and the President's speech, the real test is, will \nwe put the resources there? Will we put the money there?\n  Secondly, there is the whole question of health care. If you want to \ntalk about what most families and individuals need in America, it comes \ndown to basic health care. Ask any Governor in this Nation the \nimportance of Medicaid. That is the program, of course, the Federal and \nState program, to provide health care to people who are disabled or in \nlower income categories. Ask them what their concern is. Their concern \nis that the cost of Medicaid is going up substantially and that the \nFederal Government is not providing the resources. As a result, many of \nthese Governors worry that people today depending on Medicaid will not \nhave the Federal funds to match the State funds to make certain that \nMedicaid is viable.\n  Seventy percent of all Americans in nursing homes today depend on \nMedicaid--70 percent. A substantial number of our children depend on \nMedicaid for their health care, and a substantial number of pregnant \nmothers about to deliver depend on that same Medicaid program.\n  Watch carefully when the President's budget comes forward. See what \nthe funding for Medicaid is. See if the President's budget will also \naddress this aspiration of freedom from want when it comes to health \ncare.\n  Another issue that is very timely in the news is the future of Social \nSecurity. We are still waiting. We have heard some generalities from \nthe President, his general goals, his general aspirations when it comes \nto Social Security reform. There is an ad playing on Washington, DC, \ntelevision that shows Franklin Roosevelt signing the bill into law to \ncreate Social Security in the 1930s and then quickly switches to a \ncolor photo of President Bush working at his desk saying we need his \nleadership to make certain Social Security will last into the future.\n  Well, that is a good thing. Each President should address that. But \nwe need to see the particulars, and we need to ask ourselves, is this \nPresident proposing a privatization, even a partial privatization, of \nSocial Security which will in fact cause a cut in benefits to Social \nSecurity recipients? If that is the President's proposal, I think he is \nin for a struggle.\n  Many of us view Social Security differently than some on the other \nside of the aisle. We understand there is a challenge in Social \nSecurity. But keep this in mind: If we do nothing on Capitol Hill in \nCongress about Social Security, absolutely nothing, Social Security \nwill continue to make every single payment every year with a cost of \nliving adjustment until at least 2042, 37 years from now, and perhaps \n2052, 47 years from now. Those are the estimates from the experts. So \nwe have between 40 and 50 years of Social Security making every payment \nif we do nothing today.\n  I believe, and many share it, that we can do something today. We can \nmake commonsense changes in Social Security that are modest, which \nwould, when played out over 40 or 50 years, much like the miracle of \ncompound interest, make Social Security strong, not just for 40 or 50 \nyears but 60 or 70 years or beyond. That is what I believe we should \ndo.\n  The reason I believe it will work is I have seen it work. I served in \nthe House of Representatives in the 1980s. President Ronald Reagan, a \nRepublican, came to Tip O'Neill, the quintessential Democratic leader, \nand said: We have a problem. All of the babies born after World War II, \nthe baby boomer generation, will show up for Social Security, and we \nwill not have the resources. We need to make changes today in the mid-\n1980s to take care of a problem we can foresee in 2010, far into the \nfuture. And we did it on a bipartisan basis. We made changes, some \npopular, some not, some very modest in nature, and look what happened: \nSocial Security bought more longevity and more stability because of \nthose changes.\n\n  If President Bush is coming to us and saying, make the modest changes \nso that Social Security can be strong in the future, then I will sign \nup for that. On a bipartisan basis, we owe that not only to those who \nare to retire, working today, but to future generations. But if the \ngoal here is to privatize Social Security, is to take from the Social \nSecurity trust fund resources we are already counting on to pay to \nretirees and to put it into the stock market, which some are \nsuggesting, I think the President is in for a battle because if we are \ngoing to privatize Social Security at the expense of cutting benefits \nto Social Security recipients, then I am afraid there is going to be a \ngreat resistance on both sides of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\n  Wait for the President's State of the Union, wait for his budget \nresolution, wait to see if the promise in values that were articulated \nin the inaugural address will be played out in the actual budget \npresented to Congress in the future. That is what we have to do.\n  There are a lot of hungry people in America today. There are a lot of \nfamilies anxious to find work. There are a lot of people who have jobs \ntoday that are not quite what they were a year ago. We have lost \nmanufacturing jobs across this country. We have health insurance costs \ngoing up dramatically, not only hurting businesses but labor unions as \nwell. Schools are struggling to do their job. We are in a much more \ncompetitive world.\n  But I think what the President said today was a message of hope; that \nif we can come together as a nation, regardless of our political \npersuasion, that if we can be honest about the challenges, and if we \ncan give a little on both sides to work out compromises, the country \ncan, in the future, as it has in the past, rise to the occasion. I look \nforward to being a part of that process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S97-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A CALL FOR UNIFICATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every 4 years, at the time of the \ninauguration, it is a festive time in America. It certainly is a time \nof celebration in Washington, DC. I have had the good fortune of being \nable to be here on a number of occasions.\n  As I look back, the thing that stands out--Democrat and Republican--\nis how cold the weather is. It is always cold. It is always a question \nof how cold it is going to be. I had the good fortune, historically, of \nbeing able to serve here in the Senate when we canceled an outdoor \ninauguration ceremony for President Reagan. It was so cold it simply \ncould not be held outside, and the crowd had to be thinned down by \nthousands and thousands, and people jammed into the Rotunda behind us. \nEven though it was cold outside, it was still warm inside at the second \ninauguration of President Reagan. It is a time when we put political \ndifferences aside and honor the American presidency.\n\n  I have had a lot of microphones shoved in my direction today. Each of \nthose times I tried to recognize the day. The day is to honor our \nsystem of Government.\n  If we look back 4 years ago, there was a situation where the man who \nwas elected President received fewer votes than the person he beat. We \nhad the tremendous problems with the electoral system in Florida, and \nthen we had the race decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. But America \nbeing as it is, the minute the Supreme Court made their decision, Vice \nPresident Gore and the rest of the country recognized that the election \nwas over. There wasn't a window broken; there were no riots; no one was \nhurt. The inauguration went forward as if President Bush had won by 10 \nmillion votes. That is what our country is all about. We are a nation \nof laws, not a nation of men.\n  It is my hope that today will usher in a new beginning in Washington. \nI say that because we have had a lot of partisan rancor and squabbling. \nI hope that now gives way to a spirit of bipartisanship. Frankly, we \ndidn't get much in the last 4 years with the new tone. The President \nsaid he wanted to be a uniter and not a divider. For reasons I don't \nfully understand, that never took place.\n  I spoke to the President the day after the election, and it was a \npleasant conversation. He clearly indicated at that time that he wanted \nto reach out. He said: I haven't another election, and I want to do my \nbest to get along. That is my take on what he said to me. I hope we are \nable to go forward on the message the President delivered to me. This \ncountry needs unification. We have been divided too long.\n  Today we had a little lunch after the inauguration ceremony. Of all \nthe speeches the President has given, his speech there, which took less \nthan 5 minutes, was the best he has ever delivered. I commented on \nthat. It was because he delivered the speech recognizing the tremendous \nresponsibilities he has as President of the United States. You could \ntell by listening to and watching him the emotion that he felt. I was \nvery impressed with that.\n  I trust and hope that the President's expressed feelings today go \nforward in the months and years to come. I say that because the \nAmerican people are counting on us. People from Rhode Island, people \nfrom Illinois, people from Nevada, people from all over the country are \ndepending on us to work together to tackle the immense problems facing \nthis Nation.\n  We on this side of the aisle--the aisle that we talk about so much is \nright here--all 45 of us have stated privately and publicly, we will \nwork with the President. But I do say this: We will not shy away from \nliving up to the values and priorities we believe are important in our \ncountry. We are serious in tone and in context. We will work with the \nPresident.\n  He took an oath of office today. We all saw that on national \ntelevision. People don't often see us every 6 years when we take the \noath of office. During his remarks following taking the oath of office, \nhe praised the wisdom contained in the document we call the \nConstitution. That document lays forth the separation of powers within \nour Government, the three separate but equal branches of Government. I \ntake my constitutional responsibility just as does the President of the \nUnited States.\n  We as Senators have constitutional obligations to which we swear \nevery 6 years when we take our oath of office and fulfill our contract \nwith the people of our respective States. Speaking for those on this \nside of the aisle, we are going to work as hard as we can to live up to \nthe expectations the American people have in us. We may be elected as \nDemocrats and Republicans, but we don't serve as Democrats and \nRepublicans. We serve ultimately as Americans. There are so many areas \nwhere we can find common ground, we need not look to areas where we can \nsquabble and be partisan. If we work together on the areas where we \nhave common ground, it would take every waking minute the Senate has.\n  I look forward to being the new Democratic leader, working with this \ncaucus and working with the President and my Republican colleagues to \nfind ways that we can keep our commitments to the armed services, those \nserving in uniform in Iraq, Afghanistan, Korea, the Balkans, all over \nthe world, as they are serving to keep Americans safe. The war on \nterror is a war for which we must be vigilant, and we will do \neverything we can to support the armed services of our country.\n  One of our immediate tasks must be to put our Nation's fiscal house \nin order. There can be no question about the need to do that. We are \nspending more money than we are taking in as a government. We are \nspending in excess of our resources by far too much. There is much work \nto be done to strengthen education, expand access to quality, \naffordable health care.\n  I don't talk about bipartisanship just in theory. I have had the good \nfortune to work with Senator John Ensign, a Republican. John Ensign and \nI are from the State of Nevada. Six years ago we were in one of the \nmost difficult, bitter races, not only in the history of the State of \nNevada but the history of our country. That race was ultimately decided \nby 428 votes. Here it is 6 years later, and John Ensign is now a member \nof the Senate.\n  John Ensign is a loyal Republican, and I do my very best to represent \nthe Democratic Party. But because of our work together, the work of \nSenator Reid and Senator Ensign, we have worked on that which is \nimportant to the State of Nevada and, we believe, to the country. We \nhave worked together in a bipartisan basis. That work has been \nbeneficial to our country.\n  With the spirit of the inauguration close to our hearts today, I look \nforward to the great debates ahead in the great debating society we \ncall the Senate. I am optimistic and confident that today could be a \nnew beginning. But it will only be a new beginning if the tone that is \nset today is carried forward in the years to come in making our country \nthe country it has the potential to be.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S98-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S98]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S98]]\n                        COMMITTEE FUNDING LEVELS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. On January 6, I engaged in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, concerning the budget \nassumptions for the next committee funding biennial period, subject to \nappropriations. I stated that the committee funding budget assumes an \nacross-the-board freeze budget, with salary baselines adjusted by COLAs \nof 3.71 percent in 2005 as approved by the President pro tempore in \nearly January; 3.3 percent assumed for 2006, and 3.5 percent assumed \nfor 2007, although both the 2006 and 2007 actual COLA amounts remain \nsubject to the approval of the President pro tempore.\n  Based on preliminary calculations, both Senator Reid and I assumed \ncertain funding levels, subject to appropriations. We have now received \nfinal financial calculations for an across-the-board freeze including \nthe previously identified COLAs. To achieve our fiscal goal, aggregate \nfunding levels would be: March 1, 2005-September 30, 2005: $51,783,793; \nOctober 1, 2005-Semptember 30, 2006: $90,923,102; and October 1, 2006-\nFebruary 28, 2007: $38,704,409. These funding levels include, but do \nnot separately allocate, the additional 10 percent allocated to the \ncommittees in the 108th Congress. I believe this reflects the intent of \nthe negotiation between the Democratic leader and myself.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader is correct. The preliminary \ncalculations that we were provided did not accurately reflect our goal \nof an across-the-board freeze including the COLAs.

Mr. President, I rise today as our Nation celebrates \nthe 55th Presidential Inauguration to pay tribute to Mr. Dave \nDisponett, a fellow Kentuckian who is in Washington, DC to attend his \nsixth inauguration.\n  Dave is a dedicated member of the Republican Party--a man I am glad \nto have on my team. He has been a witness to history with the swearing \nin of President Richard Nixon in 1969, President Ronald Reagan in 1981 \nand 1985, President George H.W. Bush in 1989, President George W. Bush \nin 2001 and again today, January 20, 2005.\n  Dave is in the Nation's capita1 today with his wife, daughter, son-\nin-law and 10-year old granddaughter--who is already following in her \ngrandfather's footsteps by attending her second Presidential \nInauguration.\n  Earlier this week USA Today published a story about Dave and his \nfamily, ``Kentucky Family Hears Inaugural Call.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be included in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From USA Today, January 17, 2005]\n\n                  Kentucky Family Hears Inaugural Call\n\n                           (By Bill Nichols)\n\n       Lawrenceburg, Ky.--When Franklin Roosevelt was sworn in as \n     president for the third time in 1941 under the shadow of \n     potential U.S. entry into world war, the program read: \n     ``Inaugurals take their drama from the temper of the times.''\n       Dave Disponett, a builder and passionate Republican \n     activist in this traditionally Democratic city of just under \n     10,000, agrees.\n       On Thursday, when President Bush takes the oath of office \n     for a second term, Disponett, 69, will attend his sixth \n     inauguration with his wife, daughter, son-in-law and 10-year-\n     old granddaughter--who is on inauguration No. 2.\n       The Disponett clan, like thousands of other visitors who \n     are descending on Washington, are bracing for a very \n     different inauguration this year. ``I imagine there are going \n     to be lines everywhere, but what can you do?'' Disponett \n     says. It is the nation's first since the Sept. 11 attacks, \n     and extraordinary security precautions are in place.\n       But as demonstrated by the treasure trove of inaugural \n     memories and memorabilia--ball tickets, programs and \n     photographs--that Disponett has saved, this mix of pageantry \n     and politics always manages, for good or bad, to reflect the \n     mood of the nation. Spectators seem to come for a party but \n     end up with a little piece of time.\n       In 1969, Disponett watched friends climb a light pole on a \n     Washington street to avoid Vietnam protesters who had \n     thronged to Richard Nixon's inauguration. The trip marked \n     Disponett's first time on an airplane; he was 33.\n       Twelve years later, he was moved to tears as crowds \n     listened to transistor radios to hear news of the release of \n     the U.S. hostages in Iran as Ronald Reagan was sworn in 1981.\n       ``That was the most exciting day of my life,'' Disponett \n     remembers. His daughter Lois Ann, 47, who attended her first \n     inauguration at the age of 10, says the experiences she had \n     were almost impossible to explain to her schoolmates back in \n     Lawrenceburg. ``Most people couldn't grasp it,'' she says of \n     the celebrities and dazzling gowns. ``It was just a world \n     totally beyond their comprehension.'' She felt, she says, \n     like a real-life Cinderella.\n\n\n                           Security concerns\n\n       Inaugural historian Jerry Wallace, retired from the \n     National Archives, points out that heightened security for \n     the ceremony is not new. Both of Abraham Lincoln's \n     inaugurations found troops on Washington's streets, and the \n     1861 event was held under threat of assassination. Woodrow \n     Wilson's 1917 inauguration, held as the United States \n     considered entering the First World War, also was marked by a \n     show of force.\n       Wallace worries, however, that precautions for this year's \n     event could dampen the ability of average Americans to enjoy \n     the day.\n       At least 6,000 police officers--some of them heavily \n     armed--will patrol Washington's streets, searching ticket \n     holders and onlookers as F-16s, F-15s and military \n     helicopters patrol the skies.\n       ``I find all this security just very oppressive,'' Wallace \n     says. ``The whole dynamic behind an inaugural is not to be \n     exclusive at all.''\n       Charlie Brotman, a 77-year-old Washington public relations \n     executive who has been the Inaugural Parade announcer for the \n     past 48 years, says security for the presidential viewing \n     stands on the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the \n     White House will be tighter than any he has experienced. \n     Brotman believes, however, that earlier stretches of the \n     parade will still be quite accessible to the public.\n       Phyllis Clark, school services coordinator for Flowing \n     Wells School District in Tucson, will be bringing several \n     dozen eighth-graders to the inauguration for the second time. \n     She worries that her kids won't be able to tour the White \n     House because of the security. ``This year I told the kids \n     that I really don't think we'll get to go in,'' she says.\n       But Clark also says the event is also an opportunity to \n     show young people that they have to live their lives to the \n     fullest, even in an age of terrorism. ``We'll still go. And \n     if something happens, we'll look after each other and take \n     care of each other,'' Clark says. ``We can't be so afraid \n     that we don't go anywhere.''\n\n\n                        Not giving in to terror\n\n       The Disponetts couldn't agree more. Last week, they were \n     busy preparing for their trip to Washington. Ten-year-old \n     Anna-Marie, the daughter of Lois Ann Disponett and husband \n     Todd Hyatt, recently found her coveted $80 ball gown on sale \n     for $20 at a Louisville department store.\n       Dave Disponett's rising influence as a GOP activist and \n     fundraiser in Kentucky has given his family increasingly \n     better inaugural access since their first trip in 1969, which \n     Dave and his wife, Brenda, believe was their first trip \n     outside Kentucky. Campaign finance records show Disponett \n     gave $2,000 to the Bush re-election campaign last year, while \n     Brenda gave $2,750 to the National Federation of Republican \n     women.\n       Disponett's life as a Republican began in 1953, when he \n     went to register to vote and was told by an Anderson County \n     clerk that there was no point in registering as a Republican \n     since no Republican candidates could get elected in \n     Lawrenceburg. That struck Disponett as not exactly in the \n     democratic spirit, so he registered Republican. In 1967, he \n     helped elect Louis Nunn as Kentucky's first Republican \n     governor in 24 years. That began Disponett's side career as a \n     Republican Party power broker, which facilitated his family's \n     ritual of watching a president get sworn in.\n\n\n                             Rich memories\n\n       That first year, in 1969, the Disponetts didn't to \n     Inaugural Balls, because, they recall, they couldn't afford \n     the $100 tickets. They were also fairly dazzled by the \n     Washington scene.\n       The family didn't go attend Nixon's second-term \n     inauguration in 1973 because of financial reasons, but headed \n     back in 1981 for Reagan's first inauguration. They remember \n     the excitement of the crowd when the 52 U.S. hostages were \n     released by Iran, and that the National Christmas Tree--kept \n     dark because of the hostage crisis--was turned on at last. \n     ``I get goose bumps just thinking about it,'' Lois Ann says.\n       By 1981, Dave Disponett also was on his way to becoming a \n     GOP insider. He has a signed photograph of Reagan from the \n     occasion, on the back of which is a note from the late Lee \n     Atwater, Reagan's political director. In 1985, the Disponetts \n     were connected enough to have been invited to attend balls, \n     though Lois Ann says she was surprised that they were so \n     crowded and featured so little dancing. From George H.W. \n     Bush's inauguration in 1989, Dave Disponett proudly shows \n     an unopened commemorative bottle of Korbel champagne, \n     which he bought for $25. After eight years of Democratic \n     rule, the family returned to their inaugural haunts in \n     2001, where they had the pick of events because Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was a key inaugural \n     organizer.\n       That year also marked Anna-Marie's inaugural debut. And \n     while she fell asleep in her father's arms during President \n     Bush's inaugural address, the experience does seem to\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\n     have had an effect. She recently asked her grandfather how \n     old he would be in 2030, when she will be 35 and old enough \n     to run for governor in Kentucky. Dave Disponett now says he \n     has a compelling reason to live to be 94.\n       Charlie Brotman, the Inaugural Parade announcer, says that \n     despite the security and exclusivity now associated with \n     inaugurations, the event remains a moment of national \n     ceremony that touches even the most cynical Americans. \n     ``Fathers and mothers tell me they want to take their \n     children, so their kids can tell their kids that they were \n     there.

CATHERINE\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. president, I rise today to offer my heartfelt \ncongratulations to the College of St. Catherine, in St. Paul, MN, on \nthe celebration of its centennial year. St. Catherine is our country's \nlargest Catholic college for women. Its numerous academic achievements \nwould be impressive for a college of any size, but for an institution \nwith fewer then 5,000 students, such accomplishments are downright \nspectacular.\n  Since its founding 100 years ago, the College of St. Catherine has \nexpanded its student body from high school and lower division college \nstudents to include associate, bachelor's and graduate degree \ncandidates in more than 60 fields. In 1937, St. Catherine became the \nfirst Catholic college to be awarded a chapter of the national honor \nsociety, Phi Beta Kappa.\n  Today, the College of St. Catherine continues to distinguish itself \nas a leading institution for women's education. Its Women of Substance \nseries features lectures and performances of theater, music, and dance \nby female speakers and artists from around the world. In the classroom, \nthe college's new Centers for Excellence focus on the role of women in \nsuch diverse fields as public policy, spirituality, and health.\n  Annually, the College of St. Catherine graduates more nurses than any \nother college or university in Minnesota. It is second only to the much \nlarger University of Minnesota in the number of public school teachers \nit has educated and placed in the State's capital city of St. Paul.\n  Along with all of the Minnesotans whose lives have benefited from the \ntalents, professionalism, and leadership of St. Catherine's outstanding \ngraduates, I would like to say thank you. The College of St. \nCatherine's commitment to the highest standards of academic excellence \nand social responsibility have enriched the lives of its students and \nits state's citizens for a century. I congratulate the faculty, staff, \nalumnae, and students of the College of St. Catherine on their 100 \nyears of excellence. I know that they will continue their great \ntradition for the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S99-4", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S99-S100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF GEOFFREY ``ROCKY'' MYERS, RECIPIENT OF THE 2004 \n                            GAGLIARDI TROPHY\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Geoffrey ``Rocky'' Myers, the senior strong safety at \nWesley College in Dover, DE, who has been named the recipient of the \n12th annual Gagliardi Trophy. This award is given annually to the \noutstanding football player in the NCAA Division III and is the \nDivision III equivalent of the Heisman Trophy. His recognition \ndemonstrates the success that comes from hard work, perseverance, and \nthe experience of a remarkable team as well as a dedicated coach, and \nthe support of an outstanding college.\n  The Gagliardi Trophy was presented to Rocky on December 16, 2004, in \nSalem, VA, in the presence of his proud parents, Gilbert and Cheryl. \nUnlike the Heisman, this trophy, sponsored by Jostens, Inc. and \nadministered by the SJU J-Club, recognizes excellence in academics and \ncommunity service, as well as athletics.\n  A native of Bowers Beach, DE, Rocky attended W.T. Chipman Middle \nSchool and Lake Forest High School through his sophomore year and \nfinished his high school career, graduating second in his class, at \nCaesar Rodney High School in Camden, DE. At Wesley, Rocky played in all \n10 games of the 2004 season for the 8-2 Wesley College Wolverines and \ntotaled 124 tackles, 62 of which were solo tackles, along with 62 \nassists. Rocky also had 6.5 tackles for a loss of 20 yards and five \ninterceptions for 84 yards. A ``Football Gazette'' National Player of \nthe Week, ECAC Co-Defensive Player of the Week and three-time ACFC \nDefensive Player of the Week, Rocky ranks 11th nationally with 12.4 \ntotal tackles per game, 13th with 1.7 passes defended per game and 30th \nwith 6.1 solo tackles per game this season.\n  Rocky was named to the All-ACFC and All-ACFC Academic Team for all \nfour years of his college career. One of only three Division III \nplayers and 15 total scholar-athletes, Rocky was named to the National \nFootball Foundation and College Hall of Fame's 2004 National Scholar-\nAthlete Class. He is the only wolverine to be named a team captain \nthree consecutive years.\n  In addition to his expertise and agility on the football field, Rocky \nis a 4.0 academic record student who is majoring in biology with a \nminor in chemistry. He was selected for his academic\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\nachievements and leadership on campus and in the neighboring \ncommunities. Rocky has done volunteer work with the youth reading \nprogram at North Dover Elementary and in the Guidance Office of the \nDover Central Middle School. He has also spent time helping the senior \ncitizens of Frederica, DE, relocate to their new senior facility and \nwas a camp counselor at the St. Thomas More Middle School Youth \nBasketball Camp.\n  At Wesley, Rocky was a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory \nCommittee for the past three years, as well as a Wesley College tutor \nfor four years. Rocky's academic achievements include a nomination to \nthe ``USA Today'' Academic All-American, National Dean's List and U.S. \nAchievement Academy College All-American Scholar.\n  The Gagliardi Trophy is named for John Gagliardi, legendary head \ncoach at St. John's University (SJU) in Collegeville, Minnesota, where \nhe became the most successful coach in college football history with \n409 wins on November 8, 2003. Gagliardi currently has 421 career \nvictories in his 56 years of coaching, 52 of those being at SJU. \nCollege Presidents nominate their top student-athletes for this award. \nThe J-Club Board of Directors narrows the field to 10 finalists and a \nnational selection committee selects the winner. Dr. Scott Miller, \nPresident of Wesley College, nominated Rocky. In the words of Dr. \nMiller, ``Rocky is a student-leader of significant note. Students like \nhim emerge only once in a generation. The fact that he is an athlete \nmakes his accomplishments even more noteworthy.''\n  Today, I rise to extend congratulations and best wishes to Rocky \nMyers and his family and all of the fine students, athletes, coaches \nand faculty at Wesley College that helped to make this award possible. \nWe wish him fun times relaxing in the California sun this summer and \nthe best of luck as he pursues graduate school in the fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S100-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF JESSE L. POOR\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJesse L. Poor, Deputy to the Commander, Anniston Army Depot, United \nStates Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command upon his retirement \nfrom Anniston Army Depot and a life of service to the Nation. Born in \nCrestview, FL, Mr. Poor earned an associate of applied science degree \nin personnel management and supervision from Gadsden State College, a \nbachelor of arts degree in history and human resource management from \nthe University of Alabama, and he is also a graduate of the Harvard \nUniversity Program for Senior Executive Fellows.\n  The work that Jesse Poor did during his tenure at the Anniston Army \nDepot has been exemplary. His dedication is evidenced by the number of \nawards he has received in recognition of his outstanding work and \nservice to the men and women of the U.S. Army. Under Jesse's \nleadership, the Anniston Army Depot's revenue more than tripled and the \ndirect labor hour execution more than doubled, all in a recent 3-year \nspan.\n  Jesse has been a catalyst in business development and partnering \nefforts that have established Anniston Army Depot as a leader within \nDOD in such efforts. In November 2000, he was instrumental in \npartnering efforts between Anniston Army Depot and General Dynamics for \nthe production of the Army's Stryker vehicle to support brigade combat \nteams. As a result of his efforts, the partnership developed production \ncapabilities and began actual production within a few months at \nAnniston with the first Stryker produced in March 2002. The result was \nfielding the vehicle on time in spite of a nearly 1-year delay to the \ncontract award due to protests from other bidders. As of November 2004, \n625 Strykers have been produced.\n  Jesse L. Poor is to be commended for his exemplary achievements and \nservice to the Nation. Jesse's steady, calm, and visionary presence has \nfostered the successful melding of the 5,600 civilians, military and \ncontractor members of Anniston Army Depot into a cohesive force \nsupporting the Army's readiness. His vast expertise in depot \nmaintenance, focus on production and efficiency, coupled with high \nquality standards, set the stage for an improved financial posture. \nJesse's commitment to the goals and ideals of the Army is without equal \nand reflects great credit upon himself, the U.S. Army Materiel Command \nand the U.S. Army.\n  I wish Jesse and his family the best now and into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S100-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF LLOYD H. ROSS\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nLloyd H. Ross upon his retirement from Newark High School in Newark, \nDE, after more than 34 years of dedicated service. He is a man with a \nkind heart, diverse interests and great abilities. Lloyd embodies the \nbest of Delaware.\n  Lloyd was born on August 25, 1948 in Nicholson, PA. He graduated from \nSusquehanna University in Pennsylvania with a B.S. in Music Education \nin 1970. He then went on to complete his Master's in Music Education at \nWest Chester University in 1974. Lloyd has also done postgraduate work \nat Peabody Conservatory, Berklee College of Music, University of \nDelaware, Ithaca University and Villanova University.\n  During the last year of his Master's program at West Chester \nUniversity, Lloyd received a job offer from Newark High School. He \ncommuted from West Chester to Newark for the year, and then moved to \nNewark. The rest, as they say, is history. Lloyd has been a fixture at \nNewark High School ever since and became an institution there over \ntime.\n  Lloyd met his wife Joan while in college at Susquehanna University. \nThey married on June 14, 1970 and now have two children, Sharon and \nJeff, and one grandchild, Ashley.\n  Over the past 3 decades, Lloyd has taken the jazz ensemble at Newark \nHigh School to national competitions including the Mobile Jazz Festival \nin Alabama, the Berklee Jazz Festival in Boston, and the All-American \nJazz Festival in Orlando, as well as numerous jazz festivals in the \ntri-state area.\n  Lloyd and the Newark High School band have performed in 105 field \nshow festivals, 107 parades, 385 football games, 148 concerts, 193 jazz \nfestivals, 158 pep assemblies, 144 special performances and 34 \ngraduations. The music department has won over 925 trophies. From 1978 \nto 1988, Lloyd directed the First State Symphonic Band in over 110 \nconcerts and 500 rehearsals.\n  Lloyd's memberships have included: Delaware Music Educations \nAssociation, National Band Association, International Association of \nJazz Educations and the Music Education National Conference.\n  Described by his friend of over 30 years, Jonathan Wittman, Lloyd is \na jovial, friendly kind-hearted man. He always looks for the humor in \nlife, and finds a way to use humor positively and as a way to get his \npoint across when teaching. He is personable and easy-going man who \nenjoys life to the fullest.\n  Lloyd plans to work part-time after his retirement with students and \nteachers at the University of Delaware. He also plans to spend time on \nhis hobbies, which include travel, photography, and woodworking.\n  Through his tireless efforts, Lloyd has made a profound difference in \nthe lives of thousands of students, while enriching and enhancing \ncountless lives in the first State. Upon his retirement, he will leave \nbehind a legacy of commitment to public service for both his children \nand grandchildren and for the generations that will follow. It is my \nprivilege to congratulate Lloyd on a truly remarkable and distinguished \ncareer. I wish him and his family only the very best in all that lies \nahead for each of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S100-3", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S100-S101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ORLAND BERGENE\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is my privilege to honor a very \nspecial man for his 43\\1/2\\ years of service with the Social Security \nAdministration. Mr. Orland Bergene was raised in Circle, MT, graduating \nfrom Circle High School in 1955. He graduated in 1960, with a degree in \nBusiness Administration, from Rocky Mountain College in Billings, MT. \nMr. Bergene and his wife, Judy, were married in 1965 and have two \nchildren, Steven and Jana.\n  Mr. Bergene has helped citizens obtain disability benefits and \ninformation through the Social Security Administration, by beginning \nhis career as a Claims Representative in Billings,\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\nMT, in June 1961. Realizing his potential, Orland was promoted to Field \nRepresentative in 1965, Operations Supervisor in Grand Forks, ND, in \n1971, and Staff Officer at the Denver Regional Office in 1973.\n  Mr. Bergen was selected for the Staff Development Program in January \nof 1975 and became the Public Affairs Assistant in the Regional Office \nin Denver, CO, in August of that same year. He moved to Pueblo, CO, in \n1978 as Assistant District Manager and was reassigned as branch manager \nin LaJunta, CO, in January of 1993. Orland served on a variety of \ndetails in the Denver regional office and the Colorado Disability \nDetermination Services, until being reassigned in January 1994 and \ncoming home to Montana to his present position as district manager in \nthe Social Security Administration's Billings District Office, as their \ndistrict manager.\n  When Mr. Bergene retired January 3, 2005, we lost a very dedicated \nand caring public servant. He is an inspiration to us all, and a great \nteacher to many who have worked for and with the Social Security \nAdministration. I have personal knowledge of Orland's dedication, and \ncommitment, not only to his profession, but more importantly to the \npeople he worked with, and the citizens he worked for.

EVATT\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I take the opportunity to \nnote the impending retirement of James W. Evatt from The Boeing Company \nand congratulate him for his 4 decades of service to our country.\n  In all the debates over defense programs we often forget the human \ndimensions of these issues. It is all too easy to think of programs by \ntheir names and forget that real people work hard every day to make a \ndifference in the defense of our country.\n  Jim Evatt has been one these people for the past 40 years, first \nduring 22 years of service in the Air Force and then these last 18 \nyears with Boeing. To day that the emergence of our Nation has been a \nremarkable success, one we can be so proud of, is due in no small \nmeasure to the fact that we can claim remarkable people like Jim Evatt \namong our most devoted citizens.\n  Jim was born in Norman, OK, less than 6 months before the United \nStates entered World War II. Jim attended the University of Oklahoma \nfor a year before deciding that the Air Force Academy was the right \nplace to be. After graduation he served with distinction in the Air \nForce in Viet Nam, first flying B-52 missions and then flying the O-2 \naircraft as a forward air controller. He held positions in a variety of \nassignments as a pilot in both the Strategic and Tactical Air Commands. \nJim was part of the B-1 Joint Test Force, was the special assistant for \nthe B-1B program to the deputy chief of staff for research, \ndevelopment, and acquisition, and from 1983-1985 commanded the 2nd \nBombardment Wing, the Strategic Air Command's largest operational unit. \nIn his last Government assignment he held the dual positions of \nDirector of Special Programs for the deputy chief of staff for \nresearch, development, and acquisition and Director of Low Observable \nTechnology for the Defense Department.\n  Our Nation owes Jim Evatt a debt of gratitude just for his Air Force \nservice, from his combat assignments in Viet Nam to his intimate \ninvolvement in the development of stealth technology.\n  When Jim retired from the Air Force he went right to work at Boeing, \nintent upon continuing to contribute to our Nation's defense. He has \nheld numerous positions over his 18 years at Boeing, to include \nPresident of the Information and Communication Systems Groups; \nExecutive Vice President of the Defense and Space Group; Vice President \nof Marketing and Strategic Analysis; Director of Strategic Analysis and \nAdvanced Development; Program Manager for the Grumman/Boeing/Lockheed \nAX fighter aircraft team for the Military Airplanes Division; Director \nof Advanced Product Development; and Director of Preliminary Design.\n  Jim Evatt's contributions to our Nation's defense over the last 5 \nyears are particularly noteworthy, during which time he has been \nindispensable to the progress of America's missile defense program. Jim \nbecame the program manager of the Groundbased Midcourse Defense \nprogram, or GMD as it is now known, shortly after Integrated Flight \nTest-5 ended in a failure.\n  First he led Boeing's examination of that failure, and then was \nrewarded with the opportunity to lead GMD's industry team. In \ncombination with Major General Bill Nance, now retired, Jim focused the \nGMD program on those activities which were necessary to evolve the \nprogram from what was essentially a demonstration to a deployed system. \nThat they did this during a period of time in which the executive \nbranch was focused more on preserving the ABM Treaty as the so-called \n``cornerstone of strategic stability'' than it was on protecting \nAmerica, Americans, and American interests from the threat of missile \nattack is truly remarkable and something for which future generations \nwill be grateful.\n  In the year prior to fielding ground-based interceptions at Ft. \nGreely, AK, Jim again assumed direct responsibility for industry's \nconduct of the GMD program. I am confident that our Nation's deployment \nof interceptors is due in no small measure to the leadership and \ndedication of Jim Evatt.\n  I could go on at some length, but to do that would only embarrass \nthis humble, God-fearing patriot. We sometimes wonder how our Nation \ncame to be so great, where we find Americans so willing to put their \ncountry before themselves. The answer is that we find these people in \nplaces like Norman, OK, where service to our country is an honor beyond \nall others and its own reward.\n  I offer my gratitude and congratulations to Jim for all he has done \nin 40 years of service to our Nation, and wish him and his wife Tammy \nmy very best wishes in their well-deserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S101-2", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2005, the \nSecretary of the Senate, on January 6, 2005, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n  H.R. 241.

Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of \nthe U.S. Congress, Reverend Clergy, fellow Americans, welcome to the \nU.S. Capitol and the 55th Presidential Inauguration, where in a few \nmoments President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard B. Cheney \nwill reaffirm their solemn oath of obligation to support and defend the \nConstitution.\n\n  The inaugural ceremony is a seminal moment in our Nation's history. \nIt is the culmination of a triumphant democratic process that for \ncenturies has placed power in the will of the people, and a unique \nmoment when our leaders stand before the Nation and take an oath to \nuphold a set of principles chosen by those people. It is a time when \nall Americans can unite in appreciation of our great Republic, while \nlooking to the future with confidence and vision.\n  This ceremony, like the shining dome of the Capitol above us, is an \nenduring symbol of America's strength and stability in both challenging \nand prosperous times. As President Ronald Reagan said in his first \ninaugural address, ``Freedom and the dignity of the individual have \nbeen more available here than any other place on Earth.'' The price of \nthis freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling \nto pay that price.\n  Since we last met here, America has been challenged and it has \nresponded to those great tests with strength and steadfast courage of \nconviction. We responded by continuing to be a beacon of hope that has \nled so many from the shadow of tyranny into the light of freedom.\n  Today, we honor America. Today, we celebrate the ever expanding \nopportunities of her people. And today we also honor the brave men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces who have sacrificed to guarantee our freedom.\n  (Applause.)\n  They are standing vigil today to spread peace and freedom throughout \nthe world. Since 1789, Americans have gathered in peaceful, dignified \nceremonies to reaffirm the authority of our chief executives. So it is \nin that tradition that we gather here again today looking out over the \nexpanse of greatness that is America to celebrate our Nation, to \ncommemorate its rich history of achievement, to advance the intrepid \nhopes that reside in the hearts of our citizens, and to give thanks to \nGod for his blessings upon us all.\n  In that spirit, I call now on the Reverend Doctor Luis Leon, who will \ndeliver the invocation. Dr. Leon.\n  Rev. LEON. Let us pray.\n  Most gracious and eternal God, we gather today as a grateful people \nto enjoy the many blessings You have bestowed on this Nation.\n  We are grateful for Your vision which inspired the Founders of our \nNation to create this democratic experiment as one nation under God, \nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n  We are grateful to You that You have brought to these shores a \nmultitude of peoples of many ethnic, religious, and language \nbackgrounds, and yet have fashioned one nation out of so many cultures \nand traditions.\n  Even as we celebrate this great moment, we remember before You the \nmembers of our Armed Forces. We commend them to Your care. Give them \ncourage to carry out their duties and courage to face the perils which \nbeset them and grant them always a sense of Your presence in all that \nthey do.\n  Finally, today, we are especially grateful for this inauguration \nwhich marks a new beginning in our journey as a people and a nation. We \npray that You will shower the elected leaders of this land, and \nespecially George, our President, and Richard, our Vice President, with \nYour lifegiving spirit. Fill them with the love of truth \nand righteousness that they may serve You and this Nation ably and be \nglad to do Your will. Endow their hearts with Your spirit of wisdom \nthat they may lead us in reviewing the ties of mutual respect which \nform our civic life so that peace may prevail with righteousness and \njustice with order.\n\n  We pray that You will strengthen their resolve as they lead our \nNation seeking to serve You in this world, and that this good and \ngenerous country may be a blessing to the nations of the world. And may \nthey lead us to become, in the words of Martin Luther King, members of \na beloved community, loving our neighbors as ourselves so that all of \nus may more closely come to fulfill the promise of our Founding \nFathers: one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice \nfor all. All this we ask in Your most holy name. Amen.\n  Mr. LOTT. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the Chief Justice of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States, the Honorable William H. \nRehnquist.\n  (Applause.)\n  Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce one of today's \nmost popularly acclaimed mezzo-sopranos, Ms. Susan Graham of Texas, to \nsing ``Bless This House.''\n  (Performance by Ms. Susan Graham.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Susan.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, please join me now in welcoming the senior \nSenator from Connecticut, the Honorable Christopher J. Dodd.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Senator Lott. President and Mrs. Bush, Vice \nPresident and Mrs. Cheney, fellow citizens, the Vice President of the \nUnited States will now take the oath of office. His wife, Lynne, and \ntheir daughters, Elizabeth Cheney Perry and Mary Cheney, will hold the \nfamily Bible. I now have the honor to present the Speaker of the House \nof Representatives, the Honorable J. Dennis Hastert, to administer the \noath of office to Vice President Richard Bruce Cheney. Mr. Speaker.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. HASTERT. Mr. Vice President, please raise your right hand and \nrepeat after me.\n  The Speaker of the House of Representatives, J. Dennis Hastert, \nadministered to the Vice President the oath of office prescribed by the \nConstitution, which he repeated, as follows:\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\n  ``I, Richard Bruce Cheney, do solemnly swear that I will support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies \nforeign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the \nsame; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental \nreservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully \ndischarge the duties of my office of which I am about to enter. So help \nme God.''\n  Mr. LOTT. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome internationally \nacclaimed mezzo-soprano, Ms. Denyce Graves, to perform ``American \nAnthem.''\n  (Performance by Ms. Denyce Graves.)\n  Mr. LOTT. That sets the tone for what we are about to do.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce the \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, the Honorable \nWilliam H. Rehnquist, who will administer the Presidential oath of \noffice. Justice Rehnquist.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Raise your right hand, Mr. President, and repeat \nafter me.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States, William H. Rehnquist, \nadministered to the President the oath of office prescribed by the \nConstitution, which he repeated, as follows:\n  ``I, George Walker Bush, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully \nexecute the office of President of the United States and will, to the \nbest of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States. So help me God.''\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDENT. Vice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President \nCarter, President Bush, President Clinton, Members of the United States \nCongress, Reverend Clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens.\n  (Applause.)\n  On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate \nthe durable wisdom of our Constitution and recall the deep commitments \nthat unite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, \nmindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to \nfulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.\n  At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I \nuse, but by the history we have seen together. For a half century, \nAmerica defended its own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. \nAfter the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of \nrepose, years of sabbatical--and then there came a day of fire.\n  We have seen our vulnerability and we have seen its deepest source. \nFor as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and \ntyranny, prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder, \nviolence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the \nmost defended borders and raise a mortal threat. There is only one \nforce of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and \nexpose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent \nand tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.\n  (Applause.)\n  We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The \nsurvival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of \nliberty in other lands.\n  (Applause.)\n  The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in \nall the world.\n  (Applause.)\n  America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From \nthe day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on \nthis Earth has rights and dignity and matchless value because they bear \nthe image of the Maker of heaven and Earth.\n  (Applause.)\n  Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-\ngovernment, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves \nto be a slave.\n  (Applause.)\n  Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is \nthe honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgent \nrequirement of our Nation's security, and the calling of our time. So \nit is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of \ndemocratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with \nthe ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\n\n  (Applause.)\n  This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend \nourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by \nits nature, must be chosen and defended by citizens, and sustained by \nthe rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of \na nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect \ncustoms and traditions very different from our own. America will not \nimpose its own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead \nis to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and \nmake their own way.\n  The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of \ngenerations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. \nAmerica's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the \noppressed, America's influence is considerable, and we will use it \nconfidently in freedom's cause.\n  (Applause.)\n  My most solemn duty is to protect this Nation and its people from \nfurther attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test \nAmerica's resolve, and have found it firm.\n  (Applause.)\n  We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every \nnation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and \nfreedom, which is eternally right.\n  (Applause.)\n  America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, \nor that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human \nbeing aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.\n  We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that \nsuccess in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own \npeople.\n  (Applause.)\n  America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights \nmust be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are \nsecured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the \nlong run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no \nhuman rights without human liberty.\n  (Applause.)\n  Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty--although \nthis time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of \nfreedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, \nshould never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the \ncall of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept \nthe existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the \npossibility of permanent slavery.\n  (Applause.)\n  Liberty will come to those who love it.\n  Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world. All who live \nin tyranny and hopelessness can know the United States will not ignore \nyour oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your \nliberty, we will stand with you.\n  (Applause.)\n  Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know \nAmerica sees you for who you are, the future leaders of your free \ncountry.\n  The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as \nAbraham Lincoln did: ``Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not \nfor themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain \nit.''\n  The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: \nTo serve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this \njourney of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.\n  (Applause.)\n  All the allies of the United States can know we honor your \nfriendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. \nDivision among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The \nconcerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to \nour enemies' defeat.\n  Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens. From all of you, I \nhave asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you \nhave granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that \nare difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet \nbecause we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\nNation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom.\n  (Applause.)\n  As hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we \nhave lit a fire as well--a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who \nfeel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this \nuntamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.\n  A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause--in \nthe quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy; the idealistic work of \nhelping raise up free governments; the dangerous and necessary work of \nfighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in \ndeaths that honored their whole lives, and we will always honor their \nnames and their sacrifice.\n  (Applause.)\n  All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first \ntime. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. \nYou have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our \nsoldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, evil is real, and courage \ntriumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, \nlarger than yourself, and in your days you will add not just to the \nwealth of our country, but to its character.\n  (Applause.)\n  America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential \nwork at home--the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world \nmoving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and \npromise of liberty. In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the \ndignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on \nthe edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that \nmotivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill \nof Rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great \ninstitutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a \nstake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the \nhighest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society.\n  (Applause.)\n  We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement \nsavings, and health insurance, preparing our people for the challenge \nof life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or \nher own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from \nwant and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.\n  In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private \ncharacter--on integrity, and tolerance towards others, and the rule of \nconscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the \ngoverning of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, \nsupported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national \nlife by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the \nKoran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in \nevery generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came \nbefore--ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, \ntoday, and forever.\n  (Applause.)\n  In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by \nservice, mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean \nindependence from one another. Our Nation relies on men and women who \nlook after a neighbor and surround the loss with love. Americans, at \nour best, value the life we see in one another, and must always \nremember that even the unwanted have worth.\n  (Applause.)\n  Our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot \ncarry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same \ntime.\n  (Applause.)\n  From the perspective of a single day, including this day of \ndedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From \nthe viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed \nand few. Did our generations advance the cause of freedom? And did our \ncharacter bring credit to that cause?\n  These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of \nevery party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound \nto one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions which \nmust be healed to move forward in great purposes, and I will strive in \ngood faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We \nfelt the unity and fellowship of our Nation when freedom came under \nattack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. \nWe can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, \nand the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter \njustice, and the captives are set free.\n  (Applause.)\n  We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of \nfreedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is \nhuman choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a \nchosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence \nbecause freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger and dark \nplaces, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order \nof the ages, when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on \nliberty, when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner \n``Freedom Now,'' they were acting on ancient hope that is meant to be \nfulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has \na visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.\n\n  (Applause.)\n  When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the \nLiberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ``It rang as \nif it meant something.'' In our time, it means something still. \nAmerica, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout the world, \nand to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength--tested but \nnot weary--we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of \nfreedom.\n  (Applause.)\n  May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of \nAmerica.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. LOTT. At this time, I would like to present a unique performance \ncombining the U.S. Marine Band, the Navy Sea Chanters, and the Army of \nHerald Trumpets, performing ``God of our Fathers.''\n  (Musical performance.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Please stand as Pastor KirbyJon Caldwell will deliver the \nbenediction, and then please remain standing for the national anthem, \nwhich will be led by TSgt Bradley Bennett from the U.S. Air Force Band. \nFollowing the national anthem, please remain in place while the \nofficial party departs the platform. Pastor Caldwell.\n  Rev. CALDWELL. Thank you, Senator Lott. Let us pray, please.\n  O Lord God Almighty, the supply and supplier of faith and freedom, \nhow excellent is Your name in all the Earth. You are great and \ngratefully to be praised. O God, as we conclude this 55th inaugural \nceremony, we conclude it with an attitude of thanksgiving. Thank You \nfor protecting America's borders. After all, as the Psalmist reminds \nus, unless You, O God, guard the territory, our efforts will be in \nvain.\n  Thank You for our armed service personnel. And it is with unswerving \nthanksgiving that we pause to remember the persons who have made the \nultimate sacrifice to help ensure America's safety. Thank You, O God, \nfor surrounding our personnel, their families, their friends, and our \nallies with Your favor and Your faithfulness. Deploy Your host from \nHeaven so that Your will for America will be performed on Earth as it \nis already perfected in Heaven.\n  I confess that Your face will shine upon the United States of \nAmerica, granting us social peace and economic prosperity, particularly \nfor the weary and the poor.\n  I also confess, O God, that each American's latter days will be \nbetter than their former days. Let it be unto us according to Your \nwords. Rally the Republicans, the Democrats, and the Independents \naround Your common good so that America will truly become one nation \nunder God, indivisible, with liberty, justice, and equal opportunity \nfor all, including the least, the last, and the lost.\n  Bless every elected official right now. O God, I declare Your \nblessings to shower upon our President, George W. Bush. Bless him, his \nfamily, and his administration. I once again declare that\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nno weapon against them shall prosper. God, forgive us for becoming so \nensnarled in petty partisan politics that we miss Your glory and forget \nour purpose. Deliver us from the evil one, from evil itself, and from \nthe mere appearance of evil. Give us clean hearts so that we might have \nclean agendas, clean priorities and programs, and even clean financial \nstatements.\n  And now unto You, O God, the one who always has been and always will \nbe the one King of Kings and the true power broker, we glorify and \nhonor You. Respecting persons of all faiths, I humbly submit this \nprayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S105-1", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Therefore, no rollcall votes are \nexpected during Monday's session. We will continue to work through the \nPresident's nominations as they become available. We will have more to \nsay with respect to the voting schedule next week.\n  I also remind all of my colleagues that we were able to lock in a \ntime agreement on the nomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of \nState. We will debate the Rice nomination throughout the day Tuesday \nand vote on that nomination on Wednesday of next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/01/20/senate-section/article/S105-6", "month": "01", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 24, 2005, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
