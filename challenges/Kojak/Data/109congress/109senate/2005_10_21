Under the previous order, the \ncommittee-reported substitute is agreed to and considered as original \ntext for the purpose of further amendment.\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for calling this bill to the floor. In the past, we \nhave had difficulties scheduling the Labor-HHS bill. Sometimes this \nvery important appropriations bill has not received full Senate action. \nSo I thank Senator Frist for arranging the business of the Senate to \ntake up this bill.\n  I also thank the majority leader for his exhortation of Members to be \norganized, to bring their amendments to the floor. This is a very \ncomplicated bill and one where we expect a great many amendments. One \nof the institutional problems of the Senate has been that when a bill \nis pending, the Senators do not come forward promptly with amendments \nto move the bill along. For countless hours, we have sat on this floor \nwith the two lights on in a quorum call, which is our technical way of \nsaying, you do not have a quorum of Senators on the floor, a majority; \nbut what it really is, is a delaying practice, when there is nobody \npresent to carry forward the business of the Senate.\n  In consultation with the majority leader, I announced last night, \nwhile a majority of the Senators were present, that we were going to be \npressing ahead on amendments, and that I was going to urge the leader \nto go to third reading, which is a technical word for final passage, if \namendments were not offered.\n  Senator Harkin, the distinguished ranking member, whom I thank for \nhis cooperation on this bill--he and I sent out a letter stating the \nsame thing. The scourge of the Senate is the quorum call, where we do \nnot transact the business of the Senate. But when this bill moves into \nnext week, there will be a press by the managers--by Senator Harkin and \nmyself--to move to third reading or final passage, if Senators do not \ncome forward to present their amendments.\n  Mr. President, this bill contains the largest appropriation of any \nbill to come before the Senate, including the Defense bill. It calls \nfor expenditures in excess of $604 billion. That includes the payments \nfor Supplemental Security Income payments at the Social Security \nAdministration, Medicaid, and Medicare. When it comes down to the \ndiscretionary spending, this bill contains $145,693,000,000.\n  It is an extraordinarily difficult bill to structure because it \ninvolves three of the most important Departments of the Federal \nGovernment: Health, Education, and Labor. When we talk about health and \neducation, we talk about the two greatest capital assets our country \nhas. Without health, we cannot function. Without education, people \ncannot move ahead to attain their potential. So we are talking about \nrock bed issues of great importance to the American people.\n  The Department of Labor funding, similarly, is very important, \nproviding for workers' safety, for the arbitration and adjudication of \ndisputes between management and labor, to have a cohesive workforce and \nlabor peace, which is indispensable to move ahead on the work of our \ncountry.\n  We have an extraordinary staff in Bettilou Taylor and Jim Sourwine on \nthe majority side, and Ellen Murray on the minority side--a staff which \nis veteran and experienced, having served for more than a decade with \ngreat expertise in the field.\n  Senator Harkin and I have worked on a bipartisan basis. Very \nfrequently, you see clash and clamor and arguments and distension and \ndisagreement and bickering. That does not happen with the work of this \nsubcommittee. We have changed the gavel. When it passes from his hands \nto mine, or mine to his and back, it is a seamless transfer because we \nhave a common objective and we work together.\n  But that does not assist us very much when we take a look at the kind \nof funding we have in our tight subcommittee allocation. When you have \n$145 billion to work with and the many lines which must be funded, it \njust does not go very far. There is a great concern about Federal \nexpenditures, and it is a justified concern. We do spend too much \nmoney. Our deficit is too high, and our national debt is too high. But \nit is a matter of establishing priorities.\n\n  In my judgment, having been in this body, now in my 25th year, and \nbeing on the Appropriations Committee for all of those years, the \npriorities ought to be directed differently. When you talk about health \nand education, the two fundamental capital assets in our society and \nour daily lives, the funding is simply inadequate. Nevertheless, with \nthe professionalism of our staffs and with the work Senator Harkin and \nour Full Committee Chairman Senator Cochran, along with the cooperation \nof all other members of the Senate, we have amalgamated all of their \npriorities into this bill.\n  The highlights of the bill have been summarized in a comprehensive \nstatement prepared by Bettilou Taylor. In the course of this relatively \nbrief presentation, I will summarize the highlights. This budget \ncontains $29.4 billion for the National Institutes of Health which is \n$1.050 billion over last year's budget. This is a tough item to \nincrease by more than $1 billion, but we have done it with a very sharp \npencil. We have done it because the National Institutes of Health has \nthe greatest opportunity to improve the health of Americans. During the \ntenure that Senator Harkin and I have chaired this subcommittee, we \nhave increased funding from $12 to $28 billion. Now we are trying to \npush it up to 29-plus because of the enormous advances which have been \nmade in medical science as a result of what NIH has done.\n  There is great attention paid to cancer--appropriately so--and to \nheart disease--again appropriately so--and to Alzheimer's, and \nParkinson's. But there are many lesser known diseases which have a \ntremendous impact. Chairing this subcommittee has put me in the \nposition of being the recipient of calls from many people who are \nconcerned about so-called orphan diseases which may affect a relatively \nsmall number of people but are very important. These diseases are worth \narticulating.\n  I doubt that our C-SPAN 2 audience is very extensive on a Friday \nmorning--it is 6:48 A.M. in California--but when people listen and hear \nsome concern about their particular ailment, it is quite a \npsychological boost. I will take a minute or two and run through the \ndiseases NIH is working on: autism; stroke; obesity; Alzheimer's; \nParkinson's; spinal muscular atrophy; scleroderma; amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis, which is Lou Gehrig's disease; muscular dystrophy; \nosteoporosis; cancers, including breast, cervical, ovarian, lymphoma, \nmultiple myeloma, prostate, pancreatic, colon, head and neck, brain, \nlung; and then moving on, pediatric renal disorders; multiple \nsclerosis; deafness and other communication disorders; glaucoma; \nmacular degeneration; sickle cell anemia; heart disease; spinal cord \ninjury, sudden infant death syndrome; arthritis, schizophrenia, and \nother mental disorders; polycystic kidney disease; hepatitis, Cooley's \nanemia; primary immune deficiency disorders, autism, stroke, and \nobesity.\n  I would add to this list mesothelioma, an ailment I have become \nfamiliar with during the course of the past 2 years, as we are working \non an asbestos reform bill where so many people are afflicted with this \ndeadly disease which is contracted from exposure to asbestos. We are \ngoing to ask the National Institutes of Health to devote more \nresources. I say ask--not order, but ask--because NIH, on a \nprofessional basis, makes the determination for the allocation of \nfunding to keep it out of the political realm. But from what I have \nseen on mesothelioma, with thousands of people suffering from a disease \nwhich causes death, we need to find better ways of dealing with it. Our \nbill on asbestos reform would provide a standard of payment, the \ncreation of a trust fund of $140 billion, for which I salute my \ncolleague Senator Hatch, who preceded me as chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, for structuring this idea which we are carrying \nforward. It seeks to assist people who cannot get compensation because \ntheir companies are bankrupt. Approximately 80 companies have gone into \nbankruptcy because of asbestos claims. That is one illustration of the \npotential for the National Institutes of Health funding. I compliment \nDr. Zerhouni, Director of NIH, for doing an excellent job under very \ndifficult circumstances.\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\n  The bill contains $2 million for embryo adoptions which raises the \nissue of stem cell research. This was the legislative vehicle in 1997 \nwhich provided a prohibition against Federal funding for stem cell \nresearch where the embryo is destroyed. The House of Representatives \nhas passed legislation which would remove that prohibition. Senator \nHarkin and I have a bill pending in the Senate which would duplicate \nthe House effort to eliminate that restriction. Consideration was given \nto offering an amendment on this bill. Because this is the bill which \nhas the prohibition, it would be a logical spot to remove it. But it \nwould cause a multifaceted controversy with about five different \npositions to be inserted.\n  The majority leader has agreed to make this a priority item at the \nbeginning of the next session of Congress where all facets of the issue \nmay be explored. There have been some recent developments that there \nmay be a way to use stem cells without destroying the embryo. If that \ncan be done, it would be spectacular. But the success of that kind of \nresearch is a long way off. I personally would like to see Federal \nfunding devoted to all aspects of embryo research because the \npotentials are extraordinary. Embryonic stem cells are so superior to \nadult stem cells. There are also cord blood stem cells. But the real \nopportunity for medical advance lies in the flexible embryonic stem \ncells which can, for example, be injected into a diseased heart, where \nthe embryonic stem cells could have the potential to replace diseased \nheart cells. So it is my hope that we will be able to move ahead on \nthis line.\n  The subcommittee has held 17 hearings on this subject, starting in \nDecember of 1998, a few days after embryonic stem cells burst on the \nscene. Our most recent hearing was earlier this week, on October 19, to \ncoincide with the announcement in South Korea that they were starting a \nworldwide research program with adjunct facilities in San Francisco and \nEngland. While I applaud the efforts of the South Koreans or anyone to \nadvance medical research with stem cells, it is regrettable that the \nUnited States has not maintained a lead in this line. The objections to \nembryonic stem cell research come from the contention that these \nembryos have the potential to create life. The conclusive answer to \nthat argument is that there are some 400,000 embryos that are frozen \nand are going to be destroyed. Senator Harkin and I and the \nsubcommittee have taken the lead in putting up some $2 million for \nembryo adoption.\n  If all of these embryos could be adopted, produce life, I would not \nhave any interest in advocating scientific research on them. But if \nthey are going to be thrown away, it makes a lot more sense to use them \nthan to destroy them. But to the extent that adoption can be promoted, \nthis subcommittee supports this approach.\n  Some of the other items worth noting specifically: almost $10 million \nfor a cord blood stem cell bank, which does provide a line for some \nadvances on medical research with stem cells; $2 million for start-up \ncosts on administering asbestos claims, anticipating passage of an \nasbestos reform bill--not counting any chickens there; it is a complex \nbill, and the majority leader has committed to bringing it up as one of \nthe first items next year; it is a vital item, but this bill \nanticipates some costs along that line--$1 billion for the mesothelioma \nregistry and tissue bank, which we like to see NIH supplement on \nmesothelioma research; $225 million to continue construction projects \nfor the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n  We are calling upon the Centers for Disease Control repeatedly to \ntake on major emergency tasks. Right now they are involved in trying to \nfind a potential response for pandemic flu. Senator Harkin and I \nvisited the Centers for Disease Control several years ago and found the \nphysical facilities in a state of total disrepair. It would not be \ninappropriate to note that the Presiding Officer is a distinguished \nSenator from the State of Georgia who has filled my ear with the \nimportance--and pleasantly so--of maintaining that funding for CDC. We \nhave $225 million in the bill to improve the facilities at the CDC. \nThis is illustrative of the difficulties which this subcommittee faces \nin responding to so many urgent needs. We have to have our pencils very \nsharp to establish priorities.\n  It is my wish, hope, projection that the Senate, as a whole, would \nestablish the priorities in our overall budget which will give more \nrecognition to health, education, and labor issues.\n  This bill contains $2.183 billion for low-income energy assistance. \nThat is a figure which is the best we can do, but is palpably \ninsufficient. I anticipate an amendment, which if no one else offers \none, the chairman will, to increase funding for LIHEAP. It is an \nemergency matter. It is an outgrowth in large measure of Katrina. With \nthe prices of oil and gas going sky high and so many of our seniors \nfacing the alternative of either heating or eating, this is an item \nwhich grips much of our country and needs further attention.\n  We have $300 million for Children's Hospital graduate medical \neducation; $1.8 billion for community health centers; $454 million for \nhealth professions; $104 million for Healthy Start. That is a program I \ntake special pride in because it was initiated in the early 1980s after \nI visited the Alma Illery Hospital in Pittsburgh, and saw for the first \ntime a 1-pound baby, a human being about as big as the size of my hand.\n  Healthy Start was named after Head Start to give these infants of \nminuscule physiology a chance to live. We incorporated some of Dr. \nKoop's ideas on four prenatal visits and one postvisit.\n  That fund has grown and has taken on a very important role of taking \ncare of the weakest in our society--1-pound babies.\n  We put the budget for Head Start at $6.8 billion; $1.6 billion for \nworker protection programs; $5.25 billion for job training; almost $13 \nbillion for title I education to disadvantage students; $10.7 billion \nfor special education, State grants. The Federal Government has an \nobligation to do more, and each year we have increased funding for \nspecial education programs and have stretched the funding to the \nmaximum to come to that figure; $13.2 billion for Pell grants; $4.3 \nbillion for the Pell grant shortfall; $306 million for GEAR UP, an idea \nwhich originated with Congressman Chaka Fattah, from Philadelphia. This \nis a mentoring program and was brought to my attention by the \nCongressman some 6 years ago. Over the years we have spent some $2 \nbillion on this program and these are funds very well spent--to take \nyoung people in the minority community who have not had the benefit of \na sound family life, who need some guidance, taking them at the eighth \ngrade and moving them through high school. The results have been \nastounding. It has been projected on a nationwide basis. We have $94 \nmillion for youth offender programs; $45 million for the new youth gang \nprevention initiative; $22.5 million for youth violence prevention at \nthe Centers for Disease Control. This program will be looking at the \nterrible incidence of youth violence plaguing my hometown, Philadelphia \nand plaguing my adopted hometown, Washington, DC, as well as so many \nother cities in America. There is $400 million for the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. The list goes on.\n  I know my distinguished colleague, Senator Grassley, is awaiting an \nopportunity to speak. This highlights the contents of this bill where \nwe have stretched the dollars as far as we can. We understand that our \ncolleagues will have other ideas for amendments, and we urge them to \ncome forward.\n  I do not make the determination as to when we go to third reading or \nfinal passage because I am not the majority leader, but I have \nconsulted with Senator Frist, and if the bill is stalled by prolonged \nquorum calls when we move into next week and we do not have amendments \noffered, I am going to use my best efforts to move ahead to final \npassage.\n  One other item which I have discussed with the leadership is the \nlength of time on the rollcall votes. We have a rule for 15-minute \nvotes, and there is a practice of a 5-minute extension. I note the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer nodding in agreement. Sometimes the \nvotes go 10, 15, 20 minutes over the original 20 minutes and consume a \nlot of time. When we have 95 Senators in the Chamber waiting for the \nnext vote, when we have votes stacked, that just is not right. There \nwas a day not too long ago when the time limits on voting were strictly \nenforced. Let me tell you and the few people watching on C-SPAN, \nSenators came and voted. If they know they can stretch out the\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\nvote, they are going to stretch out the vote. And if you know you have \nto be here on time, you will be here on time. It only takes one vote \ncutoff to impose strict discipline even on the 100 feudal barons who \noccupy the Senate.\n  I ask the 101st Senator, Bettilou Taylor, is there anything more? She \nsays no.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my full statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                 Floor Statement, Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n FY 2006 LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS \n                                  BILL\n\n       Mr. President, the legislation before the Senate today \n     includes funding for the Labor, Health and Human Services and \n     Education programs at the 302(b) allocation of $141.6 \n     billion. The subcommittee's allocation is about the same as \n     the President's budget request and $860 million below the \n     amount that the House of Representatives had to spend on \n     Labor-HHS programs. The Senate bill also has an additional \n     $3.4 billion to spend in fiscal year 2006 which was achieved \n     by requiring that Supplemental Security Income benefit checks \n     be paid on Monday, October 2, 2006, instead of on Friday, \n     September 29, 2006. On a program level basis, the bill before \n     us is $2.3 billion or 1.5 percent over the fiscal year 2005 \n     appropriation and $3.7 billion or 2.6 percent over the \n     President's budget. Because of the amounts assumed in the \n     budget resolution, the funds contained in this bill are not \n     at the levels that I would like, but we did our best given \n     the subcommittee's budget constraints.\n       The funds contained in this bill address this Nation's \n     public health problems and continue to strengthen our \n     biomedical research, assure a quality education for America's \n     children, and offer opportunities for individuals seeking to \n     improve job skills.\n       At this time, I want to take this opportunity to thank the \n     distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, for his hard \n     work on this bill and helping to bring the bill through the \n     subcommittee and full committee.\n       Some of the key funding levels in the bill include: $29.4 \n     billion for the National Institutes of Health, $1.050 billion \n     over fiscal year 2005; $2 million for embryo adoption; $9.8 \n     million for a cord blood stem cell bank; $2 million for \n     startup costs for administering asbestos claims; $1 million \n     for mesothelioma registry and tissue bank; $225 million to \n     continue construction projects at the Centers for Disease \n     Control; $2.183 billion for Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance; $300 million for Children's Hospital graduate \n     medical education; $1.8 billion for community health centers; \n     $454 million for health professions; $104 million for Healthy \n     Start; $6.8 billion for Head Start; $1.6 billion for worker \n     protection programs; $5.25 billion for job training programs; \n     $12.8 billion for title I grants to disadvantaged students; \n     $10.7 billion for special education State grants; $13.2 \n     billion for Pell grants to support a maximum grant of $4,050; \n     $4.3 billion to pay for the Pell grant shortfall; $306.5 \n     million for GEAR UP; $94 million for youth offender programs; \n     $45 million for a new youth gang prevention initiative; $22.5 \n     million for youth violence prevention at the Centers for \n     Disease Control; $400 million for the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting, in addition, $35 million is provided for \n     digitalization conversion; and $40 million for the satellite.\n       Let me discuss in detail the major elements of this bill:\n       The bill before the Senate contains $29.3 billion for the \n     National Institutes of Health. The $1 billion increase over \n     the fiscal year 2005 appropriation will continue the \n     important work of thousands of researchers across this \n     Nation. These additional funds are critical in catalyzing \n     scientific discoveries that will lead to a better \n     understanding in preventing and treating the disorders that \n     afflict men, women, and children in our society.\n       Each year, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee holds numerous \n     hearings on medical research issues. Testimony is heard from \n     the NIH Institute Directors, medical experts, patients, \n     family members, and advocates asking for increased biomedical \n     research funding to find the causes and cures for diseases \n     Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury, \n     muscular dystrophy, ALS, AIDS, cancer, diabetes, heart \n     disease, cancer. But the diseases I just mentioned are the \n     ones that everyone knows. However, there are a number of \n     orphan diseases, those affecting 200,000 people or less, that \n     are just as important but not often talked about. Research \n     also needs to be specifically focused on orphan diseases such \n     as spinal muscular atrophy, Ataxia's, Batten disease, \n     fibromyalgia, Fragile X and spina bifida.\n       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the lead \n     Federal agency for protecting the health and safety of \n     Americans at home and abroad. The CDC's ability to respond \n     quickly to address this nation's health concerns has been \n     proven over the last several years. Within minutes of the \n     September 11 attack, CDC set up an emergency operations \n     center and began to deploy supplies and staff, isssuing \n     health alerts and responding to State needs. During the \n     anthrax crisis, CDC redirected more than 2,000 staff to focus \n     their resources to identifying the disease and ensuring that \n     health professionals were properly trained in recognizing the \n     signs of anthrax. During the recent gulf coast hurricanes, \n     the CDC staff was on the ground to assess and mitigate the \n     infectious disease risk to residents of flooded areas. To \n     address these critical needs, the bill includes $6.2 billion \n     for programs at the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention. A few years ago, Senator Harkin and I visited the \n     CDC and were appalled at the deplorable conditions of the \n     buildings and facilities in Atlanta. Therefore, the committee \n     has included $225 million to continue the planning, design, \n     and construction of new facilities, as well as repair and \n     renovation of the existing structures.\n       More than 35 new emerging infectious diseases were \n     identified between 1973 and 2002. Recent experiences with \n     West Nile virus, SARS, and avian flu illustrate the vital \n     need to strengthen this Nation's capacity to identify and \n     combat emerging infectious diseases. The committee has \n     included $1.7 billion to improve this Nation's research \n     capacities and to detect and control emerging infectious \n     disease threats in the United States and around the world.\n       Over the past several years, the Labor-HHS Subcommittee has \n     held several hearings to explore the factors leading to \n     medical errors. The subcommittee heard testimony from family \n     members and patients detailing their experiences with medical \n     mistakes. The Institute of Medicine also gave testimony and \n     outlined findings from their recent report which indicated \n     that 98,000 deaths occur each year because of medical errors. \n     The bill before the Senate contains $84 million to reduce \n     medical errors.\n       To continue this Nation's efforts to address bioterrorism \n     threats, the bill provides $2.3 billion.\n       To help provide primary health care services to the \n     medically indigent and underserved populations in rural and \n     urban areas, the bill contains $1.8 billion for community \n     health centers. This amount represents an increase of $105 \n     million over the fiscal year 2005 appropriation.\n       For prevention and treatment of substance abuse, the bill \n     includes $3.4 billion, including $2.1 billion for treatment \n     programs, $202 million for prevention and $901 million for \n     mental health programs. The latest estimates indicate that \n     millions of Americans with serious substance abuse go \n     untreated each year. The amount provided will help address \n     the treatment gap.\n       The bill provides $2.183 billion for the Low-Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. LIHEAP is a key program \n     for low-income families in Pennsylvania and States throughout \n     the Nation. Funding supports grants to States to deliver \n     critical assistance to low income households to help meet \n     higher energy costs.\n       For programs serving the elderly, the bill before the \n     Senate recommends $3.17 billion, including $436.7 million for \n     the community service employment program for programs to \n     provide part-time employment opportunities for low-income \n     elderly; $354.1 million for supportive services and senior \n     centers; $219.7 million for the national senior volunteer \n     corps; $718.7 million for senior nutrition programs; $1.09 \n     billion for research conducted at the National Institute on \n     Aging; and $160.7 million for family and native American \n     caregiver support programs.\n       The bill includes $6 billion for AIDS research, prevention \n     and services. Included in this amount is $2.08 billion for \n     Ryan White programs, an increase of $10 million; $657.6 \n     million for AIDS prevention programs at the Centers for \n     Disease Control and $2.9 billion for AIDS research at the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n       The bill includes $574 million for efforts to fight HIV/\n     AIDS, TB, and Malaria globally, $100 million for the Global \n     Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, $124 million for the CDC \n     Global AIDS program and $350 million for international AIDS \n     research at the NIH.\n       To enable all children to develop and function at their \n     highest potential, the bill includes $6.87 billion for the \n     Head Start program, an increase of $31 million over last \n     year's appropriation.\n       To enhance this Nation's investment in education, the bill \n     before the Senate contains $56.7 billion for discretionary \n     education programs, an increase of $143 million over last \n     year's funding level and $501 million more than the \n     President's budget request.\n       The bill includes $12.8 billion, an increase of $100 \n     million for title I grants to school districts. These funds \n     will provide services to approximately 15 million school \n     children in nearly all school districts in the nation.\n       For impact aid programs, the bill includes $1.24 billion. \n     Included in the recommendation is: $50 million for payments \n     for children with disabilities; $1.1 billion for basic \n     support payments; and $65 million for payments for Federal \n     property. In addition, $18 million is available for \n     construction activities at certain impact aid-eligible \n     schools.\n       For special education State grants, the bill includes $11.8 \n     billion, an increase of $100.5 million more than provided in \n     fiscal year 2005. These funds will help local educational \n     agencies meet the requirement that all children with \n     disabilities have access to a free, appropriate public \n     education, and all infants and toddlers with disabilities \n     have access to early intervention services. These funds will \n     serve an estimated 6.9 million children age 3-21, with \n     Federal support providing $1,542 per child.\n       The bill includes $1 billion for the Reading First State \n     grants program which provides funds to implement \n     comprehensive reading\n\n[[Page S11731]]\n\n     instruction programs to ensure that every child can read by \n     the end of the third grade. Also included is $104 million for \n     the Early Reading First Program which funds programs that \n     support activities in existing preschool programs designed to \n     enhance the verbal bills, phonological awareness, letter \n     knowledge, pre-reading skills and early language development \n     of children ages 3 through 5. To help struggling middle and \n     high school students improve their reading skills the bill \n     includes $35 million.\n       For community learning centers activities, such as before \n     and afterschool, recreational, drug, violence prevention and \n     family literacy programs, the bill includes $991 million for \n     21st Century Community Learning Centers.\n       The bill provides $306.5 million for Gaining Early \n     Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. These \n     funds will be used to assist high schools to help low-income \n     students prepare for and pursue postsecondary education.\n       To improve post-secondary education opportunities for low-\n     income, first-generation college students, the committee \n     recommendation provides $836.5 million for the TRIO program, \n     to assist in more intensive outreach and support services for \n     low income youth.\n       The bill includes $217 million for charter school grants \n     which help in the planning, development and implementation of \n     charter schools. Funding for this important program has more \n     than doubled since fiscal year 1999.\n       Also included is $26 million for voluntary public school \n     choice to expand programs, especially for parents whose \n     children attend low-performing public schools.\n       For student aid programs, the bill provides $15.1 billion, \n     an increase of $838 million over last year's amount. Pell \n     grants, the cornerstone of student financial aid is funded at \n     $4,050. The bill also includes $4.3 billion to pay off the \n     estimated Pell grant shortfall. The bill also includes an \n     increase of $26 million for the supplemental educational \n     opportunity grants program.\n       In this Nation, we know all too well that unemployment \n     wastes valuable talent and potential, and ultimately weakens \n     our economy. The bill before us today provides $5.25 billion \n     for job training programs. This includes $1.58 billion for \n     the Job Corps; $893 million for adult training; and $1.47 \n     billion for retraining dislocated workers.\n       The bill provides $1.55 billion for worker protection \n     programs. While progress has been made in this area, there \n     are still far too many work-related injuries and illnesses. \n     The funds provided will continue the programs that inspect \n     business and industry, assist employers in weeding out \n     occupational hazards and protect workers' pay and pensions.\n       There are many other notable accomplishments in this bill, \n     but for the sake of time, I mentioned just several of the key \n     highlights, so that the Nation may grasp the scope and \n     importance of this bill.\n       In closing, I again thank Senator Harkin and his staff and \n     the other Senators on the subcommittee for their cooperation.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the situation in \nLouisiana, particularly New Orleans, as it relates to the Katrina \nhurricane. I do that because of a very devoted constituent by the name \nof Craig Van Waardhuizen of 3716 Pearl Lane, Waterloo, IA. We are \nmembers of Prairie Lakes Church, Cedar Falls, IA, a Baptist church. He \napproached me because he had bad experiences in trying to help people \nin Louisiana at the height of the hurricane and the period of time \nthereafter.\n  He says things just were not right. That is quite obvious to all of \nthe country. I had a chance to hear it from a person who witnessed it. \nHe kept a diary of his experiences. He is a sincere enough individual \nto spend time with me, sincere enough individual to put things down in \nwriting, and he is a sincere enough person who would like to have \nthings that happened to him not happen again in a future natural \ndisaster.\n  So I promised my friend in Waterloo that I would make sure the entire \nSenate knew of his situation. It will be on record for people to refer \nto so corrective action can be taken.\n  I suppose most of this falls in the area of FEMA's responsibility, \nbut I am not so sure but what some of it doesn't fall into the area of \nlocal responders and to State people as well. But FEMA is the one most \nreferred to. So I am going to spend my time reading word for word from \nthis diary so that people will know the trials and tribulations of one \nbus driver, trying to help people all the way from Iowa, going to \nLouisiana to help people there who had problems.\n  This starts on September 1, which is the Thursday after Katrina hit. \nI believe Katrina hit either on that Saturday or Sunday, the 27th or \n28th of August. Presumably some time after Katrina hit, my constituent \nfriend was desiring to help the people in need there. He was affiliated \nwith a bus company that could provide transportation. This starts on \nSeptember 1, but presumably on the days of Monday, Tuesday, or \nWednesday before September 1, he was trying to get involved in helping:\n\n       September 1, 2005, Thursday: Another day of searching on \n     the internet and contacting our motorcoach associations has \n     brought no success as we (Northwest Iowa Transportation, \n     Inc.) look for ways to help in New Orleans. We have coaches \n     and drivers available to go help in moving people out of the \n     New Orleans area. However, we do not believe that we should \n     just drive down to New Orleans without any contact. It is \n     discouraging when you want to help and yet can't find the \n     avenue to help.\n       September 2, Friday: There is a light in the tunnel. Today \n     we were contacted by Utah Transportation Management to see if \n     we had any coaches and drivers that could go help in \n     evacuation of New Orleans. Finally a way to head to New \n     Orleans and provide the assistance that we have wanted to do \n     since a hurricane hit last Monday. Since this help will fall \n     under FEMA we will be able to use four drivers and two \n     motorcoaches to drive straight through to New Orleans. After \n     finding three other drivers who were willing to help in this \n     effort I head out to New Orleans. We pack extra supplies in \n     the coaches along with water and food for ourselves. We also \n     take along extra paper towels and toilet paper. About 9:00 \n     p.m. we head south from Waterloo--\n\n  That is Waterloo, IA--\n\n     ready to go provide assistance to those in need.\n       Saturday, September 3: Driving straight through the night \n     and switching off with driving we arrive at the staging area \n     at Le Place, LA. The first thing we notice is the large \n     number of motorcoaches waiting in the staging area and many \n     more like ourselves, just pulling in. Our first order of \n     business was to get in line to refill with fuel. We didn't \n     stop for fuel on our way as we had been told that FEMA would \n     provide fuel for all motorcoaches when we arrived at Le \n     Place. We are ready to go to work and start moving people. \n     The fuel was brought in by the National Guard and they did \n     all the refueling in Le Place. Finally, it was our turn to \n     get fuel. While fueling, we visited with the other drivers to \n     find out what had been happening. We learned that after \n     fueling you would get in another line and wait for orders. \n     Nobody seemed to know who was in charge of the operation and \n     there was very little communication. Finally a man with an \n     orange vest came and asked us to get in line to go transport \n     people. We lined up with 12 other coaches. Nobody moved until \n     the state patrol was ready to provide escort. At last we have \n     action. We are headed into New Orleans to do what we came \n     down to do, move people. We had traveled about 10 miles when \n     we were pulled onto the shoulder. No reason given for pulling \n     all of us over. We sat and waited on the side of the highway \n     wondering what was going to happen.\n       After a waiting about 45 minutes we started traveling \n     again, and it was soon apparent\n\n[[Page S11732]]\n\n     that we were headed back to the staging area. This whole \n     operation seems to lack leadership and direction. We arrived \n     back at the staging area at Le Place. Then we were sent down \n     I-10 to the scale house and were staged with about 40 other \n     coaches. Even the State patrol assigned to us didn't know \n     what was going on. About 10 pm a deputy sheriff patrol showed \n     up with some food for us. They didn't have any news or \n     information. About 11 pm the State patrol said to stay with \n     the motorcoach as we might be called upon at any time. As \n     drivers we decided to get as much rest as we could while we \n     had the opportunity.\n\n  So then presumably they slept the evening. That is a presumption on \nmy part because it goes on now to Sunday, September 4. This is the \nfourth day of this tribulation.\n\n       Last night was a long night with little sleep as it is hard \n     to sleep on the coach. About 4 am a group of school buses \n     arrived from Houston, TX. They had been told to report to \n     this staging area and wait. The morning passed by very slow \n     and we never saw or heard from anybody that knew what was \n     actually happening. This is really amazing as we are all here \n     to work and provide help and we are just sitting along the \n     interstate. At the scale house on the other side of the \n     interstate a unit of federal border patrol agents is also \n     waiting for instructions. They have been waiting since \n     Tuesday for orders.\n\n  So that means that they had been waiting for 5 days, the Federal \nborder patrol was waiting--that's my assumption--waiting for orders. My \nwriter says:\n\n       I asked the state patrol to radio to the main staging area \n     where we fueled to see what was going on. The patrol had as \n     many questions as we did. It sure seems like mass confusion \n     and no clear leader. I really wonder who is in charge of this \n     operation. About noon a guy shows up in an orange vest and \n     tells us that we are moving to a new staging area at Lake \n     Charles, LA. Soon the rumor is going around through the \n     drivers that we will be moving people out of temporary \n     shelters to better places. We move to Lake Charles with high \n     hopes that we will finally be moving people. At the edge of \n     Lake Charles we are pulled onto the shoulder of the \n     interstate. With over 60 motorcoaches sitting on the shoulder \n     of a major interstate (I-10), this is an accident waiting to \n     happen. The school buses from Houston are headed back to \n     Houston as they were told there was no work for them. What a \n     waste of resources to have them drive all the way from \n     Houston to New Orleans only to turn around and head back. A \n     highway patrol escort arrives and leads us to a large parking \n     area at the Lake Charles airport. We are all parked in a row \n     with no other instructions. When the last coach is parked a \n     man who tells us he is the dispatcher for this operation \n     arrives and tells us that we are going to regroup.\n       This man has made arrangements for us to have a hot meal \n     supplied by the Lake Charles Firefighters in the armory at \n     the airport. During this meal he informs us that rooms in a \n     motel have been reserved for us for the night. As we sign up \n     for our rooms we are told to report back tomorrow at 1:30 pm \n     for more instructions. Since the rooms are in Beaumont, TX he \n     arranges to have five motorcoaches to take us as a group. At \n     least we will have a good bed to sleep in tonight and we will \n     be able to take a shower.\n\n  Now, Monday September 5.\n\n       Continued conversation with other drivers reveals only \n     rumors and no facts. About noon we head back to Lake Charles \n     to report in at this temporary dispatch office at the \n     airport. When we report in, we are told there will be no \n     movement until tomorrow. This is disappointing and hard to \n     understand, especially as we listen to the radio and hear \n     about this huge need to get people moved. Seems to me that \n     there has to be a better way to organize and run this system. \n     Who is in charge and who gives the orders to all of us \n     (drivers)? There is very limited and very poor communication. \n     If I ran operations like this, the company would lose all of \n     its business and drivers. Calling back to the office--\n\n  I think he means his own office--\n\n     and to any other contact I can come up with doesn't provide \n     any help. About 2 pm the dispatcher comes around looking for \n     two coaches that have two drivers. We are just what he is \n     looking for and we offer to be of service. He tells us to \n     head to Fort Smith, AR as soon as we can hit the road and to \n     report in at Fort Smith. We head right out and make the trip \n     to Fort Smith. As we are going down the road we find out that \n     a mistake has been made. Instead of Fort Smith at Fort Smith, \n     AR, it is Fort Chaffee. The drive to Fort Smith is a long \n     one, about 500 miles. Upon arrival we are to report to Fort \n     Chaffee for instructions. As we are travelling we begin to \n     notice many other motorcoaches headed the same direction.\n\n  September 6, Tuesday.\n\n       We arrive . . . and find the directions we were given in \n     Lake Charles to be wrong. Finally, we arrive at Fort Chaffee \n     and enter the base. The guards at the gate are very \n     surprised to see us and they wonder why we are reporting \n     at 2 a.m. The guards give us direction to the area where \n     the people are housed. We get to that area only to find \n     out nobody knows why they sent us to this base. Once again \n     I get on the phone calling the numbers I was given. These \n     calls just get voice mail and nobody ever returns the \n     calls. One of the guards gives me the phone number of the \n     base commander. I give him a call (at 2 a.m.) and have a \n     nice conversation with him. I can see that he has no \n     information to help us out. He suggests getting a motel \n     room and coming back in the morning. There are no motel \n     rooms available and it is now 4 a.m. We decide to head \n     back into Fort Smith to top off the fuel tanks and get a \n     hot breakfast. Looks like we are in a race headed nowhere. \n     At 8 a.m. we report back to the base. We are wondering why \n     we were sent over 500 miles to just sit and wait. The \n     guards at the base are telling us that the people are \n     being moved out to other places to live. Many of the other \n     coaches from Lake Charles are showing up this morning. \n     About 10 a.m. there is movement and they begin to load \n     coaches to move people on. Some guy comes along and tells \n     us to hang in there and we will soon be working. At noon \n     we are moved into position to load people. However, we \n     received no instructions or information as to where we \n     will be going. Even the people we are loading don't know \n     where they are headed. What a way to treat people who have \n     lost everything they have. Soon we are loaded and waiting \n     to go someplace. A representative of the state of AR comes \n     aboard and wishes the people a good future. At the same \n     time we are told we will be escorted by the state police \n     to Siloam Springs, AR. We are part of a 12 coach move with \n     a highway patrol escort for every three coaches. The drive \n     is supposed to take about 90 minutes. The actual drive \n     took us over three hours as the escort never went faster \n     than 40 mph. All of the people are very thankful for the \n     help in moving them and they are very pleasant considering \n     what they have all been through.\n       Finally we arrive at Siloam Springs at a church camp. It \n     seems like the whole community is here to welcome the people \n     and help them make a home. It is very heart touching to see \n     all the generous help. We unload and clean our two coaches. \n     Feeling tired and hungry we head back towards Fort Smith. \n     After what happened last night we see no need to arrive at \n     Fort Chaffee in the middle of the night. We find rooms in \n     Fayetteville and shut down for the night. The whole trip is \n     nothing like we had hoped or thought it would be. Maybe we \n     will feel better in the morning.\n\n  Morning is September 7, Wednesday. So this would be the seventh--it \nis my judgment this is the seventh day that my constituents were going \nthrough this trial and tribulation.\n\n       Our week of service is almost over and we sure haven't \n     [done] much of any good. We have spent more time driving \n     around empty as they have moved us all over. This morning we \n     went back to Fort Chaffee and waited for new orders. Many \n     other drivers were also waiting to see what we were to do. \n     About noon we get the word that we were to report back to \n     Lake Charles for the next duty. Here we go again on a 500 \n     mile drive with no passengers. Does anybody really know what \n     is going on? As we drive to Lake Charles, we know it will be \n     about 9 p.m. when we arrive. Hopefully somebody will be \n     around to fill us in. No such luck. When we arrive at Lake \n     Charles the parking lot is filled with hundreds of \n     motorcoaches. There are hundreds of coaches and drivers. Many \n     drivers are very upset as they just sit idle. At Lake Charles \n     we are told to report back in the morning and we are also \n     told good luck on finding any lodging. Looks like another \n     night of sleeping in the coach. I make some phone calls and \n     find out there are some rooms at the casino. I call them and \n     ask about rooms and explain what we have been doing. The \n     manager gives us a deal on three rooms for the four of us. At \n     least we will have a bed to sleep in and be able to take a \n     shower in the morning.\n       September 8.\n\n  This will be Thursday.\n\n       This is the last day that we can help as we need to return \n     to Iowa tonight. The coaches need to be back to go on charter \n     trips. We will report to the temporary dispatch office early. \n     With hundreds of coaches just parked it doesn't look good. \n     The dispatcher said there is no work today and the next \n     opportunity might be tomorrow. I ask if there is anybody that \n     needs to move north as we could take people north as we head \n     home. Nothing available today and with all the idle coaches \n     it looks bad for tomorrow. I sign us out and we start back \n     home. I am glad that we came down and tried to help. There is \n     a huge sense of disappointment in the fact that we drove \n     about 3,000 total miles and only hauled 47 people 103 miles. \n     It seems like a huge waste of valuable resources and money. \n     Especially as I look over a parking lot filled with hundreds \n     of motorcoaches.\n       Somebody made the order to get all these coaches here and \n     now they sit idle. It easy to see why people get frustrated \n     with the system. Along with these coaches sitting idle, many \n     school buses were moved to the area and never used. They were \n     sent back home as they weren't needed. Today we learned that \n     in the city of New Orleans all of the school buses were left \n     to get caught in the flood. Why weren't they used before the \n     hurricane and flood to get people moved out of harm's way in \n     New Orleans. There are a large number of public officials at \n     all levels and the news media pointing fingers trying to put \n     the blame on FEMA when they should look at themselves. Why \n     did the school buses get left and not used? Why didn't people \n     heed the notice to get out and move to a safer area?\n\n[[Page S11733]]\n\n       I think the whole process needs to be looked at and \n     evaluated for making improvements. We were not the only ones \n     to wonder what was going on. Almost all the drivers were \n     asking who is in charge and where are the lines of \n     communication. Of all the people who gave us orders, none \n     of them seemed to understand operations and dispatch. From \n     my viewpoint, it appears to me that many of those who were \n     supposed to manage the coaches didn't have any idea of \n     what to do and just how much help they needed.\n\n     September 9.\n       After driving through the night we arrived back in Iowa. We \n     are tired and ready to be back in our own homes. The hardship \n     we went through was very minor compared to what all the \n     displaced families were going through. As a team, we all \n     agreed that we would go again and we would do whatever we \n     could to provide assistance to people in need. Hopefully, if \n     there is a next time, there will be better organization and \n     all involved parties will work together.\n       About 10 a.m. I received a call from the dispatcher in Lake \n     Charles saying he had a trip for us. He was looking for us \n     and wondered where we were. This is a good example of poor \n     management as this was the same person I had signed out with \n     yesterday morning in Lake Charles. What a joke and what a \n     lack of management. I just hope that all of the drivers and \n     coach companies didn't get mad at the system. If they did get \n     upset with the whole system, there might not be enough help \n     the next time.\n       I would go and help again. It seems like the call to come \n     and help was about two days late. Then when the call went \n     out, too many resources were brought into play and then there \n     was overkill. I do hope to be able to sit down and talk with \n     somebody who evaluates this operation.\n\n  Let me say parenthetically that he is going to continue to talk to \nother people, but he asked me to be part of this communication, to lay \nout, as he saw it, the problems, in hopes that action will be taken \nhere and at the local responder level and the State level to make sure \nthese things don't happen again.\n  I am going to say that sentence again that I just was distracted \nfrom.\n  I do hope to be able to sit down and talk with somebody who evaluates \nthis operation.\n\n     Someway, somehow, there has to be a method to get operation \n     managers in the right place to guide a mass movement of \n     people as fast as possible. Maybe when this is all over \n     people will have time to look back and make new plans.\n       The saddest part of this whole experience was the \n     difference of the news media coverage to the real situation. \n     The devastation was huge. The generous helping spirit of the \n     American people was huge. A large number of resources \n     available and there were people willing to provide \n     assistance. Yet, many of these resources were poorly used as \n     the lines of command and communication were poor. We went \n     down to New Orleans to work hard and help. That goal of \n     providing help was not accomplished in my eyes. Yes, we moved \n     about 94 people on our two coaches. However, we only moved \n     those people 100 miles and we spent the rest of our time \n     driving empty as we were moved from place to place. There \n     needs to be a better system of command and coordination.\n       I am very thankful for this opportunity to go and help, no \n     matter how small the help seemed to be. The people we moved \n     were very thankful and they greatly appreciated the efforts \n     of many. My heart hurts for those people who have lost \n     everything but their lives. I also know that we had the right \n     kind of intentions as we went to help.\n\n  I now turn to September 20. I just have 3 more days--no, 6 more days. \nAnyway, they went back to Iowa and then they were called upon again for \nan opportunity because of Hurricane Katrina. So September 20:\n\n       Once again the call has come for help in the gulf area of \n     LA and TX as hurricane Rita moves into the area. We have the \n     opportunity to provide service again to those in need. The \n     people who have called us, have assured us that there are \n     better plans and communications in place this time. They have \n     told us that lessons were learned from Katrina. This evening \n     we are headed out with two coaches and four drivers. This \n     combination allows us to get to the area in a straight \n     through drive and be ready to work. Our orders call for us to \n     report to a rest stop on 1-49 north of Lafayette, LA. This \n     will be our staging area. Before we leave, we put extra \n     supplies on board, take some food and pack some bedding. We \n     learned from the last time of helping that we might have to \n     spend nights sleeping on the coach. We depart with high hopes \n     and a thankful heart for this opportunity to provide help. \n     The people who called for this help are aware that we can \n     help until Sunday evening. The drivers and coaches need to be \n     back in Iowa for other charter work next Monday.\n\n     September 21.\n\n       The drive down was interesting and we saw a lot of others \n     headed south with the same purpose in mind. We did encounter \n     a slight problem in southern MS. There is a bug that is \n     called the ``love bug'' which is bad at this time of the \n     year. We had to make a couple of extra stops to clean the \n     windshields off. These bugs are nasty. Despite the delay we \n     arrived at the staging area about 4:00 pm. The staging area \n     was a rest stop on 1-49 which was closed down for public use. \n     First order of business was to report in and fuel. After \n     fueling, we reported in for duty. The first thing we were \n     told was to get in line and wait for orders. This is sure \n     looking like the Katrina help situation. The old hurry up and \n     wait plan. Fortunately, we had stopped for a good hot meal in \n     Lafayette and were good to go. As the night moved along it \n     appeared that we were going to sit and do nothing.\n\n     September 22.\n\n       A short night of limited sleep in the seat of the coach. It \n     is difficult to sleep on a coach. Good thing we brought food \n     with us. We were able to save some snack bars for breakfast. \n     About 7:00 am the dispatcher came looking for two coaches. We \n     took the call and headed into Lafayette to help evacuate \n     people from a hospital. At 9:00 am we were loaded with about \n     18 passengers on each coach. We waited on our orders and we \n     waited and waited. About 1:00 pm a doctor connected with \n     Homeland Security gave us the go ahead. We were part of an \n     escorted convoy moving these people from Lafayette to Monroe, \n     LA. A four hour drive under good conditions. Our passengers \n     had been on the coach since 9:00 am and they were not given \n     any food. A very long day for everybody with no food. All of \n     these people had been moved out of New Orleans before Katrina \n     and now they had to move again. This time they moved from a \n     hospital to a gym on the campus of LA Tech in Monroe. Sure am \n     glad we have an escort as the road is jammed with people \n     moving north. There are no gripes on our part as we are doing \n     the work we came down to do. After unloading the people and \n     helping them get moved into the gym, we took the opportunity \n     to shower in the locker room. That was a refreshing moment. \n     Then the drive back to the staging area. As we watched all \n     the traffic moving north, we assumed we would be assigned a \n     task as soon as we got back. That turned into a bad \n     assumption. Upon our return to the staging area, we refueled \n     and parked in line. Here we go again, another long night on \n     the coach. Sleep. didn't come easy and I went for a walk. As \n     I was walking I noticed some empty parking places near the \n     front of the line. I went back to the coaches and moved us up \n     in the line with the thought that we might get an assignment \n     quicker. We didn't come back down to park in a line and wait.\n\n       September 23, 2005.\n\n       Hurricane Rita is moving closer to shore. Why are we not \n     moving people? The word among the drivers is that there was a \n     coach accident in TX and things are on hold. This brings up \n     the subject of safety. The majority of the coaches in use are \n     top of the line, with excellent drivers and a great safety \n     record. However, there are some coaches operating with lights \n     out, broken air brakes and other safety related issues. These \n     coaches should be pulled to the side and put out of service \n     until they are repaired. There are more than enough coaches \n     here that are in excellent condition to be used. Poor \n     condition coaches. should not be used. We are in a stressful \n     situation, moving people whose lives are in danger. The coach \n     accident in TX is a tragic deal. I don't know if it could \n     have been avoided.\n       3:00 am, action at last. Ten coaches have been asked to \n     move to the Baton Rouge airport to move people. We are part \n     of the ten. Upon arrival at the airport we report in. Only, \n     the airport was not expecting us and wonders why we were \n     sent. This brings back bad thoughts of a couple of weeks ago. \n     The airport folks find a place to park us while they \n     determine the next step. We get parked right next to the \n     National Guard base. The Guard asks all the drivers with the \n     ten coaches in for a hot breakfast. This is very welcome and \n     sure beats the snack foods. After breakfast we head back to \n     the coach to nap and rest for whatever the next move might \n     be. By noon the rain has started and Rita is nearing land.\n       Listening to the radio we hear about people who needed help \n     to get out of the area. Why are we sitting here? At this \n     point it is too late to go to the areas in need as we would \n     arrive at the same time as the hurricane. We can only wonder \n     why.\n       About 3:00 pm we get orders to move. We are moved to a \n     large building in Baton Rouge and told to park along side the \n     building. The rain is starting to come down hard. The coaches \n     left at the rest stop on 1-49 are being moved further north \n     to get out of harms way. Two FEMA representatives come out of \n     the building and brief us. We are parked right along side the \n     FEMA headquarters. We are at the main command post. Our \n     orders are to stay prepared to move in case the building has \n     to be evacuated. This is hard to believe. We have been \n     assigned directly to the FEMA staff. During our discussion we \n     ask if we can stay in the building tonight as we have been in \n     the motorcoach since reporting for duty. The two staff \n     members tell us they will check on that possibility. We never \n     hear from them the rest of the night. The hurricane hits \n     land near the LA-TX state line. It is no picnic in Baton \n     Rouge. The wind is high and the rain comes down in sheets.\n\n     September 24.\n\n       With all the wind and the heavy rain it was difficult to \n     get much sleep. It is very hard to believe and understand why \n     we were not allowed to come in the building. It would have\n\n[[Page S11734]]\n\n     been a lot safer inside and there was a floor that was \n     devoted to sleeping quarters. They even had cots for people \n     to use. Yesterday the two staff members had told us we could \n     come in the building and use the showers. When we tried to do \n     this, security would not let us near the building and \n     security would not call the two staff members inside. This is \n     crazy. We are good enough to sit outside during a hurricane \n     to be on call to provide evacuation transportation. Yet, we \n     are treated like criminals when we try to get in to use the \n     showers. On the door there is a sign about a national news \n     conference at 2 p.m. I tell the other three drivers with me \n     that we will receive orders to move before 1:30 p.m.\n       Sure enough, at 1:30 p.m. we are given orders to move to \n     the staging area at Le Place. The FEMA staff didn't want us \n     parked near the building when the press conference was taking \n     place.\n       We follow orders and head to Le Place to report in and top \n     off the fuel tanks. There is water everywhere from all the \n     rain. At Le Place we drive through water to report in. Once \n     again the orders are to park and wait. We spend more time \n     driving around empty and waiting for orders than we do \n     working. Nothing is going to happen the rest of today. In the \n     parking area there are city buses from Atlanta, GA. They were \n     asked to come to the area to help move people. Thus far they \n     have done nothing but sit and wait. We said welcome to the \n     crowd.\n       Nightfall comes with no place to obtain lodging. However, \n     there are a couple of restaurants open in the area and we can \n     get a good meal. We spend our evening talking with other \n     drivers and listening to all of the frustration just sitting \n     around. This frustration builds larger each day as you see \n     resources sitting idle.\n\n     September 25.\n\n       We are tired and weary from spending the past six nights \n     trying to sleep in the coach. This morning we are able to \n     take a shower at the truck stop. The $9.00 to get a shower is \n     worth every cent.\n\n  I sure wouldn't pay it.\n\n       After showers, we meet with the drivers of the other eight \n     coaches we were with in Baton Rouge. As we are talking the \n     dispatcher gives us orders to drive into New Orleans. We are \n     going to be moving a National Guard unit out of New Orleans \n     to the area where Rita has gone through.\n       After taking most of the morning it get organized the unit \n     is ready to move out. We will be bringing up the rear of the \n     convoy: Our route will be I-10 to Lafayette where the unit \n     has been reassigned. I have discovered that these orders were \n     issued at 1 a.m. this morning and it took eight hours for \n     them to move through channels to us and the military. What an \n     amazing chain of command. The commander of the unit fills us \n     in on the route and how to drive in a convoy. The members of \n     the unit are very happy to ride in the air conditioned coach. \n     Upon arrival in Lafayette they set up a command center at an \n     old Service Master store. We have to wait until the command \n     releases us before we can go back to Le Place. The afternoon \n     goes by slowly as we wait to be released from duty. The \n     commander holds us as he sees no reason to be stationed in \n     Lafayette as they have very little damage. Once again, I want \n     to ask who is in charge. About 9 p.m. we are released to go \n     back to Le Place.\n       Arriving in Le Place we find hundreds of coaches parked and \n     waiting for orders. This brings back all the thoughts about \n     wasteful use of resources. Our time is up; we need to head \n     back to Iowa. I make the arrangements to be released and we \n     head out for home.\n\n     September 26\n\n       Another long night of driving and we finally get home, a \n     very tired group. This has proved to be another growing \n     experience. Sleeping every night in the motorcoach, only \n     getting one good meal a day, and only having two showers all \n     week. We all learned a lot about ourselves and what we are \n     able to do when needed.\n       The hardest thing to accept this trip was sitting out the \n     hurricane in the motorcoach. It is very difficult to \n     understand and accept the fact that we were not allowed in \n     the FEMA building during the hurricane. Good enough to be a \n     safety valve, but not good enough to be allowed in the \n     building.\n       Hopefully, at some point in the future I will have an \n     opportunity to share with the right folks and work with them \n     to improve the system and the way it works as it relates to \n     motorcoaches. Especially in the area of equipment safety and \n     using motorcoaches to move large numbers of people in an \n     emergency.\n\n  That is the end of his diary. He ends with a little paragraph that \nsays:\n\n       Thoughts of Craig Van Waardhuizen while working through the \n     Katrina and Rita hurricanes in LA. I was lead member of a \n     four member team providing motorcoach service with two \n     motorcoaches. I am a Terminal Manager and Operations Director \n     for Northwest Iowa Transportation, Inc (a motorcoach carrier \n     in Iowa with membership in UMA, ABA and IMG).\n\n     Craig Van Waardhuizen.\n\n  I thank my friend Craig for sharing his experiences with the people \nof the Nation through this, but most importantly for the Senate and my \nSenate colleagues to take this into consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/21/senate-section/article/S11734-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11734-S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PRAIRIE LAKES RESPONDS TO HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have one additional statement in \nregard to the Katrina situation.\n  As I said earlier before I read Craig's diary, I am a member of the \nPrairie Lakes Baptist Church at Cedar Falls, IA. Immediately after \nKatrina, our church in the following 3 weeks sent three different \ndelegations--in other words, three different teams; a team the first \nweek, a different team the second week, and a different team the third \nweek--to go down to Brookhaven, MS, and help the First Baptist Church \nin Ocean Springs, MS, in their efforts to feed people who were in need \nand house people who were in need and do other things.\n  I have this letter which was sent to the pastor of our church, Pastor \nJohn Fuller, from the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Oceans \nSprings, MS.\n  It says:\n\n       Dear Pastor:\n       I have never had the privilege of meeting you--but I know \n     you because I have experienced the heart of your people.

They drove in late \n     Tuesday. They do have a deeper understanding of the disaster \n     they are facing as they share meals and conversation with \n     survivors of Hurricane Katrina.\n       ``All I've talked to have lost everything,'' said Nancy \n     Killian, 58, of Cedar Falls. ``We mingle with them, give hugs \n     when we can.''\n       Located 100 miles north of New Orleans, Brookhaven has been \n     an outpost for some 1,600 people displaced by the hurricane, \n     said Mayor Bob Massingill. Many evacuees have\n\n[[Page S11735]]\n\n     moved on, but hundreds at the city's six shelters still need \n     housing.\n       One hub of activity is Easthaven Southern Baptist Church, a \n     shelter for 1l0, although for a time it served more than \n     twice that number. Former Cedar Falls resident Merrill Oster \n     initiated the relationship between Prairie Lakes and \n     Easthaven. He learned of Easthaven's challenge from family \n     members at that church. He called friends in the Cedar Valley \n     who were looking for a way to help.\n       The population in this town of 12,000 has swelled with \n     survivors and relief workers.\n       Members of the Indiana National Guard, shouldering M16s, \n     are on hand to keep the peace and lend a hand And then there \n     are the volunteers. Red Cross workers and Christians from \n     Tennessee have moved into Easthaven Baptist Church. And now \n     the Prairie Lakes contingent has arrived.\n       Prairie Lakes is partnering with Easthaven Baptist Church \n     to help with shelter and a transitional housing project. The \n     Cedar Falls church will send two more teams of volunteers in \n     the next two weeks.\n       ``We kind of answered the call to love people,'' said Adam \n     Graber, 23, Waterloo.\n       The warm Mississippi air was thick with humidity and ``love \n     bugs'' when volunteers started work Wednesday.\n       Men and women spent hours cutting and raking tall grass at \n     a former trailer home park, preparing the way for 14 travel \n     trailers. The units were purchased by Oster from Ace Fogdall \n     RV.\n       Oster orchestrated the project Trailers, which will house \n     displaced families, were filled with sheets, pots, pans and \n     other amenities by Prairie Lakes and Cedar Heights Baptist \n     congregations in Cedar Falls in two days.\n       Kim Oster of Easthaven Baptist, related by marriage to \n     Merrill Oster, said evacuees have brought new life to her \n     church, built specifically eight years ago to serve as a \n     disaster shelter. The joyful but weary servants at Easthaven \n     welcomed help from strangers up north.\n       ``We needed manpower. We really needed people to work,'' \n     she said.\n       Trailer lots are rent-free for six months. Organizers hope \n     that is enough time for evacuees to achieve independence. \n     Five homes also are being prepared for family use.\n       About $157,000 has been raised toward the $300,000 project.\n       On Wednesday, Cedar Valley and Mississippi volunteers began \n     preparations for sewer, water and electricity at the trailer \n     park. At first, workers had trouble locating the existing \n     water line. Some Iowa jaws dropped as a tall and lanky \n     Mississippi man slowly walked back and forth across the \n     grass. Billy Crider strolled with arms outstretched, hands \n     clutching metal sticks that pulled toward an underground \n     line. The former Entergy Corp. employee was retired for more \n     than 5 years when he was called up by his company to help \n     after the hurricane.\n       Bystander Ron Williamson, a retired area school teacher and \n     volunteer cook at the shelter, vouched for the accuracy of \n     divining rods before ducking away to cook chicken for the \n     evening meal for evacuees and volunteers.\n       ``I love 'em God bless 'em all,'' Williamson said.\n       Volunteers are grateful to understanding employers and \n     teachers for letting them serve in the South, and for the \n     sponsorship of their churches.\n       Sara, 27, and Jerry Steele, 30, of Lytham, England extended \n     a visit with family in Iowa to make the trek south. Delta \n     Airlines let them delay their travel plans without extra \n     fees. Jared Coffin, 14, is missing class at Hoover Middle \n     School in Waterloo. He finished most of his homework on the \n     16-hour drive south.\n       ``They need people down here to do things like this. They \n     need people to donate clothes. It's just a matter of getting \n     plugged in,'' Coffin said ``We're going to be here for \n     awhile.''\n       Some Cedar Valley volunteers hoped to spend more time in \n     the shelter's kitchen and were surprised to learn more help \n     was available than expected. Some mentioned trekking further \n     south if the need is greater there, added Steve Coffin, 51, \n     of Cedar Falls.\n       ``We're just getting started,'' said Mark Sherwood, \n     volunteer coordinator from Cedar Falls. ``Every day can be \n     different.''\n       Brookhaven experienced tree damage and power outages but \n     was spared the destruction suffered by her southern \n     neighbors.\n       ``We've been inconvenienced, but their lives have \n     changed,'' said Massingill the mayor. ``People are ready to \n     go back to their homes.''\n       But not everyone can.\n       Despite what the highway signs near Brookhaven say, Kenner, \n     La, evacuees Herbert Lange and his wife, Cynthia, weren't \n     looking for paradise when they arrived at Easthaven Baptist. \n     They just wanted a safe place to wait for the storm to pass \n     and the water to recede so insurance and property issues can \n     be resolved. Housed in a Sunday school room and fed three \n     times a day, the Langes are convinced they have a little \n     piece of heaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/21/senate-section/article/S11735-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING BARBARA GRASSLEY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, October is Breast Cancer Month, and I \nwish to honor my wife, who is an 18-year survivor of breast cancer.\n  I don't often speak about this, but October is the month to raise \nmoney and bring attention to the plight of those who have breast \ncancer, most often with the idea in mind of adding to research for a \ncure of breast cancer.\n  My only opportunity to participate in this, besides a few remarks I \nmake, is the second Saturday of October in Des Moines, IA, they have a \n5K to raise money. Sixteen thousand of us participated in that 5K \nfundraiser in Des Moines, IA. I have nothing to brag about because it \ntook me 28 minutes 6 seconds, but I was glad to have the opportunity to \nhelp raise money for the cause.\n  This morning, I would like to read a speech for my wife Barbara \nGrassley--today happens to be her 73rd birthday--about her personal \nchallenge with breast cancer. Today is my wife's birthday, and it is \nfitting that we celebrate her victory over this.\n  Barbara's story is a familiar one. She had many busy years raising \nour five children, helping run the family farm, particularly during \nthose years that I was in the State legislature, busy participating in \ncommunity and church activities, and even at age 50 going back and \nfinishing her BA degree at the University of Northern Iowa. Barbara \nnever worried about her own health. Then one casual visit to do a free \ncholesterol screening led to a doctor's visit for a physical exam. It \nwas an appointment that changed her life. She was diagnosed with breast \ncancer. Just 10 days later, she had a modified radical mastectomy at \nCovenant Hospital in Waterloo. That was 18 years ago.\n  We are fortunate that her breast cancer was detected early. We know \nwith certainty that early detection can dramatically increase a woman's \nchance of defeating breast cancer. That is true for women like Barbara \nwho have a family medical history working against them. \nParenthetically, I think five out of six of my wife's aunts on her \nmother's side had breast cancer as well.\n  The need for routine mammograms cannot be repeated too often. \nBaseline mammograms and regular screening are key to saving the lives \nof the thousands of women who develop this disease each year.\n  As her husband and as a Senator, I follow closely the legislative \ncommitment made to breast cancer research, education, and prevention. I \nam proud to be cosponsor of the Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Act. This bill before the HELP Committee would allow the \nDirector of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to \nmake grants to develop centers across the country. These centers will \nhelp conduct research on the environmental factors that may be related \nto breast cancer. I hope the HELP Committee will consider this bill as \nsoon as possible.\n  In the meantime, we must focus our efforts on finding a cure. In the \npast week, there have been breakthroughs on cancer research. Every day, \nwe get one step closer to overcoming this disease.\n  This month is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I hope men and women \nwill take the opportunity to talk to their loved ones about getting a \nmammogram and preventing breast cancer. I hope we can continue to raise \nawareness of this disease for the sake of every mother, spouse, sister, \ndaughter, and granddaughter in this world.\n  I remind people especially of the luck of my wife going to that early \ndetection. She went for just one of these community screenings. She \ndidn't go to the doctor with any idea she would have anything wrong; \nshe just went there and there were some questions raised. Every \nopportunity you have to take a quick one, if there is something wrong \nthat can lead to the routine mammogram, you should do it because that \nsurely made a difference in my wife's condition at the time. Early \ndetection is so important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/21/senate-section/article/S11735-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11735-S11737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEFICIT SPENDING AND COST OF KATRINA\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the last few minutes, I have listened \nwith great interest to the Senator from Iowa reading a diary of the \nexperience of a dedicated volunteer, obviously, to help out with \nKatrina victims in Louisiana and Mississippi. I found it most\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\nfascinating and also most frustrating, as I think the Senator did and \ncertainly the person involved.\n  I want to also say ``happy birthday'' to Barbara Grassley. I hope the \nSenator will communicate that to her. My wife Suzanne and I know \nBarbara and Chuck well, and I extend a ``happy birthday'' from the \nCraig family to Barbara.\n  While I was home in Idaho this past week, like many of us who were in \nour home States, I held a series of town meetings across the State. The \nmost often asked question at those open town meeting forums was about \ndeficit spending and the cost of Katrina and the overall concern \nIdahoans have about Katrina and Katrina victims.\n  As the Senator from Iowa spoke, it is so true of Idaho and other \nStates across the Nation where tremendous voluntary efforts have poured \nout in behalf of the citizens of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and \nTexas. They have gone through these literally catastrophic experiences \nof a magnitude that none of us certainly in Idaho have every \nexperienced.\n  While that concern is real and the voluntary and contributive effort \nis of a record like none we have ever seen in our country, I truly \nbelieve there is a growing concern about the wise and responsible and \ncareful use of the tax dollars. As Idahoans and Americans send their \ntime and their generosity to the South, we are also sending our tax \ndollars. Clearly we want them spent carefully and wisely.\n\n  Prior to the recess, Congress held hearings to examine the fallacies \nof the response to Hurricane Katrina. There was much criticism--most of \nit, in part, from the press and some of it not as well-founded as we \nfind out as expressed at the time--about what was done, what could be \ndone, and what should be done appropriately to handle the literally \nbillions of dollars headed south to help the citizens of those States.\n  In 5 or 10 years I hope we will not be conducting the same backward-\nlooking hearings on how Federal dollars were spent, how waste, fraud, \nand abuse occurred in the Gulf States, and how it might have been \nprevented as we are looking backward today to see why the response to \nKatrina was so mishandled. Instead of looking back, we are now in a \nposition to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse by acting responsibly now \nto control and offset Government spending. There are numerous ways for \nCongress to do this, but perhaps it is noteworthy to first talk about \nthe congressional measures that will not, in my opinion, do it \nappropriately. Senate bill 1766, the Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief \nand Economic Recovery Act, known as the Pelican Project, whatever you \ncall the bill, $250 billion of what I have examined and referred to as \na pork-stuffed package, costing more than the Louisiana Purchase \nadjusted for inflation, is not the way to go.\n  Some of the more noteworthy ``relief provisions'' in the bill include \n$8 million for an alligator farm, $25 million for sugarcane research \nand, of course, the $35 million to restore the seafood industry. At \nthis time, it is questionable whether Federal tax dollars ought to be \nspent in those categories. However, overshadowing all of that, and what \nis worse, is the bill's whopping $40 billion requested not by but for \nthe Army Corps of Engineers projects, many of which were unrelated to \nthe flood projects or the flood protection.\n  To put this in perspective, the overall national Army Corps of \nEngineers budget for fiscal year 2005 was $4 billion, one-tenth of what \nwas proposed for Louisiana. The Louisiana tradition of overreaching \nCorps projects makes this request, I guess, a little less surprising.\n  Take, for example, the Industrial Canal lock navigation project in \nNew Orleans. In 2000, the Corps launched a $750 million lock navigation \nproject on the Industrial Canal in New Orleans, the most expensive \nsingle lock project in history. The Corps justified its massive project \nby predicting barge traffic on the canal would increase when traffic, \nin fact, was decreasing, and had decreased 50 percent since 1988. \nDespite the economic and social concerns the project posed, Louisiana \nconsistently welcomed it. The Industrial Canal has received more than \n$70 million over the last few years. In the 2006 budget, the President \nprovided no funding for the Industrial Canal. However, the House--that \nis right--and this Senate pumped nearly $15 million into the project.\n  If we are wondering where the money came from, one of the programs \nthe Senate cut in the same year was the one of the national priority \nprojects. That is, the west bank and vicinity hurricane protection \nproject of New Orleans. We cut that to do something else. Indeed, one \nof the levees that lined the Industrial Canal failed after Hurricane \nKatrina hit, inundating the lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans with \nfloodwater. Yet that is where the money was cut to fund the canal \nitself.\n  Louisiana has never suffered from a lack of Army Corps funding. Over \nthe last 5 years the State reportedly has received $1.9 billion in \nCorps funds, far more than any other State. If Hurricane Katrina stood \nfor anything other than Mother Nature's catastrophic power, it is \nLouisiana, in my opinion, and the catastrophic failure to prioritize \npublic interest projects over what now appears to be pork.\n\n  S. 1776 is no different. The bill's working group on Corps response \nprojects was dominated by special interest lobbyists, with one insider \nreportedly expressing concern that the focus was not on protecting \nLouisiana. In addition, the bill would exempt any Corps projects from \nprovisions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Clean Water \nAct and it would also waive the usual Corps cost-sharing requirements, \nthus making taxpayers foot the entire bill. At a time of catastrophic \nemergency, I would be willing to look at something such as that. At the \nsame time, these are material dollars that are going. Clearly, they \ndeserve our oversight.\n  The taxpayer has already paid, dutifully and dearly, for Katrina \nrelief. Thus far, $62.3 billion in emergency supplemental funding has \nbeen authorized for immediate relief and response needs for victims of \nKatrina. However, the Federal Government's role in disaster relief, as \nprovided by existing law, is only one of support to State and local \ngovernments and agencies. The Stafford Act, which provides the \nstatutory framework for Presidential declaration of an emergency or \nmajor disaster, explicitly states that Federal resources should \nsupplement, not replace, State and local resources for disaster relief.\n  We understand the magnitude and we understand, in the case of \nMississippi and Louisiana, major wipeouts of a kind we have never seen \nbefore. But still, let's not change the laws and the relationships. \nLet's keep the balance in mind as this Congress decides, and I hope \ntracks and, most importantly, monitors where those dollars go and how \nthey will be spent.\n  With an act of supplementary spending also comes the duty of \noffsetting. Before Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Budget Office \nprojected the 2005 deficit would total $331 billion. The picture, of \ncourse, is only bleaker now. Numerous groups have offered comprehensive \nsavings proposals that would offset the massive costs of Katrina \nrelief.\n  The Republican Study Committee, the Congressional Budget Office, the \nGeneral Accounting Office, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Cato \nInstitute, American Enterprise, the Heritage Foundation, all have come \nup with a variety of proposals not to deficit spend all of it but to \nsee some reasonable belt tightening at the Federal level and some--not \nall--of the disaster relief being able to come out of current budgets.\n  In addition to these savings proposals, the Senate majority leader \nrecently proposed a rescission package that would rescind unnecessary \nspending. A few weeks ago, President Bush became directly involved when \nhe called on Congress to enact his proposed cuts in both mandatory and \ndiscretionary spending. There is little we can change about Katrina. \nYet the focus still seems to be on finding who is responsible for the \nresponse or the lack of response. We are always responsible for the \nhealth of our Government, for the wise use of hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars, and for ensuring that America's future generations do not foot \nthe bill for all of the current fiscal recklessness. The spending will \nbe the subject of both public and Government scrutiny for future years, \nbut we can prevent any of the waste or the fraud or abuse of those \nmoneys that will occur or could occur.\n\n[[Page S11737]]\n\n  That job is now. That is our responsibility as a Congress. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with the Senators from Louisiana and Mississippi. \nClearly, the need is real, and no one in any way denies that. But there \nis a responsibility here, a fundamental responsibility, as we literally \nsend billions upon billions of dollars south to rebuild and reshape and \nrefurbish the economies of those States, that those dollars be spent \nwisely, that those dollars be spent cautiously, and that no one \nindividual benefit in an extraordinary, abusive, or fraudulent way. \nThat is the responsibility of this Congress that I take most sincerely \nand I know most of my colleagues do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my colleagues, Senators Alexander and \nBingaman, have been to the floor to describe a publication that has now \nbeen provided to all 100 Senators. It is by the National Academy of \nSciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of \nMedicine, entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Energizing and \nEmploying America for a Brighter Economic Future.'' They have spoken \nabout this report with justifiable pride. They did instigate some of \nthe best scientific minds to ask and answer the question: Are we losing \nour scientific edge and what would it mean if we did and what do we do \nto get it back?\n  Part of this country's long-term opportunity and the opportunity to \ncreate a middle class in a country with an economy unlike any other in \nthe world has been technology, science, knowledge, and education. The \nquestion is: Are we losing our edge? The answer in this report is: Yes, \nwe are. Then it describes a number of ways to put together an approach \nthat would deal with that. While I think this is very helpful, it is \nthe first chapter of a rather lengthy book, the book about what is \nhappening in our country. It reminds me of the movie ``How Stella Got \nHer Groove Back.'' Has America lost its groove?\n  This country has done so much. This is the country that split the \natom, spliced genes. We have been inventive. We have invented \neverything: Plastics, the silicon chip, radar. We cured smallpox, \npolio. We invented the telephone, the computer, television. We built \nairplanes, learned how to fly them. We built rockets and walked on the \nmoon. Particularly in the last 100 years, America has been \nextraordinary in what it has done. It is standing on one another's \nshoulders, looking over the horizon and building and inventing and \ncreating. Has America lost its groove? That is not the title of my \nremarks, but that was the question that was asked. The answer is in the \ncovers of a lengthy report saying, among other things, we have to \nchange our education system. We have to educate more engineers. It says \nthat the Chinese and the folks from India are educating far more \nengineers than we are, and that is going to have an impact. We need \ngreater teaching of science in our schools. I don't disagree with any \nof that. This is a significant contribution to a debate that we should \nhave about new public policy.\n  But none of this means anything unless we also talk about the \nconditions under which we are exporting America's jobs and, yes, \nexporting good jobs, scientific jobs, technical jobs to other \ncountries. If you triple the number of engineers educated in America \nand then discover that in the country of India you can hire five \nengineers for every engineer you pay in this country--and we continue \nto see an exodus of jobs out of this country to two countries, India \nand China--of what value has been tripling the number of engineers in \nAmerica?\n\n  That brings me to the central point of what I wanted to talk about \nbriefly today, or perhaps not so briefly because it is Friday. Nobody \nseems to be crowding people here on the floor. What I want to talk \nabout is the issue of international trade and a trade policy that \nperhaps much more than the issue of losing the edge in science and \ntechnology, is injuring this country and pulling the foundation out \nfrom under the future of all the kids now in college and high school.\n  Let me describe some of this with some charts. This is our trade \ndeficit. As you can see, this is a sea of red ink. Year after year we \nsee our trade deficit grows worse and worse. It is now at about $700-\nplus billion a year. That means for every single day, 7 days a week, \nevery single day we buy $2 billion more in goods from other countries \nthan we sell. That means, at the end of the year, we have a trade \ndeficit. This year we expect a trade deficit of about $750 billion. Add \nto that the roughly $550 billion in fiscal policy budget deficits--that \nis the amount that the Federal debt increased in the last year--and you \nare talking about a Federal indebtedness of $1.2 trillion. You would \nthink that people would have an apoplectic seizure about that, \nunderstanding its consequences. But we just snore through it all, \nhaving pleasant dreams and a soft, little sleep. Nobody seems to care \nmuch. You would at least think that those people who are self-defined \nconservatives, wearing flinty gray suits and steel rim glasses and \nhaving the banker impetus that conservatives used to have, would say: \nThis has to stop. A country can't run a $1.2 trillion indebtedness and \nexpect to have a better future. But there is dead silence.\n  The only people who talk about this portion of the deficit are Fritz \nHollings--he sat here. He is gone. Fritz left--I have been out here. \nSenator Byrd has from time to time. Otherwise, there is vast silence.\n  I want to talk through some of this. I want to tell you about the \ntrade deficit with China because this is almost one-third of our \ndeficit. It is unbelievable what has happened with respect to our \nbilateral trade relationship with China. I want to also talk to you \nabout China and trade agreements because I think it is at the root of \nwhere we are headed. Automobile trade with China is interesting. ``Here \nCome the Really Cheap Cars,'' says Time magazine.\n\n       Chinese pirate companies have long been accused of \n     illegally copying easy stuff such as shoe polish and digital \n     movies. Now General Motors says a Chinese firm knocked off an \n     entire vehicle--and Americans could soon start buying its \n     cars.\n\n  Let me tell you a story about Chinese cars. We have this giant trade \ndeficit with China. We have massive numbers of jobs, this giant sucking \nsound of American jobs rushing to China, to Bangladesh and Indonesia \nand Mexico but especially China. We negotiate a trade deal with China. \nThis gets to the root of my contention that our trade negotiators are \nbasically incompetent. I don't say that lightly. I say it because it is \ntrue. Let me describe the bilateral automobile provisions of trade with \nChina that our country negotiated. We negotiated a bilateral deal and \nwe said: By the way, with respect to the sale and movement of \nautomobiles between China and the United States, here is what we will \nagree to. We will agree that after a phase-in, any U.S. cars that are \nsold in China, you can impose a 25-percent tariff on the cars we want \nto sell in China. And the United States, we will impose a 2.5-percent \ntariff on Chinese cars you want to move here.\n\n  Our negotiators said to a country with which we have a huge trade \ndeficit: You can impose a tariff that is 10 times higher on American \ncars we want to sell in China than on Chinese cars they want to sell in \nAmerica.\n  Why on Earth would someone agree to that? It is fundamentally \nunsound. It doesn't make any sense. China has nearly 1.4 billion \npeople. They have 20 million automobiles on the roads. By the year \n2020, they will have 120 million cars on the road. That means in the \nnext 15 years, they will add 100 million cars. I can talk about the \nconsequences for oil and energy issues with respect to that, but here \nis a market with 1.4 billion people for 100 million additional\n\n[[Page S11738]]\n\ncars in the next 15 years. It is a country with which we have a large \ndeficit. Our country has said to them: By the way, you charge a tariff \nthat is 10 times higher on U.S. cars we try to sell in China than we \nwill charge on Chinese cars to the United States.\n  Whoever negotiated that is incompetent and ought to be thrown out of \nGovernment immediately. But we can't figure out who did that, so that \nis what stands.\n  Here is what is happening on the other side. In China, there is a \ncompany called Chery. That is one letter away from Chevy. The Chery \ncompany is producing a car called the QQ. The QQ is a car that General \nMotors says is a rip-off of the production designs, right down to the \ndetails, of a car that General Motors was building. So General Motors \nsays the Chinese company has stolen the production design blueprints \nfor a car they now call the QQ.\n  What are the Chinese about to do? They are about to ramp up a \nsignificant automobile export industry, presumably including the QQ, \nwhich General Motors says was stolen from them, and we will see Chinese \ncars on the streets of this country coming in with tariffs one-tenth \nthe rate of the tariffs if we were to try to sell U.S. cars in China--\nnot that there is a big market for U.S. cars in China because China \nisn't interested in buying too much in terms of American products.\n\n  Here is what is happening with respect to bilateral automobile trade \nwith China. It is unbelievably inept for this country to allow this to \nhappen. We should not negotiate trade agreements with countries with \nwhich we have a huge deficit and say: Here is another big advantage to \nsucking jobs out of our country and putting those jobs in China. That \nmakes no sense at all.\n  The report I referenced a bit ago is a report that talks about \nscience and technology. But it doesn't include the other discussions \nabout the conditions of production around the world. The production, \nfor example, in countries such as Bangladesh and others in which \nchildren are employed, in some cases in slavelike conditions, locked \nbehind factory doors, working 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. Those are \nthe conditions of production in some areas that U.S. workers are told \nto compete against. And to the U.S. workers: If you can't compete, you \nare going to get fired.\n  Let me describe some examples of that. I have described this at great \nlength because it is such a perfect one, but there are many others. \nThis is Huffy bicycles. Again, I guess repetition is important. Huffy \nbicycles, they are not made here anymore. They were made by folks from \nOhio. They all got fired. They got fired because they were making $11 \nan hour making Huffy bicycles, $11 an hour plus benefits. But that was \nway too much money, according to the company. So these are all now made \nin China. You can buy them at Wal-Mart and Sears and Kmart. But they \nare not American bikes. They are Chinese bikes. As an aside, the \ncompany Huffy has declared bankruptcy so that the people who used to \nwork for Huffy will not get their pensions that were guaranteed by \nHuffy, and now the American taxpayer, through the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, will be picking up that cost.\n  Here is what happened to Huffy. These people that made Huffy bicycles \nwere making an honest living, enjoyed their work, did a good job, by \nall accounts. But now they were replaced. They were fired. The new \nemployees make 33 cents an hour producing these bicycles in China. They \nwork 7 days a week, and they work 12 to 14 hours a day. That is how \nyour Huffy bike is produced. The folks who worked in Ohio are having to \nfind other things to do because they made way too much money, $11 an \nhour.\n  We built this country believing that the middle class ought to be \nable to rise up and get educated and find a good job and be paid well. \nNow we are told that is a disadvantage. If you are paid well, the \ncompany says: Employing you is a huge disadvantage to us. We would \nsooner employ somebody whom we can pay 33 cents an hour. So we have \nHuffy bicycles. People say: That is manufacturing. We are going to lose \nthose jobs because it is going to go to people in Bangladesh or China \nor other areas.\n\n  This is a Palm pilot. The last note on that Palm pilot was from a \nwonderful young woman who did everything you should do. She was an \nAfrican-American woman who got advanced degrees and did everything one \nshould do. She went into the job market and found a job in Silicon \nValley in technology working on the Palm Pilot. But her last job \ndealing with the Palm Pilot was to train the person from India who was \ngoing to take her job. That is right. They brought the replacement \nover, and then they sent her to India to train the replacement.\n  Here is what she said on her Palm Pilot on her last day of work, this \nwoman who did a good job, advanced college degrees, did everything you \nshould do. The last message was: ``My job's gone to India.'' Why? \nBecause they could hire folks there for a fraction of the cost. It is \nabout driving down wages. It is about profit, and it is about not \ncaring about American workers.\n  The message is, if you are making $11 an hour building bicycles or \nyou are working at Palm pilot, you are making too much. You should be \npaid Chinese wages. Or wages in India or Sri Lanka or Bangladesh.\n\n  Samsonite. Most of us have packed for trips with Samsonite. They sent \n1,000 U.S. workers packing. Those jobs went to Mexico. Then when \nMexican labor got too expensive, they sent those jobs to China and to \nVietnam.\n  We have all seen the Maytag repairman on television waiting for \nsomething to do. Apparently he waited too long: 1,600 Maytag U.S. jobs \ngone to Mexico and then Korea.\n  Fruit of the Loom. We all have seen these television commercials when \nthey get three guys to dress up--kind of goofy guys dressed up like red \ngrapes, green grapes, and even an apple. Fruit of the Loom guys, 3,200 \njobs gone.\n  I know on the day it happened, it was in the Washington Post that \nthey were shutting down all their factories. I said it is one thing to \nlose your shirt, but Fruit of the Loom is gone, now we've lost our \nshorts.\n  The list, of course, is an endless list. The example I have used \nbefore is Fig Newton cookies. That was an all-American cookie. Now, if \nyou want Mexican food, go to Monterey, Mexico, because that is where \nthey make Fig Newton cookies.\n  Etch-a-Sketch? We have all played Etch-a-Sketch. Wal-Mart decided \nthat Etch-a-Sketch had to be sold for under $10, $9.99. Therefore the \nEtch-a-Sketch company had to move to China to hire Chinese workers in \norder to keep Etch-a-Sketch at $9.99. All those workers lost their \njobs. The list is almost endless. They don't make one pair of Levis in \nAmerica. What is more American than a pair of Levis, except they don't \nmake one pair of Levis in America. Gone; they are all gone.\n  We have all these people sitting around in this Chamber who voted for \nall these trade agreements--NAFTA, CAFTA, SHAFTA. We have all these \nacronyms for trade agreements. We have people who voted for all of \nthem. Why? Because they think it is free trade and free trade is what \nleads to prosperity in our country.\n  The question is, when you have the examples I have used with respect \nto trade deficits, one wonders how anyone can take a look at this and \ncontinue down the same road. If this is what this trade philosophy buys \nus, how can we continue it? Who will have the jobs in this country? \nWhere will the jobs exist that produce a middle class and sustain a \nmiddle class with people coming out of college and high school \nexpecting to find decent jobs when those jobs are being moved elsewhere \nat a record pace?\n  If they say to you, No, this is about producing factory products, \npencils and erasers, it is not true. We are now seeing medical \ntechnology jobs going elsewhere. We are seeing engineering jobs go \nelsewhere. We are seeing technology jobs going elsewhere.\n  IBM, Big Blue, General Motors. General Motors had a meeting that was \nlittle reported, but it was a meeting that was held in Detroit. It was \non April 7, 2005. A man named Beau Anderson, who is the top purchasing \nagent for General Motors, called together all the top suppliers to \nGeneral Motors. He told 380 executives from those suppliers that \nGeneral Motors has to cut costs and you ought to consider building your \ncar parts in China.\n  The effect of that, of course, is General Motors saying to their \nsuppliers:\n\n[[Page S11739]]\n\nWe want your jobs to go to China. Why? To save money and cut costs. It \nwas interesting that 2 months after that, General Motors announced a \nplan to cut 25,000 jobs. At the same time, they move out their biggest \nselling brand on television and wave the American Flag and say: This is \nan American revolution. No, it is not an American revolution, not if \nyou are telling all your suppliers to move American jobs to China. That \nis not an American revolution.\n  Or what about Big Blue, IBM, a good American company? These are all \ngood companies. It is just that the culture has changed. I wonder if \nthey say the Pledge of Allegiance in the boardroom because their fealty \nis to the stockholders and profits and not so much caring about \nAmerican jobs.\n  IBM officials Harry Newman and Tom Lynch were in the process of \nlaying off 13,000 U.S. workers and also some workers in Europe and \nhiring 14,000 workers at the same time in India. Here is an excerpt of \nthe presentation the two IBM officials made. They said:\n\n       The good news is, we have not been cited in the press for a \n     lot of what we are doing here. A couple of years ago, we went \n     to Mexico with our PC--\n\n  That is personal computer--\n\n     business as a cheap source of labor. Now Mexico doesn't look \n     as cheap as some other markets.\n\n  And then they say to the managers how to break the news to the IBM \nemployees who will be laid off:\n\n       Don't be transparent regarding the purpose or the intent. \n     The terms ``onshore'' and ``offshore'' should never be used.\n\n  In other words, they wanted to get rid of these American employees \nbut did not want to talk straight to them. And, oh, yes, the last thing \nthey said in their memo to IBM employees is: Workers should be told as \nthey are laid off, so they can hire these engineers in India, that this \naction in no way is a comment on the excellent work they have done over \nthe years.\n  Really? I thought if you did good work, if you contributed to the \ncompany's interests that you probably would not be someone who is fired \nor lose your job. In 2003, the Washington Post reported that more than \none-half of all Fortune 500 companies were outsourcing software \ndevelopment overseas. One-half of the Fortune 500 companies are now \nmoving software development jobs overseas.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the reason that many companies are \nfinding it advantageous to pole-vault from the United States to other \ncountries and employ these workers. You can employ workers without the \nrestrictions you have in our country. If you want to open a \nmanufacturing plant in China or Bangladesh, for example, you do not \nhave to worry about these things that are a nuisance here, such as the \nminimum wage. There is no minimum wage, or at least not any that is \nadhered to. You don't have to worry about worker safety. You don't have \nto worry about working in a safe work plant, about dumping chemicals \ninto the air or water, and, by the way, you sure don't have to worry \nabout somebody joining a labor union. You can fire them or, better yet, \njail them, according to the Chinese authorities.\n\n  I can offer some examples of the names of people who are now sitting \nin Chinese jails. What was their transgression? Trying to organize \nworkers to decide they should not have to work 7 days a week, 12, 14 \nhours a day for 30, 40, and 50 cents an hour. They tried to organize \nthose workers and now they find themselves in Chinese prisons.\n  We have been through all of that in this country. This is not \nsomething that is new to us. We, for a century, worked through these \nissues. Most people won't know of James Fyler. James Fyler, I once \nsaid, died of acute lead poisoning. I should not have done that. He was \nshot 54 times. James Fyler was shot 54 times. You know what he was \ndoing? He was leading a labor strike in 1914 of coal miners objecting \nto working conditions, compensation, and hours. It is not just James \nFyler who lost his life. Children working in the silk mills in \nPatterson, NJ, what was their demand? Eleven-hour days and 6-day \nworkweeks. That is what they wanted. They wanted a 6-day workweek with \n11 hours a day. That is what the kids wanted in Patterson, NJ.\n  In 1877, 10 coal miners were hanged in Pennsylvania. In 1903, Mary \nHarris Jones led a strike to demand a 55-hour workweek. In 1911, a fire \nat the Triangle Shirt Waste Company killed 147 people--women and mostly \nyoung girls locked in a 10-story building in sweatshop conditions. So \nwe have been through all of this. In 1932, five U.S. autoworkers were \nbeaten to death in Dearborn, MI, by Michigan police and goons when they \nwent on a hunger march against Ford Motor.\n  We have been through all of this. Our country decided that in America \nwe want to have child labor laws, we want to have fair wages, we \nbelieve that workers contribute to a company, we believe people ought \nto have a right to organize, and we believe workers ought to have the \nright to work in a safe workplace. We have been through it all. And now \nthe way to avoid all of that is to fire your American workers and move \nthe jobs to China or some other country.\n  In fact, unbelievably--and I will not name all the names today, \nalthough I should; I am writing a book at the moment and I will name \nall the names in the book--unbelievably, this Senate supports a tax \nprovision that rewards companies that shut down their American \nmanufacturing plants and move jobs overseas. We voted on that, I \nbelieve, four times on amendments I offered. I have lost all four of \nthe amendments. On all four occasions, this Senate has expressed itself \nby saying, We believe it is appropriate to provide tax incentives to \nAmerican companies that shut down their American plants, get rid of \ntheir American workers, and move the jobs overseas. That is \nunbelievable to me, but it is true, and all the names of the folks who \nvoted that way--they know who they are--we will vote on it again, and \nwe will continue to pay for it, we will reward it.\n  The question is what kind of a country is going to exist here 5 and \n10 years from now as this line of dramatic increases in red ink \ncontinues.\n  One of the interesting characters I have met in my life is Warren \nBuffett, the second richest man in the world. He lives in Omaha, NE. He \nis as plain as an old shoe. I am sure he doesn't mind me saying that. \nHe is the second richest man in the world, and you wouldn't know it. I \ndon't know how you act as the second richest man in the world. Whatever \nit is, he doesn't act it. He is an interesting, provocative thinker.\n  What does he say about all this? Warren Buffett is one of the few \nmajor business figures in this country who says this is nuts; this is \ndangerous. He said we are heading toward a sharecropper society in this \ncountry in which other countries own the assets of America because \nevery single day $2 billion goes to some other country. We buy $2 \nbillion more from those countries than we sell to those countries. They \nhold American assets with which they can buy American stocks and bonds, \nand they can buy American real estate.\n  We are selling America piece by piece, and Warren Buffett is the only \nbusiness leader I am aware of who speaks out on this subject, I am sure \nat some displeasure of other business leaders in this country.\n  I know some will listen to all of this and say it is the same old \nanticorporation rant. I want corporations to do well. I recognize big \nisn't always bad and small isn't always beautiful. You are not going to \nbuild a 757 airplane in a garage someplace in a small town. We need \neconomies of scale. We do need larger enterprises for that. But I also \nbelieve there ought to be some courage to stand up for the economic \ninterests of this country and, once it is decided the gate is open for \ncompanies to decide anywhere in the world they want to hire workers for \npennies on the hour and get rid of their American workers, we ought to \nunderstand the consequences of that for our country.\n  The solution is not to train triple or quadruple the number of \nengineers in our country. While I would think that is probably a useful \nthing, that does not solve our problem. Having trained engineers who \nare unemployed is relatively worthless. What we need are trade \nagreements that stand up for our country's economic interests and, \nregrettably, those trade agreements at this point don't exist.\n  I wish to point out that nobody wants to talk about these issues, \nleast of all the Labor Department. This is\n\n[[Page S11740]]\n\nfrom the Associated Press. It says, ``Labor Department Withholds Trade \nReports.'' And just before we voted on the Central American free trade \nagreement, the Department of Labor, we discover, had kept secret for \nmore than a year Government-commissioned studies that supported those \nof us who were opponents of this new trade deal. It talks about the \nfact that in the Central American countries there are just horrible \nlabor conditions.\n  I wanted to show you a picture that shows the face of Central \nAmerican labor. This is a young--I believe this boy is 11 years old in \nthe sugarcane field in Honduras in this particular case. That is the \nface of labor in Central America.\n  The report in question was kept secret by the Department of Labor for \na year. Why? Because they didn't want those of us in the Chamber who \nopposed the Central American free trade agreement to have that \ninformation.\n  If you wonder what the face of unfair trade looks like, this is an \nexample. These are teenage girls whose hands are bound by ropes. I \nbelieve this is in Bangladesh. These pictures were taken by a \njournalist who was there. These young girls raised some objections to \nthe working conditions in their factory in Bangladesh. The working \nconditions were unbelievable: 12- to 14-hour days, 7 days a week. And \nso they decided to protest. These are young kids who are held virtually \ncaptive. By the way, the product of their work comes to the United \nStates and Europe for sale.\n  But let me show you the rest of the photographs that have been taken \nin Bangladesh. Here is a young woman shot in the stomach, part of the \nsame group. Here are the pictures by the same photographer of the \nbeatings.\n  What is this all about? It is about young kids, kids as young as 10 \nand 12 years old being put in factories in intolerable conditions \nworking 12, 14 hours a day, 7 days a week without a break saying, Wait \na second, this is killing us. And what is the result? The result is a \ntrained police force comes in and decides to beat them mercilessly.\n  That picture is self-explanatory. That man is dead, shot dead because \nhe believed that those labor conditions were intolerable and believed \npeople ought to have a right to some self-determination.\n  We talk a lot about freedom these days. What about the freedom for \nthese kids in Bangladesh? What about some knowledge by American \nconsumers about the conditions of production for all these cheap \nproducts? It is something nobody wants to talk much about, but it is \nsomething one of these days this Congress and this country are going to \nhave to deal with.\n  This economy is not doing well. Most of us know that. Oh, there was a \nspurt of some income-tax receipts and the spurt of those income-tax \nreceipts recently was caused by a perverse business decision by this \nCongress, and those who voted for that will know of that as well. That \ndecision was, let's decide for all those companies that have moved \ntheir jobs overseas and that are making money overseas move to America \nat some point and repatriate their profit and pay taxes, let's decide \nfor them that we will give them a 5\\1/4\\-percent tax rate. Nobody else \nin the country has that. Nobody. But for those who moved their jobs \noverseas and they repatriate their income, we will let them pay 5\\1/4\\ \nrather than 35 percent.\n  What about my Uncle Harold? Why shouldn't he pay 5\\1/4\\ percent? Why \nshouldn't the rest of the people pay 5\\1/4\\ percent income tax? No, \nthat wasn't good enough for all Americans, just the big interests that \nmoved their jobs overseas.\n  I didn't support it. I thought it was outrageous, unbelievable to do \nthis, but this Congress did it. It is pretty accommodating to big \neconomic interests, and so we had votes and I voted against it; many \nvoted for it. And so we have had a repatriation of income and had some \nsmall increase in income tax because of that. That is temporary. So now \npeople say, Well, the deficit is less this year than last year. This \nyear is still the third highest deficit in the history of this country. \nAnd it is going higher. It was less this year because of this \nperversion of rewarding companies that moved their jobs overseas. In \nfact, the Federal debt increased in the last year by over a half a \ntrillion dollars. The trade debt increased, or will increase, this year \nby over $700 billion. That is $1.2 trillion in total indebtedness. We \nare way off track, just way off track.\n  Is there alarm or concern about it? No, not really I guess. We get \nhit with a hurricane. Well, the payment for that is very much like the \nwar in Iraq. We get a budget from the President at the start of the \nyear and it says, OK, we are in Iraq, we have 140,000 American troops \nin Iraq, it is costing a great deal of money, it is costing about $5 to \n$6 billion a month in Iraq and Afghanistan and guess what, my budget \nrequests zero funding for it. Zero. This wouldn't pass eighth grade \narithmetic.\n  So now every year the President sends us a budget with zero funding. \nSo OK, we pass a budget because we understand later on the President \nwill come back to this Chamber and say, oh, by the way, there is \nanother expenditure to be approved outside the budget for emergency \nfunding. It can add to the debt and nobody should care about that. And \nso then we get an emergency funding request for $50 billion, $40 \nbillion, $70 billion, and that is the way it goes. No one is willing to \nstare truth in the face. But we are in significant trouble here, headed \ntoward a result that is not a good result for this country.\n  The question for all of us is, When will we be straight? When will \nthis Congress and this President be straight with the American people? \nBeing straight with the American people means to get the fiscal house \nin order and to solve this trade mess. If we don't, we are burdening \nour kids with massive amounts of debt, unparalleled in the history of \nthis country.\n  Is there evidence that the President is interested in this? No. Very \nlittle, very little at all. Is there evidence that Congress wants to \ndeal with this?\n  Well, it is interesting. You go back to the year 2001 when the \nexpectation was there had been a turnaround, things were looking \nbetter, not necessarily with respect to trade but with respect to the \nbudget, we were going to have surpluses and all of a sudden the \nprediction was surpluses for 10 straight years and the President said \nto the Congress: You know what the predictions are for 10 straight \nyears. Let's provide really big tax cuts. Some of us said: You know, \nmaybe that is not the conservative way. Maybe we should be \nconservative. What if something happens? What if the surpluses don't \nmaterialize? The expectation of surpluses for 10 years, what if they \nare not there? What if something happens? Oh, don't worry, be happy, \nlet's have big tax cuts.\n  And so those who got the biggest tax cuts were those with the biggest \nincome. If you were a millionaire, I am telling you, in 2001 you should \nhave had a lot of celebrating to do because you got the largest tax \ncuts you had ever seen.\n  So we had tax cuts and then all of a sudden we have a recession. Then \nwe have a war in Afghanistan. We have the terrorist attack of 9/11, a \nwar in Afghanistan, a war in Iraq. Then we have the proposed surpluses \nturning to big deficits, following which we have massive natural \ndisasters. Now we have continuing costs of $5 to $6 billion a month in \nIraq and Afghanistan and we have been hit with Hurricane Katrina and \nHurricane Rita. The President says we can deal with all that.\n\n  If we just took back the tax cuts for those with over $1 million a \nyear in income, just that, and should probably do it this afternoon, if \nwe just took back the tax cuts, the tax cuts given to those with a \nmillion a year or more of income, we would raise about $32 billion a \nyear.\n  Use that to reduce the deficit. I am for that. Is that picking on \nmillionaires? No. They have the highest growth in income in the last \ndecade. They didn't need a tax cut, especially a tax cut that we have \ncharged and added to the debt because the surplus didn't exist.\n  But, Mr. President, we cannot possibly begin to put this country back \non track unless we address both issues of the fiscal policy that is \ndangerously off track and a trade policy that is not only incompetent \nand ``fundamentally dumb'' with people chanting on street corners about \nfree trade when the evidence is all around us that has abysmally \nfailed. If we don't address these things, we don't have much of an \neconomic future.\n  There is not a Republican or Democratic way to address them. There is \na\n\n[[Page S11741]]\n\nright and a wrong way to address them. And you can't start until the \ncountry has the will, until the Congress and the President have the \nwill and exhibit the leadership to address them.\n  McCullough spoke about John Adams in that book ``John Adams'' as they \nwere trying to put this new country together. Adams is traveling a lot, \nespecially in Europe, and he writes to Abigail. And that is why we know \na lot about John Adams. Back then he would say to Abigail as he was \ntraveling: From where will the leadership come? Where will the \nleadership come from to help form this new country of ours? Where will \nthe leadership emerge?\n  Then in a later letter he would sort of say lamentingly, there is \nreally only us to provide the leadership. There is just us. There is \nme; there is George Washington; there is Thomas Jefferson; there is Ben \nFranklin; there is Mason; there is Madison. Well, in the rearview \nmirror of history they were only a few of some of the great talent in \nhuman history who framed quite a remarkable country and a Constitution \nthat says ``we the people.''\n  But every generation of Americans has to ask the same question: From \nwhere will the leadership come? Who will emerge as the leaders to help \nput this on track? That is especially the case now. Who will emerge as \nthe leaders to begin standing up for the economic interests of this \ncountry and to say that we can't continue these kinds of trade \ndeficits, we can't continue shipping good American jobs overseas \nbecause people who make $11 an hour are paid too much? Where will the \nmiddle class in America be? Will we have a middle class if $11 an hour \nis the wage that is too high? Are we going to be willing to stand up \nfor the economic interests for our country? Are our trade policies \ndesigned to raise other countries or push our country down? The answer \nto that, quite clearly, is push down wages and opportunities.\n  You read every day in your local newspapers about what is happening \nto pensions and benefits for workers across this country and, for that \nmatter, wages.\n  If I might close with just the Palm Pilot message from the young \nwoman from Silicon Valley. I think it says it all. I mean you lose your \njob in this country. You go to school; you get an education; you go to \nwork for a technology company; you build Palm Pilots, help design them; \nand the last message on this young woman's Palm Pilot was ``My job's \ngone to India.'' Guess what. She trained her successor as well. That is \nwhat the company required her to do at her last job. So the next time \npeople say it is only about manufacturing jobs and it is really \nadvantageous for us if we can find someone to make shoes and shirts and \npants and clothes and trinkets and trousers in China or Bangladesh \nbecause it is cheaper for us to go to a big box retailer and pay that \nmoney, when they say that, understand it is not just about those jobs. \nYes, it is jobs, but it is about jobs going to India and somebody who \nmade Palm Pilots. It is about engineers going to India. It is about a \nmassive loss of American jobs, 3 million in the last 4 years, and much, \nmuch more to come, given the trade agreements we have had and given the \ntrade agreements that are now being negotiated.\n  I have one last point. Right now Ambassador Portman is negotiating a \nnew trade deal in a place called Doha. I am assuming they are \nnegotiating in Doha because they can't do it in New York or Paris or \nLondon or places such as that; the streets would be full of \ndemonstrators because people are fed up with these kinds of agreements. \nSo they are negotiating in Doha behind closed doors in secret and our \nnegotiator has, in my judgment, just put a cherry on top of whipped \ncream on the sundae here in terms of incompetency. He said everything \nis on the table.\n  That means for everybody who is unfairly dumping in our country, we \nare willing to trade it away; it is on the table as they trade away our \nantidumping laws. That is the protection we are supposed to have in \ntrade law against those who would commit unfair trade practices against \nus. We are willing to trade that away, the antidumping and the \ncounterveiling duties. It is all on the table.\n  This is unbelievable to me. This country needs a spine, a backbone, \nand a willingness to stand up for its own economic interests, and this \nhas now been the case for some long while.\n  Mr. President, I will again offer amendments dealing with trade. I \nwill offer the amendment which has been defeated now four times that \nrewards tax breaks, companies that ship American jobs overseas and \nhope, perhaps, that if not enough see the light perhaps more will feel \nthe heat. One day perhaps there will be a majority who will step \nforward to stop this insidious practice to provide tax breaks for \ncompanies that ship American jobs overseas. If we can't take the first \nbaby step, there is little hope to keep good jobs in this county.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE.

SOUSLIN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a young \nsoldier who was taken from us far too soon. Army pfc Kenneth C. Souslin \nfrom Lexington, OH, lost his life on December 15, 2003, while serving \nour Nation in Iraq. He was 21 years old at the time of his death.\n  Kenneth--Kacey to his family and friends--was born on October 10, \n1982, to loving parents, Kenneth and Cecelia. Growing up as the \nyoungest of five boys, he quickly learned the importance of developing \nhis own identity--and it was one of fearlessness, dedication, duty, and \ncompassion. From a young age, he was devoted to his family and to his \nfaith. Sean Davis, who knew Kacey since the 5th grade, remembers how he \nwould sprint across the cafeteria to give his mom a hug whenever she \ncame to their school.\n  At Lexington High School, Kacey was well-liked by all. His father \nsaid that Kacey ``did not know an enemy. He was outgoing . . . not \nscared of anything.'' As a member of the drama club, he acted in \nseveral plays, including ``Second Chance'' and ``Country Gothic.'' \nDrama teacher, Ray Gerrell remembers how well Kacey performed, despite \na speech impediment. He said that Kacey ``did wonderfully. . . . He \ngave 100 percent.''\n  Though he loved being on the stage, Kacey also had a shy side. \nEnglish teacher, Sally Giefer, considers Kacey's Junior Prom as one of \nher favorite memories of him. She recalls this about that dance:\n\n       [Kacey] was so shy. He hid in the bathroom for 45 minutes. \n     I had his friends get him out and told him that we needed to \n     dance. He replied that he didn't know how and I said that \n     there are no rules to dancing and we went and had fun. The \n     next year, Kacey had grown so much. He asked my husband for \n     permission to dance with me.\n\n  Following high school graduation, Kacey enlisted in the U.S. Army to \nsee the world, experience new cultures, and meet new people--all while \nearning money for college. His family had already taught him the value \nof service through their own selfless examples. Kacey's father served \nin the U.S. Air Force in Thailand, and his brother, Bryant, served for \n4 years in the Navy and then enlisted in the Air Force Reserves.\n  Kacey reported to boot camp at Fort Gordon, GA. There, he never \ncomplained and was known as a hard worker. Lexington High School \nPrincipal, Jim Goode, recalls that when Kacey returned with his \nrecruiter to the high school wearing his Army uniform, he was full of \nconfidence. Kacey gave him such a firm handshake that afterward, he had \nto pull his fingers apart.\n  Kacey was assigned to the 440th Signal Battalion, 22nd Signal \nBrigade, V Corps, stationed in Darmstadt, Germany. He arrived in Iraq \nin September 2003 and was stationed north of Baghdad.\n  Army Private First Class Souslin loved to serve and defend our \nNation.\n  He was a good soldier.\n  He was a proud soldier.\n  He was a dedicated soldier.\n  Soon after Kacey's death, Sergeant Jan Wendling of the Mansfield, OH, \nPolice Department, wrote a letter to the Editor of the Mansfield News \nJournal newspaper expressing condolences to his family and friends and \nto remind us all about the gratitude we owe to all the men and women \nserving in our military. The following is an excerpt from that letter:\n\n\n[[Page S11742]]\n\n\n       My heart sank when I read about PFC Kenneth Souslin losing \n     his life in Iraq. . . . The suffering that families must \n     endure for the rest of their lives is very seldom felt by the \n     average citizen, and they are often forgotten. Let us never \n     forget the sacrifices that our men and women in the armed \n     forces and their families make for us every day. When you see \n     a serviceman or woman, thank them for the unselfish job they \n     do for us. Let them know that the work they do is very \n     important to all our lives. Most of all pray that they will \n     all return to their loved ones safely.\n\n  Indeed, Sergeant Wendling is right. We have an obligation to support \nand honor all of our service members--those who are with us and those \nwho have given the ultimate sacrifice. Kacey Souslin served so that our \nworld could be a better place. He served so that we could be protected \nso that our children and grandchildren can feel safe.\n  Kacey put everything he had into his service. One Internet tribute \nhonoring him, comrade David Sanders wrote the following:\n\n       It's been [a while] and still Souslin comes into my \n     thoughts daily. I was in the 440th with him in Germany. In \n     Iraq, he used to come by my work area every morning on his \n     way to work. There are no words to describe the love he had \n     for his fellow soldiers. He truly was a wonderful friend, \n     confidant, and soldier.\n\n  Army Specialist Sean Page echoed these same sentiments when he wrote \nthis:\n\n       I am a soldier. I knew Kenneth because I am in the same \n     company that he was in. I slept in the very tent that he \n     slept in. I am writing this message to both offer my \n     condolences and to honor his memory. Kenneth, whom we knew as \n     ``hot sauce,'' was a good man and a good soldier. His loss \n     will be felt within [the] 440th for a long time to come.\n\n  Kacey Souslin was a good natured, daring, committed, outgoing, and \nreliable young man, who served our Nation with honor. As the Lexington, \nOH, community mourned for Kacey at the memorial service held in his \nhonor, Reverend John Sgro offered the following consoling words:\n\n       [Kacey's] life has touched a part of all of our lives. In \n     the midst of bullets and bombs, in the midst of hate and \n     evil, we can have a peace.\n\n  Though Kacey Souslin left this Earth far too soon, he had a very \npositive impact on countless lives in his all-too-brief 21 years with \nus. He continues to live on in the hearts and minds of his family and \nall those who were lucky enough to know him.\n  My wife Fran and I keep Kacey and his parents and his brothers \nJoshua, Adam, Bryant, and Robert in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                  Marine Lance Corporal Andrew Nowacki\n\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, I rise today to pay tribute to an exemplary soldier \nand an outstanding young man. Marine LCpl Andrew Nowacki, from South \nEuclid, OH, was killed in Iraq when a roadside bomb struck his Humvee \non the afternoon of February 26, 2005, just south of Baghdad. He was 24 \nyears old.\n  Andrew--Andy to his family and friends--served the public and \nprotected the peace in two nations separated by time, distance and \ncircumstance. As a police officer with the Grand River Police \nDepartment in Ohio, and as a Marine serving in Iraq, Andy dedicated his \nlife to helping his fellow man. It was his calling. And, he was \nremarkably good at it.\n  Andy was in harm's way on that Saturday afternoon in February \nprecisely because he had earned the trust and respect of his fellow \nMarines. Andy's commanding officer, Sergeant Paul A. Shook, explained \nin a letter to Andy's parents:\n\n       I picked Andy to be my gunner. . . . Andy's job was very \n     difficult compared to that of other gunners because he was \n     more exposed than most of them. I needed someone I could \n     trust, who wouldn't hesitate at any moment to offer the \n     protection we needed. Andy was that Marine. I felt very safe \n     having him watching over me, and I never questioned his \n     judgment. . . . I thank God that Andy was in my life and . . \n     . for the rare privilege to have put my safety in his hands.\n\n  It has been said that challenges don't build character, but, rather, \nthat they reveal it. This certainly was the case for Andy. Andy's \ncharacter was forged in Ohio with the love and support of his family. \nThe challenges he faced abroad in Iraq simply revealed the core of this \ncourageous, loving and, above all, joyful young man.\n  Andy was the youngest of three boys. His parents, Sheila and Denis \nNowacki raised him to honor God and country through his actions. Even \nas a small child, Andy demonstrated selfless concern for the welfare of \nothers. As his mother, Sheila remembers, ``Even as a kid, he never \ncared what he got for Christmas. He was happier picking the perfect \ngift for other people.''\n  His father Denis recalls that Andy followed a simple rule: Try and do \nsomething kind for someone else everyday. Always smiling, always happy, \nfull of his totally original sense of humor, Andy inspired family and \nfriends. He lived life joyfully and that joy was contagious.\n  Andy graduated from Brush High School in Lyndhurst, OH, in 1998, and \nenlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve the next fall. Andy's first \nexperience in the Marines prepared him for the next chapter in his \nlife--his time as a police officer. Andy wanted to work in law \nenforcement so that he could help others. And, as Andy's older brother, \nNathan, remembers, ``He told me he had become a police officer to \nreward the good and punish the bad.'' In 2000, Andy joined the Grand \nRiver Police Department. He worked 3 years as 1 of 31 Grand River \nofficers and, during that time, he became part of a brotherhood that \nwould never forget him.\n  Andy's work as a police officer required empathy and compassion--\nsomething that Andy had in spades. Robert Antonelli, the Grand River \nChief of Police and the man who hired Andy, reflected on what made Andy \nso good at his job. This is what he said:\n\n       Every time he had to work the road, Andy would treat every \n     call as unique. He was able to adjust to help a little girl, \n     or [help] a child off a school bus, or handle a domestic \n     violence [situation]. The outcome would always be positive. \n     He could be passionate when he had to be. If he had to put \n     the law down, he put the law down. But, he always put that \n     smile on his face. I am honored that he was part of the \n     family we have. Only a policeman understands about other \n     policemen. We're brothers in blue. He was family to us.\n\n  Andy's dad remembers the way that Andy thought of his job: ``He \nthought it wasn't his job to hurt people. It was his job to educate. He \nwas a man's man and a cop's cop. He delivered the courage of his \nconvictions.'' An avid outdoorsman and animal lover, Andy loved to work \non bike patrol. Outside, close to the people he was serving, Andy had \nthe opportunity to touch the lives of so many in his small village of \n345 people. He loved the weekly dinners at Chief Antonelli's house. He \nloved working with his brothers in blue.\n  In the village hall in Grand River, which houses the police station, \na display celebrates Andy's service. His silver police badge, No. 15, \nstill gleams alongside his starched uniform hat and still-crisp bike \npatrol t-shirt and dozens of photographs.\n  By 2003, as the conflict in Iraq escalated, Andy--again compelled by \nhis compassion for others--answered the Marines' call to serve. Andy \nwas in Iraq for 9 months in 2003, and returned in September 2004, when \nhis obligation to the Reserve was almost over. During his first 6 \nmonths in Iraq, he had already suffered injuries to his right arm after \na truck he was riding in suddenly blew up. But, in spite of his \nexperiences and injuries, the images that he brought back from the war \nzone were those of life, not death.\n  His mother remembers that ``Andy was one of the most joyful people. \nHe was an animal lover. Many of the pictures that he brought back from \nIraq were of children and animals.'' One picture, in particular, \ncaptures the very essence of Andy and what he brought to that troubled \npart of the world. In the picture, Andy is smiling that charming, \nboyish smile with his arms around two young Iraqi children. You can see \nthe admiration that these children felt toward him.\n  Again, Andy was making a difference on that most basic, human level. \nAndy's father said he will forever cherish that photograph. He said, \n``That's what [Andy] was all about.''\n  In spite of all the violence that Andy saw firsthand, he remained \ncommitted to being in Iraq as long as he was needed. His mother \nexplained:\n\n       He'd been in Iraq more than he'd been home the last two \n     years. But, he really was OK with being over there because he \n     saw the oppression and the cruelty that had happened to the \n     people there. His heart went out to the Iraqi people and the \n     deplorable conditions that they lived in. He thought a lot of \n     the Iraqi people, and he was willing to go back because he \n     thought we were doing so much good.\n\n  And that's exactly what he did--he went back for a second tour of \nduty in Iraq. Though he was scheduled to come\n\n[[Page S11743]]\n\nback and live with his parents on April 1 of this year, he didn't rule \nout the possibility of going to Iraq for even a third tour. Throughout \nhis time there, Andy kept in close touch with his family and his \nfriends in the police force. Andy's last phone call home on February 24 \nwas to tell his parents that he was scheduled to return home in about 4 \nweeks--just in time to celebrate his 25th birthday.\n  The sudden and tragic events of February 26 devastated family and \nfriends, alike. Choking back tears, Police Chief Robert Anotelli \nremembers his last contact with Andy. He said:\n\n       I have a message from him on my answering machine. . . . He \n     was talking about buying a camelback for the captain. He said \n     he was okay, to tell the guys ``I love you, and I'll see you \n     when I get back.'' I will never ever erase that message.\n\n  When asked about the impact of the news on the Grand River Police, \nChief Antonelli said: ``You ever see 29 grown men cry? You don't get \nmany guys like Andy. He was the real deal. Andy believed in what he was \ndoing in Iraq. He's a true hero.'' As Andy's brother, Nathan said, \n``The world's a lesser place right now. He made everyone around him \nbetter.''\n  Andy's death has prompted an overwhelming outpouring of love and \nsupport. Perhaps, best of all, it has prompted people to remember and \nappreciate the beautiful person that Andy was. Family and friends \nremember Andy's unique sense of humor. His fellow police officers \nremember how he would bring disco balls in police cruisers just to make \nhis partners laugh or how he'd bring smiley faces to jail to entertain \nthe inmates. John Bechtel, one of Andy's good friends who works as a \npatrolman in East Cleveland had this to say:\n\n       There was never a dull moment with Andy. He never had a bad \n     day. He never complained. He was always happy. I don't think \n     I ever saw him mad. . . . He had bought a computer in Iraq, \n     and he was always downloading songs, calling me, saying \n     ``You've got to hear this song when I get back.'' And he was \n     sending me text messages somehow. I still don't know how he \n     did it.\n\n  Todd Carroscia, an East Cleveland and Timberlake police officer and \nclose pal, said Andy gave 110 percent as an officer and a friend. He \nsaid that ``Andy was a unique person. He had a smile that was amazing. \nThat smile will be stuck in my mind forever.''\n  Andy's friend, Andrew Moore, remembers all the particular mannerisms \nthat made Andy so unique, so magnetic, and so charming. In a \nheartbreaking and beautiful letter to Andy's family, he wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       His laugh was so funny. It always sounded like he was a mad \n     scientist or [something]. . . . Andy had a walk that no one \n     else had. It was more of a strut than a walk. . . . The \n     voice, the laugh, the strut, these were the things that made \n     you find out who he was on the inside and become a friend of \n     his. And once you were allowed into his world, you'd see and \n     hear things that you only see in movies or on TV.\n       He had these characteristics that movie executives pay \n     writers millions of dollars to create. But he had them, and \n     they were real . . . [He was] one of the most wonderful souls \n     ever to grace this earth--a human being [whom] thousands of \n     people loved strictly because of who he was. . . .\n\n  Family and friends also remember Andy's love of children and animals. \nAccording to his mom:\n\n       When he first got to Iraq, the first thing he did was find \n     a lizard. He must have carried that thing around in the \n     Humvee for seven months! He also had four dogs that followed \n     him around there. He was like Dr. Doolittle! He once traded a \n     case of Gatorade for chickens and a rooster. He got the \n     chickens and a rooster, because he was trying to get fresh \n     eggs. He never got fresh eggs. He got little chickens!\n\n  On March 7, 2005, a mass held at St. Gabriel Catholic Church in \nConcord, OH, drew about 1,000 mourners including hundreds of police \nofficers and Marines in dress-blue uniforms from northeast Ohio and \nPennsylvania. An honor guard of 60 members from the 4th Marine Division \nTruck Company in Erie, PA, where Andy was stationed before being \ndeployed to Iraq, soberly lined the walkway into the church. The Marine \nline was bolstered by police officers dozens deep. Andy's peacekeeping \nbrethren, both civilian and military, saluted his arrival and departure \nwith tearful eyes.\n  Two of Andy's fellow Marines helped carry his casket. They were \njoined by a Grand River police officer and three officers from East \nCleveland, home to several of Andy's closest friends.\n  The Reverend Jerome Dukes, the Catholic priest who gave Andy's \neulogy, had known the family for years, officiating at the wedding of \nAndy's parents, Sheila and Denis, and baptizing Andy as a baby. \nReverend Dukes said that ``Andy was glowing testimony of what it means \nto be merciful and a peacemaker. He shared his life and liberty with \nall of us.\n  Andy was buried with full military honors in the All Souls Cemetery \nin Chardon, Ohio.\n  In honor of Andy, a memorial scholarship fund has been established at \nLakeland Community College in Kirtland, Ohio. The scholarship fund \nbenefits students entering the police academy, criminal justice \nprogram, EMT and firefighter programs offered at Lakeland. It is \nexpected to last in perpetuity.\n  Along with Congressman Steve LaTourette, I am an honorary Co-Chair of \nthe Andy Nowacki Memorial Scholarship Committee. The fund expresses \nAndy's desire to help those who shared his love of humanity and pubic \nservice. Andy wanted to give so that others might have the opportunity \nto give back, too.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Andy's family and friends--\nespecially his brothers Nathan and Peter and his parents Sheila and \nDenis--in our thoughts and in our prayers. The best comfort that we can \ngive them is to remember all the good and joy that Andy brought into \nthe world in a life that was all too brief. We can also remember one of \nAndy's favorite sayings: ``Smile. There's nothing to be unhappy \nabout.''\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STEVEN A. VALDEZ\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nyoung Arkansan who, in the name of freedom, paid the ultimate sacrifice \non behalf of the nation he loved. Steven A. Valdez was a brave soldier \nwho died a hero in a foreign land, but he was also a caring young man \nwho deeply loved his family and friends and they were never far from \nhis mind.\n  Those who knew Lance Corporal Valdez from his childhood in McRea, a \nsmall north-central Arkansas town, remember him as competitive, \nenergetic and fun-loving. He graduated from Beebe High School in 2004 \nand, soon after, followed the footsteps of his older brother Glenn \nSkaggs, and his grandfather Billy Skaggs, into the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  In November of 2004, Lance Corporal Valdez reported to the Marine \nCorps Base at Kaneohe Bay, HI. Serving with the 2nd Battalion, 3rd \nMarine Regiment, he was deployed to Afghanistan in June as a machine \ngun operator with Weapons Platoon Company E. Within the year, his \nfamily received a letter from the Marines, which cited Valdez's \npromotion to Lance Corporal and praised him for going above and beyond \nwhat was asked or expected of him. While serving in Afghanistan, Lance \nCorporal Valdez was stationed at Camp Blessing. The camp is located in \neastern Afghanistan, in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains near \nthe Pakistani border, and serves as a forward operating base for \nintelligence and military operations aimed to train Afghan security \nforces and track down al-Qaida terrorists. He served with a platoon of \nMarines guarding the camp.\n  While serving in Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Valdez and his \ngrandfather, Billy had an agreement; Billy would send care packages \nwith his grandson's favorite snacks and items from home, but he would \nalso include phone cards with the expectation that the young marine \nwould call his grandfather once a week. For Lance Corporal Valdez, it \nwas a much-needed respite from the stresses of war that allowed him to \nfeel a little closer to home; for Billy, it was reassuring to hear his \ngrandson's voice and to know that he was safe and healthy.\n  On September 26, insurgents attacked Camp Blessing with mortar, \nrocket-propelled grenades and small-arms fire. Lance Corporal Valdez \nwas struck by shrapnel from a mortar while running to his machine gun \npost. The brave 20-year-old died shortly after.\n  In remembering their loved one Corporal Valdez's proud grandfather \nspeaks of him as a ``true hero.'' When his brother, SGT Glenn Skaggs, \nreturns to Iraq, he will be concerned about his own well-being, but \nonly in the sense that he doesn't want to put\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\nhis family through another grieving process. Despite these concerns, in \na manner typical of this courageous and selfless family, he proudly \nstates ``My brother was over there for something he believed in, and I \nwant to help finish it.''\n  Although Steven Valdez may no longer be with us, his legacy and his \nspirit will forever live on in our hearts. On behalf of a grateful \nnation, my thoughts and prayers go out his family, friends, and all who \nknew and loved him.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nproperty tax rebates and other benefits provided to volunteer \nfirefighters, search\n\n[[Page S11745]]\n\nand rescue personnel, and emergency medical responders from income and \nemployment taxes and wage withholding; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with my colleague \nSenator Smith to introduce bipartisan legislation to improve important \ntax relief to volunteer firefighters and emergency first responders. \nCongressman John Larson of Connecticut has introduced similar \nlegislation in the House of Representatives.\n  Seventy-five percent of firefighters and emergency first responders \nin our country today are volunteers. Statistics show that the number of \nvolunteer firefighters and emergency first responders has declined in \npast years. Since 1983, the number of volunteer firefighters and \nemergency first responders has declined anywhere between 5 and 10 \npercent. Meanwhile, the number of emergency calls made to these \nvolunteer services has increased sharply.\n  Many municipalities across the country, including those within the \nState of Connecticut, offer stipends and property tax abatements to \nvolunteer firefighters, search and rescue personnel, emergency medical \ntechnicians, paramedics and ambulance drivers. These incentives have \nhelped local fire departments and emergency first responder services \nrecruit and retain volunteers.\n  In 2002, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, ruled that property tax \nabatements to volunteers should be treated as wages and income. This \nruling significantly diminished the net value of tax abatements for \nvolunteer firefighters and emergency first responders.\n  The legislation that Senator Smith and I are introducing amends the \nInternal Revenue Code to exclude property tax abatements and stipends \nfor volunteer firefighters and emergency first responders from the \ndefinition of income and wages. This bill would allow State and \nmunicipal governments to continue providing these incentives to their \nvolunteer fighters and emergency first responders without any adverse \nfederal tax implications.\n  I have long believed that our country should do more to encourage \nAmericans to volunteer in their communities. A modest tax break is not \na large repayment for the great services that volunteer firefighters \nand emergency first responders provide to our communities. They \nliterally risk their lives daily for others. The least we can do is \nallow States and municipalities to offer these modest incentives to \nserve.\n  The current IRS rule--while on one level understandable--nevertheless \ncomplicates the good intentions and creative efforts of many states and \nmunicipalities. If our State and municipal governments are willing to \nforgo their local tax revenues in order to ensure that they have enough \nvolunteer firefighters and emergency first responders to protect their \ncommunities, then our country should in my view support those State and \nlocal efforts. In so doing, our country will be acting to encourage and \naward volunteers.\n  I hope that our colleagues will join us in supporting this bipartisan \nlegislation so that our national government can join with State and \nlocal governments to design and implement recruiting and retention \ninitiatives that benefit not only volunteer firefighters and emergency \nfirst responders, but also the communities they protect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1906\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Under Secretary of Technology of the \nDepartment of Commerce to award grants to establish up to eight \nNanoscience to Commercialization Institutes throughout the United \nStates to develop commercial applications for nanotechnology; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Cantwell to \nintroduce the Nanoscience to Commercialization Institutes Act of 2005.\n  Still in its infancy, nanotechnology is an exciting technology with a \nbright future and the potential to have a significant impact on the \neconomy, global competitiveness and the quality of life for our \ncitizens.\n  The advent of nanotechnology is creating opportunities in any array \nof industries with applications ranging from improving the performance \nof sports equipment used in recreation activities to life-saving \nmedical applications used to combat deadly diseases such as cancer.\n  Many promising technological advances have already begun to take \nshape in the world of micro- and nanotechnology and countless more \npotential future applications exist in fields such as medicine, \nelectronics, energy to name a few.\n  However, many times innovative research becomes victim of the \n``Valley of Death'' by failing to advance from the research labs to \napplication in commercial products and services.\n\n[[Page S11746]]\n\n  My bill will establish up to eight Nanoscience to Commercialization \nInstitutes across the country, each focusing on a specific field of \nexpertise including areas such as energy, electronics, agriculture, \nmedical, textiles and transportation with the purpose of developing and \nbridging research to the marketplace.\n  My bill is aimed at narrowing this so-called ``Valley of Death,'' by \nfocusing on bringing research to commercialization. To reach this \nobjective, my bill contains provisions requiring these institutes to \npartner with private sector entities with experience in micro- and \nnanotechnology and for each institute to develop and maintain business \nplans.\n  My bill will create additional avenues for entities that are engaged \nin micro- and nanotechnologies to develop research for application in \ncommercial products and services that will ultimately contribute to \nsustained economic development, an improved quality of living and \nincreased U.S. global competitiveness.\n  The competitive landscape of nanotechnology is global in nature. \nOther countries, such as Japan and China are making tremendous \ninvestments and advances in various specialties of nanotechnology to \ngain competitive advantages. It is critical the U.S. demonstrate its \nglobal leadership role by further advancing opportunities to advance \nmicro- and nanotechnology to commercial applications.\n  The future of nanotechnology is a bright future and its potential \nboundless. The legislation that I am introducing today with Senator \nCantwell supports and encourages the advancement of this exciting \ntechnology. I urge my colleagues to support the Nanoscience to \nCommercialization Institutes Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1908\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
