Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 6, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6) to ensure jobs for our future with secure, \n     affordable, and reliable energy.\n\n\n                   recognition of the majority leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning, following the opening \nstatement of the two leaders, we will proceed to passage of the Energy \nbill. A lot of work has gone into this bill at this point, and this \nupcoming final passage vote is one further step toward a national \nenergy policy. We look forward to a good conference with the House to \nproduce a final Energy bill for the President to sign.\n  Following that vote, we will resume consideration of the Interior \nappropriations bill. Pending to that bill are approximately 40 first-\ndegree amendments. The committee, over the course of the weekend and \nyesterday, had been reviewing those amendments and, hopefully, we can \ndispose of most of those amendments without rollcall votes. We will \nneed to debate and vote on some of the pending amendments, and \ntherefore we will have votes throughout the day. We would like to \nfinish the Interior appropriations bill today, and I will be speaking \nshortly to the two managers with regard to progress that is being made.\n  We will be recessing from 12:30 to 2:15 today. When we conclude the \nInterior bill, the Senate will begin the Homeland Security \nappropriations bill, and we will finish that bill prior to the start of \nthe July 4 recess. In addition to funding the work of the Department of \nHomeland Security, that legislation begins the hard work of enhancing \nthe security of our borders. We will complete action on this piece of \nborder security legislation this week.\n  It is also possible that the Senate could complete work on other \nappropriations bills beyond the two to which the minority leader and I \nhave agreed. We will be working together with the chairman and the \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee to see what we can \naccomplish in addition to the Interior and Homeland Security \nappropriations bills.\n  In addition, this morning, the Finance Committee is working on our \nfree-trade agreement with several Central American countries. If the \ncommittee completes action on that, we would also take that up this \nweek. Under the law, debate on the free-trade agreement would total no \nmore than 20 hours equally divided, and we will do that later this \nweek.\n  As I mentioned last week, we will also consider any other available \nconference reports or legislative or executive items that are ready for \naction throughout the week--the highway conference report extension, a \nwelfare extension, as well as a series of important nominations that \ncould be resolved this week as well: Lester Crawford to run our Food \nand Drug Administration, Tom Dorr to serve in the Department of \nAgriculture, Gordon English to serve in the Department of Homeland \nDefense. All of these are possible for action before the recess.\n  We are going to have a very busy final week and, I know, a productive \nweek. We will be working through Friday. I want to announce to our \ncolleagues once again, as I have before, that in all likelihood we will \nbe voting on Friday, and intend to vote on Friday.\n  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized at 3:45 \ntoday, to be followed by Senator Bunning, to be followed by Senator \nMcConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion on the schedule?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, this is the time \nto vote on H.R. 6.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we be allowed to \nhave the majority leader respond to a question.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The majority leader suggested that perhaps CAFTA might be \nbrought up later this week. As the majority leader knows, CAFTA is \nbrought to us under something called fast-track procedures, No. 1, and \nNo. 2, an expedited procedure by which, when it is brought to the \nfloor, it is given 20 hours of debate. Some of us feel very strongly \nthat fast track is wrong, but, nonetheless, that is the process.\n  I ask the majority leader if he is intending to bring up CAFTA under \nfast track as the last order of business because the suggestion then \nwould be you bump fast track up against the Fourth of July recess. I \nthink that would mistreat a very serious issue.\n  My hope is that the majority leader will not decide to make the CAFTA \ntrade agreement the last order of the day in this week because, if so, \nthat will suggest that there is a desire to truncate the debate, to \nshrink the 20 hours, and not have a thoughtful and full debate on a \nvery important trade issue at a time when we have the largest trade \ndeficit in the history of this country.\n  My question would be, is there consideration to bringing up the \nCentral American Free-Trade Agreement when we return from the Fourth of \nJuly recess?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as I mentioned, the Central American Free-\nTrade Agreement is currently being addressed by the committee. That \nwill be done today and possibly into tomorrow. Before we make any \ndefinitive scheduling beyond that, we will let it get through the \ncommittee. I will be talking to the Democratic leader. It is an issue \nthat we could, through a fast-track mechanism, address before we leave \nfor our July recess. No final decision has been made. I will be in \ndiscussion with the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Democratic leader seek \nrecognition?\n  Under the previous order, the hour of 9:45 having arrived, we will \nproceed to a vote on H.R. 6. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if, in regular order, would it be appropriate \nfor the Senator from New Mexico and two Senators to speak for 3 minutes \non the bill?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent that could be the \norder.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will soon vote this morning on final \npassage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I hope and expect that my \ncolleagues will vote overwhelmingly to pass it for a number of reasons, \nbut I want to concentrate on two of the most significant.\n  First, this bill is a huge step forward in our quest to enact \npolicies that will ultimately move us away from our dependence on \nforeign sources of energy. There are no quick fixes for the predicament \nwe have created for ourselves over the past 50 years.\n  But Senator Bingaman and I, of all people, are keenly aware of the \npromise that research and development of new technologies holds for our \nfuture energy independence. He and I have had the good fortune to \nwitness the tremendous accomplishments of the scientists at Los Alamos \nand Sandia over the years. We know that partnerships in science and \ntechnology between the government and the private sector can spur \nsignificant advancements in technologies we need for our future--a \nfuture where we become more productive, more efficient, less dependent \non foreign sources, and more protective of our environment in the \nprocess.\n  We have provided in this bill the opportunities for those \npartnerships as well as other incentives for the private sector to make \nthe advances we need to have for our energy future.\n  Secondly, this is a bipartisan product that deserves broad support. \nSenator Bingaman and I have worked together on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee for over 20 years.\n  We have struggled through the issues we address in this bill for many \nyears. Over the past six months, we have garnered the fruits of that \nassociation into this bipartisan bill to create what I believe is a \nfine product to get us started on solving our energy problems.\n  This bill isn't perfect. No bill ever is. But Senator Bingaman and I \nbelieve it is a worthy product that deserves your support. We look \nforward to a speedy conference with the House of Representatives and \nhope to soon deliver a conference report to this body for passage.\n  I also express my sincere thanks to my staff, as well as Senator \nBingaman's staff, for their many, many days of long hours and hard work \nto make this bill a reality. They have been open to all of you and your \nstaffs, and, I believe, have honestly attempted to address any issue \nSenators have brought to them.\n  I especially want to thank Alex Flint, Staff Director, and Judy \nPensabene, Chief Counsel, for managing this entire process. Other \nmembers of the staff who also lent their expertise and professionalism \nto the process are: Carole McGuire, Deputy Staff Director; Karen \nBillups, Deputy Chief Counsel; Counsels Kellie Donnelly, Lisa Epifani, \nand Frank Macchiarola; Professional staff members Dick Bouts, Kathryn \nClay, Frank Gladics, Josh Johnson, John Peschke, and Clint Williamson; \nMamie Funk, Communications Director, and Angela Harper, Deputy \nCommunications Director; Colin Hayes, Legislative Aide; Carol Craft, \nChief Clerk; Cherstyn Monson, Executive Assistant; and Staff Assistants \nDavid Marks, Amy Millett, and Steve Waskiewicz.\n  Lastly, I sincerely thank the majority leader and his excellent staff \nfor helping us shepherd this bill through the Senate.\n  I believe today we will pass, for the first time in many years, a new \npolicy for the United States with reference to our energy production, \nthe energy needs of the future.\n  I think this is a very good bill. I think it will provide us with a \nsignificant number of alternative energy supplies, all of which will be \npredicated upon the proposition that energy should be clean, the energy \nthat we produce in the future; much of it should be renewable; that, \nindeed, we have conservation; that nuclear should become part of our \narsenal; that, in addition, innovation will be the order of the day.\n  Along with production of ethanol, the rest of the bill will produce \njobs, jobs, jobs, and will secure jobs for our future.\n  With reference to natural gas, one of our most significant and \nserious problems today, we hope that there will be a new and \ninvigorated supply which will give us an opportunity to have prices for \nnatural gas stabilize or even come down, without which we have a very \ndifficult future for millions of jobs that are dependent upon natural \ngas or derivatives from natural gas.\n  All in all, I think this is an exciting and good bill. I thank the \nSenate for its support, the leader for his support, Senator Bingaman \nfor his support. This is truly the first major bill in a long time that \nis bipartisan in nature. That made it possible, and I am very proud to \nhave been part of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill before us is not perfect. It \ndoes not go as far I would have liked, or others may have liked, to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil, to improve our automobile fuel \nefficiency, or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  But it makes a good start. The bill puts the Senate on record, for \nthe first time, as saying that global warming is a problem and that we \nneed to take serious action to address it. The bill stops short of \ntaking those actions itself, but it acknowledges the problem, and that \nis an important--indeed essential--step in the right direction.\n  The bill also takes major steps toward increasing the amount of \nenergy we use to make our electricity and to fuel our cars and trucks \nfrom renewable energy sources. It promotes the development and \ndeployment of new energy technologies, improves energy efficiency, and \nmodernizes our electricity laws. It was a good bill coming out of \ncommittee and it has been made better on the floor.\n  Much of the credit for the bill goes to Chairman Domenici for the \nfair, open, and bipartisan process he used to draft the bill and \nshepherd it through the\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\ncommittee and on the floor. Not all issues were resolved the way he \nwould have liked or I would have liked, but he let the committee and \nthe Senate work their will. It has resulted in a good bill.\n  Special thanks must also go to the committee staff, both majority and \nminority, who put in long hours and hard work on the bill over the last \nseveral months. Everyone on the Democratic staff of the committee \ncontributed to this effort: Bob Simon, Sam Fowler, Patty Beneke, Tara \nBillingsley, Jonathan Black, David Brooks, Michael Carr, Mike Connor, \nDeborah Estes, Amanda Goldman, Leon Lowery, Jennifer Michael, Scott \nMiller, Sreela Nandi, Dominic Saavedra, Al Stayman, Vicki Thorne, Bill \nWicker and Mark Wilson. I especially wish to thank our Democratic staff \ndirector, Bob Simon. I would also like to single out Jonathan Epstein \nand James Dennis on my personal staff for their contributions to the \nbill.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the constant and valuable help given \nto us by the Democratic cloakroom staff and the staff of the Democratic \nLeader.\n  Our task now will be to keep our bipartisan bill from being \nundermined in conference. Twice before the Senate has sent an energy \nbill to conference, only to see it die in conference or on the floor. \nBut I am confident that the third try is the charm.\n  Again, I commend Senator Domenici for his leadership and bipartisan \napproach to this effort. I think we have come up with a bill which \nshould enjoy good bipartisan support here on the Senate floor.\n  There are obviously some provisions I wish were in the bill that are \nnot. But I think we are going into conference with a good piece of \nlegislation. I hope we are successful in persuading the House to agree \nwith us on that. I do think we still have many hurdles to overcome, as \nwe have learned from previous Congresses, but I am optimistic that this \ntime we will succeed in completing action on an energy bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, energy policy is an important issue for \nAmerica and one which my Wisconsin constituents take very seriously. \nCrafting an energy policy requires us to address important questions \nabout, for example, the role of domestic production of energy resources \nversus foreign imports, the need to ensure adequate energy supplies \nwhile protecting the environment, the need for additional domestic \nefforts to support improvements in our energy efficiency, and the \nwisest use of our energy resources. Given the need for a sound national \nenergy policy, a vote on an energy bill is a very serious matter and I \ndo not take a decision to oppose such a bill lightly. In my view, \nhowever, this bill does not achieve the correct balance on several \nimportant issues, which is why I will oppose it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that implementing the \nbill will cost $5.1 billion in 2006 and $35.9 billion over the 2006-\n2010 period. I am concerned that this estimate does not include the at \nleast $10.1 billion in unpaid-for tax breaks. The $10.1 billion \nincludes $5.7 billion in production tax credits and $4.4 billion in \nvarious subsidies to the oil, gas, and nuclear industries. Although I \nsupport the extension of the wind energy production tax credit and \nincentives for alternative fuels such as biodiesel, I am concerned that \nthese tax expenditures are not offset. This billion dollar figure does \nnot include the potential costs of the billions of dollars in loan \nguarantees provided in the bill, which could prove extremely costly to \ntaxpayers. According to the CBO, loan default risk is ``well above 50 \npercent'' leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. The oil, gas, coal, \nhydroelectric and nuclear industries are mature industries that do not \nneed to be propped up by the taxpayers. I am also especially concerned \nabout the tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry, which is already \nexperiencing windfall profits as oil nears $60 a barrel.\n  Even before the Senate added the tax title to the bill or any other \namendments, CBO estimated that implementing the bill would cost $5.1 \nbillion in 2006 and $35.9 billion over the 2006-2010 period. None of \nthis spending is offset, or paid for. Our nation's budget position has \ndeteriorated significantly over the past few years, in large part \nbecause of the massive tax cuts that were enacted. We now face years of \nprojected budget deficits. The only way we will climb out of this \ndeficit hole is to return to the fiscally responsible policies that \nhelped put our nation on a sound fiscal footing in the 1990s, and that \nmeans making sure the bills we pass are paid for. Otherwise we are \ndigging our deficit hole even deeper and adding to the massive debt \nalready facing our children and grandchildren.\n  In addition, this bill repeals the proconsumer Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act, the Federal Government's most important mechanism to \nprotect electricity consumers. The bill does include language from my \ncolleague from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, banning Enron-like energy \ntrading schemes. I also welcome the addition of new language that gives \nthe Federal Government more oversight of utility mergers. This \nlanguage, however, in my opinion, does not adequately prevent utilities \nfrom using affiliate companies to out compete small businesses.\n  That is why I joined with the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, in \nfiling the consumer protection, fair competition, and financial \nintegrity amendment. We believe that small businesses and consumers \nshould be protected from abuses involving public utility companies' \nrelated businesses. We also share the belief that repeal of the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act in the underlying bill creates a serious \nregulatory void and market flaw that Congress should correct.\n  Our amendment would have improved the bill by making clear the \nactions that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--or FERC--must \ntake to ensure that deregulated holding companies do not outcompete our \nsmall businesses, damage their financial standing, and then pass the \ncosts of bad investments to consumers.\n  Our amendment was supported by a wide and impressive coalition of \nbusiness, labor, financial, and consumer groups which include AARP, \nAmerican Iron and Steel Institute, American Public Power Association, \nAmerican Subcontractors Association, Associated Builders and \nContractors, Association of Financial Guaranty Insurers, ACA Financial \nGuaranty Corporation, Ambac Assurance Corporation, Assured Guaranty \nCorporation, Blue Point Re Limited, CIFG, IXIS Financial Guaranty, \nFinancial Guaranty Insurance Company, Financial Security Assurance, \nMBIA Insurance Corporation, Radian Asset Assurance Inc., RAM \nReinsurance Company, XL Capital Assurance, ELCON, International \nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers, Mechanical Contractors Association \nof America, National Electrical Contractors Association, Plumbing-\nHeating-Cooling Contractors--National Association, Public Citizen, \nPublic Interest Research Group, Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning \nContractors' National Association, Small Business Legislative Council, \nand Wisconsin Public Power, Incorporated.\n  My State of Wisconsin is acutely interested in and concerned about \nthe repeal of PUHCA and about ongoing abuses involving the unregulated \ncorporate affiliates of regulated utilities. I have also heard from \ncontractors and other small businesses across the Nation who have been \nharmed by unfair competition by affiliates of public utilities.\n  I am pleased this consumer protection amendment was a bipartisan \neffort. I believe we have broad support in this body and beyond for \nthis amendment, which is why I was disappointed that we were not able \nto offer this amendment because of the threat of another amendment \nbeing offered that would eliminate the oversight provisions currently \nin the bill.\n  I am pleased, however, that we were able to obtain assurances from \nthe chair and ranking member that they would hold a hearing on abusive \naffiliate transactions. I also appreciate the ranking member's \ncommitment to request a GAO investigation of the potential for abusive \ntransactions involving affiliates of public utility companies.\n  During debate on this important measure, I supported several efforts \nto improve the underlying bill and the bill contains many provisions \nthat I support. Specifically, I strongly supported the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, No. 779. I am \npleased that the Senate overwhelmingly passed this important measure. I \nsupport the national ban of methyl tertiary butyl ether,\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nMTBE, and the measures in the bill that increase the supply of ethanol. \nI am also pleased that the amendment includes language I drafted to \nconsolidate the number of Federal reformulated gasoline blends. I have \nworked closely with Congressman Paul Ryan in an effort to reduce the \nnumber of Federal reformulated gasoline blends and increase gasoline \nsupplies for consumers.\n  In recent years, fuel supply shocks such as pipeline problems and \nrefinery fires have contributed significantly to gasoline price spikes \nin southern Wisconsin. Chicago and southeast Wisconsin use a \nspecialized blend of reformulated gasoline to meet Federal Clean Air \nAct requirements that is not used elsewhere in the country. When \nsupplies of this type of gasoline run low, Wisconsin is unable to draw \non supplies of gasoline from other areas. Consolidation of the number \nof boutique fuels will help Wisconsin and consumers across the country. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto ensure that the boutique fuels issue is adequately addressed in the \nenergy bill conference report.\n  I also supported Senator Bingaman's amendment to mandate a renewable \nportfolio standard requiring electric utilities to generate or purchase \n10 percent of the electricity they sell from renewable sources by 2020. \nThe Senate has previously considered renewable portfolio standards of \n20 percent. We can do even better on renewable energy sources, but I am \npleased that the Senate took a positive step forward on this important \nissue.\n  I am also pleased with the many energy efficiency incentives and the \nreauthorization of the Energy Performance Savings Contracts Program. I \nalso support the inclusion of mandatory electricity reliability \nstandards to prevent blackouts.\n  I supported the Cantwell energy security amendment, No. 784, because \nit would have helped to put America on the path towards independence \nfrom foreign oil. Reducing our dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent \nby 2025 will make our country stronger and safer. For years, the \nAmerican economy has been subject to the whims of the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, cartel. The amendment did not \naddress which technology should be used to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and does not mandate changes in fuel economy standards. The \nlanguage is simple--it sets our goal and we have to figure out how to \nget there. We are a country of innovators. Whether it is wind, solar, \nbiodiesel, or a technology we still have not dreamed of yet, we can--\nand we must--break our addiction to foreign oil. This bold, aggressive \namendment would have ensured that we meet our goal of real energy \nindependence. I was disappointed that the Senate did not adopt this \namendment.\n  In sum, the American people deserve a more fiscally responsible \nenergy policy than that is reflected in this bill, and I cannot vote in \nfavor of it. This measure will need to be improved in conference to get \nmy vote.\n  Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I start by thanking Chairman Domenici \nand Senator Bingaman for all of their hard work on this bill. They said \nthey were going to work to get a bipartisan bill and they accomplished \ntheir goal.\n  Overall, however, I believe that this Energy bill will help the \ncountry meet its energy needs in a number of important ways.\n  This bill provides strong consumer protections, aggressive energy \nefficiency standards, and a focus on new technologies to meet our \nenergy needs in a more environmentally friendly manner.\n  Additionally, the bill takes a step in the right direction to reduce \nour consumption of fossil fuels, especially natural gas. This is a \nmajor improvement over past Energy bills, which have done nothing to \nreduce our use of fossil fuels.\n  As we learned during the Western energy crisis, Federal energy \nregulators did not have enough authority to prevent widespread market \nmanipulation.\n  Through the course of the crisis in California, the total cost of \nelectricity soared from $7 billion in 1999 to $27 billion in 2000 and \n$26.7 billion in 2001. The abuse in our energy markets was pervasive \nand unlawful.\n  So I am pleased to report that this bill includes provisions that I \nhave sought over the past 4 years to strengthen consumer protections \nand hopefully prevent another energy crisis like the one we experienced \nin the West.\n  These consumer protections include: a broad ban on manipulation in \nthe energy markets; stronger criminal and civil penalties in the energy \nmarkets to provide stronger deterrents to violations of Federal energy \nlaws; elimination of the unnecessary 60-day waiting period for refunds \nat FERC, which may cost Californians millions of dollars; new \nprovisions to make the energy markets more transparent; and a ban on \ntraders who manipulated the natural gas or the electricity markets from \never trading in energy markets again.\n  I am also very pleased that Senators Grassley and Baucus included in \nthe Energy bill much of the energy efficiency tax incentives that \nSenator Snowe and I sponsored.\n  The simplest, most effective thing we could do today to reduce our \nelectricity use would be to use more energy-efficient appliances, such \nas air conditioners, refrigerators, and clothes washers.\n  We know that energy efficiency works. In California, efficiency \nprograms have kept electricity consumption flat for the past 30 years, \nin contrast to the rest of the United States, where consumption \nincreased 50 percent.\n  During the Western energy crisis, California faced energy shortages \nand rolling blackouts, but it could have been much worse. Ultimately, \nthe State was able to escape further blackouts because Californians \nmade a major effort to conserve energy. This reduced demand for \nelectricity and helped ease the crisis.\n  By creating incentives to reduce demand, the energy efficiency tax \nincentives will help us avoid power shortages and blackouts in the \nfuture.\n  In addition, encouraging more efficient technologies will also reduce \npollution and save consumers billions of dollars in the long run.\n  America cannot solve its energy challenges by simply adding more \nsupplies. We must find ways to reduce demand for energy and create more \nefficient technologies. Including the energy efficiency tax incentives \nis a big step in the right direction.\n  For all of those reasons, I am supporting this bill. However, I still \nhave some major reservations about the legislation as it now stands. \nAmong them are:\n  Ethanol. The bill includes an 8 billion gallon mandate for ethanol \nwhen my State does not need it to meet clean air standards. I think \nthis mandate is bad and costly public policy.\n  LNG Siting. This bill gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nexclusive authority over siting LNG terminals. I believe States should \nhave a strong voice in this process.\n  Global Warming. Although we can already see the real effects of \nglobal warming, this bill takes no effective action to curb greenhouse \ngases.\n  Outer Continental Shelf. This bill provides for an inventory of the \nresources off our shores. This is not necessary unless we plan on \ndrilling, to which I remain very much opposed.\n  Essentially, this bill takes no risks whatsoever to do the right \nthing. And though I will vote in favor of this bill, I would like to \ndiscuss these serious reservations that I have with it.\n  I am extremely concerned about the bill's 8 billion gallon ethanol \nmandate.\n  First, though, I would like to thank the committee for accepting an \namendment I offered to protect California's air quality. It waives the \nrequirement that California use ethanol in the summer months when it \ncan end up polluting the air more than protecting it.\n  Despite this win for California's air quality, I still have concerns \nabout the impacts of mandating that refiners use 8 billion gallons of \nethanol by 2012.\n  President Bush has said over the past few months that this Energy \nbill will not do anything to reduce gas prices at the pump. I would \nlike to add another note of caution: I hope this bill does not actually \nincrease the price at the pump for consumers.\n  According to the Energy Information Administration, gas prices in \nCalifornia have been anywhere between 4 and 8 cents higher since \nethanol replaced MTBE in California's gasoline, starting in 2003.\n  In May 2005, the Director of the Petroleum Division at the Energy \nInformation Administration stated before\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\nthe House Government Reform Committee that:\n\n     . . . refiners lost production capability when replacing MTBE \n     with ethanol. This, along with continued demand growth, has \n     contributed to price pressures. From 2000 through 2002, \n     California retail gasoline prices averaged about 19 cents per \n     gallon more than the U.S. average gasoline price, but in 2003 \n     as MTBE began to be removed, California prices averaged 27 \n     cents per gallon higher than the U.S. average, and remained \n     at that level through 2004.\n\n  So far this year, California's gasoline prices are at least 23 cents \nhigher than the national average. To be clear, adding ethanol to our \ngasoline has increased the cost at the pump.\n  In addition, when the 8 billion gallon mandate is fully implemented \nin 2012 it will only reduce U.S. oil consumption by one-half of 1 \npercent.\n  Since ethanol has a somewhat lower energy content than gasoline, more \nof it is required to travel the same distance. This results in a \nvehicle's fuel economy being approximately 3 percent lower with \nethanol-blended gasoline.\n  Further, this provision is both a mandate and a subsidy. Ethanol \nreceives a tax credit of 51 cents per gallon. An 8 billion gallon \nmandate means a $2 billion loss to the U.S. Treasury over today's \nreceipts.\n  I do not believe that we should be imposing this huge mandate at a \ntime when there is already such a huge subsidy to the ethanol industry, \nand when the Nation has such huge budget deficits.\n  We should have either the subsidy or the mandate, but not both.\n  I also remain concerned about the provision in the bill that provides \nexclusive authority over siting onshore liquefied natural gas terminals \nto the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  Increased demand for natural gas means we need new natural gas \nsupplies, and liquefied natural gas is one of the options available to \nus.\n  States will be responsible for the safety of these facilities for a \nlong time after they are sited. That is why it is so important to \npreserve the rights of the States to participate in the process to \ndetermine where these facilities should be located.\n  For LNG facilities that are sited more than 3 miles offshore, the \nGovernor has the right to approve or veto a project.\n  Yet for facilities that are located onshore, in our busy ports and \nnear our closely packed communities, States have less input.\n  That is why I offered an amendment to provide Governors the same \nauthority for siting onshore facilities that they already have for \noffshore facilities.\n  To give a remote Federal agency control when States are concerned \nabout the safety of residents near a proposed site is a mistake.\n  I firmly believe that States should have the right to veto a project \nthat could endanger the public safety of its citizens.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman and McCain for their efforts to address \nthe growing and imminent problem of global warming.\n  I strongly supported their amendment to cap greenhouse gas emissions \nat the year 2000 levels by 2010 and implement a market-based emissions \ncap and trade system.\n  The United States has only 4 percent of the world's population, and \nyet we produce 20 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. As \nthe world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, the United States has a \nduty to act.\n  We have already begun to see the very real effects of global warming. \nThe polar ice caps are shrinking, glaciers are melting, snowpacks are \ndwindling, and coastlines are falling away.\n  If we do not act, these problems will only grow worse. California \ndepends on the Sierra Nevada snowpack as its largest source of water. \nIt is estimated that by the end of the century, the shrinking of this \nsnowpack will eliminate the water source for 16 million people--equal \nto all of the people in the Los Angeles Basin.\n  Much of the world is already reducing their greenhouse gas emissions \nand they are counting on us to do the same.\n  It is time that the United States--the world's largest contributor to \nclimate change--stepped up and took responsibility for our actions and \ntheir impact on the world. Global warming is too serious a problem for \nus to keep ignoring it.\n  Yet the Senate voted against the McCain-Lieberman amendment. We \nmissed a big opportunity to do the right thing for our country and for \nthe world.\n  I am also concerned because the bill includes a provision that would \nallow the Department of Interior to conduct an inventory of the \nresources in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  I joined my colleagues from Florida and New Jersey to strip this \nprovision from the bill. Unfortunately, the amendment was not agreed \nto.\n  Why would we need to inventory the resources on the Outer Continental \nShelf unless we intend to drill there? I believe this provision is the \nproverbial ``nose under the camel's tent.''\n  I strongly oppose lifting the moratoria on drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and my State is unified in its opposition as well. \nOur coast is too important to California's economy and to our quality \nof life.\n  Despite soaring gas prices, this bill does not take any steps towards \nreducing our oil consumption, which could easily be done by holding \nSUVs and light trucks to the same fuel economy standards as passenger \nvehicles.\n  SUVs have gained popularity to the point that they now make up more \nthan half of new car sales in the United States. That is why I believe \nSUVs and light trucks should be held to the same fuel efficiency and \nsafety standards as the smaller passenger cars they are replacing on \nour roads.\n  This would both reduce our oil consumption and imports as well as \ncurbing greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. In \naddition, increasing fuel economy in SUVs and light trucks would save \nowners hundreds of dollars each year at the gas pump.\n  Consumers are concerned about high gas prices, yet we do next to \nnothing in the bill to increase the fuel economy of our vehicles so \nthat they use less gasoline.\n  Our dependence on oil is reaching critical levels. Crude oil is \nhitting record highs at nearly $60 per barrel this week and it is not \ngoing to fall any time soon.\n  Crude oil is a global commodity and global oil demand is rising, \nespecially in China and India.\n  In the past 5 years, China's oil imports have doubled, and show no \nsigns of slowing down. Chinese demand for oil is expected to double \nagain by 2025, while its imports will quadruple to 60 percent of its \ntotal oil consumption.\n  China is now the world's second biggest oil consumer, behind only the \nUnited States. And today we heard the news that China wants to buy an \nAmerican oil company.\n  In addition, India's oil needs are expected to grow rapidly in the \ncoming years. Last year alone, India's oil consumption grew by 10 \npercent.\n  Their rapidly growing economies are fueling their growing dependence \non oil--which makes continued higher prices inevitable.\n  The most effective step we can take to reduce gas prices is to reduce \ndemand. We must use our limited fuel supplies more wisely.\n  That is why I am so disappointed that the Senate did not include any \nprovisions to increase fuel economy in the bill.\n  I am pleased that the chairman and ranking member were able to work \ntogether on a bill that does not roll back environmental protections, \nas the House bill does.\n  I want to take a minute to point out the most egregious House \nprovisions that I hope we will not see in a conference report. They \ninclude:\n  Retroactive liability protection for MTBE producers despite the fact \nthat the courts have already found that they make a defective product. \nThis provision protects oil companies from having to pay billions of \ndollars to clean up the water supplies across the country that MTBE has \ncontaminated.\n  Even though I am supporting the Senate Energy bill, I will not \nhesitate to vote against the conference report if it includes MTBE \nliability protection.\n  Allowing communities to get out of requirements to clean up their air \nif they claim that part of its problem is a result of transported air \npollution. This provision severely weakens the Clean Air Act.\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\n  Exempting the underground injection of chemicals during oil and gas \ndevelopment from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Weakening the ability of States to have a say in Federal activities \nthat affect their coasts, including limiting appeals related to \npipeline construction or offshore energy development under the Coastal \nZone Management Act.\n  Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.\n  Further, the House $8 billion tax package is completely lopsided in \nfavor of oil and gas production--only 5 percent of the $8 billion goes \ntoward incentives for renewable energy production.\n  While I am pleased that the bill includes strong consumer protections \nthat will hopefully prevent another energy crisis, incentives for \nenergy efficiency, and promotes new energy technologies, I am \ndisappointed that the bill does not do the right thing on global \nwarming, ethanol, fuel economy, the Outer Continental Shelf, or LNG \nsiting.\n  And so, it is with reluctance that I cast my vote in favor of this \nEnergy bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am supporting the energy bill before us \ntoday because I feel that it is a step forward in establishing a sound \nenergy policy for our Nation. With oil prices soaring to over $60 per \nbarrel, consumer gasoline prices continuing to rise, and the impacts of \nglobal climate change increasingly apparent, we need to move toward \ndiversity of our energy supply and reduction of our dependence on oil.\n  The bill before us today includes provisions that will increase the \ndiversity of our Nation's fuel supply, encourage investment in \ninfrastructure and alternative energy technologies, increase domestic \nenergy production, take critical steps to improve the reliability of \nour electricity supply, and improve energy efficiency and conservation. \nThis bill is not a perfect bill, but on balance it moves toward a sound \nenergy policy that will lead the way to greater energy security and \nefficiency for the United States. It will increase our domestic energy \nsupplies in a responsible manner, provide incentives to move toward \nmore and diversified supply options, and provide consumers with \naffordable and reliable energy. When we consider energy policy, it is \nalways a balance. Many factors must be taken into account--the \nenvironment, national security, our economy and jobs. Each and every \nvote on this bill required a balancing of these factors to determine \nwhat is best for Michigan and for our country.\n  Our policies have long ignored the problem of U.S. dependence on \nforeign oil, and we remain as vulnerable to oil supply disruptions \ntoday as we have been for decades. Taking the steps necessary to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil is an important objective for this \ncountry. I have long supported a broad array of Federal efforts to meet \nthat objective. I believe that we need a long-term, comprehensive \nenergy plan, and I have long supported initiatives that will increase \nour domestic energy supplies in a responsible manner and provide \nconsumers with affordable and reliable energy.\n  There are provisions included in this bill that will help take \nimportant steps in this direction--particularly those provisions of \nthis bill that address energy efficiency and renewable energy and will \nlead us toward greater uses of alternative fuels such as ethanol and \nbiodiesel. I have also long advocated Federal efforts that will lead to \nrevolutionary breakthroughs in automotive technology that will help us \nreduce our oil consumption. We need a level of leadership similar to \nthe effort of a previous generation to put a man on the moon. I believe \nwe need our own ``moon shot'' in the area of automotive technology to \ndevelop alternatives to petroleum and to make more efficient use of all \nforms of energy.\n  I am pleased that the bill before us today is a bipartisan bill and, \nas such, it is a significant improvement over what the Senate has \nconsidered in previous years. This proves that when we work together in \na bipartisan fashion, not only is the process better but so is the \nresulting policy.\n  The bill includes a wide range of energy efficiency provisions that \nwill ensure that conservation and efficiency are a central component of \nour Nation's energy strategy. These provisions address Federal, State, \nand local energy efficiency programs, provide funding for important \nprograms such as home weatherization, and establish efficiency \nstandards for a wide variety of consumer and commercial products. \nProvisions of the bill will also ensure more efficient operation of \nFederal facilities, setting an important example by the Federal \nGovernment. The bill will also accelerate advances in energy-efficient \nappliance technologies by providing a tax credit for the production and \nsale of products such as super energy-efficient washing machines, \nrefrigerators and dishwashers. Increasing the sale of these products \nwill result in significant energy and water savings, thereby reducing \ndependency on foreign energy, reducing emissions and conserving water. \nFinally, because the tax credits apply only to U.S.-manufactured \nproducts, the bill can stabilize or increase American manufacturing \njobs.\n  This legislation also takes critical steps to improve the reliability \nof our electrical grid and promote electricity transmission \ninfrastructure development. Our economy depends upon electric power, \nand, in some cases, electric power literally saves lives. Failures in \nthe electric system interrupt many crucial activities. Our current \nindustry-developed, voluntary standards for the reliability of the \nelectrical grid have long been in need of improvement. That need for \nimprovement was underscored painfully by the August 2003 blackout. \nThere were two key lessons from the blackout--the need for strong \nregional transmission organizations to ensure that reliability \nstandards are carried out and enforced, and the need for additional \ntransmission upgrades to maintain reliability. I regret that it has \ntaken 2 years to get to a consensus on these issues. Nonetheless, I am \npleased that the provisions of this bill authorize the creation of an \nelectricity reliability organization to establish mandatory and \nenforceable reliability standards, which is a critical and necessary \nstep forward.\n\n  The bill puts an increased emphasis on renewable energy technologies, \nsuch as wind and solar power. These technologies are becoming more \neconomical every year. In fact, in some areas of the country these \ntechnologies are competitive with traditional fuels such as coal and \nnatural gas. With this in mind, this bill includes a renewable \nportfolio standard, which requires sellers of electricity to obtain 10 \npercent of their electric supply from renewable energy sources by the \nyear 2020. Existing hydroelectric pumped storage facilities--such as \nthe Ludington pumped storage facility in Michigan--are included in the \ndefinition of hydroelectric facilities, which will ensure that these \nreliable existing sources of renewable power are calculated in a \nutility's base generation and can continue to be utilized to full \npotential. Finally, to promote the use of renewable fuels, the bill \nalso includes a requirement for refiners to use 8 billion gallons of \nethanol or biofuels by 2012. Overall, the increased use of renewable \ntechnologies will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lead to the \ncreation of tens of thousands of new jobs.\n  The bill also puts increased emphasis on diversity of supply and \nincludes a broad range of provisions intended to encourage the use of \nnew and cleaner technologies, particularly for power generation. Nearly \n60 percent of electricity generation in Michigan is generated from \ncoal, which will remain a vital resource well into the future. Programs \nauthorizing research in clean coal-based gasification and combustion \ntechnologies will ensure that the most advanced technologies are \ndeveloped for power generation. Other provisions of the bill also \nencourage the use of innovative technologies for both power generation \nand other end-uses.\n  Increased emphasis on diversity of fuel supply will help to take the \npressure off of our tight natural gas supply, which is important for \nStates such as Michigan with a large manufacturing base. Over the past \n6 years, the tight natural gas supply and volatile domestic prices have \nhad significant impacts on the U.S. manufacturing sector, which depends \non natural gas as both a fuel source and a feedstock and raw material \nfor everything from fertilizer to automobile components. As domestic \nproduction of natural gas has declined, demand for natural gas has \nincreased dramatically, particularly in\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nthe area of power generation. Today, U.S. natural gas prices are the \nhighest in the industrialized world, and many companies have been \nforced to move their manufacturing operations offshore. More than two \nmillion manufacturing jobs have been lost to overseas operations in the \n5 years since natural gas prices jumped from $2.00 per million Btu to \nmore than $7.00 per million Btu.\n  I am pleased that the Senate bill includes a significant research, \ndevelopment, demonstration and commercialization effort in the area of \nhydrogen and fuel cells. I believe that this program will help us make \ncritical strides toward realizing the goal of putting hydrogen fuel \ncell vehicles on the road over the next 10 to 15 years.\n  We need a significantly larger effort than anything on the drawing \nboards, and we need to put greater Federal resources into work on other \nbreakthrough technologies--such as advanced hybrid technologies, \nadvanced batteries, advanced clean diesel, and hybrid diesel \ntechnology. Federal Government investment is essential not only in \nresearch and development but also as a mechanism to push the market \ntoward greater use and acceptance of advanced technologies. Expanding \nthe requirements for the Federal Government to purchase advanced \ntechnology vehicles will help provide a market for advanced \ntechnologies.\n  We also must have far greater tax incentives for advanced \ntechnologies than have been proposed to date. To that end, I had hoped \nto offer an amendment to the bill--along with Senators Bayh and \nAlexander--to provide more generous consumer tax credits for purchase \nof advanced technology vehicles and to provide an investment tax credit \nto manufacturers to help defray the cost of re-equipping or expanding \nexisting facilities to produce advanced technology vehicles. The \nFinance title of this energy bill includes laudable incentives, but I \nbelieve we need more generous consumer tax credits for a wider variety \nof vehicles--including advanced clean diesel, as well as hybrid and \nfuel cell vehicles--to encourage consumers to make the investment in \nthese technologies. I also believe that an investment credit on the \nmanufacturing side is necessary to offset the high capital costs of \nsuch an investment. I hope that more significant tax incentives for a \nwide range of advanced vehicle technologies will be considered during \nthe House-Senate energy conference.\n\n  The Senate bill also includes an amendment I offered to have the \nNational Academy of Sciences conduct a study and submit a budget \nroadmap to Congress on what level of effort and what types of actions \nwill be required to transition to fuel cell vehicles and a hydrogen \neconomy by 2020. If hydrogen is the right answer, we will need the \nequivalent of a moon shot to get there. We will need a significant \nFederal investment--well beyond anything we are doing today--in \nconjunction with private industry and academia to reach that goal. This \nstudy and roadmap will be an important step toward determining if that \nis the right path to follow.\n  I am also pleased to have cosponsored an amendment offered by Senator \nVoinovich to authorize $200 million annually for 5 years to fund \nFederal and State grant and loan programs that will help us to replace \nolder diesel technology with newer, cleaner diesel technology. Our \nfriends in Europe have taken advantage of the opportunities that diesel \noffers for improving fuel economy and reducing oil dependence. We have \nnot been able to do so here in the U.S. because of our concerns about \ntailpipe emissions. Initiatives such as those included in this \namendment will help the U.S. to develop advanced diesel technology that \nwill be able to meet our emissions standards in a cost-effective \nmanner.\n  Lastly, the Senate rejected resoundingly efforts to require \nsignificant and arbitrary increases in the corporate average fuel \neconomy--CAFE--standards, adopting instead an amendment offered by \nSenator Bond and myself that offered a more balanced approach. Our \napproach requires an increase in both car and truck CAFE standards but \nit requires the Department of Transportation to set these standards \nlooking at the maximum technological feasibility, taking into \nconsideration a series of critical factors such as safety, the impact \non manufacturing and jobs, and the lead-time required for developing \nnew technologies. Other proposals offered in the Senate--but rejected--\nwould have hurt domestic manufacturers and the U.S. economy, without \ndoing much for the environment.\n  Gasoline prices have been extremely volatile over the past few years \nand are likely to stay high. Our demand for oil continues to increase \nwhile our supplies have remained about the same. To reduce the impact \nof high gasoline prices over the long-term, we need to reduce our \nconsumption of oil by continuing to develop advanced vehicle \ntechnologies such as hybrids, advanced clean diesels, and fuel cells. \nIn the short-term, however, I continue to be concerned about price \nfluctuations because gasoline prices can have a dramatic effect on not \nonly the average consumer's wallet, but also the economy as a whole. \nDuring consideration of the energy bill, I supported an amendment \noffered by Senator Byrd designed to provide some relief to high gas \nprices, specifically for people who live in rural areas. This provision \nallows employers to provide tax-free commuter benefits to employees who \nlive in a rural area and drive to work in an area that is not \naccessible by a transit system.\n  I was also pleased to support an amendment to help small businesses \nand farmers deal with the high price of fuel. This amendment, offered \nby Senator Kerry, gives small farms and businesses access to low-\ninterest credit through disaster loan programs. These programs, through \nthe Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, will give much needed relief to these small businesspeople \nand small farmers who have been hurt by the price spikes in heating \noil, natural gas, propane, gasoline and kerosene.\n  Lastly, I supported an amendment offered by my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Stabenow, requiring the Federal Trade Commission to \nconduct an investigation and provide a report to Congress on whether \nthe increase in gasoline prices is the result of market manipulation or \nprice gouging. In 2002, as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I lead an investigation into how gas prices are set. \nSince that time, gas prices have continued to rise, and I believe a new \ninvestigation and report is warranted to hopefully result in some \nprotection for consumers.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains an amendment that I offered with \nSenator Collins to direct the U.S. Department of Energy to develop and \nuse cost-effective procedures for filling the U.S. Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. The amendment requires DOE to consider the price of oil and \nother market factors when buying oil for the SPR and to take steps to \nminimize the program's cost to the taxpayer while maximizing our energy \nsecurity. Since early 2002, DOE has been acquiring oil for the SPR \nwithout regard to the price or supply of oil. During this period the \nprice of oil has been very high--often over $30 per barrel--and the oil \nmarkets have been tight. Many experts have stated that filling the SPR \nduring the tight oil markets over the past several years increased oil \nprices. With this amendment, the bill directs DOE to use some common \nsense when buying oil for the SPR.\n\n  Any successful businessperson knows the saying, `Buy low, sell high.' \nIt makes sense for buying oil as well as pork bellies.\n  Finally, I want to mention an issue that was a source of strong \ndebate in the Senate but which this bill does not adequately address: \nglobal warming. For years, almost all scientists have agreed that human \nactions are causing temperatures around the world to increase. Experts \nalso agree that this global warming will lead to environmental problems \nand economic hardship, but there has been no consensus in the United \nStates about what we should do to stop climate change.\n  The threat is real and growing, and the longer we wait to reach a \nreasonable consensus, the more painful the solutions will be. I believe \ntwo major policy changes are needed at the federal level: support for a \nnew, binding international treaty that includes all countries, and a \nmassive new federal investment in research, development and \ncommercialization of new technologies. Both of these steps would \nprovide real environmental and economic\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\nbenefits while being fair to American workers. The Senate considered \nseveral well-intentioned proposals on this issue, though I did not \nbelieve they would have taken us in a comprehensive direction. I \nsupported a sense of the Senate resolution that acknowledges the \nproblem and calls on the administration to work with the Congress to \nenact a comprehensive national program to address this issue.\n  The energy bills considered by the Senate over the last couple of \nyears have been doomed by a heavy-handed, partisan approach and by a \nconference committee that added many objectionable provisions before \nthe bill came back to the Senate. We lost valuable time in putting us \non the course toward a sounder energy policy. It is my sincere hope \nthat the majority will pursue a different approach this year and \nproduce a bill that will have strong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two amendments \nthat I filed concerning the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hydro \nrelicensing process and its impact on Indian tribes.\n  The two amendments were simple amendments that I had hoped to have \nincluded in a managers' package.\n  As presently drafted, section 261 will authorize license applicants \nto have veto authority over the Secretary's decision on whether to \naccept alternative conditions. This will have substantial adverse \neffects on Indian reservations that are occupied by hydroelectric \nproject facilities as well as fishery resources that the United States \nholds in trust for Indian tribes.\n  The Federal Government has an obligation, a trust responsibility, to \nprotect the resources and related property rights in them that we hold \nin trust for Indian tribes.\n  A cornerstone of Federal Indian policy regarding tribal natural \nresources is that development of them will not occur without the \nconsent of the tribe for which the United States holds the resources in \ntrust.\n  By injecting the judgment of a hydroelectric dam operator--whose \ninterests may well be adverse to a tribe's--to override the Secretary's \ndetermination of the Federal trust responsibility for tribal resources \naffected by a license application seems to me to be a clear violation \nof our trust responsibility. In certain cases this could result in an \napplicant having a virtual veto over conditions relating to the \nprotection of Indian lands and resources.\n  Congress acted to create reservations to fulfill solemn obligations \nto Indian tribes and vested in the Secretary the special responsibility \nto be the repository of expertise in the management and protection of \nthose reservations as well as fisheries in which many tribes reserved \nrights in their treaties with the United States--treaties that were \nratified by this Senate.\n  The tribal land and fishery resources that would be adversely \naffected by section 261 are vested property rights that the United \nStates holds in trust. There is no justification for subordinating \nthose rights to the activities and interests of a licensee in the \nmanner provided for in this legislation.\n  The Federal Government has continuously broken its promises to Indian \ntribes. Over the past 60 years or so, this has cost us, and the \ntaxpayers, hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more for breaking \nthose promises. And we continue to face additional liability in the \nbillions of dollars for breaking other promises and violating our trust \nresponsibility. This has got to stop.\n  Justice Black once wrote at another critical juncture in the history \nof the Federal Power Act's relationship to tribal property rights: \n``Great nations, like great men, should keep their word.''\n  Although I am disappointed that we may once again be violating our \nsolemn obligation to the Indian tribes who have contributed so much to \nour great country, I note that Senator Domenici has assured me that he \nwill continue to look at this matter.\n  I call on my colleagues in the conference of this legislation to work \nto ensure revision of the language that is antithetical to tribal \nrights and longstanding Federal Indian policy.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, during the 2 weeks or so that we have been \ndebating this Energy bill in the Senate, the price of crude oil has \nclimbed to a record high of $60 a barrel. Gas is now up to $2.24 per \ngallon. The Saudis are pumping at near-full capacity, and their own oil \nminister says that the price of crude will probably stay at this level \nfor the rest of the year.\n  At this price, the United States is sending $650 million overseas \nevery single day. That is $237 billion a year--much of it to the Middle \nEast, a region we have seen torn by war and terror. It doesn't matter \nif these countries are budding democracies, despotic regimes with \nnuclear intentions, or havens for the madrasas that plant the seeds of \nterror in young minds, they get our money because we need their oil.\n  As demand continues to skyrocket around the world, other countries \nhave started to realize that guzzling oil is not a sustainable future. \nWhat's more, these countries have realized that by investing early in \nthe energy-efficient technology that exists today, they can create \nmillions of tomorrow's jobs and build their economies to rival ours.\n  China now has a higher fuel economy standard than we do, and it has \ngot 200,000 hybrids on its roads. Japan's Toyota is doubling production \nof the popular Prius in order to sell 100,000 in the U.S. next year, \nand it is getting ready to open a brand new plant in China. Meanwhile, \nwe are importing hydrogen fuel cells from Canada.\n  These companies are running circles around their American \ncounterparts. Ford is only making 20,000 Escape Hybrids this year, and \nGM's brand won't be on the market until 2007. As falling demand for \ngas-hungry SUVs has contributed to Standard and Poor reducing the bond \nrating of these companies to junk status, these giants of the car \nindustry now find themselves in the shadow of companies and countries \nthat realize the time has come to move away from an oil economy.\n  So here we are. We have people paying record prices at the pump and \nAmerica sending billions overseas to the world's most volatile region. \nWe have countries such as China and India using energy technology to \ncreate jobs and wealth while our own businesses and workers fall \nfurther and further behind.\n  And we have the Energy bill that is before us today.\n  Now, this bill takes some small steps in the right direction. It will \nrequire utilities to generate 10 percent of their electricity from \nrenewable sources. It will help us realize the promise of ethanol as a \nfuel alternative by requiring 8 billion gallons to be mixed with \ngasoline over the next few years, and by providing a tax credit for the \nconstruction of E85 stations all over America. It will provide funding \nfor the clean coal technologies that will move America to use its most \nabundant fossil fuel in a cleaner, healthier way, including for low-\nemission transportation fuels. It will support the development of 500 \nmile-per-gallon automobile technology. And it will provide a good mix \nof tax incentives to move America towards more energy efficiency \ninstead of simply rewarding the oil and gas industries, as the House \nbill does. The good that these proposals will do is reason enough to \nvote for this bill, and I will do so.\n\n  But we shouldn't kid ourselves today. This isn't time to pat \nourselves on the back and think we have put America on the path to \nenergy independence. Experts say that this bill will reduce our foreign \noil consumption by 3 percent. Three percent. Our own Department of \nEnergy predicts that American demand will jump by 50 percent over the \nnext 15 years. So 3 percent doesn't amount to much--and it certainly \nwon't make a difference at the pump. Even President Bush admits this. \nWe tried to pass an amendment that would have reduced our foreign oil \ndependence by 40 percent in 2025, but too many Senators said no.\n  And so when you look at this energy crisis and realize that it is \nabout so much more than energy, when you realize that our national \nsecurity is at stake and that the global standing of our economy hangs \nin the balance, when you see prices continue to rise and other \ncountries continue to innovate, you can't help but ask yourself, ``Is \nthis the best America can do?'' The country that went to the Moon and \nconquered polio? The country that led the technological revolution of \nthe 1990s?\n  It would be one thing if the solutions to our dependence on foreign \noil were pie-in-the-sky ideas that are years\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\naway. But the technology is right at our fingertips. Today, we could \nhave told American car companies, we will help you produce more hybrid \ncars. We could have made sure there were more flexible fuel tanks in \nour cars. We could have addressed the big reason why car companies are \nhurting in this country--legacy health care costs. Had we taken all of \nthese actions, we could have put America on the path to energy \nindependence once and for all.\n  We also could have addressed the fact that global warming is \nthreatening us with higher temperatures, more drought, more wildfire, \nmore flooding, and more erosion of our coastal communities. People who \ndon't believe this can yell about it as loudly as they want, but it \ndoesn't change the fact that the overwhelming scientific evidence \nproves this over and over again. We could have taken care of this \nproblem now and left a better world to our children.\n  With each passing day, the world is moving towards new technology and \nnew sources of energy that will one day replace our current dependence \non fossil fuels.\n  And so America has a choice.\n  We can continue to hang on to oil as our solution. We can keep \npassing Energy bills that nibble around the edges of the problem. We \ncan hope that the Saudis will pump faster and that our drills will find \nmore. And we can just sit on our hands and say that it is too hard to \nchange the way things are and so we might as well not even try.\n  Or we could realize that this issue of energy--this issue that at \nfirst glance seems like it is just about drilling or caribou or weird-\nlooking cars--actually affects so many aspects of our lives that \nfinding a solution could be the great project of our time.\n  It won't be easy and it won't be without sacrifice. Government can't \nmake it happen on its own, but it does have a role in supporting the \ninitiative that is already out there. Together, we can help make real \nthe ideas and initiatives that are coming from scientists and students \nand farmers all across America.\n  Abraham Lincoln, who first opened our National Academy of Sciences, \nonce said that part of Government's mission is to add ``the fuel of \ninterest to the fire of genius in the discovery of new and useful \nthings.''\n  Today, when it comes to discovering new and useful solutions to our \nenergy crisis, the fire of genius burns strong in so many American \ninnovators and optimists. But they're looking for leadership to provide \nthe fuel that will light their way. This bill is a reasonable first \nstep, but I know that we can do much, much better.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for several years now we have been \ndebating a national energy policy. In 2002 and 2003, I voted against \nthe Energy bills because I believed they were bad for California and \nemphasized expanding old, dirty sources of energy instead of investing \nin clean, renewable energy.\n  Today's bill, however, is slightly better. It is more balanced and \nmore protective of consumers. I will, therefore, vote for it.\n  However, this is not a perfect bill, and it contains many provisions \nthat I oppose. I am voting to move the process forward today, but if \nthe bill returns to us from conference more like the House bill, I will \nhave to vote against it.\n  Let me begin with how this bill is better than previous bills. For \nthe first time, we have an Energy bill that creates a Renewable \nPortfolio Standard, RPS. What that means is that utility companies will \nhave to get 10 percent of their energy from renewable resources, such \nas wind and solar, by the year 2020. That is enough to supply 56 \nmillion U.S. homes with electricity generated by renewable sources.\n  There are a variety of other provisions in the bill that will \nencourage conservation, energy efficiency, and development and use of \nclean sources of energy. For example, there are $6.4 billion in tax \nbreaks in the bill to provide incentives for alternative and renewable \nfuels. That includes something I have been advocating for several \nyears--extending and strengthening the tax break for people who \npurchase hybrid cars. It also includes a tax deduction for energy-\nefficient buildings, the production of energy-efficient appliances, and \nthe expansion of the credit for environmentally friendly geothermal \nfacilities.\n  Unlike previous Energy bills, this bill actually contains some \nprotections for consumers. We in California know all too well what \nhappens when energy companies are allowed to manipulate the market and \ngouge consumers. This bill specifically prohibits manipulative \npractices in the electricity market, and it contains provisions for \nbetter accountability and more transparency so that consumers can know \nwhat is happening.\n  Speaking of the electricity crisis in California, we are still \nwaiting for the refunds that are owed to us. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, FERC, found that rates were unjust and \nunreasonable; they found that markets were manipulated. They have \nordered some refunds, but California has yet to see a penny 4 years \nlater. And FERC continues to drag its feet in ordering the full $8.9 \nbillion that is owed to my State.\n  That is why I am pleased that this bill includes my amendment calling \non FERC to conclude action on the refunds issue and requiring FERC, if \nit has not done so by the end of this year, to explain to Congress what \nexactly has been done and to spell out a timetable for the rest of the \nprocess. Californians deserve their refunds, and I hope my amendment \nwill finally bring this matter to a conclusion.\n  I am also glad the Senate approved an amendment Senators Dorgan and \nStabenow and I offered that requires the Federal Trade Commission to \ninvestigate the possible manipulation of the price of gasoline. We are \nseeing unprecedented prices at the pump that cannot be completely \nexplained by the rise in crude oil prices. Oil companies should not be \nmaking undeserved, windfall profits at the expense of consumers who, in \nmany cases, have no alternative but to drive to work.\n  While I oppose the ethanol mandate in this bill, I am pleased that \nthe bill includes a proposal I originally offered with Senator Lugar to \ncount each gallon of ethanol made from agricultural waste products as \n2.5 gallons toward meeting the mandate. This will be a big help to both \nthe farmers and consumers of California. I am also pleased that this \nbill contains my original proposal to provide grants for the \nconstruction of agricultural waste ethanol production facilities.\n  As I mentioned, one of the bad things about this bill is the ethanol \nmandate. Even with the Feinstein provision to exempt California during \nthe summer months, I am still concerned about what this mandate will \nmean for future gasoline prices in my State.\n  I am also adamantly opposed to the provision of this bill that \nrequires an inventory of energy resources in America's Outer \nContinental Shelf. This could easily lead to future oil and gas \ndevelopment in some coastal areas. And an ``inventory'' is not as \ninnocuous as it sounds. It will be conducted with seismic airguns, \nwhich shoot sounds into the seafloor for mapping. These sounds can \ninjure marine mammals and fish, possibly leading to beachings and \nreduced fish catches.\n  The bill grants FERC the sole authority over the siting of liquefied \nnatural gas terminals onshore, denying States the right to have a say \nin the decision.\n  This bill lacks what is probably the surest way to reduce our \ncrippling dependence on foreign oil--increasing mileage standards on \nautomobiles. Raising the fuel economy of passenger automobiles to 40 \nmiles a gallon by 2016 would save about 95 billion gallons of oil by \n2016.\n  Finally, I want to mention my disappointment at this bill's heavy \nreliance on nuclear energy at a time when we still have no solution for \nthe nuclear waste problem and still have safety concerns about nuclear \nfacilities. The bill reauthorizes the Price-Anderson Act to put the \ntaxpayers on the hook in case of an accident, and it provides tax \nincentives and loan guarantees to encourage the construction of more \nnuclear powerplants. This does not make sense. We are subsidizing and \nencouraging the production of more nuclear waste when we have no place \nto put it.\n  As you can see, this is not a perfect bill. But, again, I will vote \nfor it today in order to move the process forward and because it is \nbetter than the previous two Energy bills. I hope that the Senate \nconferees will fight to maintain\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\nthe Senate's language during the conference. If they do not--if this \nbill returns to the Senate looking more like the backward-thinking \nHouse bill--I will have to vote against it.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to the \nmanagers of the energy bill, Senators Domenici and Bingaman, for their \nsupport of two amendments that I offered. I am proud that these \namendments have been included in the legislation that the Senate will \nvote on today, and I believe that their enactment will help America \nincrease its energy independence and transition our energy industry to \nfull usage of 21st century technologies.\n  The first adopted amendment, which was cosponsored by Senator Lugar, \nprovides $85 million to three universities for research and testing on \ndeveloping Illinois basin coal into transportation fuels, including \nFischer-Tropsch jet fuel, a type of low-emissions diesel that can be \nused in jets and diesel. The funds provided in this amendment will \nassist Southern Illinois University, Purdue University, and the \nUniversity of Kentucky in upgrading existing facilities and \nconstructing new facilities to conduct research and testing on this \ntechnology. It is critical that our Government invests in domestic \nfossil fuel supplies in an innovative manner, and this is a commonsense \nway to expand our coal industry in an environmentally friendly manner.\n  The second adopted amendment, which was cosponsored by Senator Bayh, \nprovides $40 million for research on combined plug-in hybrid and \nflexible fuel vehicles. Today, we have the technology to produce both \nplug-in hybrid vehicles, which run partly on electricity rather than \nfuel, and flexible fuel vehicles, which run on a blend of 85 percent \nrenewable fuel and 15 percent petroleum. But we don't yet have the \ntechnology to combine both technologies into the same car. If we could \ndo this, there is the potential for developing a car that could get 500 \nmiles per gallon of gasoline. At a time when our country spends \nbillions of dollars a year on importing foreign oil, it is imperative \nthat we take meaningful, proactive steps that not only stem our future \noil dependence but also reduce our reliance on overseas sources. My \namendment would do just that by stimulating the commercialization of \nthis technology at a cost of only 6 percent of our Nation's daily \nspending on foreign oil.\n  Again, I thank the bill managers for their assistance with these \namendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following two articles on the \npotential of combined plug-in hybrid/flexible fuel vehicles printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Mar. 7, 2005]\n\n\n                     Imagine: 500 Miles Per Gallon\n\n                          (By Fareed Zakaria)\n\n       The most important statement made last week came not from \n     Vladimir Putin or George W. Bush but from Ali Naimi, Saudi \n     Arabia's shrewd oil minister. Naimi predicted that crude \n     prices would stay between $40 and $50 throughout 2005. For \n     the last two years OPEC's official target price has been $25. \n     Naimi's statement signals that Saudi Arabia now believes that \n     current high prices are not a momentary thing. An Asian oil-\n     industry executive told me that he expects oil to hit $75 \n     this decade.\n       We are actually very close to a solution to the petroleum \n     problem. Tomorrow, President Bush could make the following \n     speech: ``We are all concerned that the industrialized world, \n     and increasingly the developing world, draw too much of their \n     energy from one product, petroleum, which comes \n     disproportionately from one volatile region, the Middle East. \n     This dependence has significant political and environmental \n     dangers for all of us. But there is now a solution, one that \n     the United States will pursue actively.\n       ``It is now possible to build cars that are powered by a \n     combination of electricity and alcohol-based fuels, with \n     petroleum as only one element among many. My administration \n     is going to put in place a series of policies that will \n     ensure that in 4-years, the average new American car will get \n     300 miles per gallon of petroleum. And I fully expect in this \n     period to see cars in the United States that get 500 miles \n     per gallon. This revolution in energy use will reduce \n     dramatically our dependence on foreign oil and achieve path \n     breaking reductions in carbon-dioxide emissions, far below \n     the targets mentioned in the Kyoto accords. ``\n       Ever since September 11, 2001, there have been many calls \n     for Manhattan Projects and Marshall Plans for research on \n     energy efficiency and alternate fuels. Beneath the din lies a \n     little-noticed reality-the solution is already with us. Over \n     the last 5-years, technology has matured in various fields, \n     most importantly in semiconductors, to make possible cars \n     that are as convenient and cheap as current ones, except that \n     they run on a combination of electricity and fuel. Hybrid \n     technology is the answer to the petroleum problem.\n       You can already buy a hybrid car that runs on a battery and \n     petroleum. The next step is ``plug-in'' hybrids, with \n     powerful batteries that are recharged at night like laptops, \n     cell phones and iPods. Ford, Honda and Toyota already make \n     simple hybrids. Daimler Chrysler is introducing a plug-in \n     version soon. In many states in the American Middle West you \n     can buy a car that can use any petroleum, or ethanol, or \n     methanol--in any combination. Ford, for example, makes a \n     number of its models with ``flexible-fuel tanks.'' (Forty \n     percent of Brazil's new cars have flexible-fuel tanks.) Put \n     all this technology together and you get the car of the \n     future, a plug-in hybrid with a flexible-fuel tank.\n       Here's the math (thanks to Gal Luft, a tireless--and \n     independent--advocate of energy security). The current crop \n     of hybrid cars get around 50 miles per gallon. Make it a \n     plug-in and you can get 75 miles. Replace the conventional \n     fuel tank with a flexible-fuel tank that can run on a \n     combination of 15 percent petroleum and 85 percent ethanol or \n     methanol, and you get between 400 and 500 miles per gallon of \n     gasoline. (You don't get 500 miles per gallon of fuel, but \n     the crucial task is to lessen the use of petroleum. And \n     ethanol and methanol are much cheaper than gasoline, so fuel \n     costs would drop dramatically.)\n       If things are already moving, why does the government need \n     to do anything? Because this is not a pure free market. Large \n     companies--in the oil and automotive industry--have vested \n     interests in not changing much. There are transition costs--\n     gas stations will need to be fitted to pump methanol and \n     ethanol (at a cost of $20,000 to $60,000 per station). New \n     technologies will empower new industries, few of which have \n     lobbies in Washington.\n       Besides, the idea that the government should have nothing \n     to do with this problem is bizarre. It was military funding \n     and spending that produced much of the technology that makes \n     hybrids possible. (The military is actually leading the \n     hybrid trend. All new naval surface ships are now electric-\n     powered, as are big diesel locomotives and mining trucks.) \n     And the West's reliance on foreign oil is not cost-free. Luft \n     estimates that a government plan that could accelerate the \n     move to a hybrid transport system would cost $12 billion \n     dollars. That is what we spend in Iraq in about 3 months.\n       Smart government intervention would include a combination \n     of targeted mandates, incentives and spending. And it does \n     not have to all happen at the federal level. New York City, \n     for example, could require that all its new taxis be hybrids \n     with flexible-fuel tanks. Now that's a Manhattan Project for \n     the 21st century.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, March 24, 2005]\n\n                    The 500-Mile-Per-Gallon Solution\n\n\n High-tech cars, Arctic drilling, new gas taxes: We must have the will \n                              to do it all\n\n                             (By Max Boot)\n\n       Soaring oil prices--crude is over $55 a barrel and unleaded \n     gasoline over $2 a gallon--are not much of an economic or \n     political issue. Yet.\n       In absolute terms, today's prices are still half of the \n     1970s peaks, and the U.S. economy has become much less \n     dependent on petroleum since then. (Computers run on \n     electricity, not gasoline.) But imagine what would happen if \n     Al Qaeda were to hit the giant Ras Tanura terminal in Saudi \n     Arabia, where a tenth of global oil supplies are processed \n     every day. Prices could soar past $100 a barrel, and the U. \n     S. economy could go into a tailspin. As it is, high oil \n     prices provide money for Saudi Arabia to subsidize hate-\n     spewing madrasas and for Iran to develop nuclear weapons.\n       Both Democrats and Republicans know this, but neither party \n     is serious about solving this growing crisis. Democrats who \n     couldn't tell the difference between a caribou and a cow \n     grandstand about the sanctity of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, even though 70 percent of Alaskans are happy to see a \n     bit of drilling in this remote tundra. Republicans, for their \n     part, pretend that tapping ANWR will somehow solve all of our \n     problems. If only. A government study finds that, with ANWR \n     on line, the U.S. will be able to reduce its dependence on \n     imported oil from 68 percent to 65 percent in 2025.\n       How to do better? Biking to work or taking the train isn't \n     the answer. Even if Americans drive less, global oil demand \n     will surge because of breakneck growth in India and China. \n     The Middle East, home of two-thirds of the world's proven oil \n     reserves, will remain of vital strategic importance unless we \n     can develop alternative sources of automotive propulsion and \n     substantially decrease global, not just American, demand for \n     petroleum. An ambitious agenda to achieve those goals has \n     been produced by Set America Free, a group set up by R. James \n     Woolsey, Frank Gaffney and other national security hawks.\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\n       They advocate using existing technologies--not pie-in-the-\n     sky ideas like hydrogen fuel cells--to wean the auto industry \n     from its reliance on petroleum. Hybrid electric cars such as \n     the Toyota Prius, which run on both electric motors and gas \n     engines, already get more than 50 miles per gallon. Coming \n     soon are hybrids that can be plugged into a 120-volt outlet \n     to recharge like a cellphone. They'll get even better \n     mileage.\n       Add in ``flexible fuel'' options that already allow many \n     cars to run on a combination of petroleum and fuels like \n     ethanol (derived from corn) and methanol (from natural gas or \n     coal), and you could build vehicles that could get--drum \n     roll, please--500 miles per gallon of gasoline. That's not \n     science fiction; that's achievable right now.\n       Set America Free estimates that if we convert entirely to \n     flexible-fuel, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. \n     gasoline imports in 20 years will drop by two-thirds. As \n     important, because Americans are the world's biggest car \n     buyers, U.S. preferences would reshape the global automotive \n     industry. Carmakers would wind up shipping hybrid electrics \n     to Europe and Asia too. President Bush could hasten the \n     transition through an international agreement to move major \n     economies away from oil dependency. This would not only \n     reduce the Middle East's strategic importance but also help \n     reduce emissions to Kyoto-mandated levels.\n       There is, of course, a catch. Moving to hybrid electric \n     cars won't be cheap. Automakers would have to retool their \n     wares, gas stations would have to add alcohol-fuel pumps, \n     parking lots would have to add electric outlets. Set America \n     Free puts the price tag at about $12 billion over the next \n     four years. It sounds like a lot of money, but it could \n     easily be financed by slightly raising U.S. gasoline taxes \n     (currently about 43 cents a gallon), which are much lower \n     than in Europe and Japan. Higher taxes could also be used to \n     encourage more domestic oil exploration and production, given \n     that petroleum will never be entirely eliminated as an energy \n     source.\n       There are many untapped sources of gasoline in North \n     America, such as the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, and the \n     shale of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. But extracting oil from \n     such sources costs at least three times more than pumping it \n     out of the Arabian desert. Congress could make this more \n     economically feasible by imposing a higher tax on oil that \n     doesn't come from North America.\n       Needless to say, this runs smack dab into Republican \n     orthodoxy that opposes new taxes and regulations, while the \n     prospect of more drilling raises the hackles of Democratic \n     environmentalists. Absent some political courage in both \n     parties, we will continue to be at OPEC's mercy.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of H.R. 6, as \namended by the Senate, the Energy bill. I want to explain in detail my \nreasons for supporting this legislation and highlight my serious \nconcerns regarding the House-passed version of H.R. 6. I strongly \noppose many of the provisions in the House-passed bill, and the Senate \nconferees should hold strongly to the Senate-version of this bill and \nreject the House legislation.\n  Energy policy is an important issue for America and one my Vermont \nconstituents take very seriously. The bill before us seeks to address \nimportant issues, such as the role of domestic production of energy \nresources versus foreign imports, the tradeoffs between the need for \nenergy and the need to protect the quality of our environment, and the \nneed for additional domestic efforts to support improvements in our \nenergy efficiency, and the wisest use of our energy resources. Given \nthe importance of energy policy, this bill is a very serious matter. I \ndo not take a decision to support such a bill lightly. Although this \nbill is not exactly as I would have written it, it begins to move this \nNation toward a more balanced approach to our energy needs.\n  During floor debate, the Senate modified the renewable fuels standard \ncontained in the Energy Committee reported bill to more closely \nresemble legislation reported by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, S. 606. Specifically, the bill would repeal the Clean Air \nAct requirement for oxygenated gasoline, and phase out the use of the \nadditive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, in 4 years. It would \nrequire refiners to use biofuels, presumably mostly ethanol, in volumes \nof 8 billion gallons by 2012. This is a much more aggressive goal than \nthe 108th Congress Senate-passed bill that I supported, which included \na 5 billion gallon by 2012 mandate. It is my hope that such a \nsignificant commitment will begin to reduce our dependence upon foreign \noil.\n  I would like to share the history of the renewable fuels provisions \nincluded in this bill we are adopting today. I've long supported a more \naggressive approach to replacing petroleum-based motor fuels with fuels \nmade from domestic resources, including ethanol produced by farmers \ngrowing grains and fibers. I commend Senators Domenici and Bingaman on \ntheir leadership on this important matter.\n  Back in 1991, I introduced S. 716, the Replacement Fuels Act, to \nrequire gasoline refiners to replace increasing percentages of their \nproduct with domestically produced, nonpetroleum liquids. Many of us \nknew then that it was technologically possible, and now it seems that a \nmajority has crossed that threshold of understanding.\n  When I first introduced my Replacement Fuels Act, many did not take \nit seriously. The oil industry certainly did not. But I made the rounds \nwith several of my colleagues to convince them of the benefits of such \na program, including the national security benefits of weaning \nourselves from our dependency on foreign oil. At the time, I argued \nthat the costs to our military, in terms of personnel and dollars, of \nprotecting the shipping lanes of the Persian Gulf, and of attempting to \nquell the political unrest of the Middle East, were staggering then and \nonly apt to grow larger.\n  I recall meeting with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, now \nthe chairman of the Energy Committee, in his office to discuss my bill. \nWe agreed on the domestic benefits of moving in this direction--for our \nfarmers; for our environment; for our national and domestic security. \nAfter considerable discussion, Senator Domenici agreed to cosponsor my \nbill.\n  I made the rounds to other members of the Energy Committee for their \nadvice and support. Many of those committee members who cosponsored my \nbill are still here today--Senators Bingaman, Burns, Craig and Conrad, \nShelby and Akaka. Four other committee members, since retired, also \nwere cosponsors, making a majority of the committee and ensuring \ncommittee approval. Other Members who cosponsored my bill and who are \nhere today include Senators Grassley, Reid, and Warner.\n  In the end, the bulk of the language of my Replacement Fuels Act was \nincluded as title V of Public Law 102-486 the Energy Policy Act of \n1992. Before final passage of that act, however, in every instance that \n``shall'' appeared in my bill, it was changed to ``may'' in the final \nlaw. In other words, it changed from a mandate to an option, and we've \nonly made modest gains in the past dozen years, when we could have made \nbold progress.\n  So, again, I commend Senators Domenici and Bingaman for their \nleadership to move us more aggressively toward domestic production of \ntransportation fuels and away from our growing foreign dependence.\n  I urge Senators and the public to take note of the Sense of the \nSenate on climate change successfully included in the bill due to the \nefforts of Senators Bingaman, Domenici, Specter, and many others. It \nsays that Congress should enact a comprehensive and effective national \nprogram of mandatory, market-based limits and incentives on emissions \nof greenhouse gases that slow, stop, and reverse the growth of such \nemissions at a rate and in a manner that, one, will not significantly \nharm the United States economy; and, two, will encourage comparable \naction by other nations that are major trading partners and key \ncontributors to global emissions. Such a program regarding air \npollution and environmental policy is clearly in the jurisdiction of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and I am strongly committed \nto holding hearings and reporting implementing and bipartisan \nlegislation from that committee, on which I serve as the ranking \nmember, as soon as possible.\n\n  During debate on the renewable fuels provisions, I agreed to modify \nthe absolute deadline for EPA's long-awaited and long-delayed mobile \nsource air toxics, MSAT, rule from July 2005 in Domenici amendment No. \n779 to July 2007. EPA is widely expected to promulgate a final rule \nwell before that later date, but this provision provides additional \ncertainty and protection. In addition, the provision as amended and \nincluded by Senator Inhofe in the last manager's package, will allow \nEPA to regulate more stringently than the 2001-2002 toxics emissions \nreductions baseline in the final MSAT rule.\n  That more stringent rule will take the place of the baseline so long \nas it\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nwill achieve and maintain greater overall reductions in emissions of \nair toxics. Such reductions must occur in the same timeframe and result \nin overall reductions of each and every one of the air toxics emitted \nin the combustion of gasoline, when compared to the 2001-2002 baseline. \nThis provision should not be construed to permit EPA to count \nreductions of less toxic pollutants like aldehydes equal in effect or \nequivalent to reductions of more toxic pollutants like benzene. The \nintent of this provision is not to allow EPA to avoid toxics potency \nweighting or sensible risk analysis and exposure assessment in \ndetermining the meaning of ``overall reductions.'' This provision \nshould also not be viewed as a vehicle for changes to the liability \nsystem for fuel additives. The Senate has spoken very strongly on this \npoint, and the conferees should be aware that any new MTBE language \naddressing the issue of retroactive liability is likely to jeopardize \npassage of the conference report in the Senate.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate included a 10-percent renewable \nportfolio standard in this bill. I have worked for more than 20 years \nto boost the percentage of renewable sources used to generate our \nNation's electricity. While I believe we could be taking a much more \naggressive step, we need to take a serious first step, and the \nprovisions in this bill do just that. Though I understand that the \nHouse has concerns with adding an RPS, it is my hope that the conferees \nwill acknowledge that, for many States, renewable energy can and should \nbe a bigger energy source.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has also chosen to promote renewable \nenergy by accepting three amendments I offered to the bill during floor \ndebate. It is my hope these modest provisions will be retained in \nconference. My first amendment will make significant reductions in \nenergy use in the Capitol complex by requiring the Architect of the \nCapitol to review the possibility for energy savings in the Dirksen \nBuilding. The second two amendments expand the sources of grant \nfinancing available to utilities for projects involving renewables and \nefficiency. The Senate has agreed to add livestock methane, a promising \nsource of energy in Vermont, as an energy source that is eligible to \ncompete for grants under the Department of Energy's Renewable Energy \nIncentives Program. The Senate has also agreed to create a new $20-\nmillion-per-year grant program for upgrade of electric transmission.\n  As I mentioned, though, the bill is not perfect, and the conferees \nshould carefully review several provisions. In title XIII there are a \nnumber of sections authorizing investigations that will recommend \nchanges to environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the National Environmental \nProtection Act. Unfortunately, in a number of these areas the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, whose responsibility it is to ensure \nthe air we breath and the water we drink is safe, is not involved in \ndeveloping or approving these recommendations.\n  While I proposed amendments to include the Environmental Protection \nAgency in these sections, not all of changes were adopted. The sections \nneeding amending include: section 1306 Backup Fuel Capability Study; \nsection 1309 Study of Feasibility and Effects of Reducing Use of Fuel \nfor Automobiles; and section 1320, Natural Gas Supply Shortage Report. \nIt is my belief that any studies that involve environmental compliance \nshould include the involvement of the agency whose mission it is to \noversee the implementation of these environmental laws.\n  I am pleased that my Recycling Investment Saves Energy, RISE, \nprovisions were included as section 1545 of the final bill. The \nprovisions will provide almost $100 million in tax incentives for \nrecyclers over the next decade to preserve and expand our Nation's \nrecycling infrastructure. The targeted 15 percent tax credit for \nequipment used in the processing and sorting of recyclable materials \nwill increase quantity and quality of recyclable materials collected. \nThis national investment is necessary to reverse the declining \nrecycling rate of many consumer commodities, including aluminum, glass \nand plastic, which are near historic lows. It will also generate \nsignificant energy savings as increasing the U.S. recycling rate to 35 \npercent will result in annual energy savings of 903 trillion Btus, \nenough to meet the energy needs of an additional 2.4 million homes.\n  The Finance title includes an amendment that I authored to improve \nfuture Federal energy investment and policy decisions. It requires the \nSecretary of Treasury to contract with the National Academy of Sciences \nto complete a study and report to Congress on the health, \nenvironmental, security and infrastructure externalities associated \nwith energy activities and how they may or may not be affecting \nrevenues, the economy and trade. Such information will dramatically \nimprove our ability to review the costs and benefits of energy \nlegislation and tax policy changes.\n  I am pleased that my amendment to section 1305, the coal bed methane \nstudy, was adopted. My amendment requires that as it studies the issue \nthe Department of Energy consult with States and the Environmental \nProtection Agency on the impacts of coal bed natural gas production on \nsurface water and ground water resources. This consultation should \noccur, especially before making recommendations to Congress on changes \nto the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n  This bill does a reasonable job in balancing support for traditional \nfossil fuels and nuclear power and renewable energy, but I am perplexed \nby provisions in the Energy bill that provide $1.82 billion in grants \nfor oil, gas and coal industries. With oil hovering around $60 a barrel \nand gasoline prices at record highs, I question the wisdom of providing \nadditional subsidies for oil and gas exploration and production. While \nAmericans pay more at the pump, multinational oil companies continue to \nreport record profits. The bill also waives royalty payments for oil \ncompanies drilling in Federal waters and rewards these already \nprofitable companies while depleting the U.S. economy of $100 million \nover 10 years.\n  The bill gives $1.8 billion to the dirtiest powerplants to build new \ncoal powerplants, thereby giving them an economic advantage over \npowerplants that installed pollution control technologies. I am also \nconcerned about provisions in the coal title that unfairly benefits \nmining companies with current leases on federal lands by doubling the \nacreage, 162 to 320 acres, of coal-leased lands; removing the 40-year \nlimitation for leases; and doubling the time (from 10 to 20 years) \ncurrent leaseholders can pay advanced royalties. These provisions will \nhave the most significant impact on the Powder River Basin where three \nmining companies dominate current production. I question the wisdom in \nsubsidizing these fossil fuel industries that will only continue to \nencourage our Nation's dependence upon these polluting and expensive \nenergy sources.\n  I also urge the conferees not to include the Leaking Underground \nStorage Tank, LUST, reform provisions in the final bill. The Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee is actively considering these \nissues and has planned a hearing for July 2005. Our Committee's actions \nled the Senate to enact bipartisan comprehensive LUST reform \nlegislation last Congress by unanimous consent. Adding LUST reform onto \nthe Energy bill would needlessly bypass our legislative consideration \nand prevent this issue from getting the careful attention that it \nrequires.\n  The LUST provisions of the Senate's Energy bill, section 210, are \nproblematic. Most significantly, the section raids the LUST Trust Fund \nand diverts dollars from their intended purpose--cleaning up \ncontamination from leaking USTs. Without increasing the amount of money \nto be appropriated to the States, the provision expands the eligible \nuses of the LUST Trust Fund to pay for cleanup of spills from non-UST \nsources, such as pipelines, cars, and above ground storage tanks. In a \nletter to Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin on May 7, 2003, former EPA \nAdministrator Christine Todd Whitman opposed these provisions because \nthey ``would change the historical scope of the program, and could \nstress the Agency's ability to adequately address releases from USTs.''\n  I am concerned because this section will go to conference with the \nHouse-\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\npassed LUST provisions that also contain significant flaws. The House \nprovisions add a new periodic inspection requirement for USTs that is \nweaker than the 2-year minimum inspection frequency recommended by EPA \nand the 3-year minimum requirement recommended by the Government \nAccountability Office. For example, a tank last inspected in 1999 \nwouldn't need to be inspected again for over a decade. In addition, the \nHouse delivery prohibition provisions may preempt existing authority in \n24 States. Finally, the provisions requiring secondary containment \nwithin 1,000 feet of existing community water systems includes an \nexemption that ignores prevention in favor of expensive cleanup.\n  So we have our work cut out for us. Today, the Senate is passing a \ngood bill that needs some work in conference, but not a substantial \noverhaul or weakening. To retain my support the conferees need to \nprevent substantial modifications to this bill, resist the addition of \ncontroversial items added in the House-version of H.R. 6, avoid \nsubstantive modification to core titles of the bill, limit adjustments \nto the bill's fiscal scope and cost, and consider additions of \nprovisions to provide energy security.\n  This is a good effort to develop energy legislation for America, \nwhich is a goal widely shared in both Houses of Congress. It is my hope \nthat conferees seek this year to reach consensus on issues such as: \nnational electricity reliability standards, the use of renewables, the \nphase out of methyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE, and production of \nsuitable oxygenate replacements, and the fiscally responsible extension \nof needed energy tax provisions. With this bill I am supporting today \nwe send them a good template to achieve that goal.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, H.R. 6, the Energy bill, is an effort to \nimprove our Nation's energy supply and reliability, and for that it \nshould be praised. Like any bill of its magnitude, the Energy bill \nincludes a variety of good and bad provisions, and it has to be weighed \nfor the relative good and bad it will do. I've come to the conclusion \nafter careful study that the bad outweighs the good, particularly for \nthe State of Arizona. And it is for that reason that I must vote no. \nThis bill will likely raise the price of gasoline in Arizona, hurt our \nair quality, and raise the price of our electricity, all while \nincreasing the Federal deficit with enormous subsidies, special \nprojects, and tax breaks for everything from fish oil to luxury hybrid \ncars. I support the President in his efforts to reduce our dependence \non foreign oil, and I wish this bill did more to accomplish that goal.\n  As I have said, some important provisions of this bill have much to \nrecommend them. Unfortunately, the ethanol ``Renewable Energy'' title \nis not one of them. The ethanol provisions of the Energy bill are truly \nremarkable. They mandate that Americans use 8 billion gallons of \nethanol annually by 2012. We use 3.4 billion gallons now. For what \npurpose, I ask, does Congress so egregiously manipulate the national \nmarket for vehicle fuel? No proof exists that the ethanol mandate will \nmake our air cleaner. In fact, in Arizona, the State Department of \nEnvironmental Quality has found that ethanol use in the summer will \ndegrade air quality, which will probably force areas in Arizona out of \nattainment with the Clean Air Act. Arizonans will suffer. California \nalso expects that the summertime use of ethanol would harm air quality, \nbut in the Senate bill, California is exempted from the summer mandate. \nIf Arizona had the same exemption, then the ethanol mandate would still \nbe expensive and unwarranted, but at least it would not actually cause \nphysical harm.\n  An ethanol mandate is not needed to keep the ethanol industry alive. \nThat industry already receives a hefty amount of Federal largesse. CRS \nestimates that the ethanol and corn industries have received more than \n$40 billion in subsidies and tax incentives since 1996. I repeat, $40 \nbillion Yet, this bill not only mandates that we more than double our \nethanol use, but provides even more subsidies for the industry. In the \nnext 5 years, CBO estimates that the loan guarantee program by itself \nwill cost $110 million, while CRS estimates that the tax incentives for \nethanol will cost taxpayers $37.7 billion. Furthermore, according to \nthe Energy Information Administration, a mandate of five billion \ngallons would cost between $6.7 and $8 billion a year--forcing \nAmericans to pay more for gasoline. Not surprisingly, the 8 billion \ngallon mandate will cost even more.\n  Professor David Pimentel, of the College of Agriculture and Life \nSciences at Cornell, has studied ethanol. He is a true expert on the \n``corn-to-car'' fuel process. His verdict, in a recent study: ``Abusing \nour precious croplands to grow corn for an energy-inefficient process \nthat yields low-grade automobile fuel amounts to unsustainable, \nsubsidized food burning.'' It isn't efficient, and will impede the \nnatural innovation in clean fuels that would occur with a competitive \nmarket, free of the government's manipulation.\n  Ethanol is not the only mandate in the bill. This Energy bill also \nignores state law and mandates a national one-size-fits-all renewable \nportfolio standard (RPS) for electricity. Currently, 19 States, \nincluding Arizona, and the District of Columbia have their own \nrenewable standards. In Arizona, a State that gets its electricity \nmainly from coal, natural gas, and hydro facilities, our Corporation \nCommission has tailored the State's renewable standard to our unique \ncircumstance as a desert State that receives a lot of sunshine, little \nwind, and has few other renewable resources. The current Arizona \nstandard is 1.1 percent, of which 60 percent must come from solar \nenergy. While solar energy is abundant in Arizona, it costs 3-5 times \nmore than conventional energy and 2-4 times more than other more cost \neffective renewable energy such as wind and geothermal--a fact that is \nreflected in the Arizona standard. The Arizona Corporation Commission \nhas recently proposed raising the State's renewable standard and \nchanging the mix of alternative sources that would be acceptable. This \nproposal, however, is part of an open, collaborative process. All \nstakeholders have had the chance to submit comments both supporting, \nopposing, and refining the change. The Corporation Commission will \nweigh the costs to Arizona ratepayers, and is more likely than the \nCongress to find a renewable standard that works for Arizona.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate RPS requirement does not have Arizona \nratepayers in mind. Utilities in Arizona will be forced, under this \nbill, to comply with both the State mandate and the Senate's RPS \nmandate that has different requirements. To meet the Senate's mandate, \nthe bill punishes States that lack reasonably priced renewable \nresources such as wind and geothermal, hydroelectricity cannot be used \nunder the Senate bill, by forcing them to go buy credits from wind-rich \nparts of the country or to buy those credits from the Federal \nGovernment for $ .015/kwh, adjusted for inflation. That means that if a \nState cannot find a renewable source that costs less than the \nconventional price of energy plus $.015/kwh, then it is cheaper to buy \nthe government credit. Arizona simply does not have renewable resources \nthat can compete with the Senate bill's $0.015/kwh RPS penalty. Paying \nthe penalty will be more cost effective than producing solar energy or \nacquiring other renewable resources. The effective result will be a \ntransfer of wealth from Arizonans to renewable-rich states or to the \nFederal Government. For my home State of Arizona, electricity rates \nwill rise.\n  A nationwide renewable portfolio standard is, therefore, not only \nduplicative in Arizona, it would raise consumers' electricity prices \nand create inequities among States. In simplest terms, an RPS mandate \nwould require electric utilities to forego inexpensive conventional \nenergy for more expensive renewable technologies or purchase renewable \nenergy credits from the Federal Government. Either way, an RPS mandate \nwill result in an expensive, hidden tax on electricity consumers.\n  Now for the tax title. My overarching concern is that Congress \ncontinues to try to use special interest tax subsidies to set an \nindustrial policy--failed strategy of ``Government knows best''--on the \nstrongest and most dynamic economy in the developed world.\n  I share the concerns of many of my colleagues that the budget deficit \ndemonstrates a lack of wise stewardship of taxpayer dollars. The only \nway we will get the budget back into balance is to\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nenact policies that support economic growth and spend taxpayer dollars \nwith care.\n  Almost exactly 2 years ago, Congress, working with President Bush, \napproved one of the most important and best-designed tax cuts in recent \nmemory: the jobs and growth tax bill. Quite simply, it cut tax rates on \nincome and on dividends and capital gains. We know from widely accepted \neconomic studies--most recently from our 2004 Nobel-Prize winning \neconomist, Dr. Prescott from Arizona State University--that high tax \nrates discourage work, savings and investment and that to encourage \nthese favorable economic activities, the best thing we can do is keep \ntax rates low and get out of the way.\n  When our economy is growing and businesses and individuals are making \nmoney they pay more in taxes, meaning the Government collects more \nrevenue, even at lower rates--indeed, because of the lower rates. So \nfar this year, Federal tax revenues are up significantly. From October \n1 through April 30, revenues climbed by $146 billion to a total of \n$1.216 trillion; an increase of 13.6 percent over a year earlier and \nfour or five times the inflation rate. Income tax receipts are up $66 \nbillion, or 16 percent, to $547 billion. Corporate income tax receipts \nare rising even faster, up 48 percent to $134 billion.\n  Capital gains tax revenue is set to exceed the Government forecasts \nby $14 billion this fiscal year and by $16 billion in fiscal year 06. \nRoughly $5 billion of the dividend tax cut has been recouped through \nhigher than expected dividend payments. These are the kind of tax \npolicies Congress ought to be pursuing. Instead, we are spending over \n$18 billion on tax subsidies for the energy industry--subsidies that \nwill not generate economic growth and that will not make a dent in our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  The tax subsidies in this bill are exactly the wrong approach. \nGovernment should not try to force taxpayers into one favored type of \ninvestment by providing tax subsidies for that investment. If an \ninvestment is not economically viable without a Government subsidy, \nthen perhaps it is not an activity that ought to be encouraged with \ntaxpayer dollars. And if a technology is already viable without a \ntaxpayer-financed subsidy, then we should not devote scarce resources \nto encourage what is already happening in the free market.\n  My primary complaint has to do with the use of tax credits by the \nGovernment. The Federal Government uses tax credits to induce \nindividuals or businesses to engage in favored activities. This can \ndistort the market and cause individuals or businesses to undertake \nunproductive economic activity that they might not have done absent the \ninducement. Tax credits are really appropriations that are run through \nthe Internal Revenue Code and are a way to give Federal subsidies, \ndisguised as tax cuts, to favored constituencies. It is something we \nshould do sparingly--very sparingly. While tax credits can be effective \nin encouraging activities we consider laudable for one reason or \nanother, I believe that, as stewards of the taxpayers' money, we must \nonly support those credits that provide broad benefit to all taxpayers \nand that are worth the revenue they will cost the Federal Treasury.\n  I do not believe that any of the tax credits in the bill meet these \ntests. The bill extends and expands the credit provided in section 45 \nof the Code. This credit is available on a per-kilowatt-hour basis for \nenergy produced from wind, solar, closed-loop biomass, open-loop \nbiomass, geothermal, small irrigation, and municipal solid waste. I \nbelieve that the credit for wind energy should have sunset several \nyears ago. Wind energy has been provided this credit since 1992, and if \nit is not competitive after a decade of taxpayer subsidies, it will \nnever be competitive. In 2001, the wind industry was in fact touting \nits great success and competitiveness with other forms of energy, but \nhere we are extending the wind credit for 3 more years. I wager that we \nwill still be paying for the ``temporary'' advantage being given to \nthese new energy forms a decade from now.\n  At best, we don't know whether the existing tax subsidies that this \nlegislation extends work at all because we have never subjected them to \na comprehensive review. At worst, we are simply funneling taxpayer \ndollars that could be better used by private individuals in the free \nmarket to favored constituencies. During the markup of the tax title in \nthe Finance Committee, many of my colleagues on the Committee expressed \nsympathy with my concern that Congress passes a myriad of credits and \nincentives to encourage favored activities, but we never go back to see \nif the subsidies are working as intended. I am hoping that I can work \nwith my colleagues who expressed these concerns to ask for a Government \nAccountability Office study of the many subsidies and incentives \nincluded in this legislation to track their cost and effectiveness.\n  One subsidy we ought to watch closely is the alternative fuel vehicle \nsubsidy. As much as we all support the goal of cleaner air, we must be \ncareful not to create more problems than we solve. In my own State of \nArizona, an alternative fuels subsidy program had to be repealed when \nits many scandalous deficiencies were exposed. Nor has there been any \nevidence that the vehicles to which the subsidy applies aren't simply \npriced higher by the amount of the subsidy. I have serious questions \nabout whether the incentives are necessary and whether it is \nappropriate to use the tax code to persuade taxpayers to purchase one \ntype of vehicle over another.\n  I know hybrid cars and alternative fuel cars are very popular, so \nSenators may hesitate to stand in the way of tax incentives for people \nto buy them. But I believe their very popularity argues that there is \nno need for the tax incentives. People are buying them today without \nbeing coaxed by the Federal Government. I hope we can agree to have the \nGAO study this new credit to determine how much the provision is really \ncosting, how effective it is at encouraging the purchase of alternative \nfuel vehicles, and how long the credit will be needed.\n  I have spoken of the ``bad'' in the bill, now I want to discuss what \nis ``good''. I have been particularly interested in the provisions in \nthe electricity title that are designed to restructure our electricity \nmarkets. Some of my colleagues have been tempted to move immediately to \ncompletely unregulated electricity markets; others favored imposing a \nmore stringent regulatory regime as a result of problems in California.\n  Representing Arizona, I was well aware of the problems stemming from \nthe California energy crisis but cannot agree with those who say the \nsolution is to return to a command-and-control regulatory structure. I \ncontinue to believe that the most efficient way to allocate resources \nis through competitive markets. The bill encourages competitive markets \nwhile ensuring that safety and reliability are maintained. The \nreliability provisions of the electricity title will convert the \ncurrent voluntary system of reliability procedures to a mandatory \nsystem that all utilities must follow, but that is sensitive to \nregional differences in the electricity grid. The electricity title \nalso repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. As we all \nknow, our energy markets have evolved significantly since the era of \nthe Great Depression. State regulators are smarter, more well equipped, \nand able to protect consumers from the ills that gave rise to the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 nearly 70 years ago.\n\n  On the downside, the electricity title also contains unfortunate \nprovisions that would grant the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n(FERC) additional authority to regulate generation, natural gas \nutilities, and holding companies. Giving FERC new merger authority is \ngoing in the wrong direction. Utility mergers and acquisitions are \nalready subject to multiple and overlapping reviews by FERC, SEC, DOJ, \nFTC, and the States. FERC uses exactly the same merger review \nguidelines as the antitrust agencies, DOJ and FTC--thus FERC performs \nessentially the same review those agencies already perform. There is no \nneed to add new layers of review.\n  I have often expressed my concern with what some industry officials \nhave termed a jurisdictional reach by FERC into the delivery of power \nto retail customers. The service obligation amendment that I worked on \nwith the chairman has been included in this package, and I believe it \nprovides a commonsense way to promote competitive markets while \npreserving the reliability\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\nthat retail electric consumers expect and deserve. In its actions \ngoverning access to transmission systems, FERC has not adequately \nensured that the native load customers, for whom the system was \nconstructed, can rely on the system to keep the lights on. The bill \nadds a new section 218 to the Federal Power Act to ensure that native \nload customers' rights to the system, including load growth, are \nprotected.\n  It is also worth noting that the Energy bill expands jurisdiction \nover those stakeholders in electric markets that were previously \nunregulated by the FERC. The ``FERC-lite'' provision that addresses the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission's efforts to provide open access \nover all transmission facilities in the United States again, in my \nmind, strikes the right balance. It requires FERC to ensure that \ntransmission owners--whether they are municipal utilities, power \nmarketing administrations, or electric cooperatives--deliver power at \nterms that are not discriminatory or preferential. However, this \nprovision is limited and does not give FERC the ability to begin \nregulating the rate-setting activities of these organizations. FERC-\nlite does not confer further authority to FERC over public power \nsystems. FERC cannot order structural or organizational changes in an \nunregulated transmitting utility to comply with this section. For \nexample, if an integrated utility providing a bundled retail service \noperates transmission distribution and retail sales out of a single \noperational office, the Commission cannot require functional separation \nof transmission operations from retail sales operations.\n  Gratifying, as well, is that the Senate bill has not pursued a \ncommand-and-control approach with respect to regional transmission \norganizations, or RTOs. I believe the best approach, which is captured \nin this bill, is for FERC to provide incentives to encourage membership \nin RTOs and independent system operators. As lawmakers, we need to be \nsensitive to the policy changes we propose and how the laws we draft \nwill affect Wall Street and the markets, and we must make sure we \npromote the investments that are needed. This is a prime example of how \nthe Energy bill has sought to advance policies to which the investment \ncommunity can respond favorably.\n  So, in conclusion, while this bill includes several meritorious \nprovisions, especially the electricity title, I must vote against it \nbecause of the $ 18.4 billion in tax subsidies and the bill's \nirresponsible manipulation of the energy markets through an ethanol \nmandate and a national renewable portfolio standard. I hope that the \nconference of the House and the Senate is able to address these issues \nso that I can support this bill in the future.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, as we consider the possibilities and \nchallenges that face our great Nation and the tremendous dependence we \nhave on foreign sources of oil, every effort to reduce that dependence \nbecomes a key point for consideration by the Congress. In addition, the \ngrowing demand for oil by China and India only intensifies the need for \naction. We must become less reliant on foreign sources of oil and \nnatural gas from unstable parts of the world.\n  I have been made aware that by reducing fuel consumption in the \naviation sector through implementation of an idle reduction technology \nwe would see fuel reductions in excess of 90 million barrels of \npetroleum each year after full implementation.\n  Implementing this type of technology would also greatly reduce the \nassociated mobile source emissions greatly benefiting our metropolitan \nareas facing EPA nonattainment and the losses associated this \ncategorization. The airline industry and the general public would also \nbenefit from such technology through reduced costs and environmental \nimprovements.\n  According to DOT, expenses for U.S. commercial airlines, fuel and oil \nexpenses were equal to those of labor which has historically been the \nsingle largest expense for the carriers. By reducing the amount of fuel \nrequired through idle reduction technology, the U.S. commercial \nairlines could save well over $4 billion in fuel costs at today's fuel \nprices, a large percentage of the estimated losses for this year.\n  Applying innovative technology applications in this manner will \nassist in reducing our overall dependence on foreign oil while \nproviding other benefits as well.\n  The Energy bill that has passed today includes support for research \nand development for optimizing fuel efficiency for commercial \naircrafts. This is an important step in the right direction for \nAmerica's energy future.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are voting on the Energy bill, \nwhich provides Congress with a historic opportunity. We should seize \nthis opportunity and ensure that as this legislation goes to \nconference, the NOPEC bill, S. 555, remains an essential part of the \nunderlying legislation.\n  America's fuel crisis continues to take hard-earned money from our \nfamilies, farmers, and businesses. When President Bush took office, the \nprice of 1 gallon of regular gasoline was about $1.45. Today, that same \ngallon will cost an American at the pump more than $2.20. And \nyesterday, our financial markets closed with the ominous and \nunprecedented news that a barrel of crude oil now sells for more than \n$60 per barrel. We know that these prices have a real impact--a major \nshipping carrier announced disappointing earnings last week in part due \nto the high price of fuel--and yet the administration has done nothing \nto address the situation.\n  In the face of continued inaction from the White House, it is time \nfor Congress to substitute action for talk. It is time for us to \nfinally pass NOPEC as part of the larger Energy bill.\n  We should have considered and passed this bill, S. 555, on its own. \nThis bill passed out of the Judiciary Committee for a second time with \noverwhelming support earlier this year. I have repeatedly called for \nits consideration by the Senate over the last several months. It is \nlong past time for the Congress to hold OPEC accountable for its \nanticompetitive behavior. This amendment will release the United States \nfrom being at the mercy of the OPEC cartel by making them subject to \nour antitrust laws. It will allow the Federal Government to take legal \naction against any foreign state, including members of OPEC, for price \nfixing and other anticompetitive activities in this regard.\n  The President's solution to high gasoline prices this summer is to \nopen the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, pristine wilderness area, to \noil drilling. But drilling in ANWR will not provide any new oil for at \nleast 7 to 12 years and will take an environmental toll. ANWR drilling \nwill do absolutely nothing to help working Americans who have sticker \nshock at the gas pump or who will be facing record-high home heating \nprices in a few months. The Bush administration admits that its energy \npolicies include no immediate help for gas prices and no short-term \nsolutions.\n  The NOPEC bill is a unique element of this legislation. It can do \nsomething immediately to help relieve the situation we face every time \nwe fill-up at the pump. We should insist that it be retained, enacted, \nand implemented. I hope that Republican leadership does not demand this \nprovision be removed but that if it does, the Senate stands firm on \nbehalf of the American people. We should not squander this opportunity \nto address the real concerns of the American public.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Bond-Levin \namendment regarding CAFE standards, and I want to explain my views in \ndetail. Fuel efficiency is a critically important issue for our \ncountry, for my home State of Wisconsin, and for our future. I remain \ncommitted to the goal that significant improvements in automobile and \nlight truck fuel efficiency can be achieved over an appropriate time \nframe. My vote for the Levin-Bond is entirely consistent with that \ngoal.\n  The Levin-Bond amendment seeks to renew the Department of \nTransportation's role in setting CAFE standards, acting through the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA. If Congress does \nnot act to try to restore normalcy to the NHTSA process, we will keep \nhaving these fights which Congress attempts to either block or set CAFE \nstandards, every 20 years or so, when the political will is sufficient \nto do so. NHTSA will never be able to carry out the normal process of \nreviewing and incrementally improving fuel efficiency for automobiles \nand light trucks, as Congress\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\noriginally intended when it passed the CAFE law in the 1970s.\n  Both interest groups battling over the CAFE issue, the auto \nmanufacturers and the environmental community, have switched their \npositions in this debate on this bill over the past several years. The \nauto industry, which once wanted CAFE perpetually frozen with a rider \nto an appropriations bill, now supports the Levin amendment. The \nenvironmental community, which once opposed the rider and wanted NHTSA \nto act, now wants Congress to set the standard rather than NHTSA. With \nmy vote, I am maintaining my consistent position on this issue.\n  As I stated on the Senate floor in the debate on the CAFE rider on \nJune 15, 2000, my vote was about ``Congress getting out of the way and \nletting a Federal agency meet the requirements of Federal law \noriginally imposed by Congress.'' I supported removing the rider back \nin 2000 because I was concerned that Congress has for more than 5 years \nblocked NHTSA from meeting its legal duty to evaluate whether there is \na need to modify fuel economy standards.\n  As I made clear in 2000, 2002, 2003 and many other previous debates \non this issue, I have made no determination about what fuel economy \nstandards should be, though I do think that an increase is possible. \nNHTSA has the authority to set new standards for a given model year, \ntaking into account several factors; technological feasibility, \neconomic practicability, other vehicle standards such as those for \nsafety and environmental performance, the need to conserve energy, and \nthe recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. I want NHTSA \nto fully and fairly evaluate all the criteria, and then make an \nobjective recommendation on the basis of those facts. I expect NHTSA to \nconsult with all interested parties--unions, environmental interests, \nauto manufacturers, and other interested citizens--in developing this \nrule. And, I expect NHTSA to act, and if it does not, this amendment \nrequires Congress to act on a standard.\n  In opposing the Levin-Bond amendment, some subscribe to the view that \nNHTSA has a particular agenda and will recommend weak standards. I do \nnot support that view.\n  NHTSA should be allowed to set this standard. Congress is not the \nbest forum for understanding whether or not improvements in fuel \neconomy can and should be made using existing technologies or whether \nemerging technologies may have the potential to improve fuel economy. \nChanges in fuel economy standards could have a variety of consequences. \nI seek to understand those consequences and to balance the concerns of \nthose interested in seeing improvements to fuel economy as a means of \nreducing gasoline consumption and associated pollution.\n  In the end, I would like to see that Wisconsin consumers, indeed all \nconsumers, have a wide range of new, more fuel efficient automobiles, \nSUVs, and trucks available to them, taking into account all appropriate \nenergy, technological and economic factors. That balancing is required \nby the law. I expect NHTSA to proceed in a manner consistent with the \nlaw by fully considering all those factors, and this amendment ensures \nthey do so.\n  In supporting this amendment, I maintain the position that it is my \njob to ensure that the agency responsible for setting fuel economy be \nallowed to do its job. I expect it to be fair and neutral in that \nprocess, and I will work with interested Wisconsinites to ensure that \ntheir views are represented and that the regulatory process proceeds in \na fair and reasonable manner toward whatever conclusions the merits \nwill support.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an important \ninnovative in manufacturing related to America's needs for clean, \nreliable, and affordable energy that is important for national \nsecurity, American jobs, and our competitiveness in the global \nmarketplace.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, we are fortunate to have a \ncompetitive manufacturing industry representing several sectors from \npharmaceuticals to fire safety to paper products to refining. Virginia \nis also fortunate to have a strong base of smaller, progressive \ncompanies that are producing products that help America achieve cleaner \nair standards and decrease our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  One such company advancing these priorities is Afton Chemical located \nin Richmond, VA. Founded in 1921, Afton is a full-service global \npetroleum additives supplier. It has a strong commitment to innovative \ntechnology and world-class research. It operates a state-of-the-art \nresearch facility in Richmond and a European research and test facility \nin Bracknell, Berkshire, England. It has manufacturing facilities \nworldwide.\n  Afton develops, manufactures, blends, and delivers chemical additives \nthat enhance the performance of petroleum products. One of these \nadditives, MMT, is an organic-based fuel additive designed to boost \noctane levels in gasoline. MMT is used commercially in the United \nStates and throughout the world. The product is added into fuel at very \nsmall concentrations.\n  MMT provides refiners with an economical octane improver. MMT \nachieves emission reductions by lessening the degree to which a barrel \nof crude oil has to be processed to make a gallon of gasoline. Because \nless refining is needed, fewer emissions are emitted to the air. Those \nfewer emissions include greenhouse gas emissions. Because less refining \nper barrel of crude is needed, a barrel of oil goes a lot further; \nthereby increasing refinery capacity.\n  In fact, refinery studies have shown that MMT, if used in all \ngasoline in the United States, would save up to 30 million barrels a \nyear of crude oil, reducing our dependence on foreign oil. At today's \ncrude oil prices, that is nearly $2 billion per year. Because refiners \nusing MMT operate under less severe conditions, refinery emissions of \ngreenhouse gases can also be reduced by millions of tons per year.\n  Now, more than ever, with high gasoline prices and greater dependence \non foreign oil from unstable countries, we need products that help \nconserve oil and result in more efficient refining of oil. Afton \nChemical has made production of cleaner burning fuel additives a \npriority. And because of their efforts in this area, I applaud their \nefforts in increasing energy efficiencies.\n  I am proud of all the companies in Virginia, like Afton, that are \ninnovating to find solutions for more efficient, cleaner burning, and \nless toxic fuels for America's energy needs. Whether these companies \nare producing MMT or biodiesel made from home-grown Virginia soybeans, \ninnovators from the Commonwealth are creating energy solutions to \nstrengthen our national security, create new jobs and save current ones \nand most importantly, increase our competitiveness in the global \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I joined my colleagues in voting for \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005 which passed the Senate by a vote 85 to \n12. This legislation is not perfect, but it is a bipartisan framework \nthat offers the basis of a comprehensive and balanced plan to address \nthe energy needs of our country.\n  This bill takes important steps in shifting our dependence away from \nforeign oil. It spurs the development of renewable sources--biodiesel, \nwind, solar, and geothermal. Importantly, the Senate-passed bill \ncontains a national renewable portfolio standard, requiring utilities \nto generate at least 10 percent of their electricity from renewable \nenergy sources by 2020. The legislation also requires that we quadruple \nthe amount of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, used annually in \ngasoline. Furthermore, this bill advances conservation by promoting \nenergy-efficient homes and appliances, fuel cell vehicles, hybrid \nvehicles, and alternative fuel vehicles.\n  Among my greatest disappointments, however, is the Senate's failure \nto adopt the McCain-Lieberman climate stewardship amendment to \nestablish an effective domestic program to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and the Kerry-Biden resolution to return the United States \nto its leadership role in the global deliberations on climate change. \nWe have to be creative and to recognize the many different ways we can \nbegin to make real progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with \nthe goal of stabilizing the still-growing human impact on our climate. \nBy not adopting these amendments, the Senate missed the chance to get \nback on the right side of history.\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\n  Although I supported passage of this bill before us today, I have \ngrave concerns about what may be brought back to the Senate after final \nnegotiations with the House of Representatives. If certain provisions \nin the House-passed Energy bill, including those that permit leasing \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas development, are in \nthe conference report, I will not support passage of the bill. If the \nconference report steals from these new investments in renewable energy \nand diverts even more taxpayer dollars to oil companies, when this week \noil is at $60 a barrel, I will not support passage of the bill. We have \nseen comprehensive energy policy legislation doomed in the past when \nthose negotiating the final bill have sacrificed the long-term \ninterests that we all share for shortsighted special interests. I urge \nmy colleagues to preserve the progress toward energy independence \npromised in the bipartisan bill passed today.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy bill. \nThis country needs a coherent policy to meet the growing demand for \nenergy that comes with economic growth. America needs a supply of \naffordable, reliable energy. We need an Energy bill that will give us \nlower prices, a cleaner environment, greater consumer protection and I \nbelieve this current version of the Senate Energy bill does just that.\n  We in Congress have had an opportunity to craft a far-reaching and \nprogressive energy policy for this country. I believe we owe it to the \nAmerican people to put together a well balanced plan that meets the \nneeds of everyone, consumers and industry alike, instead of playing \nfavorites and leaving the taxpayers with the bill. Unlike the House \nversion, I am pleased that the Senate version of the Energy bill does \nnot give the makers of the gasoline additive MTBE liability protection \nfrom environmental lawsuits. In the past MTBE has been a very \ncontentious issue in the Energy bill, but I am optimistic that the \nSenate and House can garner an agreement on the MTBE provision. .\n  I support alternative energy development and I believe this \nlegislation provides the necessary incentives for the development of \nalternative forms of energy. The bill protects the economic and \nenvironmental health of our country by encouraging the use of \nalternative power sources, including solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen, \ngeothermal, and other renewable energy resources. By including a ten \npercent Renewable Portfolio Standard for utilities, the Senate took a \nbold step toward the promotion of clean, sustainable energy. I have \nlong believed that our Nation must implement a sensible national energy \npolicy which emphasizes greater energy conservation and efficiency, as \nwell as the development of renewable resources.\n  Recent events in the Middle East, coupled with the environmental \nproblems associated with the use of fossil fuels, have only increased \nthe need for such a comprehensive policy. Simply put, we cannot \ncontinue to rely on imported oil to meet such a large part of our \nNation's energy needs. This dependence places our economic security at \ngreat risk. At present, petroleum imports account for fully one-half of \nour national oil use and one-third of our trade deficit. In addition, \nthe use of oil and other fossil fuels contributes to global climate \nchange, air pollution, and acid rain. For these reasons I supported a \nstrong ethanol mandate in the bill, to help improve our energy \nindependence and help clean the environment.\n  This legislation, which I voted for, is not the perfect answer for \nsolving our energy problems in this county. Few pieces of legislation \nthat we vote on are, but I believe this legislation takes the right \nsteps in helping our country move toward a more self-sufficient and \nwell balanced society for our energy needs.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, the provisions in the Energy bill will \ngreatly improve the ability of electricity transmission operators to \nensure the reliability of our grid, especially with the help of new \ntechnologies.\n  I want to make the Department of Energy and Federal Government aware \nthat there is a company in my State that currently provides independent \nreal-time energy information. This company's patented technology \ncollects power supply information using a network of remote, wireless \ndevices to monitor multiple points on the transmission grid. This \ninformation is provided to utilities, Federal agencies, and others \nresponsible for monitoring our critical energy infrastructure and the \nmarkets associated with that infrastructure. I applaud them for their \ningenuity and efforts to further increase the reliability of our \nelectricity transmission grid.\n  It is my understanding that the Federal Government is looking at \ndeveloping monitoring technology similar to the technology of other \ncompanies such as the one in my State and other States. I want to \nimplore to the Department of Energy and other Federal Government \nagencies to not choke out these new innovations already being developed \nand deployed in the private marketplace. I ask that the Federal \nGovernment consider the new technologies already commercially deployed \nwhen examining the role the Federal Government should play when \ndeveloping these new abilities.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the energy bill. I am \npleased to say that I support this bill.\n  The bill includes provisions that will help develop new energy \nsources and technologies, encourage conservation and increased energy \nefficiency, improve the reliability of our electricity system, and \naddress the challenge of climate change. I think that it should go \nfurther in some respects--particularly in making us less dependent on \nforeign oil. But overall, it represents a step in the right direction.\n  First, I want to discuss several provisions that I think are \nextremely important in helping us develop new energy sources and \ntechnologies. It is true that in the coming decades we will continue to \nrely heavily on traditional energy resources such as fossil fuels to \nheat and light our homes and power our cars. But there are new sources \nof energy and new energy technologies that offer great potential to \nhelp us meet many of these needs. We need to move beyond fossil fuels, \nand that goal must be a top priority of our national energy policy.\n  Hydrogen fuels cells are clearly one of the energy technologies that \noffer great promise. I am extremely pleased that the bill includes the \nmajor provisions of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Act of 2005 \nthat I have worked on for years with Senator Dorgan. This ambitious \nlegislation authorizes significant funding for hydrogen research and \ndevelopment and sets aggressive goals for the deployment of hydrogen \ntechnologies. The research and development components authorize $3.75 \nbillion over the next 5 years for work on hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen \npowered automobiles, and a nation-wide fueling infrastructure. But in \naddition to funding, the legislation sets ambitious goals for \ndeployment of fuel cells in transportation: 100,000 hydrogen-fueled \nvehicles on the road in the United States by 2010, and 2.5 million on \nthe road by 2020.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes significant provisions to \npromote the development of renewable energy. It includes an extension \nof the wind production tax credit, which is critical to the continued \ndeployment of windmills to generate electricity in New York and across \nthe country. In addition, I am extremely pleased that the Senate \nadopted an amendment that I cosponsored to put a renewable portfolio \nstandard into place. Under the amendment offered by Senator Bingaman, \nelectricity producers will need to increase gradually the percentage \ngenerated from renewable sources to 10 percent by the year 2020. This \nis an important step forward, and I think it is critical that we retain \nthis provision in conference.\n  In addition, the bill includes provisions to help us continue to \ndevelop clean coal technology. Coal is by no means new, but it is \nincredibly abundant here in the United States, and needs to continue to \nbe a cornerstone of our future energy policy. Continued investment in \nclean coal technology not only offers the promise of new, clean coal \nplants here in the United States; it also means the development of \ntechnology that we can export. To accomplish these goals, the bill \nincludes a Clean Coal Power Initiative that will provide $200 million \nannually for clean coal research into coal-based gasification and \ncombustion technologies.\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n  During Senate debate on the Energy bill, an amendment that \nestablishes a renewable fuels standard was added to the bill. I \nstrongly believe that ethanol has a role to play in helping to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil, and the renewable fuels amendment \ncontains elements that I support. For example, the renewables fuels \nstandard provides incentives for the development of cellulosic ethanol, \nsomething that has the potential to be produced economically in New \nYork. In fact, there is an exciting project underway to convert an old \nMiller Brewery in upstate New York to produce ethanol. This project, \nwhich is slated to begin production in the next year, will start with \ncorn as a feedstock, but ultimately plans to use local hardwoods as \nfeedstock. After extracting sugars from the wood, the chips would then \nbe available as a raw material to pulp and paper mills in the area. The \nrenewable fuels amendment can help to move this technology and this \nproject along.\n  In spite of these and other positive aspects of the renewable fuels \namendment, I could not support it as a whole because I believe it will \nlead to higher gasoline prices for New York consumers. In addition, I \nam concerned that unless measures are adopted to address the increased \nevaporative emissions caused by blending ethanol in gasoline, the \namendment will make it more difficult for New York to reduce smog to \nmeet the new federal health standards.\n  In addition to provisions to promote new energy sources, the bill \nincludes excellent conservation and energy efficiency measures, which \nare the fastest and most lasting way to reduce our energy consumption. \nFor example, the bill sets new efficiency standards for appliances and \nprojects such as commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-\nfreezers, battery chargers, distribution transformers and commercial \nclothes washers. According to the American Council for an Energy \nEfficient Economy, these efficiency provisions, along with the others \nin the bill, will save 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and \nreduce peak electric demand by 50,000 megawatts by the year 2020. This \nreduction in peak demand means that we will eliminate the need to build \n170 300 megawatt power plants. We need to retain these strong measures \nin conference.\n  While the bill does not go as far as I would like in terms of \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil, it does contain a provision \nthat would reduce U.S. oil consumption by 1 million barrels of oil per \nday by 2015. It is critical that we retain this provision in \nconference.\n  As we approach the second anniversary of the August 2003 blackout, it \nis unbelievable to me that Congress has not yet adopted the top \nrecommendation of the blackout task force--passing mandatory, \nenforceable reliability standards. I am pleased that this Energy bill \ncontains these standards, but if the legislation stalls, then I will \npush for a stand-alone bill to put these standards in place, as I have \nin the past.\n  The Energy bill also includes legislation that I recently introduced \nas cosponsored with Senator Voinovich. The legislation would create a \ngrant program at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to promote \nthe reduction of diesel emissions. The bill authorizes $1 billion over \nfive years to help in the retrofitting and replacement of existing \ndiesel engines. This program will help to reduce harmful fine \nparticulate emissions in a cost-effective way. In fact, EPA estimates \nthat diesel retrofits yield $13 of health for every $1 spent on them.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the Senate is now on record in this \nlegislation as supporting a mandatory program to start reducing the \ngreenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change. I \nthink this represents a step forward for the Senate, and I hope that \nthe Senate will follow this sense of the Senate amendment with the \npassage of legislation soon to put such a program in place.\n  This is by no means a perfect bill. I have mentioned some of the \nthings that I think are lacking. But on balance, I think this bill \nrepresents a major step forward. I am pleased to back it.\n  However, as we pass this bill out of the Senate, I have to say that I \nam extremely wary of conference. I was dismayed that the Energy bill \nvoted out by the House this year was even worse than what came out of \nthe House last year. Again, it contains a liability waiver for the \ngasoline additive MTBE. MTBE has contaminated groundwater in New York \nand across the country. According to two new studies, commissioned by \nthe American Water Works Association, AWWA, and the Association of \nMetropolitan Water Agencies, AMWA, the clean-up costs are likely to be \nin the range of $25-$33.2 billion and could be as high as $85 billion \nor more. If this provision is retained in conference, I will have no \nchoice but to again oppose the Energy bill when it comes back from \nconference. In addition, I think it is critical that the many of the \nkey features of the Senate bill--including the renewable portfolio \nstandard and the strong energy efficiency provisions--be retained in \nconference.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nSenate Energy bill. I first want to commend and thank my colleagues, \nthe Senators from New Mexico, for their hard work in getting this bill \nto the floor and ensuring fair debate on these important issues. They \nhave worked tirelessly and in a bipartisan fashion to craft this bill \nand deserve our gratitude.\n  This Nation needs an energy policy that steers us toward energy \nindependence, innovation and conservation. Unfortunately, however, I \nbelieve the bill in the Senate does not embody a sound overall energy \npolicy, and requires a no vote.\n  The American people deserve an energy policy that truly reflects our \nnational priorities and promotes energy independence. An effective \nenergy policy must: reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil; address \nclimate change in a meaningful way; promote energy efficiency through \nfuel efficiency; expand our use of renewable energy sources; and \nprotect the United States Outer Continental Shelf from offshore \ndrilling.\n  Unfortunately, the bill we voted on today inadequately addresses \nthese priorities.\n  We need an aggressive strategy to wean this country off of its \nreliance on foreign sources of energy. But this bill does nothing to \nreduce this Nation's dependence on foreign oil, or provide any relief \nfor the soaring prices at the gas pump. The bill includes an oil \nsavings goal of only one million barrels per day by 2015, and does not \neven provide a mechanism for enforcement. This is unacceptable. It \nwould take savings of three to five million barrels per day to truly \nreduce our energy dependence. I supported the amendment offered by \nSenator Cantwell to reduce imports of foreign oil by 40 percent over \nthe next 20 years. Sadly, the majority of the Senate did not, and that \namendment was not included in this bill.\n  In addition, the bill includes an 8-billion gallon ethanol mandate \nthat will actually increase gas prices for many Americans. The cost of \nliving in New Jersey is already one of the highest in the Nation, and \nthe ethanol mandate will essentially add a new gas tax for New Jersey's \nresidents. Furthermore, although the bill includes a higher renewable \nfuel standard level, this will not necessarily lead to more energy \nsecurity, as its proponents claim. Increasing these levels would not \nsignificantly reduce U.S. oil imports because each gallon of gasoline \nblended with ethanol to make gasohol has less energy in it than regular \ngasoline, requiring increased petroleum product imports to make up that \nenergy loss. Producing ethanol also requires a significant amount of \nfossil fuel. Finally, a larger renewable fuel standard could force the \nexpanded use of ethanol in areas, such as New Jersey, and hinder--\nrather than help--state efforts to attain federal air quality \nstandards.\n  Instead of establishing a national ethanol mandate, we should reduce \nthe Nation's consumption of oil. A simple and cost effective way of \ndoing this, would be to raise CAFE standards. In fact, improving the \nfuel economy of passenger vehicles not only reduces our dependence on \nforeign oil, but cuts global warming emissions and saves consumers \nthousands of dollars annually at the gas pump. Americans currently \nconsume a little over 20 million barrels of oil per day. Senator Durbin \noffered an amendment that would raise fuel economy standards from 27.5 \nto 40 miles per gallon by 2017 for all passenger vehicles and include \nSUVs in\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\nthe passenger vehicle category. The amendment would also increase the \nstandards for pickup trucks and other nonpassenger vehicles from 21 \nmiles per gallon to 27.5 miles per gallon. Raising these standards \nwould save over 95 billion gallons of oil by 2016.\n  The Energy Information Administration projects that if we do nothing \nto raise CAFE standards, by 2020 Americans will be consuming 12 million \nbarrels of oil per day for fuel use alone. If the Durbin amendment were \npassed, however, we would be saving 3 million barrels of oil per day or \na reduction of 25 percent in gasoline consumption by the year 2020. \nFurthermore, if we had implemented the Durbin amendment in 2001, \nAmericans would be saving $5 billion per year at the pump. This is an \naggressive strategy that I feel is not only necessary, but long \noverdue.\n\n  The Senate had an opportunity to make important choices with this \nbill, and if you do a cost-benefit analysis, it is clear the Senate has \nmade many wrong choices. I supported stricter CAFE standards and more \naggressive oil savings, yet these amendments were not included in the \nbill we voted on today.\n  Instead, this bill does include a provision that I strongly opposed, \nthe seismic inventory of the Outer Continental Shelf. I have been very \nclear about my opposition to any provision in this bill that will \nweaken the moratoria on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. As my \ncolleagues know, I spent many hours on the Senate floor last week to \nensure that no amendments were offered to weaken the moratoria. This \nstep onto a slippery slope is only reemphasizing our dependency on oil \nand gas.\n  It is important to note that New Jersey is a State that already does \nits part in supporting energy production and refining for the Nation. \nAlong with traditional power plants, we have three nuclear power \nplants, support siting of an LNG terminal and are looking into \nalternative energy sources. And New Jersey is the East Coast hub for \noil refining. New Jersey is doing its part. New Jersey recognizes the \nvariety of ways to generate energy. It can be done without offshore \ndrilling.\n  Yet this bill includes a provision that would allow an inventory of \nall potential oil and natural gas resources in the entire Outer \nContinental Shelf, including areas off of the New Jersey coast. It is a \nslippery slope toward drilling, which would devastate New Jersey's \nbeautiful beaches as well as its coastal tourism industry, an industry \nthat supports over 800,000 jobs and generates $5.5 billion in revenue. \nAnd the seismic explosions are themselves dangerous to the environment \nand our offshore fisheries.\n  That is why I voted with my Florida colleagues and others to strike \nthe inventory provision from the bill. But that amendment failed. That \nwas the wrong choice. It makes no sense to sacrifice the economies and \nenvironmental sanctity of coastal States for what many energy analysts \nhave said would not end the long-term trend of growing dependency on \nforeign oil. It is the wrong analysis, and the wrong decision and just \none more example of how this Energy bill includes wrong choices.\n  Another problem with the bill before us is that it fails to \neffectively address a crucial issue that is paramount to our health, \nour environment, our economy and our way of life--climate change. The \nscience is increasingly clear that greenhouse gas emissions caused by \nhuman activity are changing the earth's climate. The rest of the \nindustrialized world understands the danger of this problem. Unless \nCongress acts in a meaningful way, the effects of global warming may be \ndevastating to the worldwide economy and environment. Recognition by \nthe Senate that global warming is indeed a problem is a first step. \nHowever, we cannot stop here. I supported an amendment to ensure real, \nimmediate action on global warming. This amendment would require a \nreduction in carbon dioxide emission levels to 2000 levels by the year \n2010. But, this important program is not included in this bill. This is \na significant failure and misses the opportunity to address a problem \nthat, without quick action, we will pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Finally, the underlying bill gives the Federal Government too much \nauthority over the siting of liquefied natural gas terminals in their \ncommunities. I am very supportive of the proposed terminal in South \nJersey, which is projected to provide energy to 4 to 5 million \nresidences. Unfortunately, the State of Delaware has hampered the \nsiting of this facility. These complications, however, do not justify \nceding authority over New Jersey's choices about its energy supply to \nWashington. I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass an \namendment that would ensure States have authority over LNG terminal \nsiting.\n  As you can see, I have many concerns about this bill. But there are \nsome provisions that are steps in the right direction. The Senate \nincluded an amendment, which I supported, that requires a 10 percent \nrenewable portfolio standard. I am proud that New Jersey is one of the \nfirst States to adopt its own 20 percent portfolio standard, and I am \npleased that the rest of the Nation will take a step to follow with \nthis important effort to expand renewable energy sources. In addition, \nthis bill includes important tax incentives that promote energy \nefficiency. I am especially pleased that I was able to secure \nprovisions in the energy efficiency title that encourage the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development and the public housing authorities it \noversees to increase energy efficiency in public housing projects.\n  But these provisions are not enough to plug the weaknesses left in \nthis bill. I voted this bill out of committee with the hopes that by \nbringing it to the Senate floor, my colleagues and I could greatly \nimprove the bill. The committee markup was a fair and bipartisan \nprocess, and I was pleased to be a part of it. But if the goal is to \ncreate a comprehensive energy policy that will move this Nation in a \ndirection of energy security and independence, then the bill we voted \non today in the Senate will not achieve that goal. It is my hope that \nthis bill will be improved in the conference committee, and I urge my \ncolleagues to take these important issues into account as we move \nforward.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to say \na few words about the Energy Policy Act of 2005, H.R. 6. While I did \nnot support the bill for several reasons, I do acknowledge that the \nbill is, in many respects, better than the bill the Senate rejected in \n2003. I am pleased, for example, that the bill we are sending to \nconference does more to address the reliability of our electricity \ngrid, contains a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard for \nelectricity production, and does not include an unnecessary liability \nwaiver for the MTBE industry.\n  We all agree that reliable, affordable energy is critical to the \neconomic well being of our Nation. And increasingly, our Nation's \nenergy policy is central to our national security. As I considered how \nto vote on the energy bill, I asked myself three questions. First, \nwould this bill take meaningful action to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil? Second, would the bill enhance homeland security? And \nthird, is this $48 billion bill fiscally responsible and does it set \nthe right priorities for our Nation?\n  As for the first question, unfortunately, I find that this bill does \nnot do nearly enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Oil prices have recently soared to around $60 a barrel, a level that, \neven when adjusted for inflation, has not been seen in over 15 years. \nImports of foreign oil are draining valuable economic resources out of \nour communities and Nation. The U.S. imports 4.5 billion barrels of oil \nper year. With prices up $20 a barrel over the past year, an increase \nthat appears to be with us for the foreseeable future, we are \nexperiencing an effective annual reduction in domestic income of $90 \nbillion. That is $90 billion that we could better invest in energy \nefficiency and renewable energy, as well as police, firefighters, \nworkforce training, and education for our children.\n  Over the next 10 years the world's daily energy demand will grow to \nnearly 100 million barrels. We will have to find an extra 50 million \nbarrels of oil per day to meet that demand. The industry is already \nspending $200 billion a year to find oil, but even at that \nextraordinary level of investment, there are enormous difficulties in \nfinding recoverable reserves to fill the gap between supply and demand. \nThe United States has about 2 percent of the\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\nworld's oil reserves. We simply cannot drill our way out of this \ncrisis.\n  Reducing our dependence on oil must be both a national energy and a \nnational security priority. But that is not a high priority of this \nEnergy bill. This bill fails to promote meaningful reductions in our \noil dependence by casting aside a much-needed increase in CAFE \nstandards for cars and by omitting Senator Cantwell's 40 percent oil \nsavings amendment.\n  According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, since 1975 the U.S. has \ndoubled the economic activity wrung from each barrel of oil. Overall \nenergy savings, worth about $365 billion in 2000 alone, are effectively \nthe Nation's biggest and fastest-growing major energy source--\nequivalent to three times our total oil imports. CAFE standards were a \nprimary reason for these savings. We must make even greater strides in \nfuel efficiency if we want to move our country towards true energy \nindependence.\n  Gasoline consumption in the transportation sector represents about 44 \npercent of total oil consumption in the United States each year. If one \nincludes diesel fuel, that number jumps to 57 percent. To bring about \nany serious reduction in our dependence on foreign oil we must increase \nthe fuel efficiency of our cars and light trucks through an increase in \nCAFE standards, as well as by promoting the use of hybrids and vehicles \nthat use alternative fuels. In model year 2002, the average fuel \neconomy for cars and light trucks was 20.4 miles per gallon--a 22-year \nlow. Yet, if performance and weight had stayed constant since 1981, the \naverage fuel economy would have improved 33 percent--enough to displace \nthe amount of oil we import from the Persian Gulf 2.5 times over. Not \nonly will raising CAFE standards improve our energy security, it will \nalso ensure our economic security. China is putting in place fuel \nefficiency rules that will be significantly more stringent than those \nin the United States. The Chinese standards call for new cars, vans, \nand sport utility vehicles to get as much as two miles a gallon of fuel \nmore in 2005 than the average required in the U.S. and about five miles \nmore in 2008. And they plan to export these cars to the United States. \nWe need to improve efficiency to remain competitive.\n  For these reasons, I am an original cosponsor of S. 889, Senator \nFeinstein's bill to close the SUV loophole by gradually increasing fuel \nefficiency standards for SUVs to 27.5 miles per gallon--the same \nstandard that now applies to passenger cars--by 2011. The legislation \nwould also require that the average fuel economy of new vehicles \npurchased by the Federal Government be increased by three miles per \ngallon by 2008 and six miles per gallon by 2011. In addition, the bill \nwould increase the weight range within which vehicles are bound by CAFE \nstandards, making it harder for automotive manufacturers to build SUVs \ntoo big to be regulated by CAFE standards. The legislation would save \nthe United States 1 million barrels of oil a day; reduce our dependence \non foreign oil imports by 10 percent; prevent about 240 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide--the top greenhouse gas and the biggest single cause of \nglobal warming--from entering the atmosphere each year; and save SUV \nand light duty truck owners hundreds of dollars each year in gasoline \ncosts. It is unfortunate that the Senate energy bill includes no \nprovision to require increased CAFE standards so that we can make real \nprogress in reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Moving to my second question: would this bill enhance our homeland \nsecurity? Unfortunately, it would not.\n  Consumption of natural gas is growing at a faster rate than for any \nother primary energy source and is growing in all sectors of the \neconomy--families heat their homes with natural gas, businesses use \nnatural gas to produce products, natural gas vehicles are becoming more \ncommon, and power producers generate cleaner energy with it. According \nto the Consumer Federation of America, since 2000, the toll of higher \nnatural gas prices on consumers is an estimated $80 billion. Similar to \noil, demand is growing faster than available supplies can be delivered \nand the tightening in supply is resulting in dramatic price volatility. \nOne way to increase natural gas supply in the United States is through \nliquefied natural gas, known as LNG. Again, however, we would do well \nto learn from our lessons with oil. One-third of the world's proven \nreserves of natural gas are in the Middle East, nearly two-fifths are \nin Russia and its former satellites, and significant reserves exist in \nNigeria and Algeria. Political stability and terrorism are very real \nthreats to the reliability of natural gas from these countries.\n  On the domestic front, the siting of liquefied natural gas, LNG, \nimport terminals is an issue that has taken on critical importance for \nme and for the people of Rhode Island in recent months, as the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, FERC, is now considering proposals by \nKeySpan Energy and Weaver's Cove Energy to establish LNG import \nterminals in Providence, RI and Fall River, MA, respectively.\n  I recognize that natural gas is an important and growing component of \nNew England and the Nation's energy supply, and that imported LNG \noffers a promising new supply source to complement our domestic natural \ngas supplies. In a post-September 11 world, however, we must consider \nthe substantial safety and security risks associated with siting LNG \nmarine terminals in urban communities and requiring LNG tankers to pass \nwithin close proximity to miles of densely populated coastline.\n  That is the major problem with the current siting process and with \nthe underlying bill before us. While States do have certain \nenvironmental permitting authorities delegated to them under Federal \nlaws like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Coastal Zone \nManagement Act, States have no clear authority over the siting of LNG \nterminals in the one area that everyone is most concerned about: public \nsafety and security.\n  Senator Feinstein and I offered an amendment that would have ensured \nthat States have an authentic voice in the siting of LNG terminals by \ngiving Governors the same authority to approve or disapprove onshore \nterminals that they now have over offshore terminals under the \nDeepwater Port Act. If a Governor has the right to say yes or no to an \noffshore LNG terminal, it only makes sense that he or she should have \nthe same rights with respect to an LNG terminal located onshore or in \nState waters. The National Governors Association agreed and wrote in \nstrong support of our amendment.\n  I know that some of the opponents of this amendment say this is all \nabout NIMBY, or ``Not in My Backyard,'' as if the issue is that our \nconstituents would just rather not have to see these storage tanks and \nlarge vessels. But it is a much more serious and complicated matter \nthan that.\n  The Sandia National Laboratory released a report last December that \nsaid a terror attack on a tanker delivering LNG to a U.S. terminal \ncould set off a fire so hot it would burn skin and damage buildings \nnearly a mile away. For the terminals proposed in New England, that \nmeans schools, libraries, and thousands of homes, all within the damage \nzone. We can argue about the odds of such an attack, but when new LNG \nterminals are already being developed nearby in the Canadian maritime \nprovinces--an area with reliable pipeline access to New England--and \nthe first U.S. offshore LNG facility recently began receiving \ndeliveries, there is no justification for placing these terminals in \nthe heart of our communities.\n  I again want to emphasize that I recognize LNG's important role in \nthe energy infrastructure of Rhode Island and the Nation, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to ensure reliable supplies of \nnatural gas to our homes and businesses. I am disappointed that the \nFeinstein-Reed amendment was defeated, but our efforts have just begun. \nFor now, I hope the 45 votes the amendment received will send a strong \nmessage to FERC that the agency should work more closely with Governors \nand the State environmental and first responder agencies that have \nfirsthand knowledge of the geography and population of our States, so \nthat we can bring more natural gas to our communities while minimizing \nthe risk to our citizens.\n  Finally, we must ask ourselves, is the $48 billion cost of this bill \nfiscally responsible given our growing national debt and cuts in \nfunding for other priorities such as education, water infrastructure, \nand transit? For me, the answer is no.\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\n  Over 11 years, this bill would provide $18.2 billion in energy tax \nincentives for electricity infrastructure, fossil fuels supply, energy \nefficiency, renewables, and vehicle and fuel incentives. I want to \ncommend the Finance Committee for its work on the energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy incentives in the bill. However, I am disappointed \nthat the bill provides nearly $6 billion in tax breaks for oil, gas, \nand coal, and in addition, provides tax credits for nuclear energy. \nThese tax breaks are provided despite the fact that President Bush has \nrepeatedly stated that we do not need tax breaks for the oil and gas \nindustry given the high prices Americans are experiencing.\n  Regrettably, this Energy bill also contains the Archer Daniels \nMidland ethanol mandate. In 2003, the United States consumed only 2.8 \nbillion gallons of ethanol. But starting in 2006, the Energy bill will \nrequire Americans to purchase 4 billion gallons of ethanol, then 8 \nbillion gallons by 2012, and then increasing amounts every year after \n2012 in perpetuity by a percentage equivalent to the proportion of \nethanol in the entire U.S. gas supply. So in addition to the already \nhigh gas prices Americans are paying at the pump, they will now be \ncharged a tax to unnecessarily subsidize the ethanol industry, which \nalready benefits from an income tax credit of 51 cents per gallon of \npure ethanol, as well as a 54 cents per gallon tariff on imported \nethanol.\n  The bill also provides loan guarantees for so-called innovative \ntechnologies, including nuclear power, a provision that would cost \ntaxpayers $600 million. The legislation sets no limits on the number of \nprojects, or the total principal that could be guaranteed for these \nspeculative investments. As the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \npoints out, if a borrower defaults on a loan, the Department of Energy \ncould take over a facility to recoup losses, or the Department could \ntake over a loan and make payments on the loan for the borrower. To \nquote the CBO, ``Such payments could result in DOE effectively \nproviding a direct loan with as much as a 100 percent subsidy rate--\nessentially a grant--that could be used by the borrower to pay off its \ndebt.'' Is this a responsible use of taxpayer dollars when we are \ndramatically cutting funding for education, clean water, and energy \nefficiency programs? In my opinion, the answer is no.\n  I believe the American people deserve a better Energy bill from the \nSenate. They deserve a bill that takes seriously the need to reduce our \ndependency on foreign oil. They deserve a bill that provides for both \nour national security and energy security. They deserve a bill that \nrequires real reductions in the greenhouse gas emissions that cause \nglobal warming. They deserve a bill that reduces energy prices for \nconsumers, not one that hands out unnecessary subsidies to industries. \nUnfortunately, if history is any indicator, this bill is going to get \nworse, not better, in conference with the House. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to oppose the addition of MTBE liability \nwaivers and any other onerous House provisions to the Energy bill. It \nis high time we gave the American people an Energy bill that deserves \ntheir full support.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that the Senate has once again \nproduced an Energy bill that does not serve either the present or \nfuture energy needs of our Nation. The provisions in this bill will not \nmake us less dependent on foreign oil, will not enhance the reliability \nof the Nation's electricity grid, will not effectively promote energy \nefficiency and technological innovation, will not reduce the price of \nenergy to consumers over time, and will not address our significant \ncontribution to the serious problem of global warming.\n  While I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Energy \nCommittee for the bipartisan process they have led throughout the \ndebate, I cannot support the resulting bill. But I do want to \nacknowledge that compared to the last conference report on this issue, \nthe measure before us is somewhat better in some respects and certainly \nmore so than the recently passed House bill. For example, the Senate \nmeasure does include more emphasis on energy efficiency and renewable \ntechnology, doesn't include an MTBE waiver or hand-outs to Hooters, and \na few special interests were left behind, although not enough.\n  However, when the price of gas reaches $3 a gallon, which some \nexperts believe will occur within a year, and more manufacturing jobs \nare lost overseas due to soaring energy costs, and the next blackout \noccurs, and the wait lists for fuel-efficient cars grow even longer, \nand climatic changes increasingly affect American lives and \nlivelihoods, the American public is surely going to judge that this \nCongress did not live up to the great challenge before it by passing a \nsound, far-reaching, national energy policy measure, despite the \nmultiple years in the making. And, as we all know, Congress doesn't \nhave any popularity points to squander at this time. But even more to \nthe point is that we don't have the time to squander, now is the time \nwe need to act to avoid disastrous economic and environmental \nconsequences.\n  I am not spinning a doomsday scenario here, most of my colleagues \nappreciate the uncomfortable fact that these are our present energy \nsupply realities. That is why I believe a more appropriate title for \nthis bill would be ``The Lost Energy and Economic Opportunity Act of \n2005.'' Opportunity lost because as a body we should have the vision \nand the political courage to craft national energy policy that \naddresses the serious energy problems before us with effective, \nidentified solutions that put us on a new course--a more secure, \nreliable, and smarter course. Not the same tired path this bill treads, \nand spending an estimated $16 billion from the Federal Treasury to \nprovide taxpayers' subsidies largely for wealthy energy producers and \ncorporations.\n  With the passage of this bill, we will have lost the historic \nopportunity to craft a national energy policy that relies on the market \nrealities of high priced oil and gas instead of taxpayer subsidies to \ndrive our country in the direction of energy efficiency, security, and \nindependence, as well as global environmental stewardship. It doesn't \nmake fiscal or common sense to provide billions of taxpayer subsidies \nto encourage the production of energy by companies that are already \ngaining tremendous riches at today's sky high oil and gas prices. But \nthis bill does just that--it gives tens of billions of taxpayer dollars \nto the oil, gas, and coal industries. And if this was not sufficient, \nthe bill provides an unlimited number of loan guarantees for the \nconstruction and operation of fossil fuel and nuclear projects far into \nthe future. As such, no one can accurately assess how much this bill \nwill end up costing American taxpayers. We can say with certainty that \nit is many times more expensive than the $6.7 billion that the \nAdministration wanted and even much more costly than the House bill at \n$8 billion. The tax incentives alone in the Senate bill are estimated \nto be more than $14 billion by the Joint Committee on Taxation. \nRemarkable generosity with scarce taxpayer funds.\n\n  My colleagues supporting this bill contend that these taxpayer \nsubsidies are necessary to increase domestic energy supplies and \nprovide incentives for technological innovation. I believe that these \nsubsidies largely amount to a multi-billion-dollar maintenance of the \nstatus quo which will only perpetuate and exacerbate our current \nnational energy and environmental problems for the foreseeable future.\n  Let me be clear. I understand the need to encourage the development \nand deployment of zero and low emission technologies. That is why \nSenator Lieberman and I added a comprehensive technology title to the \nClimate Stewardship and Innovation Act which we offered as an amendment \nlast week. But the incentives provided in our legislation are different \nin many respects from those in the Energy bill.\n  For example, we propose a cost-sharing program with industry for \nfirst-of-a-kind engineering designs of facilities using advanced coal \ngasification, nuclear, and solar technologies as well as large scale \nbiofuel production. Subsequent users of the designs generated under the \nprogram would pay a ``royalty fee'' on a per facility basis which would \nbe used to reimburse the overall costs of the program.\n  Following the design phase, loans or loan guarantees would be allowed \nfor the construction phase of the first facility utilizing advanced \ncoal gasification, nuclear, solar, and large scale\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nbiofuel production technologies. These loans would be repaid at the end \nof the construction phase, and in the case of loan guarantees, the \nguarantees would terminate at the end of the construction phase. This \nis very different from the programs authorized under the base Energy \nbill which provides loan guarantees over the operational life of the \nfacilities. The approach in the underlying bill leaves the taxpayers \nliable for a very long time, 30 years in some cases, as opposed to a \nconstruction period of maybe 5 years in our legislation. And in our \nbill, we envision all assistance would be funded through the revenues \nfrom the early auction of carbon allowances to industry rather than \nentirely from the taxpayers pockets as would be the case in the \nunderlying bill.\n  Instead of our approach, the American public is going to be saddled \nentirely with the expense of this bill, which is running on empty--\nempty of new ideas--and further running up our deficit. The fuel we \nshould be relying on to drive our national energy policy is American \nconsumer demand. If we allowed consumer demand to drive our legislative \nactions, this bill would emphasize energy efficiency across all sectors \nof the economy and include a reasonable and progressive CAFE standard \nfor SUVs and all other passenger vehicles. If it were up to American \nconsumers, we wouldn't be imposing a meaningless 8 billion gallon \nethanol mandate, but instead would be making it possible for people to \nobtain and operate their automobiles using clean and abundant biofuels \nthat actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil and not just provide \nsubsidies to the ethanol producers. If it were to the American public, \nwe would not be repealing the Public Utility Holding Company Act, \nPUHCA, without replacing it with alternative protections for utility \nratepayers, investors, and pension plans. Finally, if it were up to the \nAmerican public, we would pass a bill that addresses global climate \nchange: more than 75 percent of Americans believe that we need to \nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions and participate with our allies and \nother countries in a united effort. And in the process of reducing \nemissions, we would also improve the health of millions of Americans \nwho suffer from asthma and other air quality-related conditions.\n  If these kind of policies were to be found in this bill not only \nwould it satisfy the majority of the American public but it would \nsignificantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil while providing new \njobs and financial benefits to the agricultural sector and a host of \nenergy, technology, and service providers economy-wide. So why aren't \nwe doing that in this bill? Why aren't we seizing the economic and \nenvironmental opportunities that are within our grasp, the available \nsolutions to our current and future energy woes? There must be some \ngood reason that we aren't giving the public what it wants but are \ngiving special interests and rich corporations exactly what they want. \nI will leave that for the supporters of this bill to explain to the \nAmerican public as we continue on our well-worn and convoluted energy \npath leading us no further than where we are right now. Only in the \nfuture, fuel prices will be higher, greenhouse gas emissions will be \ngreater, and our economy, international relations, and environment will \nbe in greater peril.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Senate \nenergy bill that this body has passed today, on a resounding bipartisan \nvote of 85 to 12. For those of us on the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, this day has been long in coming. Today is another \nmilestone in the effort to craft a new energy plan for America; \nlegislation that has been swirling around Capitol Hill in one form or \nanother for at least the last 4 years.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Energy Committee for \nthe skill and consideration they have shown in navigating a path \nforward for this legislation. It has taken a lot of work. But today's \nvote represents a concerted, bipartisan effort to find the compromises \nthat can help move our nation forward on an energy strategy to meet the \nneeds of a 21st century economy. The result has been a cleaner, more \ntransparent process, and a cleaner energy plan for America.\n  I will not stand before this body today and suggest that this \nlegislation is the solution to all of the challenges we are facing--and \nwill continue to face for decades to come--when it comes to our \nnational energy security. There are provisions contained in this \nlengthy and complicated bill that I do not agree with; and there are \nareas where this legislation does not go nearly far enough, \nparticularly when it comes to curbing our dangerous overdependence on \nforeign oil imports, and tackling the emerging threat of global climate \nchange. However, I am supporting this legislation because it represents \na modest improvement on the status quo; and because I believe that this \nlegislation is the beginning--rather than the end--of the Senate's \nconsideration of these issues.\n  I have participated in this debate in the Energy Committee and on the \nSenate floor for the past 4 years, and I have listened intently to many \nof my colleagues and what they have had to say. I can tell you this: it \nseems to me that there is more agreement in this body today than at any \nother point in my memory as to the nature of the energy challenges we \nare facing as a nation, and the critical importance of addressing these \nproblems if we want to ensure American competitiveness and economic \nsecurity in the coming decades.\n  Four years ago, I do not believe many of us were discussing the \nimpact of foreign, state-owned oil companies on our energy security. \nFew of us had recognized the emergence of China and India and what \nthose countries' growing thirst for petroleum could mean to the \ndynamics of world energy markets and the American economy. Many \nSenators were skeptical about the potential market transformation that \ncould occur with new hybrid vehicle technologies. Four years ago, there \nwas far less consensus about the promise of new biofuel technologies \nusing an array of different crops and materials. These technologies are \ncapable of transforming the U.S. renewable fuels business from a \nboutique industry dominated by corn-growers to a real, national \nindustry capable of displacing significant amounts of imported \npetroleum.\n  This Senate has come along way in four years--in thought, if not yet \nin deed. The fact the majority of Senators now recognize the need to \naddress in a meaningful and binding way the threat of global climate \nchange; and the fact that the majority of my colleagues now seem to \nrecognize the perfect storm of economic and national security issues \nposed by our dependence on foreign oil are significant milestones. But \nI am disappointed that we do not yet have the same degree of unanimity \non what to do about it.\n  That is why this legislation--and the debate about this legislation's \nsuccesses and failings--is just the beginning. Our national energy \nsecurity is an issue with which this country and its leaders absolutely \nmust continue to grapple. When it comes to our Nation's oil dependence, \nAmerica can and must make more progress. We must acknowledge the \nrealities of geology and the international marketplace. Given that the \nU.S. sits on just 3 percent of the world's known oil reserves, we \ncannot drill our way to energy independence. And when any policymaker \nlooks at the distribution of where the rest of those oil reserves lie--\ntwo-thirds of them in the Middle East--it becomes painfully obvious \nthat the U.S. must step up and tackle this challenge head-on. Anything \nless jeopardizes our economic future and our national security.\n  I fundamentally believe that securing our Nation's energy future is \namong the biggest challenge faced by our generation. It is a challenge \nby which future generations of Americans will measure us. We did not \nget the job done with this particular Energy bill when it comes to \nAmerica's energy security and dependence on foreign oil. Nor did we \nfinish the job when it comes to the issue of global climate change. So \nthis year, next year and for the foreseeable future, this Senator will \nstand up and ask her colleagues to pay more than lip service to these \nissues. The spirited and thoughtful debate that has characterized our \nconsideration of this bill must guide us as we move forward to tackle \nthese challenges. I believe it can be done. It must be done. And this \nSenator stands ready to work with her colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to reach meaningful\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nsolutions to what are some of the most difficult economic security \nissues of our time.\n  But as I said at the outset, I do believe that this legislation will \nmove our Nation forward in a number of other important ways. A \ncomprehensive Energy bill touches every sector of our economy. The \nnature of our existing energy infrastructure is complex and \ninterdependent, yet regionally diverse. Moreover, a maze of \ninterlocking Federal and State regulatory authorities guide the \nproduction and sale of energy supplies in this country. For all of \nthese reasons, the task of crafting a ``comprehensive'' energy policy \nis a massive undertaking. But even as this legislation has failed to \naddress certain issues to this Senator's satisfaction, we have taken a \nnumber of important steps forward.\n  While we have not done nearly enough to address our economy's \npetroleum dependence--and hence, our dependence on foreign petroleum--\nthis bill does put in place the basics for creation of a robust, \nAmerican biofuels industry that can someday displace significant \nportions of our energy imports. While agricultural producers across the \nU.S. have long touted the energy and economic security benefits of \nfostering a domestic biofuels production industry, this country has \nnevertheless lagged behind in developing the technologies that would \nmake a national biofuels strategy a reality. For example, 90 percent of \nthe ethanol production in the U.S. is derived from corn and is produced \nin just five Midwestern States. Meanwhile, other nations such as Brazil \nhave taken the lead on producing biofuels from other crops, and in the \nprocess have diversified their economies and energy supplies, begun to \nminimize their dependence on foreign petroleum, and lowered prices for \nconsumers.\n\n  The key to growing this industry for the U.S. is investing in the \ndemonstration and commercialization of new technologies that will make \nit possible to produce biofuels from a more diverse array of crops, \nincluding wheat straw and other biomass readily available in places \nlike Washington State.\n  The Senate Energy bill contains a number of provisions key to moving \nforward on a national biofuels strategy. Specifically, I was pleased to \nadd a number of measures that will help spur biofuels production in the \nPacific Northwest. Making ethanol and biodiesel from more diverse \nfeedstocks--in more regions of the country--is essential to making \nbiofuels a sustainable and cost-effective solution to our Nation's \nemerging energy needs.\n  The Senate Energy bill contains a provision I authored to establish \nan ``Advanced Biofuel Technologies Program.'' The new program provides \n$550 million over 5 years to demonstrate technologies for production of \nethanol and biodiesel. The measure directs the Secretary of Energy to \nwork toward developing and demonstrating no fewer than four different \nconversion technologies for producing cellulosic-based ethanol; and \nfive technologies for coproducing biodiesel and value-added \nbioproducts. In other words, it would provide Federal support for \nuniversities, private sector researchers and entrepreneurs who are \nstriving to invent the next generation of biofuels technology, and help \ndemonstrate them in real-world applications. The program also directs \nthe Secretary to prioritize the demonstration of proj-\nects that will enhance the geographical diversity of alternative fuels \nproduction, and focus on developing technology related to feedstocks \nthat represent 10 percent or less of our Nation's existing ethanol and \nbiodiesel production--agricultural products like wheat straw, canola \nand mustard that are readily available in Washington State and \nthroughout the Pacific Northwest.\n  But in addition to pioneering the next generation of technologies, \nthe Senate Energy bill would provide important market-based incentives \nfor the very first producers of new sources of biofuel. The Senate bill \nis more ambitious that previous energy bills, as well as this year's \nHouse-passed version, in setting a target to produce 8 billion gallons \nof renewable fuel by 2012. But in addition, it contains my provision to \nmore than double the incentives for refiners to use ethanol made from \ncellulosic sources such as wheat straw, and to ensure that by 2013 the \nU.S. is producing at least 250,000 gallons of ethanol from these new \nsources. These provisions are designed to help build a market for the \nvery first producers of ethanol from nontraditional, noncorn sources--\nan important way to help move the technology toward broader \ncommercialization.\n  The Senate Energy bill also recognizes that a national biofuels \nstrategy is in the long-term energy security interests of the U.S., and \nprovides Federal support for this emerging industry. First, the \nlegislation authorizes Federal loan guarantees for the first cellulosic \nethanol facilities that produce 15 million gallons of ethanol or more. \nMultiple sites in the Pacific Northwest are vying to be among the first \nin the U.S. to produce cellulosic ethanol. In addition, the bill would \nextend the biodiesel excise tax credit through 2010. Otherwise slated \nto expire in 2006, the tax credit is important to the very first \nrefiners and distributors of biodiesel in Washington State, who are \nusing this tax credit to lower costs to consumers at the pump. I \nbelieve all of these are valuable provisions that will contribute to \nour national energy security and put farmers across the country in the \nbiofuels business.\n  In addition to the renewable fuels standard, this legislation will \ndiversify our Nation's energy supplies with the inclusion of a \nrenewable portfolio standard that would require 10 percent of our \nelectricity to come from sources such as wind, solar and geothermal. \nThis legislation also extends the renewable production tax credit and \nthe renewable energy production incentive program to support the drive \nto diversify our sources of electricity.\n  I should also note that this legislation contains consensus \nreliability standards, to ensure mandatory rules are in place to govern \noperation of our electricity grid--an important provision that I have \nchampioned since I arrived in the Senate, and an effort that was \ninitially begun by my predecessor, Senator Slade Gorton.\n  I was also pleased to have a role in crafting provisions to promote \ncutting-edge research and development in the area of ``smart grid'' \ntechnologies, which will build intelligence into our existing energy \ninfrastructure in a way that improves both efficiency and reliability. \nThis legislation also includes incentives for the adoption of existing \ntechnologies that can aid reliability such as ``smart meters,'' which \ngive utilities and their customers real-time information about energy \nusage.\n  This legislation also takes an important step to ensure that we are \nmeeting the workforce needs of the electric utility sector. The \nNational Science Foundation and energy industry interests have noted \nthat as the baby boom sector of our workforce retires, a lack of \ntraining capacity will lead to a growing shortage of qualified \nengineers and innovators. Language that I worked to add to the bill in \ncommittee will ensure that the Energy and Labor Secretaries are closely \nmonitoring our energy workforce, including the availability of power \nand transmission engineers, and will authorize the Federal Government \nto provide grants for appropriate workforce training investments. All \nof these reliability-related provisions will help ensure the stability \nof the electricity grid, which powers every sector of the American \neconomy.\n  While I am on the topic of electricity, I must mention some of what I \nbelieve are among the most notable achievements of this legislation. \nThere are provisions of this bill that I have championed related to \nEnron and the market manipulation that occurred during the Western \nenergy crisis, which I believe represent the first meaningful \nCongressional response to the massive public mugging that took place. \nCertainly, Congress enacted aggressive new accounting reforms in the \nwake of Enron's collapse. But we have not yet done the same when it \ncomes to our Federal energy laws.\n  I spoke at the outset about how the Senate has at least turned the \ncorner in recognizing the problems posed by climate change and foreign \noil dependence. Similarly, some of my colleagues may recall that, 4 \nyears ago, many at first didn't believe that any market manipulation \nhad taken place in the West. But with the release of Enron's smoking \ngun memos outlining the manipulation schemes, additional audiotape \nevidence that has surfaced since\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nthen, the guilty pleas of energy traders who executed these schemes \nfour years later, this Senate has reevaluated its position, based on \nfacts that are now a matter of public record.\n  I am optimistic about the notion that this Senate, in the foreseeable \nfuture, will get serious about addressing climate change and oil \ndependence because I have seen a sea change occur in the Senate on an \nenergy issue before--in particular, on the issue of market manipulation \nand the need to protect our Nation's consumers against later-day \nEnrons. The Energy bill we passed today contained a number of important \nprovisions to incorporate the lessons we learned from the Western \nenergy crisis.\n  First, it puts in place a broad statutory ban on all forms of market \nmanipulation in our Nation's electricity and natural gas markets. \nSecond, it gives Federal authorities the ability to ban traders and \nexecutives implicated in energy market manipulation schemes from \nparticipating in the utility industry.\n  The Securities Exchange Commission has had this authority for decades \nand used it in some high-profile instances of individuals engaged in \nsecurities fraud. However, this authority does not currently exist in \nFederal energy law. Added unanimously as amendments during the Senate \nEnergy Committee's markup of the bill, these provisions were inspired \nby recent court cases in which it is alleged that some of the same \nenergy traders overheard on the now-infamous Enron audiotapes have been \nimplicated in subsequent market manipulation schemes in other regions \nof the country.\n  Lastly, this legislation contains a provision of particular \nimportance to my Washington State constituents. Section 1270 of this \nbill would prohibit a Federal bankruptcy court from forcing Washington \nState's Snohomish Public Utility District--PUD--and its customers to \nfork over another $122 million to Enron. Specifically, the provision \nprohibits the bankruptcy court from enforcing payments on power \ncontracts that are unjust, unreasonable or contrary to the public \ninterest. The provision was written to target manipulated power \ncontracts between Enron and utilities in the West. The contracts were \ncancelled when the energy giant began its scandalous slide into \nbankruptcy. But once they were cancelled, Enron turned around and sued \nutilities for ``termination payments,'' seeking to collect profits on \npower that was never even delivered.\n  While the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--FERC--has been \nconducting its proceedings to provide remedies for the consumers harmed \nby market manipulation, Enron has nevertheless continued pursuing \ncollection of these ``termination payments'' in bankruptcy court. In \nfact, the court has already ruled that other Enron victims--Nevada \nPower Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company--should have to pay \nthese fees, which come to more than $330 million for the two Nevada \nutilities. The court went so far as to enjoin FERC from proceeding with \nits own specific inquiry into whether Enron is owed the termination \npayments in those cases.\n  The provision included in this bill says very clearly to FERC, ``Do \nyour job to protect consumers, and when you make a decision, that \ndecision will stand.'' Interpreting our Nation's energy consumer \nprotection laws is not the job of a bankruptcy judge. This \nresponsibility lies with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  I am aware that these provisions are in stark contrast to those \nincluded in the legislation passed by the House of Representatives. The \nHouse bill would ban only one type of manipulation scheme made infamous \nby Enron--roundtrip trading. It would do nothing to ban proven market \nmanipulators from future employment in the energy business. And most \ninexplicably, it would actually give later-day Enrons a license to \nsteal. It would lock in profits for would-be market manipulators under \nthe guise of ``contract sanctity.'' I recognize that reconciling these \nissues with the House may be difficult. But when it comes to the deeds \nof Enron--and putting in place tough new laws to make sure such a wide-\nranging fraud is never again perpetrated against our Nation's \nconsumers--I believe the Senate will have the American people firmly on \nour side.\n  In addition to these very important provisions, I must also make a \nfew comments on other matters of importance in this legislation's \nelectricity title. I regret that during the course of the debate on \nthis bill, there was not enough time to discuss more fully its \ntreatment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act--PUHCA. It is \nimportant that this silence not be confused with disinterest. It is \nbecause of the consumer protections provisions included in the bill-- \nsome that I have mentioned already--that this issue has not caused an \nuproar, as it has in the past.\n  It was crucial to me that, in PUHCA's stead, this bill include the \nrefinements and enhancements of FERC's merger review authority that \nwere worked out by Senators Bingaman and Domenici. I must still state \nmy profound uneasiness with the notion that we are repealing one of our \nNation's fundamental consumer protection laws at a time when many of us \nare concerned about mergers and consolidation within the utility \nindustry. And I remain concerned that we have not done enough to \naddress the issue of cross-subsidization of unregulated affiliates by \nutilities that are owned by the same holding company.\n  I ask my colleagues to remember: Enron was a company willing to turn \na profit by any means necessary; but it was presented with a market and \nregulatory environment that presented innumerable opportunities for \nabuse. We have given FERC the tools in this bill to prevent those \nabuses; let's hope they take this responsibility seriously.\n  The bill's repeal of PUHCA is predicted by some to usher in a new \nwave of utility mergers. Consolidation can be beneficial, but it can \nalso foreclose competition, frustrate effective regulation and create \ninefficiencies. Let us hope that Federal and State regulators both take \ntheir responsibilities to protect consumers seriously.\n\n  PUHCA repeal lifts diversification and investment bans that the \nleading financial rating agencies have determined were critical in \nprotecting the financial health of utilities and preventing bad \nbusiness investments. Let us hope that we don't regret this decision.\n  Again, this bill requires steps to prevent cross-subsidization when \nutilities merge, but is silent on the need to prevent cross-\nsubsidization by those utilities that don't merge. Let us hope that \nconsumers and independent competitors do not suffer from this decision.\n  I sincerely hope history will prove this Senator's instincts and \nskepticism wrong on the topic of utility cross-subsidization and PUHCA \nrepeal--because otherwise, it is American ratepayers and investors who \nwill be paying the price. But as I said, it is the consumer protections \nin this bill today that have led me to view this as a reasonable \ncompromise. In addition to the provisions I mentioned before, this \nlegislation also includes improved language on market transparency, \naccountability standards for the Nation's Regional Transmission \nOrganizations--RTOs--and the protection of transmission rights needed \nto serve consumers, particularly in the Pacific Northwest.\n  Let me be perfectly clear: the provisions that I have mentioned, \ntaken together, are the minimum needed in order to meet the needs of \nelectric consumers. They were essential in earning the support of this \nSenator. Last Congress, one of the key factors that led to the defeat \nof the Energy bill was the failure of the conference report to protect \nelectric consumers. While I believe we can and should do more, I \ncommend both the Senators from New Mexico for their efforts. But their \nefforts will be wasted if the other body does not realize that these \nprovisions are essential for final passage of an energy bill conference \nreport.\n  It is also important to note that the Senate legislation we have \npassed today avoids the gratuitous special interest deals in the House \nbill--such as giving groundwater polluting MTBE manufacturers a free \nride on clean up liability. It moves forward without the rollbacks of \nthe Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, National Environmental Policy Act, \nand Safe Drinking Water Act that are included in the House legislation. \nThe Senate has spoken out against these bad environmental policies and \nwe stuck to those principles in this bill.\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\n  We stuck to those principles and we worked across the aisle, in good \nfaith at every turn. I hope the other body across the Capitol has paid \nsome attention to this process. If leaders in the House are serious \nabout delivering energy legislation to the President's desk for \nsignature, then they will realize that a similar effort will be \nrequired during the conference on this legislation.\n  Make no mistake: the Senate Energy bill is far from perfect. There \nare missed opportunities. There are provisions that I outright oppose, \nsuch as surveying for oil and gas areas on the Outer Continental Shelf \nthat are protected by drilling moratoria, originally established by \nPresident George H.W. Bush. But there are many, many more provisions in \nthis legislation that I wholeheartedly support.\n  This bill positions the U.S. to make many of the right investments in \nenergy research and development. It includes important measures to \ndiversify both our domestic sources of biofuels and electricity. And it \ncontains many important consumer protections for our Nation's energy \nratepayers. In other words, the Senate Energy bill contains many of the \nbasics necessary for our Nation to start moving in the right direction. \nIt is a modest step. Yet I believe we should take this step, if we are \ncommitted to moving our country--even more aggressively in the coming \nyears--toward an energy policy that will sustain American \ncompetitiveness in a rapidly-evolving global economy.\n  I thank my friends and colleagues who serve on the Senate Energy \nCommittee, for the thoughtful and substantive consideration they gave a \nnumber of key aspects of this legislation. And again, my thanks to the \nchairman and ranking member for their leadership in navigating what \nwere at times turbulent waters, with certain aspects of this bill. We \nwill be counting on those navigational skills as this legislation moves \ntoward conference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I see that my good friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, has come to the floor. I want \nto thank Mr. Grassley for his hard work on the Energy Policy Tax \nIncentives Act of 2005. I commend my good friend and Senator Baucus for \ntheir efforts to complete this important section of the Energy bill.\n  The Energy Policy Tax Incentives Act of 2005 supports the development \nof energy production from renewable resources and complements the \nEnergy bill that Senators Domenici and Bingaman have worked in a \nbipartisan fashion to put together. I agree with my colleagues that we \nmust continue to seek alternative sources of energy; it is in the best \ninterest of America.\n  I would mention, however, that we must also continue to sustain \ndomestic production of oil and gas. According to the National Petroleum \nCouncil's Natural Gas Study, a $10-billion-per-year investment over 20 \nyears will be needed in order to meet future natural gas needs. We \ncannot overlook the importance of developing our domestic oil and gas \nresources. Domestic production is a critical first step toward energy \nindependence while alternative sources are more fully developed. I ask \nmy colleague from Iowa if he would agree with me that U.S. imports of \nforeign energy are at unacceptable levels, and the need to develop our \ndomestic resources is an important step toward energy independence.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to my colleague from Texas that I do agree that \nour dependence upon foreign sources of energy is dangerously high. It \nis a threat to our economic stability and national security. We cannot \ncontinue to rely on foreign imports for 60 percent of our supplies. We \nmust utilize available domestic resources, and I believe the Energy \nbill before the Senate is a good step forward.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Finance Committee chairman. A central \ngoal of the Energy bill is to enhance the production of U.S. energy \nsources, including oil and natural gas, and thus allow us to reduce our \nreliance on imported energy. To do that we need to make domestic oil \nand gas exploration projects cost competitive with those abroad. \nAllowing geological and geophysical expenditures to be amortized over 2 \nyears will help make U.S. projects more economical by reducing the \nadministrative cost burdens to both taxpayers and the IRS. It will \nespecially help small operators take more risks to find new sources of \noil and gas. This provision has been in every Energy bill--House and \nSenate--over the past several years. It has enjoyed bipartisan support \nbecause it makes sense. These expenditures are similar to research and \ndevelopment expenditures paid by other industries. Research and \ndevelopment expenses are either currently expensed or they receive a \ntax credit. Shorter amortization of geological and geophysical \nexpenditures, while not as generous a tax treatment as expensing or a \ncredit, would help to equalize the tax treatment of similar \nexpenditures for all industries.\n  I would also raise the importance of similar tax treatment of delay \nrental payments. Congress needs to pass legislation to clarify that \ndelay rental payments can be amortized over 2 years to enhance and \npreserve domestic oil and gas production. This is important for \ndevelopers who cannot afford to run continuous operations on the \nproperties they hold. The current uncertainty of how these costs are to \nbe treated has led to costly litigation; prompt clarification will \neliminate needless administrative burdens on taxpayers and the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  Unfortunately, these two provisions were not included in the Senate \nEnergy Policy Tax Incentives Act of 2005. They are both important \nprovisions for a comprehensive Energy bill. I would ask my colleague if \nhe would work with me to see that they are included in the final \nconference package.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I say to my colleague that I understand the importance \nof these provisions in a comprehensive Energy bill. I have supported \nthese in the past and included them in our bill in the 108th Congress. \nI agree that sensible tax treatment that will promote the development \nof domestic oil and gas sources should be a part of the final bill. As \nwe move forward to conference, we will work to include these two \nimportant provisions.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to thank Senator Grassley for his \nconsideration and willingness to work with me.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. With its passage, America will begin to declare its \nindependence from foreign sources of energy.\n  A strong energy policy is crucial to America's economic security and \nnational security. We must become less dependent on foreign sources of \nenergy.\n  In 1985, 75 percent of the crude oil used in American refineries was \ndomestically produced. Only about 25 percent came from beyond our \nborders. But today, those proportions have been turned upside down: \nOnly about 35 percent of crude oil used here is produced at home, and \n65 percent is imported from foreign countries.\n  That precarious balance leaves our Nation's energy needs, and even \nour Nation's economic strength, in the hands of others. America can do \nbetter. Four years of debate is enough: I urge this Senate to pass this \nmuch-needed energy bill now.\n  Kentucky has not escaped the ill effects of America's energy needs. \nCommercial natural gas prices in Kentucky rose by 53 percent from 2000 \nto 2004. Gasoline prices in the Commonwealth, and throughout the entire \nMidwest region of the United States, have risen by 86 percent since \n2002. The same gallon of gas that cost $1.13 then costs Kentuckians a \nwhopping $2.11 today. America's lack of a strong, focused energy policy \nhas imposed a tax on all Kentucky drivers.\n  This bill will provide that strong, focused energy policy. It will \nnot make gasoline prices drop overnight. But it includes some simple, \nsmart provisions that will provide cheaper, safer, and more plentiful \nenergy for generations to come.\n  Passing the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will provide $2.9 billion in \nincentives for the development of clean coal technology and generation. \nAmerica contains enough coal to meet our needs for the next 250 years, \nand Kentucky ranks third among the States in coal production. Coal \nprovides over 50 percent of the electricity in America, and 97 percent \nof Kentucky's. We must take full advantage of such a cheap, abundant\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\nresource while also making sure we protect the environment.\n  This bill will do that. It provides money to research technologies \nthat will remove nearly all pollutants from coal-fired power plants. We \nwill be able to continue using coal in an environmentally friendly way. \nThat will benefit Kentucky, and America. The bill also includes $1.4 \nbillion in incentives for increased domestic oil and gas production. \nAmerica hasn't seen a single new oil refinery since 1976. We need to \nbuild more now, and we can do so in an environmentally sensitive way.\n  The bill includes $7.9 billion for the development of alternative \nfuels. We can unleash the American genius on creating or refining new \nand better sources of energy for the future, such as hydrogen, ethanol, \nand biodiesel. One day, automobiles can run on hydrogen instead of \ngasoline--and instead of exhaust fumes, they would emit pure water. \nEthanol, made from corn, can be mixed with gasoline to make a cleaner, \nmore efficient fuel. Increased production of biodiesel would further \nreduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  This bill also provides $278 million for more nuclear power \nfacilities. Nuclear power is produced entirely here in America, and can \ncreate vast quantities of electricity. Nations such as France have long \nsince realized the benefits of nuclear power. It is time America did \nthe same. Nuclear power is safe and smart. It should be a major source \nof America's energy policy in the 21st century.\n  Passage of this bill will also provide money for increased energy \nefficiency and conservation, and a renewable fuels standard that will \nincrease our amount of renewable fuel in the fuel supply to 8 billion \ngallons by 2012.\n  It is time America stopped outsourcing its energy production. The \nproblems we face are simple to grasp--so simple that it is a wonder \nthat Congress has waited this long to act. We must continue to use our \nprimary source of energy, coal, while being sure to do so using \nenvironmentally safe technology. We must increase domestic oil and gas \nproduction, also using environmentally safe technology. We must develop \ncheap, safe, and clean alternative energy sources including nuclear \nenergy. And we must increase energy efficiency and conservation.\n  American know-how has made us the economic envy of the world. We can \nlead the way in technologically advanced methods to take great care \nwith our environment, while still meeting our energy needs, as well. \nThis bill will accomplish these goals.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on final passage \nof the Energy bill. I want to applaud my fellow Senators for their hard \nwork and cooperation. Senator Pete Domenici deserves special \nrecognition. Senator Domenici's expertise on energy issues is \nunparalleled in the United States Senate, as he has demonstrated for a \nnumber of years on both the Energy Committee and the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. His determination to \nproduce a comprehensive national energy policy, and his hard work with \nhis ranking member, Senator Bingaman, as well as the other members of \nhis committee, is the reason why we stand here, today, on the cusp of \nfinal passage of a balanced, bipartisan energy bill. I congratulate \nChairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman. I am confident that they will \ncontinue to work together in conference to deliver a strong Energy bill \nthat will provide the clean, affordable energy we need to keep America \nmoving forward.\n  Anyone who has filled a tank of gas recently, or paid an electric \nbill, knows that we've reached a crisis point. Energy prices are \nskyrocketing. Suddenly, instead of the lowest natural gas prices in the \nindustrialized world, we have the highest. Because of high natural gas \nprices, manufacturing and chemical jobs are moving overseas. Farmers \nare taking a pay cut. Consumers are paying too much to heat and cool \ntheir homes. Communities across the country are suffering. And as many \nas 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost because of soaring \nprices. All the while, we have grown dangerously reliant on foreign \nsources of energy. And some of those foreign sources do not have \nAmerica's best interests at heart.\n  In the 1960s and early 1970s, the U.S. produced almost as much oil as \nwe consumed. Imports were relatively small. But since then, U.S. oil \nproduction has been on the decline, while consumption has steadily \nincreased. As a result, we've become more and more dependent on \nimported oil.\n  As we remember all too well, in the early 1970's, large oil exporters \nin the Middle East adopted an oil embargo against many Western \ncountries. This marked the first time that oil was used as a political \nweapon. At the time, the U.S. imported 35 percent of our oil needs. \nSince then, we have become much more dependent on foreign sources of \noil and natural gas. We are more vulnerable than ever to the use of \nenergy as a political weapon.\n  In addition, many non-democratic countries and others maintain their \nhold on power through the redistribution of oil revenues. We see this \nhappening in Venezuela. We currently import over one million barrels of \noil a day from Venezuela. Meanwhile, its president, Hugo Chavez, \nactively opposes the United States, supports rogue states such as Cuba, \nand is working to destabilize Latin America. President Chavez maintains \nhis political support with the aid of Venezuela's oil revenues. These \nrevenues have also given him the ability to purchase arms and play a \nmajor role on the international stage.\n  These dynamics are equally evident for energy suppliers in the Middle \nEast. President Bush and many of my colleagues here in the Senate have \ncorrectly argued that the spread of democracy, human rights, and the \nrule of law is essential for peace and stability, and for victory in \nthe War on Terrorism. But regimes in the Middle East have been able to \nuse their oil revenues to hang on to power and maintain non-democratic \npolitical systems. As a result, the conditions that breed hatred, \nviolence, and terrorism often go unaddressed, and the problems of \nterrorism persist.\n  Passing the energy bill today will be a major step forward in \naddressing these serious national security challenges. It will also be \na major step forward for our economic productivity and prosperity. The \nEnergy bill promises to deliver exciting new technologies. Hydrogen \nfuel cells are one example. If just 20 percent of cars used fuel cell \ntechnology, we could cut oil imports by 1.5 million barrels every day.\n  The Senate Energy bill authorizes $3.7 billion over 5 years to \nsupport hydrogen and fuel-cell research, as well as the infrastructure \nwe need to move toward this goal.\n  Last week, Senator Hatch and I had the opportunity to attend a \nhydrogen car demonstration here at the Capitol. The cars were stylish. \nThey drove well. The technology is very promising. Hybrid cars are \nalready gaining in popularity. Just this past week, Nissan announced \nthat its first hybrid vehicle will be built at the Smyrna plant in \nTennessee. This is one example of how technology can simultaneously \npromote conservation and efficiency, and boost the manufacturing \nsector.\n  In addition, the Energy bill's conservation and energy efficiency \nprovisions far exceed those of other energy bills considered by the \nCongress in recent years.\n  According to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, \nthe Senate Energy bill will save 1.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas \nby 2020, equivalent to the current annual consumption of the whole \nstate of New York. It will reduce peak electric demand by 50,000 \nmegawatts by 2020, the equivalent of 170 new power plants. And it will \nreduce U.S. oil consumption by 1 million barrels a day by the year \n2015.\n  It encourages the use of home-grown renewable fuels such as ethanol \nand biodiesel, as well as wind and solar and geothermal energy. It \nprovides incentives to facilitate the development of cutting edge \ntechnologies like coal gasification and advanced nuclear plants, which \nwill produce clean, low-carbon energy to help address the issue of \nglobal climate change. And it will modernize and expand our Nation's \nelectricity grid to enhance reliability and help prevent future \nblackouts.\n  The Senate energy bill will help us both conserve more energy, and \nproduce more energy. It will also help produce more jobs. It is \nestimated that the energy bill will save over two million jobs and \ncreate hundreds of thousands more. The ethanol provision, for\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\nexample, is expected to generate 230,000 new jobs over the next 7 \nyears. Incentives for wind generated energy are expected to create \nanother 100,000 jobs in the next 2. The investment in clean coal \ntechnology will create 62,1000 jobs, and 40,000 new jobs in the solar \nindustry will come on line. These are good jobs, well paying, and right \nhere at home.\n  The energy bill is good for America, It will move our country toward \na more reliable supply of clean, affordable energy. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this comprehensive, forward leaning plan. \nCasting a vote for the Energy bill is a vote for a safer and more \nsecure America.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is so much negative written in the \npress about all the infighting that goes on in the Senate, how we don't \nwork together. We work together on a lot of things. We don't get much \nappreciation from the public for that because they see all the negative \nthat the press conjures up. But here is an example of two Senators, \nboth very experienced, both from the same State, who are in positions \nof prominence in that very important committee that brought the Energy \nbill here. They worked together.\n  They had meetings where Senator Bingaman met with Republicans, \nSenator Domenici met with Democrats, and they crafted this bill. It \nwasn't a perfect bill, but there is not anything we do around here that \nis perfect. We did improve it and we had the opportunity to try to \nimprove it even more. It was a free debate. And to indicate there was \nenough time on the debate, the cloture vote was overwhelming.\n  Mr. President, I hope as we proceed through the conference process on \nthis--and as the distinguished majority leader knows, we have set the \nexample of how a conference should be conducted with the highway bill--\nwe are going to move forward on this and do everything we can in \nconference to sustain and uphold the position of the Senate.\n  This is a good bill. I commend and applaud the two managers, Senator \nDomenici and Senator Bingaman, for doing an outstanding job and setting \nthe example of what should be the future of all bills that come before \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that I be made a cosponsor with \nthem. I spoke to the sponsors earlier this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend these two Senators for taking \nthe initiative to add an incremental part of the cost of the Martin \nLuther King Memorial, and I would like to take a minute to go back and \nrecite the history of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. During the \n104th Congress, while Chairman of the Rules Committee, I joined my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, to authorize a project for \nconstruction on the national mall. Our bill, as I read from the \nCommittee Report for S. 426 from December 19, 1995, authorized the \nAlpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, the oldest Black fraternity in the United \nStates, to establish without cost to the Federal Government, a memorial \nin the District of Columbia and its environs to the late Dr. Martin \nLuther King. Similar bills were introduced in the 100th, 101st, 102d, \nand 103d Congresses, reported favorably by the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration in the 100th Congress, and in the 102d Congress the bill \npassed the Senate. Again,\n\n[[Page S7479]]\n\nthat reference, for those who want to go back and read this report, is \nCalendar No. 284, December 19, 1995.\n  I was privileged to work with Senator Sarbanes on this legislation, \nand we did secure the authorization for this group and others to \nproceed with this memorial.\n\n  If I might say, Mr. President--and I say this with a great sense of \nhumility--I have always had a deep admiration for Dr. King. It started \nat the time that he went to the Lincoln Memorial and addressed, indeed, \nthe world, much less the United States, the Nation. I came down not as \na participant but as a spectator, as a young man. I was drawn to the \nlocation, as were many others, and simply stood quietly on the side of \nthe street as the marchers went by and then was able to get close \nenough to hear in some way some parts of the speech as it was so \neloquently delivered that day.\n  Then in later years I was privileged to be a member of the Chapter of \nthe Washington National Cathedral, the Chapter being the governing body \nof the Cathedral at that time, and the subject of his addressing the \nNation from the pulpit came up. I always expressed support for that, \nand actually my term expired before the historic day when he was \ninvited to take the pulpit at the Washington Cathedral and give his \nlast sermon. He met his tragic and untimely death shortly after that.\n  So it is against that background that I joined with my dear and \nvalued friend, Senator Sarbanes, to introduce the original authorizing \nlegislation. Construction was required to begin by November 2003. \nHowever, because of the difficulty in choosing a site, finalizing a \ndesign, and raising the $100 million that would be necessary, the \nproject was still in need of funds. In 2003 I again joined my colleague \nfrom Maryland to extend the authorization so the Martin Luther King, \nJr. National Memorial Project Foundation would have additional time to \nraise the funds necessary to erect a fitting tribute to Dr. King. We \nwere able to pass another piece of legislation, S. 470, to extend the \ndeadline to November of 2006.\n  Since that time, I am pleased to say that the Foundation has raised \napproximately $40 million toward the total cost of the Memorial. Today \nI join my dear friends Senators Byrd, Cochran, and Sarbanes to provide \nan additional $10 million for the construction.\n  I simply add that, as noted in the December 1995 Committee Report, \nthe first paragraph I read, about the public funding, at that time it \nwas the hope and expectation that private funds could achieve the goals \nin their entirety. Although arduous and wonderful efforts have been put \ntogether by many people to raise the funding, I think it is appropriate \nthat this increment of public funding be added. And I say that because \nI was--many of us--a part of the effort to establish the World War II \nMemorial. And there, again, it was, I think, 95 percent private funding \nlargely through the efforts of our beloved colleagues, Bob Dole and \nFred Smith, a citizen of national and international recognition and \naccomplishment, and together their large team of people did raise about \n$100 million. But at the very end there were expenses to be incurred \nthat were not foreseen to enable a massive audience to come from all \nover the United States for the dedication. And at that time, as a \nMember of the Armed Services Committee, I was able to secure some \nmodest amount of funds, several million dollars, to enable that \nceremony to be completed. So I think precedent is established there for \nthe use of public funds for memorials of enormous significance \nhistorically and otherwise to our Nation.\n  Dr. King serves as a reminder that change can be brought about most \npowerfully when it is done by non-violent means. Visitors will come to \nthe Memorial from every part of this country and indeed the world, to \nbe inspired anew by Dr. King's words and deeds, and the extraordinary \nstory of his life. It will be of particular inspiration to the many \nschool children who will visit for years to come.\n  Dr. King's dream is the fulfillment, in part, of the revolutionary \nwords of great American patriots such as Thomas Jefferson and it is \nfitting that the two monuments will rest across from each other.\n  I have worked with my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator \nSarbanes, from the beginning of the efforts in Congress to secure a \nsite and build a memorial on the national mall. I am proud of our \nhumble contributions to this project and look forward--with great \nexpectation to the day that we can visit Dr. King's Memorial in its \nrightful place--among the giants of American history and liberty.\n  Mr. President, I again commend the sponsors and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from West \nVirginia, the distinguished Senator who formerly served as chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, in offering this amendment for the \nconsideration of the Senate.\n  I appreciate Senator Byrd inviting me to be an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment and join him in this effort to see that the memorial \npreviously authorized to be constructed on the Mall here in the \nNation's Capital in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King be funded so \nconstruction can begin and this memorial be completed.\n  The Martin Luther King Memorial was authorized to be constructed on a \n4-acre tract on the Mall to recognize and honor the influence on civil \nrights and justice for all--for all Americans--to which Dr. King \ndevoted a lifetime of courageous service and leadership.\n  Although the legislation contemplates, as my friend from Virginia, \nMr. Warner, points out, that all of the funds for the construction of \nthe memorial would be raised from private sources, much in the same way \nas the World War II Memorial was constructed--there has been $42 \nmillion of private donations made for this purpose--there is needed \nadditional funds. It is hoped that the adoption of this amendment will \nshow the serious commitment of the Congress in seeing that this \nmemorial is completed at the earliest possible date. This could jump-\nstart the final stage of fundraising and enable construction to begin. \nIt is my hope the Senate will support this effort and approve the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I spoke on yesterday when I offered the amendment for \nthe Senate's consideration. I will not speak further at this time \nexcept to say that my remarks of yesterday will be found on page S7420 \nof the Congressional Record.\n  I am very pleased that my chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi--I say \n``distinguished,'' the distinguished Senator, Mr. Cochran--I am \ndelighted he is the chief cosponsor of the amendment. I appreciate his \nexcellent remarks today.\n  I also express my deep appreciation to the distinguished gentleman--\nthe distinguished ``gentleman''--the Senator from Virginia. And I say \nthat with all the emphasis that word's meaning carries. He is a great \nSenator. He believes in the Constitution of the United States. He swore \nto support and defend it, and he has not forgotten his oath. He has not \nforgotten his oath. And he has stated it and restated it, holding his \nhand on the Bible and the other hand to God and all men. He has \nrestated it several times, and he has lived up to it. I commend him.\n  He has been in the forefront of the effort to honor Dr. Martin Luther \nKing with a memorial on the Mall. He has been in that forefront over a \nperiod of several years. He cosponsored, as he has pointed out, the \noriginal authorization. I am so pleased he is cosponsoring this \namendment. He stood as a spectator, he said, but he later became an \nactive participant in the history that followed on to that moment in \nwhich he was a spectator watching from the streets.\n  So he has become a part of history. And what I say with regard to the \ndistinguished gentleman, the Senator from Virginia--the Virginian--I \nsay also with equal heartfelt thanks to the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes, who has announced he will not remain with us \nafter next year, to my great sorrow and regret. But Senator Sarbanes \nhas been a leader in the march toward justice for all men and women. I \ncommend him, likewise. And I thank him for being a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\n  While I have the floor, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe following Senators be added as cosponsors to the amendment: Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Schumer, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Boxer, Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join in \ncosponsoring this amendment. I thank the Chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee for bringing this amendment \nforward. It is an enormously important contribution to the effort that \nis underway now to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, by placing his \nmemorial between President Roosevelt's Memorial and the Lincoln \nMemorial on the National Mall.\n  I thank the Senators for their kind comments. My dear friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, and I worked together on this project to help \nmove it along. It has had overwhelming support in the Congress and in \nthe country, but raising the money has been a difficult proposition. \nLet's be very clear about this--an enormous effort has gone into \nbringing this memorial to fruition and significant moneys have been \nraised.\n  While we are not yet there, this amendment will provide a tremendous \nboost to the fundraising effort. It shows clearly the support of the \nCongress. Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd, by coming forward with the \namendment, at this critical time, have given this entire effort an \nimpetus, which will bring it to a successful conclusion.\n  Interestingly enough, I, too, was there when Martin Luther King gave \nhis ``I Have a Dream'' speech, that Mr. Warner, the able Senator from \nVirginia, referred to earlier. It was clearly a historic occasion that \nhelped to shape the nature of our country for the better--much for the \nbetter. Dr. King fought to establish the proposition that people should \nbe judged by their character and not by the color of their skin. He \nenunciated that principle time and time again.\n  The other thing he did was he advocated his position in a nonviolent \nway. He asserted that in a democratic society, these goals could be \nachieved through peaceful means, through nonviolent means. He channeled \nthe energy and the commitment that was devoted toward achieving racial \nequality in this country into peaceful paths. And our country has been \nmuch the better for his efforts.\n  So much work has gone into this Memorial--first in getting it \napproved and then in finding the location for it on the National Mall. \nBut, it has been worth the effort because when schoolchildren come to \nthe Nation's Capital in the year's to come, part of their visit to \nWashington will involve a trip to the Martin Luther King Memorial.\n  The plans that have been prepared are quite impressive. They will \nhave an opportunity to visit that Memorial and to reflect upon the \ncontribution which Dr. King made to our Nation: the healing he brought \nabout, the realization of the American dream, that all of our people--\nall--have an opportunity to participate and to advance themselves and \ntheir families.\n  So I join with my colleagues. I thank them for their very kind \nremarks. I appreciate the Senator from Virginia reminding us of the \neffort that went into helping bring us to this day. I especially again \nthank Senators Cochran and Byrd for coming forward with this amendment \nat a very critical time, to give an impetus to the effort to do the \nfundraising that is necessary to build this Memorial and to have, in \neffect, this national treasure on the Mall.\n  Dr. King's statue is, of course, here in the Capitol, as we know. It \nis fitting now that we move beyond the Capitol and create this Memorial \non the Mall in recognition of all he stood for and what he represented \nin terms of realizing the words and ideals embodied in the Declaration \nof Independence and the U.S. Constitution.\n  I thank my colleagues very much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland, a dear, dear friend. We have worked on so many things \ntogether, and continue to do so.\n  But I recall very vividly going down on the day we dedicated the \nsite. It was a bitterly cold day. There was a small tent in which there \nwas a heater going, and we emerged from the tent. I, for some reason, \nremember one line, not spoken by either of us but by several others who \nspoke at the occasion: The site was chosen so the sunrise cast its \nfirst rays on the memorial; and then, as the sun set, the final resting \nrays of the day would drape the memorial. I remember that phrase to \nthis day.\n  I thank my friend for his kind remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we have some modifications to make, and we \nhave a list of those amendments that have been cleared on both sides.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1040, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification for Senator Bond on \namendment No. 1040 and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be so \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the Interior appropriations \nbill, waiting for additional debate. All amendments have been offered, \nbut we are waiting for additional debate on some amendments. I am going \nto seek to speak in morning business.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I remind Senators that we are going to \nstart calling up these amendments right after lunch. I want to warn \nSenators to come down and defend their amendments. If not, we are going \nto start taking action on them first thing after lunch. We have the \norder already agreed to, and we want to complete this bill by tomorrow \nmorning, if possible. There is more impending business before the \nSenate. It is important that the appropriations process move forward. \nWe will be calling up those amendments this afternoon, and those \nSenators defending and offering those amendments should be on the floor \nto defend them.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Carlos Lazo\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, to follow up on an issue I raised \nyesterday, I have not yet received a return call from the State \nDepartment. As I indicated, Karl Rove and the chief of staff at the \nWhite House had sent word to me following my discussion with Karl Rove \nlast Friday that Mr. Zoellick at the State Department would be handling \nthis issue. The issue is Mr. Carlos Lazo, a marine who fought in Iraq \nand won the Bronze Star for bravery and courage, came back to this \ncountry. He is a fellow who fled Cuba on a raft in 1992. His wife and \nchildren remain in Cuba unable to leave. He went to fight in the \nNational Guard, went to Iraq to fight for this country, earned a Bronze \nStar last November in Iraq. He came back to this country to find out \nthat his son was quite ill in Cuba. He wanted to go visit his son and \nwas told he can't travel to Cuba because the President's current \nregulations and rules say you can only visit once every 3 years.\n  This young man who fled Cuba, came to this country, put on America's \nuniform, fought for this country in Iraq, won a Bronze Star fighting \nfor freedom, comes back to this country. He doesn't have the freedom to \ngo to see his sick child in Cuba. That is unbelievable to me. Why? \nBecause there is no humanitarian exemption in the travel to Cuba \nregulation the President proposed several years ago.\n  I have asked all the folks involved: Do you mean there is no \nflexibility at all in this regulation proposed by the President?\n  None at all, they said. We have people calling. Their mothers are \ndying in Cuba, and we won't let them go. You can only go once every 3 \nyears.\n  So Mr. Zoellick did tell me he is looking into it. I haven't heard \nback from him. Sergeant Lazo, who is walking around with a Bronze Star \nawarded by this country for his heroism on the battlefield, does not \napparently have the freedom to go see his sick son. I will continue to \nask these questions of the administration.\n  Incidentally, I have offered an amendment on this legislation. I \nagree it is going to take a two-thirds vote, but I want to see the \npeople in the Senate who want to vote against giving this marine the \nopportunity to go see his sick child. It is not just him. It is all the \nother people caught in the web of this bizarre travel restriction. In \nan attempt to slap around Fidel Castro, we have decided to restrict the \nfreedom of the American people to travel to Cuba. What a strange thing \nthat is. We can travel to Communist China, Vietnam, but you can't go \nsee your sick child in Cuba. You can't take your father's ashes to \ndistribute on the church grounds of the church he ministered at in \nCuba, after your dad died and his last wishes were to have his ashes \ndistributed on the church property in Cuba. When you do that, you get \nhit with a big fine. It is unbelievable.\n  I won't go on except to say that I continue to wait by the phone for \na call back from Mr. Zoellick who apparently is handling this. My hope \nis they will find a way to do the right thing. My hope is the Senate \nwill be able to vote on this in the next day, and maybe the Senate will \ndecide what the right thing is. The right thing is for humanitarian \nreasons to allow this courageous soldier who fought for freedom to have \nthe freedom to go see his sick child.\n\n\n                              Halliburton\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me describe a hearing I chaired \nyesterday morning. It was a hearing on the subject of Halliburton. \nTypically, Halliburton has put out a statement saying that it was \npolitical. They have been saying this is political for a long while. I \nheld a hearing because the authorizing committee won't. This is the \nfifth hearing I have held.\n  The highest civilian official in the Department of Defense, working \nwith the Corps of Engineers, testified at that hearing. She was \ndescribing the meetings during which Halliburton was awarded no-bid \ncontracts worth billions of dollars.\n  She said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR [the subsidiary of Halliburton] \n     represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I \n     have witnessed during the course of my professional career.\n\n  She insisted these things be done right. They weren't done right. \nThese were sweetheart deals, worth billions of dollars, given to a \ncompany without competition for the bid, companies that had an inside \ntrack to get the money, get the bid, and they did.\n  Let me describe one more piece of testimony from an employee of this \ncompany. We have had testimony from many others who worked for this \ncompany in the country of Iraq under the contract given to Halliburton. \nThis is from an employee of Halliburton who testified yesterday. He was \ninvolved in food service, providing food to our troops:\n\n       Food items were being brought into the base that were \n     outdated or expired as much as a year. We were told by the \n     [Halliburton] food service managers to use these items \n     anyway.\n\n  They are feeding the American troops, and they are receiving food \nthat has an expired date on it; some as much as a year ago have \nexpired. They said give it to the troops anyway. This food was fed to \nthe troops. Continuing to quote:\n\n       A lot of these were frozen foods: Chicken, beef, fish, and \n     ice cream. For trucks that were hit by convoy fire and \n     bombings [during delivery], we were told to go into the \n     trucks and remove the food items and use them after removing \n     the bullets and any shrapnel from the bad food that was hit.\n\n  I will say that again:\n\n       We were told to go into the trucks and remove the food \n     items and use them after removing the bullets and any \n     shrapnel from the bad food that was hit. We were told to turn \n     the removed bullets over to the managers for souvenirs. When \n     I had the military check some of the food shipments, they \n     would turn the food items away. But there wasn't any making \n     of the record, so KBR [Halliburton] just sent the food to \n     another base for use.\n\n  It is unbelievable. We are talking about feeding soldiers here, and \nthis is an employee of the company that was receiving billions of \ndollars to feed soldiers. In fact, what caught my attention about this \nissue is that Halliburton was charging us to feed 42,000 soldiers a \nday, and it turns out they were only feeding 14,000 soldiers. They were \nbilling the Government for 42,000 soldiers and feeding 14,000. I didn't \nknow they were feeding soldiers food that had expired on its label, \nfood that had come in trucks that had been attacked with bullets and \nshrapnel embedded in the food to be removed first and then provided to \nthe superiors for souvenirs. This is unbelievable.\n  Everybody here talks about honoring America's soldiers. What kind of \nhonor exists in providing a sole-source, no-bid contract worth billions \nof dollars to a company that is feeding food to our soldiers that is \noutdated or expired on\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\nits label? They say do it any way, it doesn't matter, it is just \nsoldiers. This is just one more example. Every time we hear this sort \nof thing, we get Halliburton putting out a statement that says this is \njust politics because the Vice President used to run Halliburton. We \ndidn't talk about the Vice President yesterday. This is a company that \ngot a sweetheart deal at the Pentagon and there are stories after \nstories of abuse. There was one about the guy who came to our hearing \nsome while ago, and he held up a hand towel. He was in charge of buying \nsupplies such as hand towels. Well, the hand towels he would have \nbought for the soldiers weren't what his boss wanted. He bought the \nones his bosses wanted to buy; they were almost double the price. Why? \nThey wanted the company logo on the hand towel. The taxpayers get \nbilked, and it increased the price of the hand towels used by soldiers.\n  Unbelievable. The stories we have heard are hard to believe. They \nordered 50,000 pounds of nails, but they came in the wrong size. They \nare now dumped in the desert in Iraq. It is just a mistake. How about \ndriving $85,000 trucks and when you get a flat tire, you leave the \ntruck. An $85,000 new truck gets a flat tire or has a plugged fuel \npump--just trash the truck, leave it beside the road and somebody \ntorches it.\n  The stories are astounding every time we hear them. Mr. President, \nevery time we hold a hearing, we have the same response. I am not \ninterested in holding any more hearings. I have held five. The only \nreason we will hold hearings is the authorizing committee won't. You \nwould think somebody would be halfway interested in this kind of fraud. \nSome of it is abuse or recklessness.\n  I will tell you one other thing. This is Mr. Rory Mayberry, former \nfood production manager at KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton. He happens \nto be in Baghdad at this minute, but he is not working for Halliburton. \nHe is working for another contractor. Here is what Mr. Mayberry said. \nHe said: When the Government auditors came to try to determine what \nthey were doing, I was told all of the employees were told don't you \ndare talk to a Government auditor. Don't you speak to them. If you do, \none of two things will happen. No. 1, you are either going to be \ntransferred to an area where there is hostile activity, in a fire zone, \nor you are going to be fired. He talked to an auditor at one point, and \nhe was sent to Fallujah during the fighting. That is the way they \nhandled him. Then he quit.\n\n  It is unbelievable. They are telling employees you may not speak to \nauditors under the threat of being fired. You cannot talk or cooperate \nwith Government auditors. Why? I suppose the reason is because this \nsort of nonsense is going on. They have a sole-source contract, a \nnoncompetitive contract, with billions of dollars going out the door. \nThere is massive waste, abuse and, yes, I believe, fraud. Now, we know \nthere is, at this point, slightly more than $1 billion in billing to \nthe Federal Government by Halliburton, which has a sole-source contract \nworth billions. We know there is $1 billion that has been formally \nobjected to by the Pentagon. There is about $440 million above that for \nwhich there is not sufficient documentation. Yet, this Congress seems \nto be willing to snore through all of this.\n  In 1941, right on the edge of the Second World War, Harry Truman was \na Democrat and here on the floor of the Senate. There was a Democrat in \nthe White House. Maybe it was uncomfortable to have a Democratic \nSenator going after waste, fraud, and abuse in the military in \ncontracting, but he did. They went after it for 6 years. I am sure \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt didn't like it, but the Truman committee, as \nit was known, held hundreds of hearings and, in 1940 dollars, saved $16 \nbillion. Would that, could that, should that happen now? The answer is \nyes. Would it or could it? Probably not because no one is interested in \nhaving these hearings--no one. Is the White House interested in having \nhearings like this? Absolutely not. Is anybody going to respond to the \nquestion of whether expired food is being fed to soldiers? Will one \nperson stand up downtown at the White House or at the Pentagon and \ndemand answers now? Will there be one hearing by the authorizing \ncommittee? Will one person be angry enough to decide this should not \nhappen any longer? I doubt it.\n  Month after month after month, through five hearings, nobody seems to \ngive a damn about this. We have soldiers eating bad food, taxpayers \nbeing bilked, and nobody seems to care. Somebody should. This Congress \nhas little reason to hold its head high when it decides to ignore these \nkinds of things. It is not of great interest to me to continue to hold \nhearings through our policy committee, but I will do it if the \nauthorizing committees will not. I don't have the foggiest idea why \nsomebody would want to have an authorizing committee if they weren't \ninterested in following the trail of wrongdoing. Look, this doesn't \ntake an ``Inspector Clouseau.'' You don't need a funny looking hat to \ntrack this down. It is all out in front of you. The whole case is laid \nout. Yet, nobody seems to care.\n  We don't honor these soldiers, such as Sergeant Lazo, by saying you \ncan fight for freedom and earn a Bronze Star, but you don't have the \nliberty or the freedom to go see your sick child. We don't honor our \nsoldiers by deciding it is OK for someone to feed them bad food or \nexpired food. I hope perhaps all those who talk about honoring soldiers \nwill decide that honor means a responsibility to follow up. We have had \nthese discussions on the floor of the Senate before about uparmoring \nhumvees and other things. Every time it is raised, it is political, we \nare told. Perhaps sometimes we should understand there are areas of \nserious policy, serious concern that ought to embrace the time of this \nCongress. We spend so much time on things that have so little \nimportance.\n  I said yesterday that this is a Congress that has tended to treat the \nlight too seriously and the serious too lightly and important things \nthat really matter and really make a difference in people's lives are \nlargely not the center of debate here in the Congress. I regret that. \nWe can, and should, do much better.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, following my \npresentation, the entire testimony of Rory Mayberry, former food \nproduction manager at Halliburton's KBR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record, following my remarks, the formal statements presented \nyesterday by the highest ranking civilian official in the Corps of \nEngineers at the Pentagon, Bunnatine Greenhouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. She is a woman who had a wonderful career for a long \ntime, was given high marks always, clearly someone with a sterling \nreputation and a great career, who ran afoul of the ``old boy's \nnetwork,'' it appears to me, in the Pentagon when they decided they \nwanted to steer certain contracts in certain ways. She said: You are \nnot following regulations. That is the wrong thing to do, and we are \ngoing to see waste, fraud, and abuse as a result of it. She would not \ngo along with it all. Guess what. They decided to tell her that, \ndespite all those glowing performance evaluations, they are changing \ntheir mind on her if she would not go along, so she was either going to \nbe demoted or fired. She testified yesterday, when she was told by the \nacting general counsel of the Corps of Engineers that it would not be \nin her best interest to speak publicly about these things. Oh, really? \nI thank her for the courage and the others for their courage. I also \nthank Rory for the courage to speak out. I suppose it would be easier \nnot to speak out.\n  I will read the last sentence of the second paragraph of the \nstatement of Bunnatine Greenhouse:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR [Halliburton] represents the most \n     blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during \n     the course of my professional career.\n\n  I continue to ask the question: Is there somebody here who cares? Is \nthere somebody who has the reins of an authorizing committee that cares \nenough to begin a real investigation or shall we continue to hold \nhearings in the Policy Committee only because nobody else will?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n\n transcript of the testimony of rory mayberry, former food production \n    manager, kbr, senate democratic policy committee, june 27, 2005\n\n       My name is Rory Mayberry. I'm sorry that I'm not able to be \n     there in person to testify to the Committee, but I returned \n     to Iraq on June 14. I am working as a Medical Examiner and \n     Medic Supervisor for a company called Emergent Services.\n       I wanted to testify today about my experience working with \n     Halliburton in Iraq. I was hired by Halliburton subsidiary \n     KBR in January 2004 as the Food Production Manager for a \n     dining hall at Camp Anaconda, Iraq. I worked under the \n     Halliburton's LOGCAP contract from February 2004 until Apri1 \n     2004.\n       When I was assigned to the dining facility, KBR managers \n     informed me that there were KBR practices that were to be \n     followed everyday. These practices led to major overcharges.\n       First, KBR was supposed to feed 600 Turkish and Filipino \n     workers meals according to their custom. Although KBR charged \n     the government for this service, it didn't prepare the meals. \n     Instead, these workers were given leftover food in boxes and \n     garbage bags after the troops ate. Sometimes there were no \n     leftovers to give them.\n       Second, KBR charged the government for meals it never \n     served to the troops. Until late 2003, anaconda was a \n     transition site for army personnel. Because there could be \n     large numbers of extra personnel passing through everyday, \n     KBR would charge for a surge capacity of 5,000 troops per \n     meal. However, KBR continued to charge for the extra \n     headcount even after Anaconda was no longer a transition \n     site.\n       When I questioned these practices, the managers told me \n     that this needed to be done because KBR lost money in prior \n     months, when the government suspended some of the dining hall \n     payments to the company. The managers said that they were \n     adjusting the numbers to make up for the suspended payments.\n       I would prepare food orders each week in order to get the \n     food we needed at the camp in the coming week. The KBR \n     managers would triple the order every week to bring in much \n     more food than we needed. They did this because they were \n     charging an extra 5,000 troops they weren't actually feeding. \n     Most of this food went to waste though.\n       Third, KBR paid too much for the food itself. Initially, a \n     company called Tamimi Catering was KBR's sub-contractor for \n     the food. Tamimi paid local prices for the food products in \n     the towns and cities around the base in addition to orders \n     sent to their main office. Tamimi's pricing was fair for the \n     condition of the country. Then, KBR switched to a new \n     supplier, PWC. PWC's prices were almost triple what Tamimi's \n     were.\n       For example, tomatoes cost about $5 a box locally, but the \n     PWC price was $13 to $15 per box. The local price for a 15-\n     pound box of bacon was $12, compared to PWC's price of $80 \n     per box. PWC charged a lot for transportation because they \n     brought the food from Philadelphia. KBR switched from Tamimi \n     to PWC because Tamimi complained about KBR's poor treatment \n     of its staff; they were living in tents with sand floors and \n     no beds.\n       There were other problems that were not related to KBR's \n     costs:\n       Food items were being brought into the base that were \n     outdated or expired as much as a year. We were told by the \n     KBR food service managers to use these items anyway. This \n     food was fed to the troops. A lot of these were frozen foods: \n     chicken, beef, fish, and ice cream. For trucks that were hit \n     by convoy fire and bombings, we were told to go into the \n     trucks and remove the food items and use them after removing \n     the bullets and any shrapnel from the bad food that was hit. \n     We were told to turn the removed bullets over to the managers \n     for souvenirs. When I had the military check some of the food \n     shipments, they would turn the food items away. But there \n     wasn't any marking of the record, so KBR just sent the food \n     to another base for use. The problem with expired food was \n     actually worsened with the switch to PWC because it took \n     longer for the food items to get to the base as they were \n     shipped from the U.S. to a warehouse in Kuwait.\n       KBR also paid for spoiled food. When Tamimi dropped off \n     food, there was often no place to put it in to the freezers \n     or refrigeration. Food would stay in the refrigeration and \n     freezer trucks until they ran out of fuel. KBR wouldn't \n     refuel the trucks so the food would spoil. This happened \n     quite a bit.\n       In addition, KBR would cater events for KBR employees, like \n     management parties and barbecues. This happened about 3 times \n     a week. As a result, there were shortages of certain food \n     items, such as beef, chicken, pork, salads, dressings, and \n     sodas for the troops.\n       The food service personnel were given sanitation rules from \n     the Military Preventive Medicine information programs and \n     rules to follow by the Armed Forces, but KBR managers \n     informed us that the information was not to be followed, that \n     they knew best, and to keep following their instructions. So \n     our employees weren't following sanitation rules as set \n     forth.\n       Also, the Iraqi subcontract drivers of food convoys that \n     arrived on the base were not fed. They were given MREs, or \n     meals ready to eat, with pork, which they couldn't because of \n     religious reasons. As a result, the drivers would raid the \n     trucks for food.\n       Government auditors would have caught and fixed many of the \n     problems. But KBR managers told us not to speak with \n     auditors. The managers themselves would leave the base or \n     hide from the auditors when they were on the base and not \n     answer the radios when we called for them. We were told to \n     follow instructions or get off the base. The threat of being \n     sent to a camp under fire was their way of keeping us quiet.\n       The employees that talked to the auditors were moved to the \n     other bases that were under more fire then Anaconda. If they \n     refused to move, they were fired and sent home.\n       I personally was sent to Fallujah for 3 weeks. The manager \n     told me I was being sent away until the auditors were gone \n     because I had opened my mouth to the auditors. When I \n     returned from Fallujah, the convoy was attacked. I was put in \n     danger because the KBR managers didn't want me to talk with \n     U.S. government auditors.\n       When KBR wanted me to go to Tikrit, I headed home on \n     rotation. I wasn't officially fired and I didn't formally \n     quit.\n       I am happy to answer any questions the Committee may have \n     for me.\n       Mr. Mayberry, representatives of the Senate Democratic \n     Policy Committee have provided me with several questions that \n     they would like me to ask you now. Can I begin asking you \n     those questions?\n       Q: Are you saying that Halliburton deliberately falsified \n     the number of meals they prepared, and then submitted false \n     claims for reimbursement, and that they did this to make up \n     for past amounts auditors had disallowed?\n       A: Yes.\n       Q: So, when they couldn't get reimbursed legitimately, they \n     committed fraud by submitting these false bills?\n       A: Yes.\n       Q: How many meals were served at the dining hall each day?\n       A: 2,500 meals, per meal, times four. There were four \n     meals, breakfast, lunch, dinner and a midnight meal.\n       Q: So, every day, Halliburton was charging for 20,000 meals \n     it never served?\n       A: Correct. They were charging for 20,000 meals, and they \n     were only serving 10,000 meals.\n       Q: Was it rare for expired food to be served to the troops?\n       A: No. It was an everyday occurrence, sometimes every meal.\n       Q: You've described routine overcharging and unsanitary \n     practices by Halliburton, as well as shortages of food items \n     for troops because of private Halliburton parties. \n     Halliburton managers were not only aware of these practices, \n     they ordered them, is that correct?\n       A: Correct.\n       Q: How senior were these managers?\n       A: The managers, the main manager was a manager of all of \n     Iraq, assigned by KBR.\n       Q: So these practices may have been ordered at other dining \n     halls in Iraq?\n       A: Most likely, yes.\n       Q: When government auditors arrived, these senior managers \n     deliberately avoided them?\n       A: Yes.\n       Q: And these senior managers ordered you and other \n     employees not to discuss your concerns with the auditors?\n       A: Yes. We were informed if we talked, we would be rotated \n     out to other camps that were under fire.\n       Q: Is it fair to say that the managers used the threat of \n     transfer to a more dangerous base to intimidate employees \n     into keeping quiet?\n       A: Yes.\n       Q: When employees did talk to auditors, what happened?\n       A: All the employees that did talk to the auditors were \n     switched out to other camps or fired because they refused to \n     go to the other camps.\n       Q: Is there anything else you'd like us to know?\n       A: Not at this time.\n       Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Mayberry.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\nBunnatine Greenhouse, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Senate Democractic \n                Policy Committee Hearing, June 27, 2005\n\n       My name is Bunnatine H. Greenhouse. I have agreed to \n     voluntarily appear at this hearing in my personal capacity \n     because I have exhausted all internal avenues to correct \n     contracting abuse I observed while serving this great nation \n     as the United States Army Corps of Engineers (``USACE'') \n     senior procurement executive. In order to remain true to my \n     oath of office, I must disclose to appropriate members of \n     Congress serious and ongoing contract abuse I cannot address \n     internally. However, coming forward is not easy. On June 24, \n     2005, I met with the acting General Counsel of the USACE. \n     During the course of this meeting it was conveyed to me that \n     my voluntary appearance would not be in my best interest. I \n     was also specifically advised to clearly state that I do not \n     appear as a representative of the Department of the Army or \n     the United States Corps of Engineers.\n       I have been involved with government contracting for over \n     twenty years. On June 9, 1997 I was sworn in as the Principal \n     Assistant Responsible for Contracting (``PARC'') for the \n     USACE. Back then, the commander of the Corps asked me to do \n     what I could to end what could be called casual and clubby \n     contracting practices. To curb these practices I required \n     Commanders to strictly follow the\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\n     Federal Acquisition Regulations and began to institutionalize \n     the contracting practices the Corps had to follow. However, \n     as the command structure at the Corps changed, there was ever \n     increasing pressure to return to the old ways. My \n     determination to ensure that the Corps strictly adhere to \n     contracting regulations was no longer viewed as an asset and \n     I began to experience an increasingly hostile environment. \n     The hostility peaked as the USACE was preparing contracts \n     related to the Iraq War. At this juncture, the interference \n     was primarily focused on contracting activity related to a \n     single contractor, Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and \n     Root (``KBR''). The abuse I observed called into question the \n     independence of the USACE contracting process. I can \n     unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts \n     awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and improper \n     contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of my \n     professional career.\n       The independence of the USACE contracting process was \n     unquestionably compromised with respect to the issuance of \n     the Restore Iraqi Oil contract, known as RIO. I observed, \n     first hand, that essentially every aspect of the RIO contract \n     remained under the control of the Office of the Secretary of \n     Defense (``OSD''). This troubled me and was wrong. However, \n     once the OSD delegated responsibility for the RIO contract to \n     the Department of the Army, control over the contracting \n     process by the OSD should have ceased. However, the OSD \n     remained in control over the contracting process. In reality, \n     the OSD ultimately controlled the award of the RIO contract \n     to KBR and controlled the terms of the contract that was to \n     be awarded even over my objection to specific terms that were \n     ultimately included in the contract.\n       As the ramp-up to the Iraqi War escalated I was \n     increasingly excluded from contracting activity related to \n     the war effort. However, given my position, it was simply \n     impossible to completely exclude me from the process. When I \n     did gain access to some of the high level planning meetings \n     related to the implementation of the RIO contract I sensed \n     that the entire contracting process had gone haywire. I \n     immediately questioned whether the Corps had the legal \n     authority to function as the Army's delegated contracting \n     authority. The Corps had absolutely no competencies related \n     to oil production. Restoration of oil production was simply \n     outside of the scope of our congressionally mandated mission. \n     How then, I asked, could executive agency authority for the \n     RIO contract be delegated to the USACE? I openly raised this \n     concern with high level officials of the Department of \n     Defense, the Department of the Army and the U.S. Army Corps \n     of Engineers. I specifically explained that the scope of the \n     RIO contract was outside our mission competencies such that \n     congressional authority had to be obtained before the Corps \n     could properly be delegated contracting authority over the \n     RIO contract. Exactly why USACE was selected remains a \n     mystery to me. I note that no aspect of the contracting work \n     related to restoring the oil fields following the 1991 \n     Persian Gulf War was undertaken by the USACE, and there was \n     no reason why USACE should take over that function for the \n     prosecution of the Iraq War.\n       I further raised a concern over which contract authorized \n     payment for prepositioning work KBR was doing in anticipation \n     of being awarded the RIO contract. I was generally familiar \n     with the scope of the LOGCAP contract and was under the \n     impression that the LOGCAP contract was being used to fund \n     the initial preposition work being done by KBR before the \n     Iraq War commenced. I specifically questioned whether using \n     LOGCAP funding was legal and insisted that a new contract be \n     prepared. My concern over this issue ended when I was \n     apparently provided misinformation that a new contract had \n     been issued. This is the first time I can recall being \n     overtly misled about something as fundamental as the \n     existence of an underlying contract authorizing work to be \n     done.\n       I further raised a concern over the basis used to justify \n     the selection of KBR as the sole source contractor for the \n     RIO contract. I learned that a specific basis to be used for \n     the selection of the contractor was a requirement that the \n     contractor have knowledge of the contingency plan KBR \n     prepared for the restoration of Iraqi oil. The inclusion of \n     this requirement meant that the RIO contract would have to be \n     awarded to KBR because no other contractor participated in \n     the drafting of the contingency plan and no other contractor \n     had knowledge of the contingency plan itself after it had \n     been prepared by KBR. What was particularly troubling about \n     this arrangement was that contractors who are normally \n     selected to prepare cost estimates and courses of action, \n     such as the work KBR did when it prepared the contingency \n     plan, are routinely excluded from being able to participate \n     in the follow-on contract. The reasons for prohibiting the \n     contractor responsible for preparing costs estimates and \n     course of action from obtaining the follow-on contract is \n     obvious. The fact that it was a no-bid, sole source \n     contract meant that the government was placing KBR in the \n     position of being able to define what the reasonable costs \n     would be to execute the RIO contract and then charging the \n     government what it defined as being reasonable. Given the \n     enormity of the scope of work contemplated under the RIO \n     contract, the exclusion of the contractor responsible for \n     pricing out the scope of work to be done under the RIO \n     contract should have been an imperative. Instead, it \n     formed the basis of awarding the RIO contract to KBR.\n       Ultimately, I was most concerned over the continuing \n     insistence that the RIO contract be awarded to KBR without \n     competitive bidding for an unreasonable period of time--two \n     years plus the option to extend the contract an additional \n     three years. I raised this concern with officials \n     representing the Department of Defense, the Department of the \n     Army and the Corps of Engineers. However, when the final \n     Justification and Approval of the RIO contract was forwarded \n     to me for signature--after the draft had been approved by \n     representatives of the office of the Secretary of Defense--\n     the five year, no-compete clause remained in place. I could \n     not sign the document in good faith knowing that this \n     extended period was unreasonable. However, we were about to \n     prosecute a war and the only option that remained opened to \n     me was to raise an objection to this requirement. Therefore, \n     next to my signature I hand-wrote the following comment: ``I \n     caution that extending this sole source effort beyond a one \n     year period could convey an invalid perception that there is \n     not strong intent for a limited competition.''\n       I hand-wrote this comment directly onto the original \n     document because experience had taught me that a separate \n     memo outlining my concerns could inexplicably be lost. I \n     wrote my comment on the original J to guarantee that my \n     concern was not overlooked. Instead, it was just ignored.\n       The RIO contract was subjected to public scrutiny when, on \n     December 11, 2003, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) \n     issued a draft report concluding that KBR over-charged for \n     the purchase of fuel by $61,000,000. However, the firestorm \n     over this issue was significantly dampened a week later when \n     the Commander of the USACE, Lt. General Flowers, took the \n     unusual step of issuing a waiver absolving KBR of its need, \n     under the RIO contract, to provide ``cost and pricing data.'' \n     The Corps simply asserted that the price charged for the fuel \n     was ``fair and reasonable,'' thereby relieving KBR of the \n     contract requirement that cost and pricing data be provided.\n       However, the manner in which the waiver request was \n     prepared and finalized demonstrates that the USACE Command \n     knowingly violated the AFARS by intentionally failing to \n     obtain my approval, as the PARC. The evidence suggests that \n     the reasons why I was intentionally kept from seeing the \n     waiver request were politically motivated and driven by the \n     DCAA's conclusion that KBR had overcharged the government for \n     the fuel by $61,000,000, rather than whether the granting of \n     the waiver was in the interest of the government.\n       Significantly, it appears that a concerted effort was \n     undertaken to ensure that I was kept in the dark about the \n     waiver request. I have every reason to believe that the USACE \n     knew I would object to the granting of the waiver if it had \n     been presented to me for signature. So, I was specifically \n     kept in the dark and did not learn of the existence of the \n     waiver until I read about it in the press. Having reviewed \n     the documentation used to justify the waiver, I can \n     unequivocally state that I would not have approved it because \n     the documentation relied upon to justify the fuel charges as \n     ``fair and reasonable'' was grossly insufficient.\n       Eventually, a copy of the original J for the RIO contract \n     was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act \n     Request which prompted Time Magazine to attempt to find out \n     why I felt it necessary to document my concern. Time Magazine \n     contacted the USACE seeking permission for me to be \n     interviewed. I later learned that this caused great \n     consternation. According to sworn testimony given on October \n     15, 2004 by the Deputy Commander of the USACE, Major General \n     Robert Griffin, the Department of the Army was figuring out \n     how it was going to publicly respond and whether the Army \n     would officially allow me to speak to a Time magazine \n     reporter. According to MG Griffin, the problem was that I did \n     not ``know the Army's story'' so the Army had to figure out \n     who was going to respond. The difficult position the Army \n     found itself in, according to MG Griffin, ``was because she \n     wrote this informal note at the bottom of this document, \n     which actually makes my case, which is, you shouldn't write \n     on official documents because they get taken out of context, \n     somebody reads them and there you go.'' However, my comment \n     was far from an informal note, and it was not being taken out \n     of context. Rather, my concern had found its way to the light \n     of day.\n       As public pressure mounted, my involvement and past actions \n     related to the RIO contract became a thorn in the side of the \n     USACE. As a result stating my concern in writing on the \n     original RIO J and as a result of expressing other \n     significant concerns over contracting matters related to KBR, \n     I was eventually summoned to a meeting on October 6, 2004 at \n     which time I was issued a memorandum notifying me that I was \n     to be removed from the Senior Executive Service and from my \n     position as PARC. At that point I knew that my ability to \n     resolve the issues within the USACE had terminated. I had no \n     other alterative at that juncture but to file a formal \n     request for investigation with the then-Acting Secretary of \n     the Army and to appropriate members of Congress.\n       In closing, I would like to thank my attorney, Michael \n     Kohn, and the National Whistleblower Center, for the support \n     and unbelievably hard work they have put forth.\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\n     Without their effort I could not have survived the political \n     fire storm that burns around me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7485-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are setting the priority of amendments \nnow and consulting. We will have that decision made in just a bit. We \nwant to work on that. We have a lot of work to do this afternoon and on \ninto the evening. There have been some changes as far as amendments \nthat have been offered.\n  In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Isakson, be allowed to speak as in morning business for 10 \nminutes, followed by Senator Murray--how much time will the Senator \nneed?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Fifteen minutes, and after that, Senator Kerry will be \nrecognized, and Senator Akaka needs about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, as a Senator from Ohio, would like \nto know where I fit into that schedule.\n  Mr. BURNS. Right after the chairman is done with his duties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that 3 o'clock?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might make a point, because of the \nway the order is established, it could be 5 minutes after 3, but the \nSenator from Ohio will be in line following the Senators who have just \nbeen described by Senator Burns as having time. It should turn out 10 \nminutes, 15, 10, and 10, and it should turn out to be just about the \ntime the Presiding Officer leaves the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BURNS. First let me add something, if the Senator from \nMassachusetts will withhold?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to speak. It is a little longer than \n10 minutes. I do not know exactly how long.\n  Mr. BURNS. Then the Senator will follow the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that. I will follow the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. BURNS. And Senator Voinovich of Ohio, and Senator Akaka is after \nMr. Isakson. Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Voinovich, and Senator Kerry--\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the understanding was the Senator from \nWashington, the Senator from Hawaii, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nand then the Chair. It should be around 3 o'clock, and if the Senate \nproceeds now, we should be able to get there.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me see if we can clear this up without \ntaking more substantial time. Senator Isakson wants to speak for 10 \nminutes in morning business. We decided following that Senator Murray \nwould be recognized. She sought 15 minutes to speak on her amendment. \nFollowing that, Senator Akaka was to have been recognized for 10 \nminutes. At that point, before Senator Kerry came in, we had indicated \nthe Senator from Ohio would be recognized, and then Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts has asked to be recognized without a time limit.\n  The one thing that is unclear to me is how much time the Senator from \nOhio wishes. I know he wants to speak on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think we can lock all of that in understanding the \nSenator from Ohio could take the 10 minutes and then Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts would be recognized. I think that actually works out to \nabout 3 o'clock, in any event.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor allowing me this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7485-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7485-S7512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to take just a minute to address \n48 extraordinary hours in my life this past weekend I spent with the \nmen and women in the U.S. Armed Forces, first on Saturday in Ellijay, \nGA, at the funeral of 1LT Noah Harris of the U.S. Army, and then 24 \nhours later at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where I spent the day with U.S. \nArmed Forces in the work they are doing with the detainees in the war \non terror.\n  I wish to do the best I can today to speak for those with whom I \ntalked. I take responsibility for every word I say, but they are every \nbit a message from the people with whom I talked and who shared with \nme.\n  First, at the funeral of 1LT Noah Harris, I eulogized Noah on last \nThursday and made a promise that I would make it to Ellijay, GA, on \nSaturday to be at his service. He was a distinguished Georgian, and \nlike every other soldier who served and sacrificed, we mourn his death \nbut we praise his service to our country. But this was an extraordinary \nfuneral service.\n  A thousand Georgians--500 in the high school gym and 500 in the First \nMethodist Church--attended a 2\\1/2\\ hour service that passed in a \nmicrosecond, a service not by ministers but by laymen, Americans, \ncitizens of Georgia to praise Noah Harris but also to praise our men \nand women in harm's way.\n  When the service came to a conclusion, it was his mother Lucy and his \ndad Rick who talked for the last 20 minutes. To honor what they said \nand their son to the best of my ability, I want to recount it to all of \nyou.\n  Lucy stood up before that crowd of 500 and said: You know, when we \ngot the word of Noah's death, I knew I had two choices: I could mourn \nand I could be sorrowful and I could grieve, and I have done all those, \nbut I could also do the good and the godly thing, and that is to praise \nmy son and all those other men and women who fight in Iraq on behalf of \nfreedom and democracy.\n  She gave a beautiful and eloquent statement about the tribute her \nson's life was to that for which our men and women fight.\n  Then her husband stood up and asked rhetorically: What was it the \nAmerican press is really writing about today? Everything you hear about \nwhat is going on in Iraq is negative and wrong, questioning our motives \nand our reasons for being there. Yet in this church in quiet Ellijay, \nGA, in northwest Georgia, thousands had come to honor a man who had \nsacrificed his life in harm's way for the people of Iraq and the \nprinciples of this great Nation.\n  Rick Harris asked the question: Have we forgotten 9/11? Have we \nforgotten that since that date there has not been an attack on American \nsoil? Since we went after terror, wherever its exists, and since we \ncommitted the resources of our country, our Nation has been safer. And \nwhat we are doing is right--is not only right morally, but it is right \nfor the future of peace and freedom and democracy.\n  So for Lucy and Rick Harris, on behalf of their son, I rise today in \nthis Senate and send that message loud and clear that I got last \nSaturday from a thousand Georgians proud of their native son's service, \nsorrowful for his loss but appreciative of living in a country that has \nbeen willing to make the commitment we have made on behalf of freedom \nand democracy around the world and on behalf of the security of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  And then, Mr. President, I went to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I went with \ntwo other Members of the Senate. I went with a specific desire in mind: \nthe desire to go and see for myself that which I heard so many people \ntalk about and have seen so much about on television.\n  I learned something very interesting. There must be two Guantanamo \nBay, Cubas--the one I visited and the one all the news media talks \nabout because they did not resemble one another. I thought when I \nlanded at Guantanamo Bay and went to visit the detainees that I would \nsee men incarcerated in cyclone fences with razor wire on top of it. \nThat does not exist anymore. That was Camp X-Ray. It was closed 3 years \nago. It was the original temporary place we took the enemy combatants \nto until we could spend the millions of dollars to build the buildings \nthat now house them.\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\n  I saw 538 people who are intent on hurting and destroying Americans, \nwho are incarcerated in a facility from which we are gaining \nintelligence that is saving lives of Americans and citizens around the \nworld. The most hardened of those I saw are in air-conditioned \nfacilities, not unlike what I have seen in the United States in \nsheriffs' jails and prisons. The food they eat is unbelievable. The \nmedical care is first rate. The security is tight and, yes, they are \ncontrolled, but they are there because they are the enemies of our \nNation and were captured in battle in the worldwide war on terror.\n  After seeing all those facilities and having totally dispelled that \nwhich television shows, I had lunch with two Georgia sailors. I \npromised them I would bring a message back to the Senate. They are on a \n6-month rotation as guards guarding the enemy combatants, the \nterrorists who threaten America.\n  I asked them: If I could take back anything, what would you like me \nto do? They said: Please tell the American media to stop saying what \nthey are saying about what we are doing in Guantanamo because what we \nare doing is right and what is being alleged is not correct. And tell \nthem what we, the guards, the American soldiers, are subjected to.\n  The two gentlemen with whom I had lunch are two African-American \ncitizens of the State of Georgia serving in the U.S. Navy. They go 12 \nhours on and 12 hours off, 4 consecutive days guarding enemy \ncombatants. Every day, they have to take a shower more than once during \ntheir duty to wipe off and wash off the human waste that is thrown on \nthem by the enemy combatants they guard. They are subjected to racial \nepithets that we in the United States would never accept. They continue \nto stay on their post and do their duty, and there is no harm to the \nenemy combatants. They are sitting there guarding the people who would \ntake the lives of your loved ones and mine.\n  They are abused every day, and what is alleged by people in this \nChamber and other places about what may or may not be happening at \nGuantanamo is not correct. The people subjected to abuse are the men \nand women in the Armed Forces of the United States who take it from \nthose who would harm us and harm our loved ones.\n  They are standing guard in the front line in the war on terror. My \ntime is about up, but I came to the floor for this time to deliver two \nmessages. First, for Rick and Lucy Harris on behalf of their son, Noah, \nI hope I did an adequate job.\n  Second, to deliver the message by those two servicemen from Georgia, \nwho stand on the front line of the war on terror guarding the enemy \ncombatants from whom we are gaining the intelligence that is saving \nAmerican lives; enemy combatants who are treated well, fed well, \nclothed well, and medically treated well; enemy combatants who would \ntake the lives of our loved ones but because of the commitment of our \nPresident, this country, and the men and women in harm's way, are \nsafely incarcerated, and from whom we are gaining the information \nnecessary to win the global war on terror.\n  I hope tonight all Americans will watch our President on TV. I hope \ntonight in some small way the message I have brought back from those \nvalued soldiers will help us to remain to stay the course against the \nwar on terror for democracy and freedom and in support of this country, \nits leadership, and the liberty and freedom we all cherish and love.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to amendment No. \n1052, an amendment offered by myself, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nFeinstein regarding emergency supplemental funding for the Veterans \nHealth Administration.\n  As my colleagues know, throughout the last 6 months I have been \ntalking to this body about my deep concern that we were not going to \nhave sufficient funding for our veterans, both our current veterans who \nare accessing the system, nor for our veterans who are now returning \nhome in record numbers from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Throughout the budget process, I asked that we consider making sure \nwe have additional funding. I was rejected in that request. Throughout \nthe appropriations process, I have made it known time and time again \nthat looking at what we know, we are not going to have sufficient \nfunding for our veterans health care.\n  On the supplemental emergency bill, I offered an amendment to add an \nadditional $1.98 billion for veterans services, and I outlined on this \nfloor for all of my colleagues the exact numbers we were looking at as \nwe went out and talked to our regional veterans administrations, as we \nheard the stories of shortfalls in every single place across this \ncountry, about service men and women who are waiting in line, about the \nhigh number of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who would \nneed access to mental health care services for post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome, and I asked that we add emergency supplemental funding \nbecause I knew, looking at the numbers, we had a shortfall.\n  On this floor, I was defeated on that amendment. Why? Because the \nSecretary of the VA, Secretary Nicholson, sent a letter to this body \nsaying they had sufficient funds.\n  That was less than 3 months ago. Several weeks ago in the Veterans' \nCommittee I asked the Secretary, when he was before us, if they had \nsufficient funding, and he told us they had adequate funding.\n  Last Thursday, to everyone's surprise, except a few of us, we were \ntold that the VA is now over $1 billion short in funding this year. \nThis is surprising to some, but it should be appalling to all of us.\n  As I told my colleagues when I was on the floor talking about the \nsupplemental, we all know that the veterans in VA care have gone up by \n88 percent. We know that medical inflation has gone up 92 percent. But \nthe VA continued to go on a formula based on 2002 figures that did not \nadequately take into account our military who were going to be \naccessing the veterans services, nor the fact that we all know of \nmedical inflation.\n  So here we are today, and it would be easy to say I told you so, but \nthat is not going to solve the problem. So last Thursday, I called \nSecretary Nicholson. I said: How are you going to solve this problem? \nWhat are we going to do?\n  Well, he said to me that we were going to take the money out of \nmaintenance and construction projects.\n  I would let every one of my colleagues know that all of them have VA \nfacilities in their own States or in their own region that are serving \nour veterans today that need asbestos removal. There are new clinics \nthat have been promised for years. There is maintenance due, long-term \nbacklogs that have not been completed that we voted on in the 2005 \nappropriations bill and promised to our men and women back in our home \nStates would be taken care of this year.\n\n  We cannot go back on that promise right now. Those veterans are \nwaiting for that service. If we were to say, well, we have to suck it \nup and take the money out, that means we are just going to defer those \ncosts until next year. If we are today basing our figures of the VA on \n2002 numbers, then we know the $1.5 billion we are short this year is \ngoing to be multiplied by two or three times next year and those \nfacilities will not be fixed.\n  So we have a problem. We have a big problem, and we need to address \nit now. I believe the best and most important way we can do that \nquickly is through an emergency supplemental bill passed through the \nHouse and Senate to get the VA the money they need to serve our \nveterans. This is an emergency.\n  None of our veterans who served in previous conflicts should be told \nthat they have to wait 6 months or a year or 3 years. None of our \nveterans who are being served in our hospitals today should be looking \nat facilities that are falling down around them. None of our veterans \nwho are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan should be told that they \ndo not have adequate care and we are not there for them.\n  I was just in Iraq 2 months ago and the first question that my \nsoldiers from Washington State asked me is: Will my country be there \nfor me when I get home?\n  The Senate has been responsible by passing a bill last year to begin \nto put\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nin place those contracts, maintenance, and important facilities \nprojections. We cannot take that away now. Our only responsible choice \nremaining is to pass an emergency supplemental.\n  I have to say I am deeply concerned about how our VA came to this, \nand I am frankly quite angry. Less than 3 months ago, our VA said, no \nproblem. Our VA, 2-plus weeks ago, said no problem, and now they tell \nus they are well over a billion dollars short this year. In fact, what \nthey are saying is we can fix that; we can take $600 million from \nconstruction, as I just talked about.\n  We cannot let them do that.\n  The other $400 million they are talking about coming up out of a \nreserve fund. I have been on this floor before talking about this. \nThere is not a reserve fund. I asked Dr. Jonathan Perlin. He is the \nVA's Acting Under Secretary for Health. I asked him on April 5th: Is \nthere a $500 million reserve?\n  He said to me:\n\n       No . . . I do not know where that might have been \n     suggested, but there is no $500 million reserve that is \n     sitting there for future projects.\n\n  So the White House's solution, the VA's solution, to take $600 \nmillion from construction and $500 million from this reserve account \ndoes not exist. Those are already part of our appropriations and there \nis no reserve account. So it is time for us to be responsible. It is \ntime for us to face up to the fact that we have not been given accurate \nfigures from this administration on veterans, and we need to act \nresponsibly to pass an emergency supplemental.\n  I want to say that Senator Craig, the chair of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, and Senator Hutchison, the chair of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs, and Related Agencies, have been responsible in the last few \ndays by addressing this crisis. We have held a hearing this morning \nunder Senator Craig's direction to hear from the VA what their solution \nwas.\n  As I have said, that is simply unacceptable to me. It should be \nunacceptable to this Senate. I want to work with anyone to solve this \nproblem. We have an amendment that is now pending. It is amendment No. \n1052 to have an emergency supplemental to deal with this crisis. I know \nthat my colleagues on the other side feel that we must address this as \nwell, and I hope that we can work this amendment out and get it passed \non the Interior appropriations, get it passed through the House and \nsent to the President so that our members who are serving us, both in \nprevious conflicts and in Iraq and Afghanistan today, can look any one \nof us in the eye on the Fourth of July recess, when we all go home to \nmarch in parades and carry our flags, and we can say, yes, this country \nis there for you.\n  I can think of no more important issue that this body should address \nbefore the upcoming recess than this pending crisis before us. We owe \nit to the troops who have served us so honorably to be there for them \nwhen they come home. We cannot say to them that your clinics will not \nbe built, that your hospitals will not be maintained, that there is a \nhiring freeze and you will not be seen if you show up.\n  We all have talked to generals who are in Iraq, and every member of \nthis body knows that this is a 360-degree war. We have been told that \ntime and time again. Our members in the military who are serving us in \nIraq and Afghanistan do not have a front line to go behind to get some \nease from this conflict. They are in this conflict every single minute \nof every single day that they are there, and as a result of that many \nof them will be facing emotional stress and post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome when they get home.\n  It would be wrong of this country to tell those members who served us \nso well that there are no services for them when they come home. We \nhave a responsibility not as a Republican, not as a Democrat, but as an \nAmerican to be there for them. The most responsible way to do this is \nthrough this amendment with an emergency supplemental.\n  I think who said it best was George Washington back in 1789:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this emergency supplemental funding, \nget it to the House, and get it to the White House so that we can \naddress this crisis that has come before us. We can say a lot of stuff \nabout the VA and why the numbers were wrong and why what we knew on \nthis floor were not listened to and were not told to us honestly. We \ncan spend time doing that, but I think the most important thing we can \ndo is make sure this funding is there for our soldiers, and we do it \nthrough an emergency supplemental in a responsible way.\n  The President is going to address the Nation this evening. He is \ngoing to talk to us about the importance of staying the course in Iraq. \nWell, I would say to the President and to the Members of the Senate, \nwhen we send our troops to war, part of the cost of that is making sure \nwe are there for them when they come home. I urge the President, when \nhe addresses the Nation tonight, to tell us how this administration is \ngoing to be there for our soldiers when they return and work with us to \npass this emergency supplemental as expeditiously as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n\n                         Mutual Fund Regulation\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Securities and Exchange Commission--\nSEC--has been impressively led by Chairman William Donaldson. Chairman \nDonaldson inherited an agency in turmoil. The previous chairman left an \nagency with limited effectiveness and demoralized staff. The SEC needed \na vocal, imaginative, and forceful leader to restore the trust of \ninvestors.\n  Chairman Donaldson has accomplished much during his tenure, such as \nreform of the mutual fund industry, the implementation of Sarbanes-\nOxley, the registration of hedge funds, while improving the integrity \nof exchanges. He has been the friend and protector of investors. \nUnfortunately, this has brought him a lot of criticism. I have been \nimpressed by his ability to fight for what he considers to be in the \nbest interests of investors and the public. I was deeply saddened when \nChairman Donaldson announced his resignation. I am concerned about the \nfuture of the Commission after his departure.\n  In particular, I am worried about mutual fund reform. Mutual funds \nare of particular interest to me because they are investment vehicles \nthat millions of middle-income Americans utilize that provide \ndiversification and professional money management. Wealthier \nindividuals can have their own investment managers and private bankers, \nor invest in hedge funds. Mutual funds are what average investors rely \non for retirement, savings for children's college education, or other \nfinancial goals and dreams.\n  I was appalled by the flagrant abuses of trust among mutual fund \ncompanies that were discovered by New York Attorney General Eliot \nSpitzer and the SEC in 2003. Ordinary investors were being harmed due \nto the greed of brokers, mutual fund companies, and institutional and \nlarge investors. In November 2003, I introduced S. 1822, the Mutual \nFund Transparency Act of 2003. I introduced legislation to bring about \nstructural reform to the mutual fund industry, increase disclosures in \norder to provide useful and relevant information to mutual fund \ninvestors, and restore trust among investors. Several key provisions of \nthe legislation were the requirements that mutual fund chairman and 75 \npercent of board members be independent. The transgressions brought to \nlight made it clear that the boards of mutual fund companies are not \nproviding sufficient oversight. To be more effective, the boards must \nbe strengthened and made to be more independent. Independent directors \nmust have a dominant presence on the board to ensure that investors' \ninterests are the paramount priority.\n  I applauded the efforts of the SEC to adopt proposals that will \nimprove the governance of mutual funds and that mirrored provisions \nfrom my legislation. Again, Chairman Donaldson and the majority of the \ncommissioners have made great attempts to address the widespread abuse \nof investors by the mutual fund industry. The independence requirements \nare an important part of the Commission's response\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\nthat will ultimately lead to improved governance, better protect \nshareholders from possible abuse, and improve the transparency of fees. \nThe SEC requirements for an independent chairman for mutual fund boards \nand an increase in the percentage of independent directors to 75 \npercent are significant steps towards ensuring that independent \ndirectors are better able to protect shareholders' interests. I believe \nthat the Commission must go forward with the independence rule and \naddress the concerns raised by the Federal appeals court.\n  Several of my colleagues have written to the Commission saying that \nthe reissuance of the rule would be inappropriate. I respectfully \ndisagree. It is not out of the ordinary for outgoing agency leaders to \nmove rules forward prior to their departure. The uncertainy of the \nfuture of the independence rule for the mutual fund industry and of the \noutcome of the confirmation process, require that action be taken on \nthe rule as soon as possible.\n  On May 16, I reintroduced a modified version of my original bill, S. \n1037, to further strengthen the independence of boards, make investors \nmore aware of the true costs of their mutual funds, and prevent several \nkey reforms from being rolled back. Legislation is needed to ensure \nthat the increased independence rule is applied universally among \nmutual funds, not just those that rely on exemptive rules.\n  I look forward to meeting with Representative Cox to discuss mutual \nfund regulation, prior to consideration of his nomination by the \nSenate. It is my hope that Representative Cox will be as aggressive in \nprotecting investors as Chairman Donaldson has been.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to enact mutual \nfund reform legislation. I support the efforts to move the mutual fund \nindependence requirements forward and appreciate all of the hard work \nof Chairman Donaldson and the SEC staff on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the order we agreed on was to \nrecognize the Chair. I do not want to abuse that process. I will talk \nbeyond 3, but it will not be that extensive. I ask the Chair if it \nmeets with his approval to change the order so that I speak now and the \nChair will speak when he is relieved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How long does the Senator from Massachusetts \nseek?\n  Mr. KERRY. I can't tell you exactly, 15 or 20 minutes, somewhere in \nthat vicinity.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will take the chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I ask unanimous \nconsent to add Senator Jeffords and Senator Salazar as cosponsors to \nthe Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1010, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1010.\n  I ask unanimous consent the current order in terms of the amendment \nbe waived so we can discuss this amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is the pending business.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment that will address \nan issue that is becoming a problem in my home State of Ohio and a \nnumber of other States nationwide--the explosive growth of Indian \ngambling.\n  I thank Senator Enzi, Senator DeWine, Senator Vitter and Senator \nAllard for cosponsoring my amendment.\n  Currently, there are over 400 tribal casinos in 30 States. To build \non the success of these tribal casinos, some Native American tribes are \naggressively seeking to take gambling off reservations and into local \ncommunities all across the country--from States like California to New \nYork, Oregon to Florida, and my home State of Ohio.\n  In this practice, commonly referred to as ``reservation shopping,'' \ntribes are looking to acquire new, non-contiguous land to open casinos \nnear large communities or next to major roads with easy access.\n  A loophole in the law that regulates Indian gaming, the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, allows the Department of Interior to take land into \ntrust for a tribal casino, even at great distances from their home \nreservation, if it advances the economic interest of the tribe.\n  Originally, many reservations were located in rural areas at great \ndistances from population centers. They were unable to sustain \nprofitable casinos, so they moved casinos to areas near cities that \nwere part of the reservation. Now these casinos aren't enough--the \ntribes are looking at lands great distances from their reservations and \nnear population centers like Cleveland, Chicago, Miami, the Bay Area of \nCalifornia, to name a few.\n  In Ohio, the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma has filed a land claim \nin Federal court for 146 square miles throughout the State, alleging \nthat this land was illegally taken in 19th Century treaties.\n  They have also reached an agreement with four separate mayors in the \nState to site casinos in their communities, stating that a casino \ncomplex would bring new jobs and increase the tax base. In announcing \ntheir lawsuit, the Eastern Shawnee announced they would also try to \nblackmail the State of Ohio--they will drop the land claim in exchange \nfor the right to put an unlimited number of casinos in the State. The \ntribe's attorneys said the aim was not to seize cities and farms, but \nto negotiate a deal to open casinos where the tribe has been invited.\n  It is important to note here that the population of Ohio is more than \nthree times the size of the population in Oklahoma, where the Eastern \nShawnee already have a casino. The tribe sees dollar signs, dollar \nsigns that they will make at the detriment of my constituents.\n  In response to the threat of reservation shopping nationwide, the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee has held a number of hearings \ninvestigating the current issues, and Senator McCain, the Chairman of \nthe Committee, has indicated that he will be offering legislation this \nCongress to address the reservation shopping created as an unintended \nconsequence of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It is my hope that his \nlegislation will close some of the loopholes created by this law.\n  The amendment I have offered to the Interior Appropriations bill is \nsimply a moratorium on taking land into trust by the Department of \nInterior for the purposes of gambling unless the Governor of a State \nspecifically gives his consent. This moratorium will give Congress the \ntime needed to pass thoughtful legislation that will protect States \nfrom the threat to States rights that the proliferation of these \ncasinos will have.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask why I am opposed to the prospect of \nIndian casinos in Ohio. The answer is simple. This issue is really \nabout families. Back when I was a State representative and just \nbeginning my career in government, I was asked how I would confront the \nproblems of Ohio if I had a magic wand.\n  My answer then was the same as it is now: I would use it to \nreconstitute and protect the family, which is the foundation of this \ncountry and the reason why most of us get up in the morning, go to work \nand hurry to get home at the end of the day.\n  In the late 1980s, when I was Mayor of Cleveland, the first attack \nagainst our families was mounted by the backers of what studies call \nthe ``crack cocaine'' of gambling: casino gambling. Voters fought back \nat the polls in 1990. We defeated the effort to amend the Ohio \nconstitution that prohibits gambling in Ohio, but it wasn't long before \nit surfaced in Ohio again.\n  In 1996, as Governor of Ohio, I was proud to lead a coalition of some \n130 organizations, dozens of elected officials and thousands of \nindividual citizens, in defeating State Issue 1, another effort to \namend the Ohio constitution, the second ballot initiative that would \nhave legalized casino gambling.\n  So here we are in 2005 and it's deja vu all over again. It's a new \nmillennium, but the same forces are back, but this time they are joined \nby the Shawnee tribe. They have regrouped and reappeared in different \ndisguises.\n  This amendment, which just lasts one year, will guarantee that \nthrough\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nstealth this tribe and others can not sneak into the Department of \nInterior and get land taken into trust and abrogate the Ohio \nconstitution. It also gives urgency to the work by Senator McCain as he \ngrapples to deal with the proliferation of reservation shopping around \nthe country.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Governors Association. I \nask unanimous consent that the letter from Ray Scheppach, Executive \nDirector of NGA, be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this amendment is opposed by Senator \nMcCain as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. It is \nopposed by Senator McCain, not because he is not concerned about the \nproliferation of Indian gaming, but rather because he believes this is \nwithin the jurisdiction of his committee and that he is already \naddressing the issue.\n  He has indicated he will give me a hearing on my amendment right \nafter the July break. This issue of Indian gaming is a serious threat \nto the people of Ohio and other people throughout the country. It is an \nissue in terms of States rights and the States' Constitution and their \nability to deal with the issue of casino gambling.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully withdraw my amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                   National Governors Association,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2005.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: The nation's governors appreciate \n     your efforts to ensure that states continue to play a \n     meaningful role in the trust land acquisition process. The \n     Governors are committed to working with Congress, the \n     Executive Branch and Indian tribal governments to resolve the \n     Complex issues involved in the implementation of the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA).\n       By requiring the consent of the governor before land can be \n     placed into trust for gaming purposes, your proposed \n     amendment would underscore the governors' role in the trust \n     land acquisition process and in determining whether Indian \n     gaming is consistent with existing state gaming policy.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership in support of a \n     strong role for states in our federal system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Raymond C. Scheppach,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto express my continued concerns about the proliferation of off-\nreservation gambling by Indian tribes. I know that Senator McCain is \nholding a number of hearings in the Indian Affairs Committee to \ninvestigate this issue. I urge him to act quickly on this issue. It is \nvery important to my home State of Ohio.\n  Mr. McCain, I understand the Senator from Ohio's concerns, and \nappreciate the Senator not calling for a vote on his amendment. I will \nbe holding a hearing in the Indian Affairs Committee in July and would \nwelcome Senator Voinovich to testify at that time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership \nand accept his invitation to testify on this issue before his \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Let the Chair \nconvey thanks to the Senator for his patience before making his \npresentation. It is appreciated very much.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if I may, Senator Akaka had asked if he might make \nsome comments on the amendment of Senator Murray, and so I would ask \nunanimous consent that I can yield to Senator Akaka for 3 minutes and \nthen hold the floor after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nyielding me the time.\n  I rise today in support of the amendment to rectify the funding \ncrisis for VA health care. You heard Senator Murray expound on this \neloquently. This morning, the committee held a hearing on the \nrevelation that VA is more than $1 billion in the hole for this year. \nWith the VA's announcement, we at least now have an admission that the \nVA hospitals and clinics are in the red, and this is the first step in \nturning things around.\n  Despite the tremendous pressure to keep quiet, VA's dedicated \nproviders have been forthright with us about the fact that they were \nraiding capital accounts just to make ends meet. There seems to be some \nconfusion about what kinds of projects will be done because of the $1-\nbillion shortfall. We have asked for a specific list from VA and \nhopefully we will receive that shortly. At the very least, we are \ntalking about deferred maintenance, and anyone who is familiar with the \nmilitary knows that deferred maintenance means trouble for our troops. \nThe same is true for a hospital or clinic. The purchase and replacement \nof equipment directly impacts the quality of care provided. Let there \nbe no mistake about that. Deferring capital projects may also mean that \nneeded clinics--and there are more than 120 clinics in the queue--will \nnever come to fruition. My colleagues in the Senate will be familiar \nwith this issue. Indeed, we raised the issue earlier this year on the \nSenate floor. Unfortunately, VA officials denied that trouble was \nahead. Our amendment is a way to fix the problem. But let me say that I \nam open to any approach that ensures the highest quality health care \nfor our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1029, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii. Before \ntaking time to speak in morning business, I have a couple of procedural \nitems I need to do. One, I thank the Senator from Washington, speaking \nas a veteran and as somebody who has introduced an amendment that I am \nabout to ask be withdrawn. In fact, let me do that if I may, Mr. \nPresident. I call up amendment No. 1029.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is an amendment I had been working on \nin an effort to try to add money back to the VA, and I am delighted \nthat the appropriators, led by Senator Byrd and Senator Murray, have \nundertaken to do that now. So I would ask unanimous consent--I am now a \ncosponsor of their amendment--that I withdraw this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. Senator Murray could not be more \ncorrect, and I thank her on behalf of veterans all across the country \nwho understand how this game is affecting their lives. The fact is that \nthis funding is one of the hidden costs of the war and now no longer \nhidden, and veterans are beginning to feel it and VA hospitals across \nour Nation. She has been a tireless, tenacious advocate on behalf of \nveterans, and we are all very grateful to her and grateful to Senator \nByrd for their leadership.\n  (The remarks of Senator Kerry are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the pending \namendment No. 1052, which is the emergency supplemental funding for the \nveterans services which I spoke about earlier. I thank my colleagues, \nSenators Akaka and Kerry, for their remarks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators \nto our amendment as cosponsors: Senators Jeffords, Salazar, Bill \nNelson, Dayton, Rockefeller, and Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask for the regular order \nwith respect to the amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have cosponsored the amendment offered \nby my colleague from Washington. I want to make a couple comments.\n  It seems to me, on the question of what the priorities are around \nhere, what are the right choices, veterans health care has to rank \nright up at the top.\n  We had a hearing at one point. We had Secretary Rumsfeld come, and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. We asked a lot of questions about \nthis issue because I think everyone wants the same thing. We want to \nsay to young men and women who wear the uniform of this country: Please \nsupport this country's efforts. Go fight for freedom. Answer your \ncountry's call.\n  And when they do, and put themselves in harm's way--and most of us \nunderstand what ``harm's way'' means because we have been over to \nWalter Reed, we have been out to Bethesda Naval Hospital. We have seen \nthese young men and women with lost limbs, limbs that have been blown \noff, and all kinds of other wounds. We understand the sacrifice that is \nmade.\n  We asked the Secretary about the difference between someone who is a \nsoldier on active duty and someone who has come home to a hospital to \nbe treated for a lost leg or a lost limb or other devastating injuries \nand then is moved out of the service with a discharge--what is the \ndifference between the level of health care for an active-duty soldier \nat Walter Reed or Bethesda and a veteran in a veterans hospital \nsetting? Should there be a difference? No, there should not be. These \nare soldiers: active duty or retired, but soldiers.\n  I do not think there is a debate in this Senate about whether we \nadequately fund veterans health care. We all know the answer to that. \nThe answer is no, we are not adequately funding it.\n  So the question is, will this be a priority? Will the Congress, will \nthe Senate think this is as important as some other issues?\n  Someone once asked the question hypothetically: If you were asked to \nwrite an obituary for someone you had never met and the only \ninformation with which you could write that obituary was their check \nregister, what would it tell you about the person? You could take a \nlook and determine, what did that person spend money on? What did that \nperson determine to be valuable?\n  You could make the same case with respect to the Federal Government. \nTake a look at the checkbook and evaluate, what did we determine was \nimportant? What were our priorities? Where was veterans health care, \nbecause we know the esteem in which this country holds its veterans? We \nknow that starting with the poster that says ``Uncle Sam Wants You'' \npointed to the face of Americans for decades to say: Join the service, \nrepresent this country, support and fight for it, fight for freedom. We \nknow that call. But we also know a promise was made. The promise was, \nyou do this for your country and, when you come back, we will have a \nveterans health care system available for you.\n  Some say--not publicly--why have a veterans health care system? Why \nnot just have those folks go to a regular hospital? Especially after \nmajor wars, you don't ask that question because if you go to the \nveterans hospitals or Active-Duty hospitals that are treating these \nveterans, you will discover there is a kind of medical challenge that \nyou don't find often in other hospitals.\n  I visited a young man at Walter Reed a couple times. I had appointed \nhim to West Point. He is a proud member of the armed services. He went \nto Iraq. Because of an improvised explosive device, he lost his leg. He \ncame back, was in Walter Reed, and went through a long period when they \ndidn't know whether he was going to make it. He had a lot of infections \nand serious problems. He lost his leg right up to his hipbone.\n  Go visit those folks at the military hospitals or the veterans \nhospitals and understand these are different medical challenges than \nyou find every day at the hospitals in the inner cities or the \nhospitals in the suburbs. I am not saying other hospitals don't face \nchallenges. I am saying the wounds of war are deep, challenging. Go to \nthe orthopedic section out here and understand the difference. It is a \nbig difference.\n  I have told my colleagues about a Sunday morning at Fargo, ND. I will \ntell the story again because it is so important. It illustrates such an \nimportant point in support of my colleague.\n  A man served his country, left the Indian reservation when called \nduring the Second World War and served. His name was Edmund Young \nEagle--Native American, Standing Rock Reservation. He served in Africa, \nNormandy, Europe, served as his country asked him to, never complained \nabout it. At the end of the war, he came back to the Standing Rock \nIndian Reservation, lived, had a tough life, didn't have a family of \nhis own, loved to play baseball but had a tough life all of his life. \nToward the end of his life, he went to the Old Soldiers' Home in North \nDakota, and following that, he developed lung cancer.\n  His sister contacted my office and said: My brother has never had \nvery much, but he was always very proud of serving his country and \nnever received the medals he had earned for serving in Africa and \nEurope and Normandy during the Second World War. Could you help get his \nmedals?\n  So I did. I got the medals that this Native American had never \nreceived from his country for going all around the world and fighting \nfor America. By that time, Edmund Young Eagle was transferred to the VA \nHospital in Fargo with advanced lung cancer. In his late seventies, on \na Sunday morning, I went to his room at the VA Hospital with his \nmedals. His sister came. The doctors and nurses from the ward came and \ncrowded into Edmund's room. We cranked up his hospital bed to a seating \nposition, and I pinned on his pajama top the medals that Edmund Young \nEagle had earned fighting for his country in Africa, Normandy, and \nEurope.\n  This man, who would die 7 days later, said to me: This is one of the \nproudest days of my life.\n  He was a very sick man but enormously proud that his country had \nrecognized what he had done for America in the Second World War some 50 \nyears later.\n  The fact is, he and so many like him, particularly now, those Tom \nBrokaw called the ``greatest generation'' who went off to win the \nSecond World War, beat back the forces of nazism and Hitler, the fact \nis they are now at an age where they claim an increasing amount of \nhealth care in their late seventies, eighties, and nineties. There is a \nstrain on the VA medical health care system. Added to that, the Vietnam \nWar and the age of those veterans, the gulf war, now the war in Iraq, \nthis is a system that is straining at the seams.\n  My colleague offers an amendment. She has offered it before. I have \nsupported it previously on many occasions. It says: Let us, on an \nemergency basis, decide as a country that veterans health care is our \npriority. Let someone years from now look back at what we spent money \non and have some pride in knowing that we spent money on a priority \nthat was critically important, a priority that said to us: We will keep \nour word to veterans. We promised health care, if you served your \ncountry. Now we are going to deliver it.\n\n  It is not satisfactory to me and to many others in this Chamber to \ndecide that among a whole series of priorities, providing another tax \ncut is more important than providing health care or keeping a promise \nto veterans. That is not acceptable to me.\n  That is why I am happy to join. I mentioned a tax cut as one example. \nWe tried to offer an amendment to the emergency supplementals that \npreviously went through this Congress. We just had an $81 billion \nsupplemental, none of it paid for. We have now a $45 billion emergency \nsupplemental passed by the House that is coming this direction. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma made the point that we have increased spending. \nWe sure have increased spending. No question about that. Take a look at \nwhat has increased with respect to defense spending and homeland \nsecurity spending post-9/11. I have not opposed that spending. I happen \nto think we need to replenish Army accounts when you send troops to \nIraq. I happen to think we need more security at our ports and other \nplaces. But it seems to me logical that progressives, conservatives, \nmoderates, everything in between at some point ought to decide to get \ntogether and say: If we are\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\ngoing to spend this money, we ought to pay for it. Instead of doing \nthat, we have done emergency supplementals.\n  My colleague from Washington is saying, if you are going to do \nemergency supplementals for everything, how about doing it for the \nfirst and most important thing, and that is keeping our promise to \nAmerica's veterans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I wanted to ask if the Senator was aware that when our \namendment was offered on the supplemental, Senators on this floor were \ntold by the VA that they didn't need the funding. And last Thursday, \nthe VA announced that they were indeed well over $1 billion short for \nthis fiscal year alone for VA funding. That is why I needed to offer \nthis amendment on this bill, and hopefully the Senate will pass it. I \nhope it will pass unanimously tomorrow. Is the Senator from North \nDakota aware that is the situation we are now in?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Was there a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I was asking if the Senator from North Dakota was aware \nthat during the consideration of the emergency supplemental, when we \noffered our amendment, we were told by the administration they didn't \nneed the funding. And then last Thursday they announced that they were, \nindeed, as we had warned, well over $1 billion short. That is why we \nare offering this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say, that is why I support the amendment. It is a \nquestion of priorities. I know everyone has their own view of what \npriorities might be. One of the top priorities ought to be keeping your \npromise to America's veterans. I appreciate the amendment being \noffered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be added to the Byrd-\nCochran amendment No. 1053 as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is about time we got down to business \nthis afternoon and start taking care of some of these amendments. We \nwould like to dispose of this bill at least by tomorrow.\n  I call up the Coburn amendment No. 1002 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask for the regular order?\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. COBURN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is it not the offeror of the amendment who places in \norder the amendments that are called up and lays the other amendments \naside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Any Senator can ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1015, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1015 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment 1019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized in support of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we just heard a good observation about the \nincrease in spending, but it is important for the American people to \nunderstand, we did ramp up homeland security. We did ramp up defense. \nLet me read the increases in spending that have occurred in other areas \nsince 2001: legislative branch, 40 percent; judiciary, 40 percent; \nAgriculture, 25.7 percent; Defense, 55 percent; Education, 109 percent; \nEnergy, 48 percent; Health and Human Services, 53.1 percent; Homeland \nSecurity, 153 percent; Housing and Urban Development, 38.2 percent; \nJustice, 22.7 percent; Labor, Health, and Human Services, 57 percent; \nDepartment of State, 74 percent; Transportation, 40 percent; Veterans \nAffairs, 44.5 percent; General Services Administration, 404 percent; \nNational Science Foundation, 61 percent. The average has been almost 39 \npercent in the last 4 years. Outside of homeland security and defense, \nthe increase in spending by the Congress has been almost 30 percent.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate to talk about the spending \nproblems. I also want the American people to understand what is \nhappening to us presently. This chart represents the on-budget Federal \ndeficit. It is not the games that we play in Washington. This is the \ntrue amount of money we are going to spend that we don't have, that we \nare actually going to borrow money to pay for. As you can see, this \nyear it is going to be $544 billion. That is $544 billion that we are \ngoing to ask our children and grandchildren to pay back. There is no \nquestion that we have some belt-tightening to do. There is no question \nthat the authors of this appropriations bill have done some of that in \nthe bill.\n  The amendment I wish to focus on presently is an amendment that \nreduces funding for land acquisition within the bill by $121.2 million, \nfrom $154 million, for a total of $32.8 million.\n  The reasoning behind this amendment is, there is $92 million in \nreserve accounts right now to buy land that had not been spent this \nyear. The committee put forward another $154 million. Buying land to \npreserve our scenic heritage, natural wildlife areas, is a good goal. \nThe problem is, do we need to do it now when we are in a time of war, \nwhen we are borrowing from our children's future to be able to \naccomplish that? Is now the time to spend money on it? If not, is there \nanother need? Is there a priority on which we should be spending?\n  I would say that we need to have another priority. The current bill \nprovides funding for land acquisition through four separate programs: \n$12.3 million for the Bureau of Land Management, $40.8 million for the \nFish and Wildlife Service, $56 million for the National Park Service, \nand $44.9 million for the Forest Service. Within the amendment, land \nacquisition funding for both the Bureau of Land Management and the \nForest Service is eliminated, while funding for both Fish and Wildlife \nService and National Park Service is reduced by $32 million.\n  According to OMB and staff estimates, the estimated amount of \nunobligated balances for Federal land acquisition at the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year will be $92 million. OMB estimates that BLM will \nhave $28 million in unobligated balances. In contrast, the bill \nprovides an additional $12.3 million for BLM. U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, which is set to receive almost $41 million, will have an \nestimated $32 million in unobligated balances at the end of this year, \naccording to OMB.\n  Of the $121.2 million savings produced, $60 million in this amendment \nis transferred to a special diabetes program for Indians, and $61.2 \nmillion is transferred to the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program. Both \nprograms are with the Indian Health Service. Why is that important? \nThere are some important things about diabetes with Native Americans \nthat need to be recognized.\n  The question is, Do we spend money on land or do we spend money to \nimprove the people's lives that need us the most? We have a real crisis \nin health care in Indian Country.\n  The causes are many, but one controllable factor is the delivery of \nfederally funded health care services. Quality of care is severely \nimpacted by poor oversight, lack of competitive forces, and the serious \nlack of funding prioritization. My amendment addresses the latter. \nThere are 107,000 Native Americans that suffer from diabetes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:45 \nhaving arrived, the majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n   Tribute to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Longest Serving Kentucky \n                           Republican Senator\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a leader in \nthe Senate, a true partner in guiding the 109th Congress and my friend. \nToday, we mark a momentous occasion for the senior Senator from \nKentucky, Mitch McConnell.\n  With the opening of Monday's session, Senator McConnell surpassed the \nesteemed John Sherman Cooper as the longest serving Republican Senator \nin\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\nthe history of his State. Sworn in on January 3, 1985, Senator \nMcConnell has now served for over 20 years. For the last 2\\1/2\\ of \nthese, I have worked side by side with Mitch in our capacities as \nleader and whip. I could not have asked for a steadier partner in \nguiding this Senate to accomplishment. Leading over 4 dozen strong-\nwilled, independent Senators is not always easy. One of the things I \nlike to say about the leader's job is that it is something similar to \nbeing the groundskeeper at a cemetery: You have a lot of people under \nyou, but no one ever listens.\n  But more than anyone, Mitch is able to impress upon his colleagues \nthe importance of working together to move America forward. Mitch and I \nwork side by side not only as leader and whip, but also as Senators \nfrom the great States of Kentucky and Tennessee. Committed to the Union \nonly 4 years apart, our States share the common interests of \nagriculture and commerce, a common culture of southern ingenuity, and \nhospitality, and a border over 320 miles long.\n  I have worked with Mitch on regional matters important to our States \nsince I first entered this body in 1995. He is a fierce advocate for \nthe people of his State, and I have watched him with admiration. \nKentucky and Tennessee have a history of friendly partnership, and I am \nproud that Mitch and I work in that same spirit in the Senate.\n  Mitch and I have also both had the honor of being elected by members \nof our conference to chair the National Republican Senatorial \nCommittee, the organization in this body charged with maintaining and \nbuilding a Republican majority. Mitch chaired it from 1997 until 2001, \nand then he handed it off to me, from 2001 to 2003. Mr. President, \nthere was never a smoother transition from one NRSC chair to the next \nthan when Mitch turned over the keys to me in early 2001. Under his \nleadership, Republicans maintained control of the Chamber for over 2 \nelection cycles under very extreme circumstances. When he passed the \nchairmanship to me, the NRSC was debt free, something almost unheard \nof, and in better shape than he found it. His legislative \naccomplishments are just as impressive.\n  Through his chairmanship of the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Mitch has shaped America's policy on promoting freedom \nabroad so strongly that he has become literally a hero in oppressed \nlands throughout the world. He believes in using American might to \nsupport democracy and civil institutions in nations that know neither.\n  He is not afraid to call the tyrants by their names. In Burma, an \nillegitimate junta has held Nobel laureate and democracy advocate, Daw \nAung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest for the last 15 years. And 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, she succeeded in sending a letter to Senator McConnell \nthrough a very, very circuitous route. Let me say that it didn't just \narrive in his mailbox. She told him, in her words:\n\n       You have been such a stalwart supporter of democracy. We \n     have come to look upon you as a rock-like friend.\n\n  Whenever Mitch gives a friend or a cause his support, you can count \non him. Mitch has led the fight every year to impose import sanctions \non Burma, to force its tyrannical government to free Suu Kyi and stop \njailing and harassing the country's freedom fighters. His record on \nfreedom, protecting our national security, and promoting democracy \nabroad has been crystal clear and consistent since his first days in \nthe Senate.\n  One of his earliest votes upon entering the Senate was in favor of \nsanctions against the apartheid regime then in South Africa. Through \nthe appropriations process, he provided authority and funds to conduct \ndemocracy-building programs in Syria, Iran, and China. He has always \nbeen a staunch supporter of Israel which, along with Iraq, is one of \nthe few models of democracy and liberty in a region plagued by tyranny \nand intolerance.\n  Mitch was the author of language that forced Russia to withdraw its \ntroops from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in \n1994. Throughout decades under Soviet rule, those three countries never \nformally surrendered, and they maintained their embassies here in \nWashington, DC. Thanks to Mitch McConnell, the home soil of Baltic \nstates became just as free as those embassy grounds a little sooner \nthan otherwise.\n  Mitch is a solid rock when it comes to supporting freedom here at \nhome as well as abroad. Take his fight in defense of free speech and \nagainst the changes to our system of financing political campaigns \nknown as ``campaign finance reform,'' that was one fight he ultimately \nlost. But even in losing, he won the hearts of his comrades as we \nwatched him doggedly champion what he believed in--the first amendment \nand the right of every American citizen to have a free, unfettered \nvoice in our democracy.\n  His good friend, Phil Gramm, our former Senate colleague from Texas, \nsaid on this floor:\n\n       I don't know whether they will ever build a monument to the \n     Senator from Kentucky, but he is already memorialized in my \n     heart.\n\n  Senator Gramm, you are not the only one.\n  Mitch made his case with passion all the way up to the highest court. \nAnd when he lost there, he very graciously was the first to reach out \nand congratulate his long-time opponents and began healing the divide.\n  Mr. President, when I look at the impressive career of Senator \nMcConnell, studded throughout with so many successes--and, yes, a very \nfew defeats, but always refueled again and again by his relentless \nenergy--I have sometimes wondered, where does that drive come from?\n  Perhaps the answer lies 60 years in the past. Mitch's dad, A.M. \nMcConnell, was fighting overseas in World War II. While he was away, 2-\nyear-old Mitch contracted the dreaded disease polio. In 1944, before \nDr. Jonas Salk invented his vaccine, polio very likely meant paralysis, \nsickness or death.\n  Mitch's mother, Dean, took her son to Warm Springs, GA, the polio \ntreatment center that President Roosevelt established. Learning from \nthe therapists there, she put him through a strenuous, tough regimen of \nphysical therapy to save the use of his left leg. She made her son \nexercise his leg three times a day, and it was drilled into his head \nthat to protect his leg, he had to refrain from walking on it. That \nhardly sounds like an easy reality for a typical 2-year-old. But she \nwas successful. To this day, Mitch credits his mother with teaching him \ndetermination and tenacity.\n  Today, the world is virtually free of polio, with only about a \nthousand cases diagnosed every year. Most of those are in the \ndeveloping nations. Through his subcommittee chairmanship, Mitch has \nappropriated over $160 million in the last 6 years toward wiping out \nthe deadly virus. Those funds go to the U.N., The World Health \nOrganization, and other agencies that take Dr. Salk's lifesaving \nvaccine into the world's poorest countries and deliver it to people who \nneed it, bringing us closer and closer to eliminating polio once and \nfor all.\n  No Kentucky history book would be complete without portraits of Henry \nClay and Alben Barkley. Henry Clay dominated his State and this Senate \nin the 19th century and Barkley in the 20th. Well, I submit that Mitch \nwill be viewed in the same light for the 21st century. Why? Because \neven with all of the accomplishments he has behind him, I predict that \nhis greatest contributions are still ahead with his wife and life \npartner, who is a leader in her own right, Elaine Chao, at his side.\n  Like Clay and Barkley, Mitch speaks with a voice of principle. He is \na rocklike friend to his fellow Senators, to this institution, to his \nState, to his country, and to defenders of freedom the world over.\n  I join my fellow Senators in congratulating my friend, the majority \nwhip, on reaching this milestone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Bunning, is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague \nfrom Kentucky, the senior Senator, Mitch McConnell.\n  Today is somewhat of a historic occasion for my friend, this Senate, \nand the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  As of yesterday, our colleague, Mitch McConnell, became the longest \nserving Republican Senator in Kentucky history. He surpassed the \nservice of the legendary Senator from Somerset, John Sherman Cooper.\n  For over 20 years now--7,481 days, to be exact--Mitch has honorably \nserved Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\n  In all that time, Kentuckians have been getting solid leadership and \nrepresentation here in the Senate. Mitch is an effective and devoted \nlegislator working hard on behalf of the bluegrass State. I could not \nhave had a better partner in my fight for Kentucky.\n  Some of my friends may not know what kind of role Mitch has played in \nKentucky's political scene. He has helped lead the fight to build the \nthriving, vigorous, two-party political system that Kentucky enjoys \ntoday.\n  Mitch McConnell helped set the growth of Louisville--home of the \nKentucky Derby--in motion over 20 years ago when he served as judge-\nexecutive of Jefferson County. Many of the initiatives he launched then \nto expand the city's economic growth and prestige have since borne \nfruit many times over.\n  In 1984, Judge McConnell made history with his election to the \nSenate. He was the only Republican to defeat an incumbent Democratic \nSenator anywhere in the country. He was the first Republican to be \nelected statewide in Kentucky since 1968.\n  For a lot of people, that would have been enough. But not for Mitch. \nThanks to him, 1984 was not just one election for one man. It was the \nbeginning of an emerging and competitive two-party system in Kentucky.\n  Once upon a time, most Kentucky Republican organizations could hold \ntheir meetings in phone booths. I remember those days vividly and \nsomewhat fondly because in the early 1980s, I was just one of nine \nRepublicans in the Kentucky State Senate.\n  I bet that sounds good to some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle, but in all seriousness, one-party rule is not good for anyone, \nincluding the party in power. If parties do not have to compete to sell \ntheir ideas, they stop coming up with new ideas and they get lazy. The \npeople they serve are left without a voice because the people in power \nhave no incentive to listen. I believe that to be true no matter which \nparty is in power.\n  In the eighties, Senator McConnell saw us all laboring under one-\nparty rule and decided to do something about it. He helped recruit \ncandidates to run, and he never shied away from explaining the \nRepublican message every where he went. And he did it all with his \ntrademark-focused determination.\n  Many of my colleagues know that once Mitch sets his sights on \nsomething, no one will outwork or outthink him in pursuit of his goal.\n  I am a witness to this. I first ran for the Congress in 1986, and I \nwon. At that point, and in getting to know Mitch much better, it was \nalready clear that Mitch had goals for Kentucky's Republican Party.\n  After helping to lay the groundwork for many years, these goals began \nto pay off. In 1994, we saw two Republicans--Ron Lewis and Ed \nWhitfield--win seats in the U.S. House of Representatives that had been \nheld by Democrats for years. In 1996, Congresswoman Anne Northup won \nanother seat in Louisville held by a Democrat. Congressman Ernie \nFletcher joined them in 1998, and Congressman Geoff Davis, last year, \nwon back my old fourth district House seat. Today, Kentucky sends a \nlargely Republican delegation to Congress, and my colleague worked hard \nto help make that happen.\n  When I decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 1998, and when I ran for \nreelection in 2004, Mitch was there for me. His help was phenomenal and \nsaid so much about our friendship.\n  Mitch also helped influence Kentucky's State government. For decades, \none party had a lock on the statehouse and the Governor's mansion, but \nthat is not true today. Republicans gained control of the Kentucky \nSenate in 1999, and in 2003, they captured the Governor's mansion. I \nknow Mitch was involved in these races to help build a viable two-party \nsystem in Kentucky.\n  Mitch has been a great friend in the Senate. In fact, he is my best \nfriend in this body. But he has also been a great friend to the good \nfolks of our Commonwealth over the last 20 years.\n  Last year, Mitch and I worked hard in the Senate on the passage of a \ntobacco buyout for our Kentucky tobacco farmers. This is one of the \nmost significant events in the agricultural history of Kentucky. That \ntobacco buyout literally saved the livelihood of tens of thousands of \nKentucky tobacco farmers, their families, and the communities in which \nthey live. That old quota system that dictated to the farmers how much \ntobacco they could sell was broken. My office and Senator McConnell \nreceived thousands of letters and phone calls from Kentuckians pleading \nfor help. We answered their pleas and, Mitch, our Senate majority whip, \nhad a major role in pushing this ball over the goal line.\n  Throughout my service in the Senate, I could not have asked for a \nbetter comrade in arms than Mitch McConnell. Mitch, is a fighter. When \nhe is on your side, you feel unstoppable. When he is not, you know you \nhave an uphill battle to fight. But he is always fighting for what he \nbelieves in and what is right. Kentucky is lucky to have him, and so is \nthis Senate.\n  Mitch, I appreciate you, and I am proud to call you my best friend in \nthe Senate. Congratulations on your milestone. You have my vote for \nKentucky's political hall of fame.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Under the previous order, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I extend my thanks to the \nmajority leader for his exceptionally generous remarks about my service \nhere, and I also want to take this opportunity to thank him for the \nextraordinary leadership he has provided over the last 2\\1/2\\ years. It \nhas been a great pleasure working with the Senator from Tennessee \nalmost every day as I try to assist him in conducting a chorus on our \nside that is occasionally slightly off key but, generally speaking, \nsinging the same tune.\n  To my good friend and colleague from Kentucky, we share the same \nconstituency. We have similar views on how America ought to be led. It \nhas been a distinct pleasure, I say to my friend from Kentucky, to be \nassociated with him, to enjoy his own electoral success, which has been \nquite extraordinary given the rather limited number of Republicans who \nhave been elected to the Senate from our State. I thank him for his \nincredible, generous remarks.\n  Mr. President, I stand here today with a bit of disbelief. Forty-one \nyears ago, as a young man long on desire but short on achievement and \ncertainly devoid of connections, I met the man I considered to be one \nof the greatest Senators in Kentucky's history and certainly the \ngreatest in my adult lifetime, John Sherman Cooper. I was 22 years old, \nhad just graduated from the University of Louisville, and was intent--\nabsolutely intent--on getting a Senate internship as the first step up \nwhat I hoped would be the ladder to a life of accomplishment.\n  Senator Cooper reached out and lifted me up to that first rung. He \ntook me on as an intern in his office, and this was at a time when many \nSenators did not have internship programs at all. He gave me a chance \nto do that. I had the pleasure of being the only intern in the office \nand to stay for the entire summer--June, July, and August. So he became \nmy boss, and he also became my mentor, and he became my friend. In \nfact, he was the first great man I ever met.\n  Now I stand in the same Senate Chamber as Senator Cooper, the longest \nserving Republican Senator in Kentucky's history, until yesterday. I am \nfilled with gratitude for his helping hand, gratitude for Senator \nCooper, and for a country where there are no limits to one's success.\n  Senator Cooper served for 7,479 days. My fellow Kentuckians elected \nhim to this body five times. But Senator Cooper had a most unusual \nrecord of service. It was not unbroken, nor was he elected to a full 6-\nyear term until his fifth race for the Senate. In fact, to serve his \nnearly 21 years he stood for election seven times. He won five and he \nlost two. He also lost a race for Governor before World War II. But he \nwas never afraid to put himself before the people of Kentucky and be \njudged. He knew who he was and he knew where he stood. To borrow a \nphrase, he had the courage of his convictions.\n  To most Kentuckians, Senator Cooper was our emissary to places of \npower. I viewed him with simpler eyes. He was my hero. I learned more \nfrom him than from anyone else I have encountered in all of my years in \npublic life. He taught me how to be a Senator. And he taught everyone \nwho knew him\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\nthe value of integrity, forthrightness, and moral character.\n  Senator Cooper stood fast for what he believed was right, no matter \nhow large the opposition and no matter what the cost, even if that cost \nmight mean his seat in this Chamber. When President Andrew Jackson \nsaid, ``One man with courage makes a majority,'' he was talking about \nJohn Sherman Cooper.\n  I saw that firsthand during my summer here in Washington in 1964. \nThat was the summer of my internship in the Senator's office. It was \nalso the summer of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and we all remember \nwhat a dramatic struggle that bill was.\n  Until that point, the Senate had been, for the most part, a graveyard \nfor civil rights bills since reconstruction, courtesy of the \nfilibuster. But as my generation was keen to say at the time, things \nwere a-changing.\n  By mid-June of 1964, the Civil Rights Act had been debated in the \nSenate for 57 days. One Senator filibustered against it by speaking on \nthe floor for over 14 hours. But not John Sherman Cooper.\n  Senator Cooper had advanced equality for every American citizen for \nhis entire public life. In the 1930s, as county judge of Pulaski County \nin south central Kentucky, he felt moved to help his African-American \nconstituents who were hit hard by the Great Depression just as much as \nhis White ones who were equally devastated. He was known to take money \nout of his own pocket to buy a meal for a starving family of any color. \nIn the 1940s, he was one of the first Kentucky circuit court judges to \nseat Blacks on juries.\n  In 1963, he tried to pass a bill barring discrimination in public \naccommodations. It was filibustered, just like all the others. He was \ndetermined that the 1964 Civil Rights Act would not meet the same fate.\n  Senator Cooper's office was besieged with mail from thousands who \nopposed the bill. Some just were not ready for this measure, although I \nam proud to say that things have come a long way since then.\n  Despite the considerable opposition back home, Senator Cooper never \nwavered. Steadfastly and with clear vision, he worked to get the votes \nto break the filibuster.\n  I must admit, seeing him stand his ground was a bit exciting for a \nyoung man. But I wondered how he could hold fast against such forceful \nopposition. So perhaps crossing the line of decorum between Senator and \nstaff that existed in those days, I asked him one day: How do you take \nsuch a tough stand and square it with the fact that a considerable \nnumber of people who have chosen you have the opposite view? His answer \nis one I will always remember.\n  He said, ``I not only represent Kentucky, I represent the Nation, and \nthere are times you follow, and times when you lead.''\n  From that one simple statement, I learned first-hand what I had never \nlearned in school. Senator Cooper followed the Jeffersonian model of \nrepresentative democracy: Put succinctly, the people elect you to \nexercise your best judgment.\n  He did not think a leader was someone who wet his finger and stuck it \nin the air to see where popular winds blew. He believed that even if \nvoters don't agree with every position a leader might take, they would \nsee that leader trying to do the right thing, they would respect that, \nand they would support him, or disagree with him and vote him out.\n  Senator Cooper believed that a leader should stand up for what he \nthought was right, regardless of the opposition, or the cost.\n  I think he stuck to this principle so firmly because he learned it \nthe hard way. As I said, his career was filled with many peaks, but \nalso a few valleys.\n  In 1939, he made his first bid for statewide office with a run for \nGovernor, but did not even win the primary. He won his first statewide \nrace in 1946, in a special election to fill a partial term in the U.S. \nSenate. But when he ran to hold the seat in 1948, the same electoral \nwave that propelled President Truman to a surprise second term, \nproducing that famous ``Dewey Defeats Truman'' headline, also swept \nSenator Cooper and many other Republicans out.\n  It probably did not help that Kentucky's other Senator, Alben \nBarkley, the majority leader and a beloved Kentucky figure, was \nTruman's running mate.\n  Senator Cooper won his seat back in 1952, again for a partial term, \nwhen Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower sat atop the ticket. But he lost the \nseat in 1954, when he ran against the one Kentucky politician more \npopular than he, Alben Barkley, now a former Vice President running to \nreturn to the Senate.\n  He came back in 1956 to win his old Senate seat, and this time he \nheld it until retirement in 1973. So he had three partial terms before \never being elected to a full term.\n  In 1966, his last election, he set a record for the largest margin of \nvictory for a Republican in Kentucky history, a record that held for \nnearly 40 years until one of his former interns broke it in 2002.\n  Senator Cooper's peers on both sides of the aisle respected his \nwisdom and gravitas. But he was defeated by Senator Everett Dirksen for \nRepublican leader in 1959, by a vote of 20 to 14--not exactly a \ncliffhanger as leadership races go.\n  Senator Cooper knew the bitterness of loss as well as the sweetness \nof victory. It is a sign of the respect he commanded, from both \nparties, that after every loss a new door opened, often as an important \ndiplomatic assignment on behalf of the President of the United States.\n  After his defeat in 1948, President Truman asked him to serve as a \ndelegate to the newly formed United Nations, alongside Eleanor \nRoosevelt. After his 1954 loss, President Eisenhower appointed him \nAmbassador to India, a crucial post, as this newly independent country \nwas weighing whether to align with the free world or the Soviet bloc.\n  After his retirement from the Senate, President Ford called him back \ninto public service to be America's first ambassador to East Germany. \nWith all this diplomatic experience, I think Senator Cooper brought a \nperspective to foreign-policy issues that the Senate may have otherwise \nlacked.\n  As Senator Cooper's intern, I also had the pleasure of meeting his \ncharming wife, Lorraine. Their marriage was proof of the old adage that \nopposites attract. Where he was soft-spoken, unpretentious, and humble, \nshe was vivacious, full of good humor, and very much a member of high \nsociety. She threw many Washington parties, and in fact even though it \nwas not a Washington party, I think I had my first glass of champagne \ncourtesy of Lorraine Cooper.\n  Lorraine was not a native Kentuckian, and few would have mistaken her \nfor one. When Senator Cooper ran in 1956, some of his aides recommended \nhe campaign without her. He would hear none of it. Lorraine marched \nthrough every small, rural Kentucky town in her pinwheel hat and \nbrocade dress, carrying a silk parasol and an emerald-studded cigarette \nholder, and they loved her.\n  At a diner in Berea, in central Kentucky, a woman admonished Lorraine \nfor smoking at the lunch counter. ``Listen,'' Lorraine replied. ``I'm \nsupporting the state's most valuable crop.''\n  The first Tennessean who was majority leader of the Senate, Howard \nBaker, likes to tell the story about Lorraine Cooper. Right after he \nwas chosen Republican leader, the phone rang and it was Lorraine Cooper \non the phone. She said: Howard, do you have time to see me?\n  He said: Well, of course.\n  So Lorraine Cooper got an appointment, came up to the Senate, walked \ninto his office and sat down and she looked at him. She said: Now, \nHoward, do you have any money?\n  Senator Baker said: Yes.\n  She said: You need new clothes.\n  Then she got up and walked out.\n  Senator Cooper was a confidante to Presidents. He and Lorraine were \nthe first dinner guests of John F. Kennedy after the latter's election \nto the Presidency in 1960. I know my good friend, Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts, has said that his brother the President thought very \nhighly of Senator Cooper, as did he.\n  Senator Kennedy once said that Senator Cooper ``always brought light \nto the problem, rather than heat.'' What a wonderful description of \nthis kind, thoughtful, wise and honorable man.\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\n  Let me add to Senator Kennedy's description that Senator Cooper \nshowed the same compassion and courtesy to the Kentucky farmer, to the \nCapitol Hill intern, or to the destitute of the Third World, as to the \npowerful and the mighty.\n  I know this from personal experience. One day in August 1965, I \nreturned to Senator Cooper's office after completing my internship one \nyear before. I was then a law student, having finished my first year at \nthe University of Kentucky College of Law.\n  I was waiting to see Senator Cooper when suddenly he appeared and \nmotioned for me to follow him. We walked together from his office in \nRussell 125 to the Capitol Rotunda, where I saw more people, and more \nsecurity, than I had ever seen before. Then Senator Cooper told me what \nwas happening: President Johnson was about to sign the Voting Rights \nAct that Senator Cooper had worked so hard and courageously to pass in \n1965.\n  Sure enough, the President of the United States emerged. Every good \nbiography of President Johnson describes him as a larger-than-life man, \nwith an imposing physical presence. Let me testify right now that they \nare correct. President Johnson seemed to tower a head taller than \nanyone else in the room. He had a huge head, massive hands, and a \ncommanding figure that immediately filled the Rotunda.\n  I was overwhelmed to witness such a moment in history, and moved that \nmy hero, at the spur of the moment, had brought me to witness it.\n  I stayed close to Senator Cooper for the rest of his life. When I \nfirst won election to this body, Senator Cooper was retired and living \nin town. He invited me to stay at his home when I came to town to be \nsworn in. He would regularly come to my office to visit.\n  Harry Truman once said, ``If you want a friend in Washington, get a \ndog.'' It doesn't sound like he had a very pleasant introduction to \nWashington. Mine could not have been more different. Senator Cooper \ngave me, as a new Senator, the gift of his 20-plus years of experience. \nWe remained close, even as his health began to falter near the end of \nmy first term.\n  John Sherman Cooper died in 1991 at 89 years old. Kentucky lost a \nleader, and the Senate lost a valued friend. Somewhere in a small town \nin Kentucky, a young boy or girl eager to enter public service lost a \nhero. I lost all three.\n  If not for John Sherman Cooper, I would not be here today. If not for \nhim, all of the lives he touched--the farmer and the businessman, the \nindigent and the rich, the white and the black, the powerful and the \nleast among us--would have a little less justice, and slightly narrower \nhorizons.\n  I stand here 2 days past the 7,479 days that grand gentleman graced \nthis floor. To a kid whose dreams and ambitions greatly outstripped his \nmeans of ascent, I cannot begin to describe how that feels. It's \nhumbling, and bittersweet. He looms in my memory. But I think of him \ntoday just as I first did on that bright day in 1964, a giant among men \nand a role model for life.\n  Thank you, Senator Cooper. You gave me more than I can ever repay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I do not know how one signs on to all of \nwhat was just stated by my friend from Kentucky. I can also compliment \nhim in a couple of areas and say that I would not be here had it not \nbeen for him. I do not know if I should mourn or celebrate that.\n  Nonetheless, if anyone ever visits Kentucky and takes in the \ntraditions of Kentucky, they will find out the former Senator was a \npart of that landscape and the present-day Senator is the same way. So \ncongratulations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor back to the Senator from Oklahoma on his \namendment where we were interrupted, amendment 1019, which is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. We were in the midst of talking about whether we buy land \nor take care of diabetes with native Americans. That is what this \namendment does. It is obvious we are not going to be able to trim the \nspending in this bill, but it certainly is not obvious that we cannot \nreprioritize.\n  Let me give some facts and figures on Native American diabetes \ncompared with diabetes in every other group in this country. The \nnational U.S. population rate for diabetes is 6.3 percent. For Native \nAmericans between 45 and 74 years of age, it is 45 percent, 7 times the \nnational average. The most extensively studied, the Pima Indians, an \nestimated 50 percent of that population suffers from type II diabetes.\n  Native Americans who have diabetes suffer from increased rates of \nkidney failure, amputations, blindness, heart disease, and stroke. End \nstage renal disease in Native Americans with diabetes is six times \nhigher than any other group in this country. Diabetic retinopathy, \ni.e., blindness from diabetes, occurs in 24 percent of Native Americans \nwho have diabetes. Only 2 to 4 percent of the diabetes in the Native \nAmericans is type I; 98 percent of it is type II diabetes.\n  Alcohol and substance abuse is where the other half of this money \ngoes. Nineteen percent of Native American youth age 12 to 17 are \nconsuming alcohol at an alarming rate, headed for addiction; 12.8 \npercent of the young 12 to 17-year-olds engage in binge drinking. That \nis five or more drinks, weekly. HHS estimates that 7.6 percent of \nNative Americans over the age of 26 are classified as heavy alcohol \nusers. American Indians are five times more likely to die of alcohol-\nrelated causes than other groups and they face significant increases in \ncarcinoma of the liver and chronic diseases such as psoriasis.\n  Mortality rates from alcohol and substance abuse are seven times \nhigher in Native American populations than in the general population.\n  This amendment does not cut funding. It simply moves money from land \nto people, moves money from the purposes of why we are here to care for \nthose who cannot care for themselves. I would say in Oklahoma, it is \nvery evident to see the underfunding for the Indian Health Service, the \nnumber of true full-blooded Native Americans who cannot receive care \nthat was promised under treaty to get the care they need for their \ndiabetes, for alcohol abuse, and other substance abuse.\n  This is a simple amendment. I understand a budget point of order is \ngoing to be raised against it because it spends money faster than the \nland acquisitions do. I plan on moving to waive that point of order, \nbut I would say to my friends on the committee, and I would say to the \npeople of America, should we be buying more land when we cannot afford \nit? And if we are going to spend the money anyway, should we not be \nspending that on something that is going to increase the quality of \nlife and increase the health care of those who are least fortunate in \nour society?\n  I would also ask, having looked at this and then refer to the \nincreased spending since 2001, how many Americans have received a 39-\npercent pay increase since 2001? That is how much Federal Government \nspending, discretionary spending--that is not Medicare, that is not \nSocial Security, that is not Medicaid, but discretionary spending--has \nrisen. It is time for us to tighten our belt. This is one way to move \nthe priorities back to where they should be in terms of caring for real \npeople, not land.\n\n  The other point that I would make is when we buy land it costs us \ntwice. No. 1, it takes it off the tax rolls which decreases the amount \nof income coming to the States, local communities, and municipalities. \nBut No. 2, it markedly increases costs to care for that land. With $92 \nmillion unspent from last year, we are going to spend another $40 \nmillion to $50 million to maintain that land and close the purchase.\n  With that, I yield to the chairman of the subcommittee and thank him \nfor the time to allow me to present my case.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. The argument is made \nthere are very few of us here who do not look for extra funds to put \ninto IHS, and especially in the diabetes program. We know that is \nimportant.\n  This year, the committee has included an additional $135 million to \nsupport Indian health services. This is the largest increase in many \nyears targeted specifically at providing greater support for hospital \nand clinical services, dentistry, nursing, diabetes, and\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nother important health services. Funds for population growth and \nmedical inflation have been included for the first time in probably a \ndecade or more.\n  This increase comes at a time when most other agency budgets in the \nbill are not growing--in fact, many are declining. For example, EPA is \nreduced $144 million below their current year level; the Forest Service \n$648 million below; and the National Park Service, $52 million below. I \npoint to these reductions both to underscore the commitment all of us \nshare to improving health care in Indian country, but also to \ndemonstrate that increases for any one agency come at the expense of \nothers.\n  My colleague's amendment proposes to add funds to the special \ndiabetes program. This program was initiated through the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 and reauthorized in December 2002 to provide $150 \nmillion annually for 5 years beginning in 2004. These are not \nappropriated dollars, it is a mandatory spending program for the \nprevention and treatment of diabetes within Indian communities. In \naddition to this program, the IRS itself spends over $100 million \nannually from within its appropriation to address diabetes treatment \nand prevention. There are also other programs funded outside this \nbill--the Centers for Disease Control comes to mind--that direct funds \nto Indian country for diabetes work. I mention these programs to \nhighlight the fact there are significant resources being dedicated to \ndiabetes work now with this committee's support and we are encouraged \nby the impact these funds are having in Indian communities.\n  Alcohol and substance abuse is another area where we are directing a \nsubstantial amount of funding into tackling this problem. This budget \nproposes a $6.3 million increase bringing the total for these efforts \nup to $145.3 million. Of this funding, 97 percent goes directly to \ntribally contracted or compacted programs. The committee has been an \nadvocate for this program and has worked to increase funding over the \nyears.\n  Funding levels for these two programs may not be in amounts that are \nideal, but they are significant. Other programs of importance to our \nMembers were proposed to take substantial reductions in the budget \nrequest, which we have struggled to restore. In the end, as I have said \nbefore, we have to strike a balance in this bill. I think the committee \nbill does a good job of hitting this balance and I urge Members to \nsupport the committee position.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is no question a significant amount of money is \nbeing spent on these two programs, but when you compare it to every \nother group in this country, what you see is about $1 compared to $3 \nfor everybody else in terms of diabetes. You cannot very well square \nthat when there is six times the rate of end-stage renal disease in \nNative Americans. That is an important point because if you can prevent \nend-stage renal disease, you save $50,000 per year per person in not \nhaving them on dialysis, as well as the fact it is a miserable life \nbeing on dialysis.\n  So the point is that there are increases. I will recognize that. I \nstill say how in the world can we justify buying land when we are \nstealing $541 billion from our grandchildren? And No. 2 is why not \npeople instead of land? That is a legitimate question, especially in an \nunderserved segment of our population that needs the dollars that will \nmake a tremendous difference. I would just ask the Senator, can't we \ncome to an agreement that a portion of this money should be moved to \nsolve this very tragic problem that affects and afflicts Native \nAmericans at a higher rate than any other group in this country?\n  Mr. BURNS. This bill has such a delicate balance that there could \nbe--and I will raise it--a budgetary point of order. That is what we \nhave to work with. The Senator from Oklahoma knows how to work with \nbudgets and how we work with appropriations. It proposes to add $121 \nmillion to the Indian Health Service for a special diabetes program and \nan alcohol substance abuse program. The offset would be derived from an \nequivalent reduction in land acquisition. This transfer of funds \nresults in a change of outlays that causes the bill to exceed its \noutlay allocation.\n  Now we might work on offsets in some other areas. As to the argument \nthat you would make about land acquisition, we have always had land \nacquisition, but we have also had land sales. I wish I could stand here \nand report to you that we had as many sales as we have had acquisitions \nbecause I, for one, support the idea that there should be no net gain \nof land by the Federal Government. I come from county government. I \nknow whenever the Government buys land, it takes it off the tax rolls. \nIt hurts me as a county commissioner to provide all the programs that I \nhave been asked to provide at the county level. In fact, we passed some \nlegislation at one time when I first came here, which I was part of, of \nno net gain--or no net loss--whichever way you want to define it.\n  The way this is structured does raise a point of order, and I will \nraise that point. The pending amendment offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma increases discretionary spending in excess of the 302(b) \nallocation to the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies of the \nCommittee on Appropriations. Therefore, I raise the point of order \nagainst the amendment according to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I \nplan, in a moment, to move to waive the point of order, but before I do \nthat I think every American ought to be asking the question this is \n$544 billion which we are going into the market and borrowing on budget \nthis year, $544 billion that our kids and our grandkids are going to \nhave to pay back at a minimum of 6 percent interest every year. So we \nare going to pay back about $2 trillion on this $544 billion. That is \ngoing to be about $70,000 apiece that we are going to wrangle their \nfuture with. And the question is, Should we be buying more land if we \nare going to put our kids in debt?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises that the point of \norder is not debatable.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. COBURN. I do. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is debatable, and the \nSenator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. The question the American people have to ask themselves \nis, if we are going into hock and we are going to put this kind of lien \non our kids, should we be taking money off tax rolls? Should we be \nspending more money to maintain the land? Or if, in fact, we are going \nto do this, should we not see an outcome that reduces our cost by \nreducing insulin dependence type 2, by reducing dialysis? I believe the \nchoice is very clear, that we ought to be taking care of those who need \nus the most and not add land that is going to add cost. In fact we \nshould, invest in those people where we are going to decrease the cost \nof the Indian Health Service. With that, I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n       Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I had to be absent from the \n     Senate today, and I missed votes beginning with the motion to \n     waive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 1019, \n     offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn. I had to \n     miss the votes in order to travel to Charlotte, NC, to \n     participate in a Base Realignment and Closing, BRAC, \n     Commission Regional Hearing at Central Piedmont Community \n     College. I am not absent from the Senate on days when we have \n     votes without good reason.\n       This afternoon there was nowhere more important for me to \n     be than at the BRAC Regional Hearing, which is part of the \n     process whereby the fate of the 130th Air National Guard \n     Wing, based in Charleston, WV, will be decided. I believe it \n     is a crucial part of my duty as a United States Senator from \n     West Virginia to protect the 130th. While I respect the \n     difficult work done by members of the BRAC Commission, and \n     understand that their preliminary recommendations were made \n     in a good faith effort to improve the efficiency and efficacy \n     of our armed services. However, I believe that gutting the \n     130th is wrong and I must make every effort to oppose it.\n       The 130th plays an important role in our national security, \n     as well as the security of\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\n     the greater Washington area. It has also provided hundreds of \n     National Guard personnel who responded to the call of duty in \n     Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In addition to 340 full-time \n     Guard members, the 130th employs 201 federal technicians, and \n     more than 80 active guards. The State of West Virginia also \n     employs more than 50 State employees whose jobs depend on the \n     continued presence of the 130th. At a time when enlistments \n     and retention for both our National Guard units and regular \n     Army are suffering, the 130th had 96 percent reenlistment, \n     fifth in the nation. Every single job in West Virginia is \n     sacred to me, and as these jobs also protect my home State \n     and are a vital part of our military family and national \n     security, I believe very strongly that they should not be \n     cut.\n       With regard to the amendment by Senator Coburn, I believe \n     he made very persuasive arguments about problems in Indian \n     Country of diabetes and drug and alcohol addiction. When you \n     consider that Native Americans from the ages of 45-74 have a \n     rate of diabetes roughly seven times the rate for all \n     Americans, and that drug and alcohol addiction is rampant, I \n     believe most of our colleagues would feel that all that can \n     be done to help the Indian Health Service--IHS--combat these \n     plagues should be done.\n       However, we are in a time of severe fiscal constraints, and \n     I commend the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for \n     successfully completing the difficult task of meeting so many \n     priorities as best they could. The underlying bill contains \n     about $100 million in appropriated funds for diabetes \n     programs under the IHS, and there are more than $150 million \n     available in mandatory spending in other programs targeted at \n     the same problem. Similarly, the bill funds alcohol and drug \n     abuse programs at $145.3 million. Senator Coburn would have \n     shifted additional funding to those important causes by \n     transferring funds to be appropriated for land acquisition. \n     The bill contains only about $154 million for Federal land \n     acquisition. While IHS diabetes and drug treatment programs \n     surely could have benefited from an extra infusion of cash, \n     it was also important to fund the land acquisition program at \n     a reasonable level.\n       I will support efforts to adequately fund all programs of \n     the Indian Health Service, and while I would have opposed the \n     Coburn amendment, I commend him for his obvious and careful \n     attention to this matter.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment \nbe set aside. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma has another \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1053\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator from \nMontana, my understanding is that we have a request from Senator Byrd, \nand I believe Senator Cochran, that on their behalf, the Byrd \namendment, amendment No. 1053, be adopted by voice vote. My \nunderstanding is that both sides have had that request of Senator Byrd \nand Senator Cochran. I wonder if we might be able to accomplish that, I \nwould ask the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is perfectly amenable to me. In fact, I would suggest \nthe pending business be set aside and call up amendment No. 1053.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be adopted by voice \nvote.\n  First, the unanimous consent is to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1053) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran to establish a Memorial to \nMartin Luther King, Jr. on the Washington Mall.\n  A memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr. in the heart of the Nation's \nCapital is a fitting tribute to a man whose vision and courage \ntransformed the face of our Nation. Only a short distance from us here \nin the Capitol, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his famous ``I Have \nA Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. His \ninspirational words resonated with many Americans and helped spark the \ncivil rights movement.\n  Dr. King started as a civil rights leader during the Montgomery bus \nboycott. Despite the bombings, arrests, and violence that Dr. King \nfaced as a leader of this boycott, he continued to push for change. The \nMontgomery bus boycott successfully brought the glaring inequities \nfacing African Americans to the fore of the American consciousness. In \nresponse to the boycott, the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed racial \nsegregation on intrastate busses. However, as we know, Dr. King did not \nstop with this one legal victory.\n  Dr. King continued to tirelessly advocate for the principles of \nnonviolent protest as a means of addressing the injustices facing \nAfrican Americans. Even in the face of tremendous opposition and \ncynicism, Dr. King persevered and helped concentrate the civil right \nmovement's momentum for change. It is largely due to Dr. King's efforts \nthat Congress rightly passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Over 4 decades later, I believe we are coming closer day by day to \nachieving Dr. King's dream, but still, more progress must be made. To \nmemorialize Dr. King's dream here in our Nation's Capital would serve \nas a powerful reminder of the strides we have made but the steps we \nmust still take together as a nation to weed out inequity.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to cosponsor this amendment with \nSenators Byrd and Cochran to honor this great individual with a \nmemorial in Washington, DC. The $10 million authorized by this \namendment will help expedite the building of this memorial, which shall \nserve to remind future generations of Dr. King's sacrifices and his \nlasting legacy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of this proposed legislation be printed in \nthe Record immediately following this statement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1003\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1003. I would like \nto be recognized to speak on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending, and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to call the attention of the Members to page \n8 of the report language on the Department of Interior, Environment and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill, 2006. No. 7 is entitled, ``Report \nLanguage.'' I think it is important that we understand what this says. \nIt says:\n\n       Any limitation, any directive or any earmarking contained \n     in either the House or Senate report which is not \n     contradicted by the other report, nor specifically denied in \n     the conference report, shall be considered as having been \n     approved by both Houses of Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not have objection to that other than the fact \nthat the American people, when the report comes out of conference, will \nhave no way to measure the earmarks, the directives, and other things \nin that bill without that inclusion. This amendment requires that any \nlimitation, directive, or earmarking be included in the conference \nreport. This amendment is about sunshine so that if you get the \nconference report you can actually tell what is earmarked, what is \ndirected, what is limited by the language that individual Senators have \nplaced in the bill. I do not expect this amendment to pass. I \nunderstand that. But I think in one of the steps of us ever getting to \nthe point where we do not leave this heritage of tremendous debt to our \nchildren, sunshine has to come in. And when we pass a bill out of \nconference, the conference report ought to say what is in there, just \nlike it does when we have a conference bill on the Senate side or a \nconference bill on the House side.\n\n  The current report language actually abdicates our authority in \nlooking at what the House earmarks or what the House limits as a body. \nWe do not get a chance to look at that because it is not in the report \nlanguage coming out of conference. I believe the Senate has a \nresponsibility to vote on everything that is in that bill and have \nknowledge of everything that is in that bill. The only way a Senator \nwill be able to know that is to take the House language in their \nreport, filter through the Senate language, and figure out what is and \nwhat is not included.\n  This amendment requires that all provisions must be included in the \nconference report. It allows both the Senate and the House the \nopportunity to vote on all provisions, as opposed to only those which \nhappen to pass through their respective Chambers.\n  I believe the American people expect us to do that. I believe this \nbody was, in fact, intended to look at what the\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\nHouse does. I believe the conference report ought to share what the \nHouse has limited, directed or earmarked for the benefit of individual \nMembers or individual States, cities or otherwise.\n  So with that, I yield to the Senator from Montana and ask that he \nwould support this amendment. It is a simple change. It is a change for \nopen and more transparent Government. It is my belief that it is \nsomething we ought to consider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. We all live by sunshine, I would tell the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I think--I will have to ask counsel on this--whenever the House \npasses their bill and sends it to the Senate, and we take that bill to \nour committee, both the subcommittee and the full Committee on \nAppropriations, that House bill contains all of their earmarks. And \nsome of those earmarks are covered up, agreed. But that bill is \navailable for the Senators' perusal whenever it comes over here.\n  Now, most of these, however--recommended by the House and the Senate \nboth--appear in the tables of the statement of the managers that \naccompanies that conference report. They are all there. All you have to \ndo is kind of look for them. Some of them are not because the two bills \nare merged.\n  So in order to get the bills balanced out, merged, and back on the \nfloor with a conference report--and you have to remember, the staff \nreads that whole bill, every word, before it is in its final form and \ncomes back here for final consideration--some of those do get covered \nup. But in each body, all of those earmarks are a matter of public \nrecord, what goes on in their committees on the House side and the \nSenate side. This is to facilitate getting that report put together, \nthe bill coming back on this floor, and getting it passed.\n  So what the Senator is asking for is more time between the time the \nHouse passes it, we pass it, it goes to conference, and then getting it \nback on the floor and full disposal of the conference report.\n  So it is not to hide anything. The way it is done is not meant to \nhide anything. And nothing is hidden. You just have to follow the trail \nin order to dig it out. And I realize sometimes the public would have a \nhard time doing that. But as a Senator, we even have to work at it at \ntimes. But, basically, that is the reason for the process: to save \ntime, take some of the load off the staff that has to put this \ntogether.\n  So I would ask that the body oppose this particular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think we are in a time when we can take \nthe time to make sure the American public knows what is in the bills. \nAs a matter of fact, I think it is wrong if we do not take the time. I \nread almost every bill. I am one of the few Senators who do. I can tell \nyou that I will struggle through a House bill and then have to subtract \nout the conference bill to find out what was deleted from the House \nbill to be able to know what is and what is not there.\n  That is not sunshine for the American people. It is barely any \nsunshine for a Senator. I restate, the fact is, we ought to make it \neasy for the American people to find out where we are spending the \nmoney. A conference report that does not make it easy, does not direct \nwhere the money is directed, where the earmarks are, where the \nlimitations are, is less than what the American people deserve.\n  This is a simple request. It will not add that much time. It is all \nprinted out. In the conference, you all know what you are going to \nagree to and what you are not going to agree to. It is taking one \ncomputer screen: You punch ``copy,'' and it goes into the report.\n  So I would beg to differ with the chairman. I love him dearly. I \nthink he is a great man. But I think the American people deserve to \nknow what is in every report that comes out of here in terms of \nspending so they can make an evaluation: Are we doing the right thing \nmortgaging the future of our kids? Is it legitimate?\n\n  But to pass a conference report that does not give that pathway to \nthem, for them to see and make that judgment, I think is wrong.\n  I think it will help us as the Senate, as we look at what the other \nbody does, to put that in that report. I believe anything less than \nthat says we do have something to hide. We may not have anything to \nhide. But not being very transparent and very clear about what the \nlimitations, earmarks, and directives are in a bill is something less \nthan what the American people deserve.\n  I ask the chairman again to reconsider his opposition to this \namendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Well, I will tell you, I have read those conference \nreports, also--even the bills that come over from the House--like you. \nIf you have a clear paper trail, and you read everything, about 80 \npercent of all earmarks are contained in the conference report. There \nare just a few that are matched up, and we do not get to see them in \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I will. I am still going to fight for the 20 percent. How \nis that?\n  Mr. COBURN. But the point is, don't the American people need to see \nthat 20 percent? Shouldn't they be able to see that 20 percent?\n  Mr. BURNS. Sure. Listen, I helped pass a law with Senator Lieberman \non E-Government. Any citizen can go to their computer and dial it up \nonline, and they can follow it all the way through. There are ways of \ndoing that. I was part of that debate on E-Government. And we are going \nto do another E-Government bill that is going to open it up even wider, \nwe would hope.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Do you believe the average American can get on a \ncomputer, after this bill comes through conference, and see where all \nthe money is spent?\n  Mr. BURNS. I would answer that by saying those citizens who are \nreally, really interested in how we budget and how we spend do have the \ncapabilities and the knowledge to access that information and to follow \nit.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1002, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1002 of the Interior appropriations bill be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to \nspeak for 5 minutes prior to the vote. I know we have two important \nvotes that will be coming up shortly. But I did want to take this \nopportunity to indicate that I am very proud to be cosponsoring the \nMurray amendment concerning the important resources that are needed for \nveterans health care today.\n  The midyear budget review of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nconfirmed what many of us have known for some time; that the VA is \nfacing at least a $1-billion shortfall in meeting critical health care \nneeds for the current budget, the 2005 budget. As a result, the VA \nofficials say they are forced to take $600 million away from funds to \nimprove VA hospitals and other infrastructure and to borrow $400 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nfrom funds already committed to provide health care during the next \nfiscal year. The end result is that the quality of health care for our \nveterans will suffer. Essential services and programs are now at \nrisk. This is not acceptable. We need to act today to do something \nabout it.\n\n  We are creating more veterans, as brave men and women come home from \nIraq and Afghanistan and around the world. Over 360,000 veterans have \nalready returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, and over 86,000 have sought \nhealth care from the VA. The VA's patient growth for this year rose by \n5.2 percent, an increase of over 3 percent from their original \nprojections. We have men and women coming home every day, changing one \nhat for another. They come home with the assumption that we will keep \nour promise to make sure health care is there for them.\n  We know there are an additional 740,000 military personnel also \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan. This next generation of veterans will \nalso be eligible for VA health care, putting further demands on the \nsystem. Continued funding shortfalls and rising costs have already \nresulted in unprecedented waiting times for veterans seeking care. In \nmy State of Michigan, I talk with veterans who have to wait 6 months to \nsee a doctor. This is simply not acceptable. The VA's enrolled patient \npopulation has increased 134 percent. Funding for the VA has only \nincreased 44 percent.\n  It really isn't about funding. We know this involves dollars. The \nreal issue is whether we are going to keep our promise to our veterans \nwho have kept their promise to each of us in fighting for our freedoms. \nThe President's budget fails to keep this promise. I was proud, as a \nmember of the Budget Committee, to be involved in efforts to turn that \naround. In the budget process this year, we did offer an amendment that \nwould have increased the dollars for veterans health care. That was not \nsuccessful at the time. Now is the time that we can make this right.\n  I also mention that in the President's budget this year, instead of \nadding the dollars needed for our brave men and women who are coming \nhome and putting on the veterans cap, we saw a proposal to double \nveterans prescription drug copays from $7 to $15 per prescription and \nan increase of $250 in an enrollment fee for more than 2 million of our \nveterans. I was pleased as a member of the Budget Committee to lead the \neffort that took that out of the budget that came before the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing proposed cuts with the budget proposed \nby the President, deep cuts in our VA nursing homes and private homes, \nState VA nursing homes. We are seeing continued efforts to roll back \ndollars rather than increase them.\n  I hope what we will do long term is move our veterans health care \nfunding over to be mandatory funding rather than having to go through \nthe budget process every year. We know that our veterans put their \nlives on the line for us without question. They are not asking will \nthose funds we promised really be there for them. They assume we will \nkeep our promise. Every year, we are debating whether veterans health \ncare is fully funded. Now is the time to make this a mandatory promise \nthat we keep based on the needs of our veterans, not a debate about the \nbudget. We need an emergency supplemental to address this crisis.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor with Senator Murray. I commend her for \nthe amendment. We also need to take a hard look at this year's budget \npriorities and ask why we are not putting our veterans at the top of \nthe list.\n  I urge support for the Murray amendment. Then we must get about the \nbusiness of making sure that we are getting it right for our veterans \nevery year, that we are fully funding their needs, the promises we have \nmade to each veteran who is serving us today, served us yesterday, and \nwill serve us tomorrow.\n  I urge adoption of the Murray amendment and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment that I am sponsoring with Senators Murray and Byrd, to \nprovide the Department of Veterans Affairs with an additional $1.42 \nbillion in emergency funding to shore up dramatic new shortfalls in the \nVA health care system.\n  Our soldiers are returning home from Iraq and the front lines of the \nWar on Terror by the hundreds, to begin their transition back to \ncivilian life--and they deserve our assistance and respect.\n  In California alone, there have been nearly 100,000 men and women \ndeployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, all of whom will be eligible for at \nleast two years of VA medical services when they return.\n  Over 1,400 Californians have been wounded during operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Many of these recent veterans suffered injuries that \nwill require specialty care for the rest of their lives.\n  Moreover, many of our combat veterans could have mental wounds we are \nnot even aware of yet.\n  A report issued by the Government Accountability Office in September \nof last year found that:\n\n       Mental health experts predict that because of the intensity \n     of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan 15 percent or more of the \n     servicemembers returning from these conflicts will develop \n     post-traumatic stress disorder--PTSD.''\n\n  This is in addition to the veterans currently accessing the VA health \ncare system.\n  And now, we have learned that the VA's budget forecast projections \ndid not adequately provide for soldiers returning from Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  How, if we know this, can we sit by and insist that there is no \nproblem? This budget crunch is not just on paper.\n  In San Diego County alone, 4,000 more veterans have been treated by \nthe VA this year as compared to last, and we are still three months \nfrom the end of the fiscal year.\n  This includes over 1,700 soldiers returning from combat in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. At the same time, the number of backlogs for appointments \nis growing, leading to longer wait times for veterans.\n  And the Los Angeles Times reported on March 20, 2005, that over the \nlast decade, the VA hospital in Los Angeles has reduced the capacity of \nin-patient psychiatric beds from 450 to 90. Meanwhile, over the same 10 \nyears, Los Angeles has seen an increase of 28 percent in mental health \npatients.\n  The crunch is coming and we need to start preparing. This amendment \nstarts the preparation.\n  But I want to be crystal clear, this amendment only addresses needs \nthis year. Much more work will need to be done in fiscal year 2006.\n  It appears that the fiscal year 2006 VA budget request also made use \nof similar data forecasting as this year's, making it highly probable \nthat we will see a repeat of this shortfall next year.\n  Secretary Nicholson testifies today before the Senate Veterans \nAffairs Committee and acknowledge that the fiscal year 2006 budget \nrequest is insufficient. We look forward to the Administration's budget \namendment for fiscal year 06 to deal with this problem.\n  Clearly, we will have a lot of work to do in the fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations process. In the meantime, this amendment would add \nneeded funding this year and help to alleviate the budget problems we \nare seeing in VA hospitals across the country.\n  In closing, I would only add that this is not a Democrat issue and \nthis is not a Republican issue. This is an issue that goes to the very \nheart of how we treat those men and women who have fought bravely on \nbehalf of our nation and we need to be unified in showing them our \nsupport.\n  I respectfully urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, George Washington said more than 215 years \nago that, ``The willingness with which our young people are likely to \nserve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \nproportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were \ntreated and appreciated by their country.''\n  Today, our veterans are appreciated, but we learned last week that \nthey are not necessarily treated adequately when it comes to health-\ncare. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, disclosed it needs at \nleast an additional $1 billion to provide healthcare to our Nation's \nveterans. If we don't do something about it, our veterans will be in \njeopardy of having necessary healthcare delayed or even denied due to \nlack of funds. We must\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\naddress this situation without delay. Our troops risk their lives every \nday defending freedom, and sacrificing to keep us safe. If we fail to \nmeet our responsibility to them, and provide them the healthcare they \nneed, we fail to honor their service.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Senator Murray's \nimportant amendment to immediately cover this shortfall by providing \n$1.42 billion to the VA for veterans' healthcare under an emergency \ndesignation so we can ensure today's veterans receive the benefits they \nhave earned fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. I hope that none of us \nwould tolerate the injustice of soldiers who have bled for our country \nbeing denied the medical care they need.\n  While the VA is replacing the lost funds, they do so at a great cost. \nThe VA is cutting corners by squeezing other accounts. Those accounts \nprovide funds for non-recurring maintenance and equipment--funding \ncritical tasks like repairing leaky roofs, or purchasing equipment \nranging from photocopiers to defibrillators.\n  Our VA hospitals should be shrines of gratitude to those who have \nborne the battle. They should not want for anything--not new roofs, not \nphotocopiers--and most certainly not defibrillators.\n  At a time when a new generation of veterans is returning from war, \nset to use the VA in historic numbers, I hope that we will heed the \nwords of Commander James E. Sursely. Commander Sursely spoke for the \n1.2 million members of the Disabled American Veterans organization when \nhe called upon Congress to ``. . . act quickly to stem the flow of red \nink that threatens health care for today's veterans and thousands of \nmen and women injured or disabled during the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.''\n  Our veterans are humble Americans who every day exude the quiet \nstrength that comes from having served their country when it needed \nthem. Today, they need us. I ask all my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Murray amendment, and do right by our veterans without \ndelay. Let's not waste another moment in answering this call. Let's \nfill this gap now. Let's meet their need. Let's not forget that a new \ngeneration of veterans is watching to see what we do today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the vote in relation to the pending motion to waive with \nrespect to the Coburn amendment No. 1019, to be followed immediately by \na vote in relation to the Coburn amendment No. 1003, with no second \ndegrees in order to the amendments prior to the votes and with 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge the body to not support the \namendment offered by my good friend from Oklahoma. Everything is listed \nin earmarks either in the House bill or the Senate bill. The conference \nreport misses some of them because they overlap. I ask the body not to \nsupport this amendment and support the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the point I wish to make is the American \npeople deserve to have sunshine on everything we do. The conference \nreport would not adequately reflect the earmarks in the House, the \ndirectives in the House, or the limitations in the House. We are going \nto be voting on the bill without the knowledge of what those \nlimitations or earmarks are.\n  I would like to turn for a second to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if we are going to put any kind of brake \non earmarking and some of the subterfuge that exists of putting \nearmarks into conference reports which are then interpreted by the \nagencies affected as mandatory, the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma should be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1003. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

Mr. President, we decided to call up amendment numbered \n1026, the Sununu-Bingaman amendment regarding the Tongass National \nForest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. BURNS. There is no time agreement on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this year marks the 100th anniversary \nof the founding of the U.S. Forest Service. The creation of the Forest \nService in the Department of Agriculture is remembered as probably one \nof the most significant conservation legacies of President Theodore \nRoosevelt.\n  During President Roosevelt's tenure, there were established 5 new \nnational parks, 51 bird reserves, 4 game reserves, 18 national \nmonuments, and 150 national forests, including the Tongass National \nForest. All told, some 230 million acres of land was set aside for the \npublic. It is no wonder that President Roosevelt is regarded not only \nas the first but perhaps the greatest conservation President.\n  President Roosevelt shared his vision for the national forests in an \naddress to the Society of American Foresters on March 26, 1903. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       First and foremost, you can never afford to forget for one \n     moment what is the object of our forest policy. The object is \n     not to preserve the forests because they are beautiful, \n     although that is good in itself. Nor because they are refuges \n     for the wild creatures of the wilderness, though that too, is \n     good in itself. The primary object of our forest policy . . . \n     is the making of prosperous homes. Every other consideration \n     comes secondary. A forest that contributes nothing to the \n     wealth, progress or safety of the country is of no interest \n     to the Government, and should be of little interest to the \n     forester.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       Your attention must be directed to the preservation of \n     forests, not as an end in itself, but as a means of \n     preserving and increasing the prosperity of the nation.\n\n  I find it somewhat ironic that during the centennial year when we \ncelebrate the achievements of the Forest Service and the professional \nforesters who manage these forests, that this particular amendment is \noffered today. This is an amendment opposed by the Society of American \nForesters. This society represents 16,000 professional foresters from \nacross the Nation. It is opposed by the National Association of Home \nBuilders. It is an amendment opposed by the very people who were \nidentified as the core stakeholders of our national forests by the \nRoosevelt administration.\n  This amendment is opposed by organizations which, like President \nRoosevelt, believe in the wise use of our forests. It is opposed by the \nNational Association of Counties. It is opposed by America's working \nmen and women who belong to the labor unions that make up the Forest \nProducts Industry National Labor Management Committee. We have the \nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the PACE \nInternational Union, the International Brotherhood of Carpenters and \nJoiners, the United Mine Workers, the Southern Council of Industrial \nWorkers, and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers.\n  The amendment we have before the Senate now does not comport with \nPresident Roosevelt's vision for the national forests. It is an \namendment that turns our national forests, which are intended to \nsupport multiple uses, into wilderness areas. It is the falling domino \nin the nationwide campaign to lock up our national forests, throwing \npeople out of work and wreaking havoc on our local economies. And most \noffensively, to me, it is an amendment that discriminates against just \none forest--the Tongass National Forest, in the State of Alaska. It is \nonly directed to the Tongass. It covers no other national forest in the \nNation. I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate that first it is the \nTongass; next it will be the forests in your home States.\n  Even though this amendment is cloaked in the language of fiscal \nresponsibility, it should come as no surprise that the usual suspects \nare working hard for its adoption--those who seek to shut down and to \nprohibit any timber activity on national forest lands. It is not that \nthey are fiscal conservatives themselves. It is because they \nspecifically oppose logging in the Tongass. These are groups such as \nthe Wilderness Society, the Alaska Rain Forest Campaign, the National \nResources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, \nEarthjustice, formerly known as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. \nThese are organizations that have just said no, there shall be no \ntimber activity in the Tongass.\n  The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, now known as Earthjustice, is a \ngroup that maintains an office in Juneau for the purpose of appealing \nand then litigating the timber sales that are presented in the Tongass.\n  It is no wonder the Forest Service finds it difficult to efficiently \nmanage the timber program in the Tongass. I am told we have about 2 \nyears of the Forest Service planned timber offerings that are either \nunder appeal or litigation at any one time. This is four times the rate \nexperienced by the Forest Service nationally.\n  It is fair to say the professional foresters, in whom President \nRoosevelt placed his trust, no longer manage the timber in the Tongass. \nI can tell you these professional foresters are very frustrated that \nwhat we have are trial lawyers and judges who have more to say about \nmanaging our forests than they do.\n  The proponents of this amendment will tell you this is about making \nthe free market system work within our national forests. As long as the \nlitigators can tie up the timber sales, tie up the forest management in \nknots, this is not a free market scenario.\n  When Congress passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act, which caused the \ncancellation of long-term contracts and the closure of the pulp mills \nin Ketchikan and Sitka, that was not the free market. It was not the \nfree market that eliminated thousands of timber jobs in the State of \nAlaska. It was about timber politics, plain and simple.\n  It is not the free market that generates the high costs that the \nproponents of this amendment complain make the timber sales \nunprofitable. According to the Society of American Foresters, about 75 \npercent of the cost associated with timber sales in the Tongass is \nspent on environmental review, appeals, and litigation. So the \nremaining 25 percent of that is spent on actual preparation and \nadministration of the sale.\n  So again, you look at the numbers, and you say, it seems, looking at \njust the columns, the numbers are higher. But keep in mind, 75 percent \nof those costs are directly associated with the environmental review, \nappeals and litigation. So we need to be very clear about what this \namendment does. If it is passed, it essentially will enact a roadless \nrule on the Tongass National Forest. Because the Tongass is currently \n95 percent roadless, and because it has stringent environmental \nstandards, the amount of timber that could be harvested from the \nTongass would be vastly reduced.\n  The current 150 million board foot program--and keep in mind, this \nwas formulated after a very extensive scientific consultation, with \npublic participation. It was a process which took 9 years and $13 \nmillion to complete this plan. Under this program that again was \nformulated in this very lengthy process, it would be reduced to 30 to \n40 million board feet. This would result in the direct loss of two or \nmore of the mills and loss of about 680 potential jobs.\n  Now, some of you may be saying: Well, 680 jobs does not seem that \nsignificant. In the southeastern part of\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\nthe State of Alaska, where our population numbers are few and our \nunemployment numbers are very high, this is a huge loss. This is a \ndevastating loss. This would truly be nothing more than the latest \nchapter in the campaign to shut down the Tongass and kill off the \ntimber industry in southeast Alaska.\n  Now the proponents of this amendment would have us believe that if \nthis amendment fails, then somehow or other there are going to be all \nthese big corporations that stand to gain. But the timber industry in \nsoutheast Alaska is not made up of big corporations. It is made up of \nmom-and-pop businesses. These are owner-operated small businesses run \nby people such as Steve Seeley, out of Ketchikan; Kirk Dahlstrom, out \nof Klawock; Butch and Jackie DuRette. These are real people who are \ncontributing to their local economy. These are people who could have \ncut and run when the timber industry turned sour, but instead they \naccepted the risk. They stayed around, and they tried to build their \nbusinesses. Believe me, these are people who know what the free market \nis. I know these people, and I am proud to tell you of the good job \nthey do contributing to the economy of southeast Alaska.\n  So for the good of southeast Alaska, and for the good of sound forest \nmanagement, I ask my colleagues to look at this amendment, look at it \nvery carefully, look at who it is opposed by. It is opposed by the \nNation's professional foresters. It is opposed by working men and \nwomen. It is opposed by the National Association of Counties. And it is \nopposed by our Nation's homebuilders. Let's look carefully at how we \nmanage our forests and make sure we do it right.\n  One of the contentions you will hear is that the economics in the \nTongass do not work. You will hear some numbers thrown around. I think \nit is important to recognize you would be operating off of a false \nassumption or a false premise if you were saying that the Forest \nService is supposed to be a profit-making venture. As I indicated in \nthose comments made by President Roosevelt some 100 years ago, \nconservation, in Roosevelt's mind, meant the wise use of forest \nresources for the greatest good, not necessarily locking them up under \nglass down in southeastern Alaska.\n  The question of why the Forest Service does not necessarily make a \nprofit has been studied extensively. There is a think tank in Bozeman, \nMT, called the Property and Environment Research Center. They did a \nstudy in 1995 where they noted that the Forest Service is not expected \nby its governing law to make a profit. Its operations are governed by \nextensive environmental review processes that make it difficult to turn \na profit.\n  Again, look at the numbers. Look at what the task, the mission, is in \nterms of multiple use, and what it is we are asking our foresters to \ndo.\n\n  I will speak a little bit about the cost issue because there are \nthose who will suggest this amendment is not being put forward because \nthey are opposed to timber in the Tongass; they just think it is an \nunreasonable amount of money and that we are subsidizing. Well, we have \na breakdown of the various regions across the country from the U.S. \nForest Service that delineates the cost per acre of our respective \nnational forests based on State. It sets forth the net acres, the gross \nreceipts, as well as the monetary return per dollar invested.\n  If you look at the Tongass, we operate at about $6.05 in terms of \ncost per acre. As you go through this report across the country, you \nrealize that $6.05 is actually a pretty good deal in terms of how we \nare operating on a cost-per-acre basis.\n  Running down through the States--not singling out any particular \nState, but in several of the California national forests, the cost per \nacre at Six Rivers National Forest is $27.35. The cost per acre in \nPlumas, CA, is $35.86; in San Bernardino National Forest, it is \n$189.20. As to the sponsor of the amendment, if you look at the White \nMountain National Forest in the New Hampshire area, their cost per acre \nis $19.39.\n  So if we are talking about singling out one national forest in the \nentire national forest system, and we are saying it is too expensive in \nthe Tongass, and we are not going to allow for any Federal dollars to \ngo toward building roads because we think it is too expensive there, I \nchallenge you: Take a look at what is happening with the operation of \nour other national forests in terms of our cost per acre and what it \nmeans.\n  Let's look to the monetary return per dollar invested in those \nnational forests in California I made reference to. Their return per \ndollar invested is 1 percent. That is not a very good return if that is \nwhat you are going to base it on.\n  So again, to single out the Tongass, to single out the State of \nAlaska and say, ``You are the only one where we, as a Congress, are \ngoing to decide how you are going to manage your forests because we are \ngoing to tell you that there are no dollars that can go for road-\nbuilding activity,'' the land management plan that we have spent 9 \nyears and $13 million on is thrown out the window because the Federal \nGovernment is going to tell us that our costs are a little bit too \nhigh--it is wrong. It is flat out wrong, and it needs to be stopped.\n  I mentioned those who oppose this amendment. It is important for us \nto recognize who the professional managers are, the professional \nforesters, some 16,000 professional foresters across the Nation who \noppose this amendment. Our decision, should we adopt the Sununu \namendment, would override the judgment of professional foresters. It \nwould render meaningless the Tongass land management plan. We need to \nthink about what it is we are doing should we move forward in support \nof this amendment.\n  I want to leave my colleagues with a few facts again about singling \nout the Tongass for this action in this amendment.\n  Alaska is a State. We are not a colony. We may have come late into \nthe statehood battle, but we are still a State, and we deserve to be \ntreated as a State. We sought statehood so we could gain control of our \nresources. But sometimes that goal remains pretty illusive. All we are \nasking for is that we have the ability to manage our Federal lands \nresponsibly. We can--in conjunction with those professionals, those \nforesters who are working hard on this plan to make it work--manage the \nforests to provide for the multiple uses our national forests are \ntasked to do.\n  I know people think: Oh, we throw around these Alaska statistics all \nthe time. But I think it is significant in this debate to put this in \ncontext. Ninety-four percent of the land in the southeastern part of \nthe State is part of the Tongass National Forest. It is controlled by \nthe Federal Government, the U.S. Forest Service.\n  In the State of Alaska, we have 54 percent of the Nation's designated \nwilderness. In one State, our State, we have 54 percent of the entire \ndesignated wilderness.\n  What are we doing with the Tongass National Forest now? Forty percent \nof that land in the Tongass, some 6.6 million acres, is already off \nlimits to timber development. It is in a wilderness area. It is a \nnational monument. It is a land-use designation II area. It is \nabsolutely, positively off limits. That is 40 percent currently in the \nTongass.\n  Another 56 percent of the Tongass National Forest is off limits to \ntimber under the forest plan--this forest plan that I keep talking \nabout that took 9 years and $13 million that this amendment will \nessentially kick aside. Fifty-six percent of the Tongass is off limits \nunder that plan.\n  That leaves 4 percent of the Tongass, or approximately 655,000 acres, \nout of a total of 17.8 million acres in the Tongass. That 4 percent is \nwhat we are talking about that would be available for timber \ndevelopment. Allowing southeast Alaska, allowing people such as Steve \nSeeley and his sawmill, and Kirk Dahlstrom's sawmill in Klawock, \nallowing this development in an economy that is already very hard \npressed, is not going to spoil the beauty of this incredible national \nforest--these 17.8 million acres. It is not going to doom any national \ntreasures.\n  We have a plan we have worked hard to complete. We ask to be allowed \nto continue that, and to be able to provide for the few jobs we would \nlike to continue in the area for the benefit of those who choose to \ncall it home.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see the senior Senator from Alaska is \nhere. As\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\nwell, we are joined by our colleague from Oregon. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a national forest \nthat is not in my State, and of constituents who are not in the State \nof Oregon. I do so because I see happening to my Alaskan colleagues and \ntheir constituents what I have witnessed for too many years in my own \nState of Oregon. As a predicate, I know the difference between \nenvironmentalists who make many good points, who have much to \ncontribute, and, frankly, what I would term the ``environmental \nconflict industry.'' Others have used that term. If this amendment that \nis offered by my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, were really \nabout saving money, it would be about streamlining costs associated \nwith timber production as opposed to just an amendment that would \neffectively end any kind of multiple use in the Tongass National \nForest.\n  The truth is, the Tongass is an area as big as many States in the \nlower 48. It is a vast resource. The truth is also that each of us, as \nAmericans, use many pounds of wood in our lives every day. The question \nbefore this Senate is whether we want to have timber come from our \ncountry with high environmental standards or from other countries where \nthere are few, if any, environmental standards. Many complain about the \nway the harvest is done in Indonesia or in Brazil. Some of us even \ncomplain that the way Canada harvests, across the border from the \nTongass, is done on the basis of tremendous amounts of subsidies. They \nare called crown lands. The timber companies there are essentially \ngiven the raw product, provided access to the forest, and then are able \nto compete with American timber workers. That is to our great \ndisadvantage.\n  Today I have to stand in defense of my colleagues and their State and \ntheir forest because America needs to be reminded that we have the best \ntimberlands in the world. We can either use them or watch them, too \noften, go up in catastrophic wildfires. We know how to manage forests \ntoday. We know silviculture science. We know what works and what does \nnot. Clearly, there have been abuses in the past. Clearly, things can \nbe done better in the future. But the truth is, if we, as Americans, \nwant timber products in our lives, that wood will grow and be harvested \nsomewhere, if not from our country, then from where? If not up to high \nenvironmental standards, then as against what standards?\n  If you end the road-building component of timber sales in the Tongass \nNational Forest, then you will end timber harvest in the Tongass \nNational Forest because of the size of this area. You can't helicopter \nin and out everything that could be harvested and could be made \navailable to American workers and American home builders and the tax \nbase of the State of Alaska and, obviously, the Federal Government \nthrough timber receipts as well. It is expensive to build roads in \nforests, to maintain them. But, frankly, to do nothing is to abandon \nthis industry.\n  Americans need to be reminded that timber does not come from the Home \nDepot. It comes from a tree that grows somewhere. But as to the \nenvironmental conflict industry that is pushing this particular \namendment and, I am sure, some who want to save the taxpayer money, I \nwant to suggest that it is the environmental conflict industry and not \nthe timber industry that is feeding off the American taxpayer. With \nappeals and lawsuits, the cost of basic forest management skyrockets. \nThe Tongass National Forest estimates that half of its timber budget is \nspent on paperwork that will be called into court. And to produce a \n1,000-page NEPA document is now the rule rather than the exception.\n  The Tongass currently has 13 environmental impact statements delayed \nin court. Every forest plan on the Tongass has been litigated. And the \nenvironmental conflict industry will ask that their lawyer's fees be \npaid--by whom?--by you and by me, and by the taxpayer. In 2003, \ntaxpayers were charged $200,000 by the Sierra Club for its lawsuit \nagainst the Tongass National Forest. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy \nfor the environmental conflict industry to drive up costs of forest \nmanagement and then grumble about those costs.\n  If this amendment were truly about fiscal responsibility, we would be \ndiscussing ways to produce timber from the Tongass at a lower cost \ninstead of eliminating fiber production there altogether. Or we could \nbe capping lawyers fees. Or we could be talking about other national \nforests that do not produce any revenue whatsoever, unlike the Tongass.\n  This amendment is not really about fiscal responsibility, it is about \nenvironmental responsibility. That ought to be our real objective.\n  If we buy wood products, just know that it grew on a tree somewhere. \nI would rather that it be managed in an American forest, such as the \nTongass, providing American products for American consumers.\n  I felt it important that a Senator from a State who has already \nsuffered, as they are now, and been attacked in the way that they are \nbeing attacked, ought to come down and speak for them. There are not a \nlot of people who stand up for timber workers anymore. These are not \nbig companies operating in the Tongass. These are Americans in very \nrural places, trying to produce the products of the tree in a \nscientific way, according to high U.S. standards, so that we can meet \nthe obligations of our law for multiple use as well as environmental \nstewardship.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and allow an \nenvironmentally sensitive industry, a timber industry that is living up \nto high environmental standards, to survive in a very rural and \nvulnerable part of our country in Alaska.\n  As I have said, I rise today in opposition to the Sununu amendment. I \ndo so in defense of one of the basic functions of our National \nForests--to produce timber.\n  This Friday signifies the 100th anniversary of the United States \nForest Service. We celebrate this event because our forests are still \nthere. Our forests are still beautiful. But certainly there's more to \ncelebrate than that.\n  National Forests were originally set aside to produce two \ncommodities: clean water and a continuous timber supply.\n  Ted Roosevelt said:\n\n       The object (of our forest policy) is not to preserve the \n     forests because they are beautiful . . . nor because they are \n     refuges for wild creatures. . . . the primary object of our \n     forest policy in the United States is the making of \n     prosperous homes. Every other consideration comes as \n     secondary.\n\n  With this in mind, I come to the Senate floor in defense of a \nNational Forest not in my State, and on behalf of communities who are \nnot my constituents.\n  But Alaskans are under the same siege that struck my constituents and \nNational Forests in my State.\n  It is a siege of the ``environmental conflict industry.''\n  And it is this industry, not the timber industry, that is feeding off \nthe American taxpayer.\n  With appeals and lawsuits, the cost of basic forest management \nskyrockets.\n  The Tongass National Forest estimates that half of its timber budget \nis spent on paperwork that will be called into court. And to produce a \nthousand-page NEPA document is now the rule, rather than the exception.\n  The Tongass currently has 13 environmental impact statements delayed \nin court. Every forest plan on the Tongass has been litigated.\n  And the environmental conflict industry will ask that their lawyer's \nfees be paid by the taxpayer.\n  In 2003, taxpayers were charged $200,000 by the Sierra Club for its \nlawsuit against the Tongass National Forest.\n  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy for the ``environmental conflict \nindustry'' to drive up the costs of forest management and then grumble \nabout those costs.\n  If this amendment were truly about fiscal responsibility, we would be \ndiscussing ways to produce timber from the Tongass at a lower cost--\ninstead of eliminating fiber production altogether.\n  Or we would be capping lawyers' fees.\n  Or we would be talking about other National Forests that do not \nproduce any revenue whatsoever.\n  This amendment is not about fiscal responsibility. It is about \nenvironmental responsibility.\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\n  I would remind my colleagues that a 2 x 4 does not come from Home \nDepot. It comes from a tree somewhere. The choice of the ``where'' is \nup to us.\n  If not from Alaska or Oregon, how about the rainforests of Brazil or \nIndonesia?\n  If not according to our environmental laws, then by whose?\n  If not to feed American families, then whose?\n  The United States has the most productive forests and the strictest \nenvironmental laws in the world.\n  To export our industry and our employment is both economically and \nenvironmentally appalling.\n  I do not believe this is the intention of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  But this amendment runs against the very grain of the National Forest \nSystem we commemorate this week.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  \n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nstatement and his support. I thank my colleague from Alaska for her \nstatement.\n  I come to the floor in opposition to the Sununu amendment, also. I \nhope Members will read it because it says:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     plan, design, study, or construct new forest development \n     roads in the Tongass National Forest for the purpose of \n     harvesting timber by private entities or individuals.\n\n  This amendment is premised on inaccurate information and faulty \nassumptions about our Nation's timber industry, the Tongass, and the \nstate of our national forests. Unfortunately, this type of information \nhas become commonplace. It is the inevitable result of special interest \ncampaigns which are designed to distort the facts and mislead the \nAmerican public. For many years, I have worked to set the record \nstraight, especially when it comes to the false claims about Alaska's \nstewardship of our natural resources. Unfortunately, this amendment \nrequires that I attempt, once more, to set the record straight.\n  Misinformation about management of our national resources now runs \nrampant. I believe it lies at the heart of this amendment. It is the \nresult of propaganda campaigns raised by extreme environmentalists and \nspecial interest groups who often get the facts wrong because they \nignore our history. Our State once had a thriving timber industry. It \nsupplied almost 2 billion board feet a year, employed over 3,000 timber \nworkers, and generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the \nU.S. Treasury. But in the spirit of compromise and cooperation, our \ntimber industry agreed to reduce the amount of timber it could harvest \nper year. In fact, one timber employee recently stated ``we cooperated \nourselves right out of business.''\n  The Tongass National Forest was established in 1917. At 17 million \nacres, it is the largest national forest in the United States. It is \ntwice the size of Maryland and more than 25 times the size of Rhode \nIsland. As a matter of fact, if we look at the map showing the New \nEngland area, it shows how big this forest really is. The part that is \ncovered in black is that portion of the forest that is open to timber \non a proportionate basis. The other map that I have shows the forest as \na whole and shows the result of the plans that have been developed. The \narea in blue is area that is still available for harvesting. All of the \nwhite part of that map of the Tongass is permanently closed to timber \nharvest.\n  The Tongass compromises 90 percent of the lands of southeastern \nAlaska. The remaining lands are State, more Federal, and private lands. \nThe Tongass is the only forest in Alaska in which timber may be \nharvested now. Alaska's other forest, the Chugach National Forest, \nwhich contains 5.5 million acres, is now under a management plan which \nhas reduced the allowable sale quantity to zero. The Chugach is \ncompletely closed to logging. No timber can be logged from that very \nmassive forest, 5.5 million acres.\n  Federal timber policy regarding the Tongass has had devastating \neffects on the 32 communities in Southeast Alaska that depend on timber \nharvests for their livelihood. When Congress passed the Tongass Timber \nAct in 1947, an allowable sale quantity, which we call the ASQ, for the \nTongass was set at 1.38 billion board feet per year. This level was \nslowly eroded. Under the 1959 Statehood Act, the State of Alaska was \nallowed to select only 400,000 acres of its 103-million-acre \nentitlement in Southeast Alaska.\n  Because there is little private land to support our local economies, \nCongress committed to provide support for economic development through \ntimber sales. Congress codified that support in a series of laws \nbeginning in 1971. In 1971, the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement \nAct set the ASQ, the allowable quantity, at 950 million board feet per \nyear. During subsequent years, the timber industry in the Tongass \nsupported almost 3,000 jobs and harvested an average of 520 million \nboard feet per year. However, the amount of permissible harvest was \nagain decreased in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \nof 1980, which set an ASQ of 450 million board feet per year. At that \ntime, the Senate believed that 450 million board feet per year would \nmaintain a robust timber industry which was a major section of \nsoutheast Alaska's regional economy.\n  In addition, the Senate envisioned providing Federal funds for road \nbuilding and advanced harvesting technology.\n  As former Senator Roth stated at that time in 1980, the bill:\n\n       . . . permit[s] the established timber industries to \n     maintain a rate of production necessary for their economic \n     success. It was understood by Members of the Senate during \n     this debate that a vital timber industry was necessary for \n     the economic survival of the residents of southeast Alaska.\n\n  As Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts said:\n\n       Our commitment was to treat Alaska fairly.\n\n  The commitment was again put to the test during the debate on the \nTongass Timber Reform Act, which was called TTRA, in 1990. That plan \nset the ASQ at 450 million board feet on 1.9 million acres. The Act \nalso directed the Forest Service to provide a supply of timber which \nmeets the market demand in southeast Alaska. At that time, several \nMembers from both sides of the aisle in the Senate adamantly agreed \nthat this bill would be the final word on the Tongass.\n  As Senator Johnson of Louisiana stated:\n\n       I believe that the designation and disposition of the \n     public lands in the Tongass National Forest pursuant to this \n     act represent a responsible balance between the preservation \n     of wildlife areas and the availability of lands for more \n     intensive use as determined appropriate by administrative \n     planning and management. I further believe that this \n     agreement will allow Alaskans the certainty they need and \n     deserve by resolving the issue once and for all.\n  Now, that was in 1990. Senator Bingaman--now an original cosponsor of \nthe Sununu amendment, as a matter of fact--said at the time:\n\n       This is a balanced bill that will adequately protect this \n     majestic national forest, while assuring a sustainable supply \n     of timber for current and future needs. . . . This \n     legislation recognizes that some areas should be protected, \n     while others should be managed for a sustained supply of \n     timber.\n\n  That was at the time of the 1990 act.\n  I remember speaking on the floor prior to passage of the bill. After \nyears of broken promises and severe declines in the timber industry, I \ntrusted our colleagues to do the right thing and resolve the issue of \nthe Tongass once and for all. That is what everybody at the time said--\nthat Act was the final legislation pertaining to the Tongass timber \nharvest. I called on all Members of the House and Senate to listen to \nthe voice of Alaskans. I received a promise, commitment, and assurance \nof those involved, who had the power to change these laws, that they \nrecognized this was the end, that there would be no further divisions \nof the Tongass.\n  In 1997, however, the Forest Service completed the Tongass land \nmanagement plan, which currently guides management of the Tongass. The \ndevelopment of that involved an unprecedented level of scientific \nreview and public involvement. It took over 10 years and cost the \ntaxpayers of the United States $13 million.\n  I opposed the plan because it contained again a drastic reduction in \nthe amount of timber allowed to be harvested. It reduced the allowable \nsale quantity level to 267 million board feet per year. I thought the \nlevels were\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\nmuch lower than they needed to be, and they violated the commitment \npreviously made to me. Numerous scientists who found that the Tongass \ncould sustain far greater development supported my conclusion.\n  Yet, today, that plan seems like the golden age of the Tongass timber \nindustry. I now find myself defending a plan I initially opposed, \nbecause of continued efforts to erode the promises made to our State.\n  This plan addresses how to manage the Tongass--a largely undeveloped \nforest landscape--over time. The centerpiece is a biological \nconservation strategy that protects the ``biological heart,'' as they \ncalled it, of the Tongass, designed to assure the sustainability of all \nresources and values, while allowing development on a relatively small \nportion of the Tongass to support communities in southeast Alaska \nthrough timber harvesting.\n  Mr. President, 93 percent of all forested areas in the Tongass are \nset aside under the 1997 plan; 93 percent are not available for timber \nharvesting. Timber harvesting can actually now occur on only 676,000 \nacres, or 4 percent of the 17 million acre forest. The allowable sale \nquantity under this plan is 267 million board feet--down, as I said, \nfrom over 1 billion board feet. An ASQ of 267 million board feet per \nyear is the bottom quantity, as far as I am concerned.\n  Since 1990, the volume of timber harvested from the Tongass has \ndropped from hundreds of board feet per year. Last year, only 46 \nmillion board feet of timber was harvested--46 million board feet of \ntimber from a forest of 17 million acres.\n  To comply with the Tongass Timber Reform Act, the current plan seeks \nto plan, prepare, and sell about 150 million board feet per year. \nDelays caused by litigation have prohibited the Forest Service from \naccomplishing this goal on the Tongass. Fourteen projects are currently \nunder litigation. They represent over 238 million board feet of timber \nthat should have been harvested in years gone by.\n  Direct timber jobs in the Tongass have declined from over 3000 in \n1990 to less than 700 today. Unemployment in parts of southeast Alaska \nis well over 10 percent, all because of extravagant acts of those who \noppose the very Act they championed at the time it passed in 1990.\n  Mr. President, 150 million board feet per year could support 959 \ndirect timber jobs, totaling over $35 million in direct wages, Each \ndirect timber job is estimated to support another 1.7 jobs in the local \neconomy. These jobs are an important high-wage sector of the economy \nand provide much needed year-round employment for southeast Alaska. The \nbenefits of a sufficient and sustained timber supply are obvious.\n  The timber industry in southeast Alaska has changed dramatically over \nthe period we have described. The large pulp mills are closed. Three \nmedium sawmills, one small sawmill, and a handful of micromills remain, \nbut they are primarily idle because of the level of timber that can be \ncut right now. These businesses are family owned and community based \nand depend upon a supply of timber from the Tongass for their survival.\n  The remaining mills are involved in efforts to increase the demand \nfor, and the stumpage values of, the timber in southeastern Alaska.\n  These people are trying to build a more integrated industry to \nprovide finished products, such as window and door trim, to local, \nnational, and international markets.\n  The Tongass timber program is working to complete investments in \ndrying and planing lumber, having it graded, to sell in the local \nregion.\n  Wood resources in southeast Alaska are now known to have unique \nqualities. Wood density and lumber strength is high. New lumber grades \nfor Alaska yellow cedar and hemlock have recently been issued, which \nsurpass the strength of other species currently used in construction in \nthe lower 48, such as Douglas fir. This is also expected to increase \nthe value of Alaska's timber.\n  In other words, we are trying to do what we can through technology to \nincrease value of our timber, even though the amount of the timber is \nsteadily declining.\n\n  The efforts of those remaining in the Tongass industry to adapt to \ncurrent conditions will be worthless if Congress adopts the Sununu \namendment. As I said, the amendment prohibits the Forest Service from \nusing funds appropriated for the ``planning, designing, studying, or \nconstruction'' of timber roads.\n  Planning, designing, and studying are necessary to assure that we \nmeet the multiple use consideration of the national forests. This \nforest area is full of small streams that contain migratory salmon. \nWildlife is there. There are recreation values. A whole series of \nvalues require the Forest Service to study the areas that can be \nharvested. Careful planning, designing, studying, and construction is \nnecessary to protect those values, as well as provide a transportation \nroute so timber can be taken to market.\n  This amendment will effectively enact a roadless rule in the Tongass. \nIt would prevent access to more than 300,000 acres of unroaded timber \nbase in the areas that are open for timber harvest. Access to the small \namount that is available should not be denied because of this \namendment.\n  Data provided by the Forest Service shows at a minimum southeast \nAlaska will lose two mills and about 680 more jobs. These numbers will \nnot support the industry described if this amendment passes.\n  Law requires that a sufficient timber supply be provided to meet \nmarket demand. That was one of the basic considerations that came from \nthe 1990 Act. Current market demand is about 150 million board feet per \nyear in our own area. Under this amendment, we would harvest less than \n40 million board feet per year, bringing the industry to a standstill. \nI ask the Senate to reject this approach that would further renege on \nthe obligation to southeast Alaska to fulfill the commitments that were \nmade to Alaska and to southeastern Alaska under the Tongass plan.\n  Some of the Senators claim the Sununu amendment is about our fiscal \nresponsibility to ensure taxpayers are not subsidizing the Tongass \ntimber industry. But this is not about fiscal responsibility.\n  National environmental groups have spent millions appealing and \nlitigating timber sales in the Tongass National Forest, causing program \ncosts to soar and the number of sales to collapse. Almost 75 percent of \nall the costs associated with timber sales in the Tongass National \nForest are spent on NEPA, appeals based on that Act, and litigation. \nThe remaining 25 percent is the actual preparation and administration \nof a sale, including the building of roads.\n  Compliance with NEPA and other Federal laws and responses to appeals \nand litigation currently total about $110 per thousand board feet, or \n$110,000 per million board feet.\n  Without these costs, timber sale preparation and administration for \nthe Tongass Forest would cost about $36 per thousand board feet. The \naverage timber sale generates about $42.5 per thousand board feet. \nWithout frivolous appeals and lawsuits, the Tongass timber program \nwould yield a reasonable profit margin and make money for U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  Administrative appeals and litigation increase the cost of Tongass \ntimber sales exponentially compared with the rest of the United States. \nThe Forest Service estimates the timber sales in the Tongass are \nappealed and litigated more than four times that of timber sales in the \nnational forests in the lower 48. It is the cost of this litigation and \nthe cost of the environmental programs that are instilled by these \nextreme environmentalists that drive up the cost in the Tongass. Now \nthey say we should stop harvesting timber because of the cost. Despite \nextensive environmental review and public participation, the majority \nof the timber projects in the Tongass are appealed and/or litigated.\n  Taxpayers are not subsidizing the timber industry. Under the National \nForest Management Act, timber sale purchasers are required to \ncompetitively bid and pay market value for the sales they purchase. \nPurchasers also pay for all logging, transportation, and manufacturing \ncosts.\n  In addition, the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act mandates that \nnational forests be managed for multiple use benefits such as fish, \nwildlife, recreation, and clean water.\n  Ecological benefits include various land management objectives such \nas\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\nimproving forest health and reducing the risk of catastrophic fire.\n  All of those costs are what the environmental groups say are part of \nthe cost of the timber sale program. They are not. Seventy-five percent \nof all the costs have nothing to do with harvesting timber. They have \nto do with the attacks of extreme environmental groups that now bring \nthis amendment to say you cannot use Federal money to build these \nroads, or even plan them, because it costs too much.\n  In the Tongass, timber sales also provide basic infrastructure, such \nas roads and docks. This infrastructure provides residents and visitors \nwith access to hunting, fishing, recreation, and wildlife viewing. The \nwhole spectrum of tourist activity in southeast Alaska is supported by \nthe roads constructed. Some roads constructed by timber sales serve as \nthe basic road system between communities and ferry terminals, which \nare the water highways of the island communities of southeast Alaska.\n  That area has no roads. Even our capital cannot be reached by road. \nThis is an island area. It must have roads basically from the edge of \nthe water to the area available for harvesting which, by definition, is \nback away from the view shed that we keep along the water's edge to \nassure that tourists will have the proper view of the area.\n  I do believe these water highways between our southeastern islands \nare connected, in a way, by virtue of the forest roads that are \ndeveloped under these timber sale programs.\n  These timber sales provide benefits beyond revenues earned. Economic \nbenefits include new jobs, additional income for individuals and \nbusinesses. Basic tax receipts of this area depend on the harvesting of \ntimber in the Tongass.\n  The problem that I see now is that these communities have come to \nrely on timber sales not only for jobs but for their local economies. \nTimber sales revenues are important to local communities which receive \n25 percent of the proceeds of these sales for public schools and roads, \nas do all areas that have national forests. By prohibiting these roads \nwhich will kill the sales, in effect, the contribution that is brought \nabout by the laws that pertain to national forests will not be realized \nin Southeast Alaska because there won't be any harvest or 25 percent to \nsupport the schools that come out of the national program.\n  That program applies to the entire United States. The timber roads \nprogram applies to all States where there are national forests. In the \nyear 2004, the timber harvest for all 10 forest regions was about 2 \nbillion board feet. The gross receipts totaled $217 million and \nexpenditures amounted to over $268 million, and that number does not \ntake all costs into account.\n  The 1998 timber sale performance information reporting system found \nnet losses in 8 of the 10 forest regions. Some States may be able to \nshow a profit or even break even, but clearly the national timber sale \nprogram does not.\n  As a matter of law and policy, national forest managers are required \nto behave differently from private forest managers, so it does not make \nsense to judge their performance by private sector standards--profits.\n  If the Forest Service's goal was to maximize profits, contrary to the \nMultiple Use-Sustained Yield Act, the Forest Service would allow export \nof timber and sell it to the highest bidder worldwide in the global \neconomy. But that would essentially outsource all of the value-added \nforest products industry of the United States, putting local mills out \nof business, eliminating jobs, and leaving local communities with few \nalternatives for revenue. Given our current economic climate, the \nUnited States cannot afford that policy.\n  I want to share a quote from President Roosevelt. Senator Murkowski \nmentioned he established the Tongass National Forest. I think it is \nrelevant today. He said:\n\n        . . . First and foremost, you can never afford to forget \n     for a moment what is the object of our forest policy. That is \n     not to preserve forests because they are beautiful, though \n     that is good in itself, not because they are refuges for the \n     wild creatures of the wilderness, though that too is good in \n     itself; but the primary object of our forest policy, as the \n     land policy of the United States, is the making of prosperous \n     homes.\n\n  This national forest concept was supposed to provide an alternative \nto the development of privately owned timber and be a yardstick for the \nmanagement of timber resources in our country.\n  The construction of timber roads is important for both the economic \nand environmental health of our forests. They provide access to timber \nused for wood, paper products, and home construction. They enable \ncitizens to access our forests for public recreation, and they enable \nForest Service employees to manage those forests for the public good.\n  The timber road program in Alaska is managed in the same manner as \nthe timber road program of every national forest in the United States. \nThe only difference in our case is we provide special protections, such \nas culverts, to ensure safe fish passage, and we protect the terrain. \nWe have learned from the mistakes of the past. We do not build roads \nthe same as they do in other areas. We strive to strike a balance \nbetween conservation and economic development.\n  And now with this amendment, some Members of the Senate would \npenalize Alaska for doing the right thing. We have developed a basic \napproach to use our timber areas to protect other values besides timber \nharvests. We could seek to significantly reduce the amount of these \nprotections required for our timber road system, and we could \ndrastically reduce the funds required, but that would be inconsistent \nwith proper stewardship of our national forest lands.\n  Because only 1 percent of Alaska's lands are privately owned, it is \nimperative that the Federal Government allow us to use some of our \nresources on Federal lands. The Federal Government manages, by the way, \n235 million acres of Alaska's land.\n  We have a long, proud history as responsible stewards of our natural \nresources. Alaskans will always manage our lands in a way that ensures \nits vitality. Timber is a renewable resource. It can be--and will be--\nmanaged as such under the Tongass land management plan.\n  Much of Alaska will remain pristine wilderness. We have set aside a \ntremendous amount of it. But we need some certainty that we will be \nable to harvest small portions of the forest which are not already set \naside. We need to know we will be able to sustain the timber industry \ntoday with the assurances of the past. We need assurances that our \nefforts will not be met by more resistance, such as the frivolous \nlawsuits and amendments such as this.\n  In order to give our communities a chance to be prosperous, Congress \nshould allow the Tongass to be managed under the forest management plan \nwithout further unwarranted interference.\n  I remind the Senate, the same environmental groups that caused the \nTongass to lose money through frivolous litigation and stalling \ntactics, as I said, are now calling for an end to the timber program \nunder the guise of fiscal conservatism. It is disingenuous and \nduplicitous, and their approach is given sanction and credibility by \nthis amendment. This amendment should be defeated.\n  I do hope that our colleagues will consider this: Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense has repeatedly opposed Federal funds for the entire \nNational Forest System. They argue that 105 of the 111 national forests \nspend more money in the operation of forests than they collected \nthrough timber sales. They want us to meet the cost of all multiple use \nvalues the cost of recreation, the cost of conservation, the cost of \nprotecting wildlife--by the revenues coming in from the small amount of \nareas of the forest allowed to be harvested.\n  This group singled out several national forests as wasteful. I want \nto point out to the Senate that the Taxpayers for Common Sense attacked \nforests in California, Alaska, Montana, Oregon, Idaho, New Mexico, \nArizona, Colorado, Washington, and Utah. I urge the Senators involved \nin this amendment to consider this. Why single out Alaska? Why is it \nthat Alaskan roads cannot be built with Federal money? They are being \nbuilt in all these other national forests deemed wasteful.\n\n  I am surprised my colleagues from New Hampshire and New Mexico would \noffer this amendment in view of the conditions of the forests in their \nown States. According to the Wilderness Society, the Forest Service's \ntimber program in New Hampshire lost between $813,000 and $1.2 million. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nbeing attacked for something that does not exist in Alaska alone.\n  In New Mexico, the timber program lost between $365,000 and $414,000.\n  The same economics are applied to the Tongass Timber Programs as in \nall National Forests. The difference in Alaska is that four times as \nmany lawsuits are brought against Tongass timber sales than in the rest \nof the United States.\n  If this amendment is designed to protect the taxpayer, then \nrestrictions on Federal funds for timber roads should apply to all \nforests in every State. And I think special interests will come after \nthose other areas, if this amendment is passed.\n  I call this an ill-conceived amendment. I urge it not be adopted. It \nwould add weight to the logic embraced by Taxpayers for Common Sense \nwho have attacked, as I said, almost every forest in the United States. \nIt will send us down a slippery slope by setting a precedent for \nhalting road programs in national forests.\n  The roads designed and built by the Forest Service are in the best \ninterests of the Nation because they protect all the values of the \nmultiple-use concept of our national forests. This is not only \nimportant to the timber industry, but it is important to millions of \nAmericans who rely on roads for access to national forests.\n  I do not want to encourage environmental groups to continue waging \nfrivolous lawsuits in the hopes of making timber programs throughout \nthe United States too expensive to continue. What they are doing is \nincreasing the costs. Again, I point out, 75 percent of the costs in \nAlaska are involved in compliance with the National Environmental \nPolicy Act and the appeals and litigation that ensue whenever the \nForest Service offers a timber sale in the Tongass.\n  Adopting this amendment would unfairly and unjustly distinguish one \nState--our State--sending a sobering message to Alaskans: Despite \nCongress's statements and actions in the past, a Senator voting for \nthis amendment will be telling Alaskans that their economic well-being \nis secondary to special interests, and when push comes to shove, \nCongress will forget about the commitments of the past, forget about \nthe promises of the past, and move to satisfy this extreme \nenvironmental movement that is the basic cause of the problem as far as \nthe forests are concerned.\n  If Congress chooses to adopt this amendment, none of our forests are \nsafe. No forest can afford to sit idly by. These special interest \ngroups are designing ways to destroy an important Federal program based \non spurious allegations with regard the economics involved. Those \neconomics are affected more by the environmental movement, which is \nchallenging most timber sales in the Tongass, than by the forest \nactions themselves.\n  Above all, I ask the Senate to remember that this amendment goes back \non congressional promises made to Alaska. In exchange for withdrawing \nover 100 million acres of land for parks, refuges, and forests, \nincluding 17 million acres in Tongass National Forest, Congress \npromised that it would leave intact sufficient land to maintain a \nrobust timber industry in Alaska.\n  Unlike the timber industry in other States, Alaska's timber industry \nis reliant on the Tongass, which comprises 90 percent of Southeast \nAlaska. Only 676,000 acres are currently open for timber harvesting.\n  Since 1980, jobs in the Alaskan timber industry have shrunk from over \n3,000 to less than 500 today. We have only four small family-owned \ntimber mills left.\n  This amendment is not about fiscal responsibility, it is a back-door \nattack on the timber industry to benefit this extreme environmental \nmovement.\n  As I said, 75 percent of the timber sale cost is from NEPA, the \nNational Environmental Protection Act, compliance, appeals, and \nlitigation. Without those, the Tongass would make a 13-percent profit.\n  Many of the national forests in the United States have monetary \nreturns per dollar invested, which is less than the rate of return of \nthe Tongass, and they are not considered at all in connection with this \namendment. This amendment would set a precedent that litigation can \nmake the cost of timber programs in all national forests too expensive \nto continue.\n  If this amendment was really about fiscal responsibility, then all \nnational forests would be included. Most of the timber programs \nthroughout the United States--as I said, 8 out of 10 of them--are not \nprofitable. In fact, according to the Forest Service--and I close with \nthis point--the Tongass is one the best managed forests in the Nation. \nIt has one of the lowest costs per acre, including the timber program.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak on my amendment. I had an \nopportunity to present more complete remarks last night so I will try \nto speak briefly this evening.\n  I appreciate the work of both Senators from Alaska and understand \nthat this is naturally an issue of great personal interest and \ncommitment for them.\n  I wanted to address briefly a few of the general remarks that were \nmade, especially those, for obvious reasons, that referred to me. \nFirst, I do not think I have ever been accused of being an extreme \nenvironmentalist. I certainly do not consider myself an extreme \nenvironmentalist.\n  In that regard, I believe one simply has to look at the basic premise \nof this amendment. It does not create a new wilderness designation. For \nmy part, I have opposed President Clinton's roadless initiative. I have \nsupported the multiuse concept in national forest land across the \nentire country and will continue to do so. So I just do not think it is \nfair or appropriate to throw around a label like that cavalierly, and I \ntrust that it was not meant that way.\n  Second, I emphasize the point that from my perspective, this is about \nfiscal responsibility and fiscal restraint.\n  The suggestion was made a number of times that it was not. Frankly, I \ndo not think that is quite appropriate because it suggests a set of \nmotives that just are not there.\n  One does not have to go any further than the amendment I offered last \nweek to the Energy bill to strike some of the more egregious taxpayer \nsubsidies in that Energy legislation or my vote against the highway \nbill that broke the budget or my vote against a prescription drug bill \nthat we knew then and we know now had costs far in excess of its \nprescribed $400 billion or my vote against the Energy bill in its final \nform today. I believe it is fair to stand on my record that the votes I \nhave cast, the amendments I have offered of this type that have dealt \nwith taxpayer subsidies, have all been motivated by one thing and one \nthing only, and that is doing what I believe is appropriate and right \nwhen we are handling taxpayer resources.\n  In the case of the support and the subsidies that go to private \nlogging firms, I believe we have to draw a line somewhere. When we look \nat the Tongass and see $49 million in costs for a timber program that \nyields for the taxpayers $800,000 in revenues, something is not right. \nThe opponents of the amendment will say: Well, only $15 million, $20 \nmillion, or $25 million is going directly for the cost of building \nroads. But in my book, $25 million for $800,000 in revenue is still a \npretty bad deal.\n  There are a lot of reasons listed for the high cost of a timber \nprogram on the national forests, and I am very sympathetic to many of \nthe concerns raised: high legal costs, an unbearable bureaucracy, \nregulatory costs associated with not just completing, in some cases, \nredundant environmental studies but then defending them in court. I am \nwilling and I have voted in the past to support efforts to deal \ndirectly with those costs and to support efforts to allow appropriate \nconsideration, but deliberate consideration, of those challenges. I \nwill continue to do so.\n  Because there are such things as frivolous lawsuits that are in the \npipeline does not justify a $15 million subsidy or a $25 million \nsubsidy or a $35 million subsidy or a $48 million subsidy. The subsidy \nitself cannot and should not be used to defend or respond to bad \nbehavior in other ways. So we need to fight those costs, the legal \nabuses, and burdensome environmental regulations\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\nthat are not appropriately applied, but those issues are separate from \nthe question of whether we should use taxpayer funds to subsidize the \nconstruction of roads to support private timber firms.\n  Again, I come back to the basic point that this is about fiscal \nresponsibility. When I hear that phrase, ``this is not about fiscal \nresponsibility,'' it really has to be read as questioning my motives \nor, frankly, the motives of any of those who are supporting this \namendment. I do not think the Senate floor is the appropriate place for \nthat kind of a question.\n  The facts are pretty straightforward. In fiscal year 2004, the timber \nprogram on the Tongass cost $49 million, and $800,000 was yielded in \nrevenues. That does not mean that profitability as applied to a private \nfirm should be the standard for any multiuse effort or any effort to \nharvest timber on national forest lands because we know national forest \nlands are unique, and we know that the Forest Service has to be \ninvolved in doing things that many private timber firms either cannot \nor would not be asked to do in the private sector. So I recognize that.\n  The Senator from Alaska made a point that the loss in New Hampshire \nin the timber program was about $800,000. If so, I would hope that over \ntime we can do better than that in my state, but there is a big \ndifference between $800,000 and $48 million. The disparity of cost or \nthe costs associated per million board feet taken out are similarly \nquite significant, the loss per million board feet in New Hampshire \nbeing approximately one-third of that in the Tongass in data that I \nhave seen.\n  So profit should not be the standard, but at the same time it is hard \nfor me to justify taxpayers paying the cost of the roads. I do not \nthink asking private firms to pay for the cost of building the roads to \naccess the timber they purchase is too much of a burden to bear.\n  Finally, with regard to the multiuse concept that was mentioned, I \nstrongly support the development and application of forest plans that \nare put together locally using local stakeholders. It has been very \nsuccessful in New Hampshire. I imagine it has been successful in other \nparts of the country. In New Hampshire, we enjoy national forest lands \nfor recreation, hunting, fishing, economic interests, and a timber \nmanagement program. But even where multiple use is concerned, we need \nto strike a balance, a balance between the taxpayers' interest and a \nbalance between the long-term health of the forest itself. Where the \ntaxpayers are concerned, a subsidy of $45 million or $48 million per \nyear, stretching as far as the eye can see at this particular time, is \nunnecessary.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. I hope this at least \ncan lay the foundation for looking at subsidies not just in this \nindustry but in other areas with a little bit of a sharper eye. At a \ntime when we have $300 billion or $400 billion deficits, I do not think \nthere is any area of the budget that does not deserve tougher scrutiny.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to respond \nto several of the remarks raised by my colleague from New Hampshire. I \nstart off my comments by stating very clearly it was certainly not my \nintention, nor do I believe it was the intention of Senator Stevens, to \nquestion motives or to imply somehow our colleague is an environmental \nextremist.\n  If, in fact, that was perceived from the remarks, that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire falls in that category, again from my perspective \nthat was not my intention, and I certainly would not want him to think \nthat I have put him in that category of those who, as the Senator from \nOregon indicated, are engaged in ``professional environmental \nconflict,'' I think was the terminology he used.\n  I do wish to speak very briefly to a couple of the issues. The \nSenator from New Hampshire indicated that he was not, through his \namendment, proposing any addition of wilderness designation. He stated \nthat was not his intent. I understand that is not the intent. However, \nthe practical effect, if we were to withhold any Federal dollars, any \nopportunity for Federal revenues to come in and help with the road \nbuilding in that area, that would be the practical effect in the \nTongass. It would put off limits those areas to any harvesting of the \ntimber. If we cannot build a road in there, the harvesting will not \nhappen.\n  As the Senator from Oregon mentioned, we are dealing with an \nincredible land mass. The acreage in the Tongass is 17.8 million acres. \nAs has been said many times this evening, the area we are talking about \nthat would be available for development is a small fraction of that. \nJust 4 percent of that would be available for any form of development, \nbut still, if one is not able to put a road in, if they are not able to \naccess the area, the harvesting does not happen, and in effect what is \nbeing created is an off-limits area, off-limits to development, off-\nlimits to recreational use, off-limits to pretty much anything.\n  I was born in the Tongass. I was born in Ketchikan. At the time that \nI was born, Ketchikan was a very thriving timber community. The Tongass \nis not a place where one just goes to take a walk. It is an old growth \nforest that is as tangled and deep a forest as one can possibly \nimagine.\n  So those who would say, We want to make sure we have access to the \nTongass for recreational purposes, the way that one is able to access \nfor recreational purposes is through the roads that have been built as \nwe have harvested in certain areas. My family goes out there and we \nwant to use the area for hunting, but we do not go off the beaten track \nbecause it cannot be accessed. The animals are not in the areas that \nhave not been cleared, to a certain extent. So for those who will \nengage in the multiple use of the Tongass, these roads are significant.\n  The statement was made that those of us who are in opposition to this \namendment are saying that this really is not about the fiscal issue. I \nguess I have to just stop on that one and say, okay, if we really are \nlooking at this from a cost perspective and we are looking to minimize \nthe extent of Federal dollars going out and to be as cost efficient as \nwe possibly can, why are we just looking at the Tongass alone? If what \nwe are really talking about is to get those efficiencies, to make sure \nwe do not have unnecessary subsidies, then tell me why this is just \nabout one national forest in 1 State out of all of the 50 States. \nBecause we are not going to balance the budget on what is happening in \nthe Tongass in terms of the dollars that go out there.\n  I wish to speak just a little bit to the dollars. My colleague has \nindicated that the Tongass spent $49 million on its logging program and \nthe logging roads in 2004. The total budget to operate the Tongassis is \n$49 million. In fact, the timber program on the Tongass cost $22.5 \nmillion. He has also indicated that the timber revenues on the Tongass \nin 2004 were $800,000. In fact, the timber revenues were nearly $2 \nmillion. So it is important to make sure we are using the right \nnumbers.\n  Let us just look at what that $49 million buys us. Is this all about \nroads? No, it is not. Now, the road maintenance is an aspect of that, \nbut it is also for bridge and road construction unrelated to timber \nharvesting, other engineering projects. The work that the Forest \nService does in the Tongasssupports subsistence harvest, the fish and \nwildlife, basically keeping the grocery store open for thousands of \nrural Alaskans.\n  Senator Stevens mentioned the fish culverts that are inserted to \nallow for the fish passage. We build those so fish can get to where \nthey need to get. It is one of those things we do to make sure we are \ncaring for the environment and are good stewards.\n\n  We developed an invasive species strategy to help prevent the \nnonnative plants from coming in and taking over, as we are seeing in \nsome parts of the lower 48.\n  Basically, the bottom line is these dollars that are going out are \nnot all directed at road building. They are dollars spent on \nrecreation, visitor service, heritage, wilderness, minerals, \nvegetation, watershed, subsistence, wildlife, fish habitat, fire \nsuppression, and land acquisition. And administrative costs are \nincluded in there, as well. So when we look to the Tongass and those \ncosts, we must put it into perspective.\n  I spent a few minutes in my previous remarks looking at the costs per \nacre on other national forests across the 50 States, what is the dollar \nreturn on\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\nyour investment if we are trying to make that connection. These are \nimportant to recognize. What is very important to recognize is the \nTongass is not so way out of whack in terms of its management and its \ncosts that it should be sending off signals and red flags. In fact, my \ncolleague from Alaska has indicated the Tongass has been singled out \nand has been declared the best managed national forest in the system. \nThat ought to count for something.\n  For my colleagues who are saying this is simply a fiscal issue and we \nneed to look at it from the numbers perspective, let's look at it from \nthe numbers perspective. Let's use the right numbers, but let's also \nrecognize there is something terribly wrong with an amendment that \npulls one national forest out of all of our national forests and says: \nThere is too much going to you; we have to shut it off.\n  Folks, that is not right. It is not fair. I certainly hope my \ncolleagues, when we have an opportunity to take this up in the Senate, \nvote down this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, many States, especially those in the West, \nare dominated by Federal lands. For those States, and many others, the \nInterior appropriations bill is a singularly important piece of \nlegislation because of the funding it provides for our public land \nagencies.\n  Take Nevada, for instance. While my State contains nearly 71 million \nacres within its borders, 61 million of those are managed by Federal \nagencies. That's 86 percent of my State, or nearly 9 out of every 10 \nacres. And if that number doesn't get your attention, consider the fact \nthat two out of every three acres in Nevada are controlled by one \nFederal agency: the Bureau of Land Management.\n  I offer these statistics to highlight the significance of today's \ndebate. While the Department of Interior may not be the center of \nattention in some areas of our country, in the West, the agencies \nfunded under this bill have a measurable impact on our quality of life, \nour access to public resources, and the protection of our greatest \npublic assets.\n  Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan have done a good job crafting this \nbill. We all know that this year is especially tough in terms of \noverall funding allocations and that some tough decisions had to be \nmade. Considering the constraints they faced, these two senators have \nproduced impressive legislation. I commend them for the time and effort \nthat they and the rest of the committee have put into this bill.\n  Particularly, I am pleased that the committee funded a number of \npriority projects in Nevada. One of the key projects that this bill \nprovides funds for is the construction and improvement of the Jarbidge \nCanyon Road. This road in northern Elko County washed out over 10 years \nago and has been a major source of controversy ever since.\n  With the funding that the committee has helped provide, we will \nfinally be able to bring resolution to the issue in a way that ensures \ngreater access to our public lands while also protecting a threatened \npopulation of bull trout and shielding the road against future floods. \nThis is a win-win situation for sportsmen, for the county, for the U.S. \nForest Service, and for local residents.\n  I am also pleased that the committee saw fit to provide funding for a \nnumber of sewer and water projects that are difficult and often \nimpossible for small and rural communities to fund on their own. Even \nin some of Nevada's larger population areas, the amount of Federal land \nin those areas still makes raising funds for these projects very \ndifficult. So I thank the committee for their efforts to provide EPA \ngrant funding.\n  I also want to recognize their efforts to increase funding for the \nPayment-In-Lieu-of-Taxes program. ``PILT,'' as the program is popularly \nknown, provides millions of essential dollars to Nevada's counties each \nyear. Without these funds, the provision of basic local government \nservices such as law enforcement and street repairs would be severely \ndiminished. I look forward to the day when we will fu1ly fund this \nprogram and finally live up to the responsibilities we have to our \nrural counties.\n  I am also strongly supportive of the increased funding levels \ncontained in this bill for the National Endowment for the Arts, the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities, and the Historic Preservation \nFund. As our distinguished friend Senator Byrd has taught us on so many \noccasions, life can be not only enriched but measurably improved by a \nfuller understanding of our history, our cultural roots, and our common \nheritage. These programs deserve our respect and our support.\n  Before I close, let me remark briefly that we have a profound \nresponsibility this year, and every year, to make sure that our public \nlands and our public resources are properly managed. As the demand for \nhealthy outdoor recreation grows, so too must our commitment to proper \nstewardship.\n  I am concerned that in all too many places, budgets for agencies such \nas the BLM and the Park Service have stagnated or shrunk while the \noverall usage of our public resources has skyrocketed. The Lake Mead \nNational Recreation Area, for instance, now sees nearly 8 million \nvisitors a year, a strong increase from 10 years ago. But this same \npark has lost 40 rangers and support staff positions since 2002. We \nneed to solve this and similar problems before our greatest natural \ntreasures are lost or permanently compromised.\n  I look forward to a healthy debate on this bill and I hope Democrats \nhave a chance to offer their amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bill under consideration on the Senate \nfloor is intended to provide appropriations for the Department of \nInterior. Unfortunately, we were forced by circumstances to shift our \nfocus during the course of debating this bill to consideration of an \nemergency issue which faces our Nation that relates to funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. This is because the President's budget \ndid not provide enough funds to provide quality health care to veterans \nacross America during the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs admitted to Congress \nthat its budget for the current fiscal year will be at least $1 billion \nshort of the amount needed. Part of the reason for this is reportedly \nthat the Department based its budget needs on faulty estimates. \nReportedly, the VA thought it would see a 2.3-percent increase in \npatient demand for services. In reality, they have experienced \nincreases of 5.2 percent. In other words, the Bush administration \nmiscalculated. Their estimate of veteran patient load was less than \nhalf of what actually proved to be the case.\n  Senator Patty Murray of Washington has been our leader on this issue. \nRepeatedly in the Committee on the Budget and in the Senate she has \nsaid the Veterans' Administration was not asking for enough resources \nto take care of the veterans from other wars and the returning soldiers \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan. She spoke at length in the Senate about the \nmany opportunities we have had in the Senate over the last few months \nfor the Bush administration officials to state their true budget needs. \nThey repeatedly said they needed no more money this year. Now, \nbelatedly, they admit they are at least $1 billion short of what they \nreally need.\n  With the Murray amendment that Senator Byrd is joining and offering, \nthe Senate has an opportunity to address this serious shortfall and to \nprovide to America's veterans the real resources they need and deserve. \nOne of the medical services that unquestionably, indeed, desperately \nneeds funds is the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. The war \nin Iraq is producing a new generation of American veterans whose wounds \nare invisible. Already, we see recently returned veterans with \ndepression, anxiety, substance abuse, and post traumatic-stress \ndisorder.\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\n  As our men and women come home from battle, we must be ready to give \nthem the help they need, the help they deserve, the help we promised. I \nhave noted on numerous occasions the special need for additional VA \ncapacity to treat returning veterans suffering from PTSD. Last year, \nthe New England Journal of Medicine published data showing that roughly \none in every six returning Iraqi veterans will likely suffer this \ndebilitating mental health condition. With the number of troops having \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan now exceeding 1.1 million, it is \nabsolutely clear--it has been clear for some time now--that the VA is \ngoing to see a big increase in the need for post-traumatic stress \ndisorder treatment. Even the toughest warriors can have troubled \nfeelings following the stress of combat. It is no sign of weakness. It \nis no sign of cowardice. It certainly is no sign of failure.\n  Frankly, they need to ask for help, and we need to give it. All our \nveterans need to know that services are available to them and they \nshould not be ashamed to use them. Unfortunately, the VA's current \ncapacity to help them is lacking. The Government Accountability Office \nreported last September that officials at six out of seven VA medical \nfacilities said they may not be able to meet an increase in demand for \nPTSD services. Their own internal committee has made repeated \nrecommendations about the need to expand PTSD treatment capability \nwithin the Department, but the GAO has also recorded that the Veterans' \nAdministration has not fully implemented any of these recommendations.\n  Given the failure of the VA to expand PTSD treatment, as its own \nexperts have advised, given the failure of the VA to adequately see the \ncoming increase in patient need, given the failure of the VA to budget \nfor its real requirements, it is time for Congress to do something, to \ntake strong corrective action.\n  I have introduced legislation to fill in the gaps in the VA's \ntreatment structure for PTSD to ensure that counselors and PTSD teams \nare available in every veteran center and VA hospital. But even before \nwe make these structural changes, we can provide the funding increases \nto prevent long delays in service. This amendment we will consider from \nSenator Murray and Senator Byrd is an important step toward that goal.\n  It is a sad fact under the Bush administration's leadership that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs has failed to adequately budget for the \nhealth care needs of American veterans. Sad, but it is true. Where the \nadministration has failed, Congress must step in and correct the \nproblem. This amendment will help fill the gap.\n  In less than 20 minutes, President Bush will be speaking to America. \nHe will be talking about the situation in Iraq. He will give his speech \nin the company of some of the best and bravest men and women who serve \nin our Armed Forces. He will undoubtedly say to them, on behalf of all \nMembers, that we stand behind them. His words will be heartfelt and \nthey will truly represent the way we feel about the men and women in \nuniform. But our commitment to soldiers and to veterans has to go \nbeyond statements on television. It has to go beyond speeches. It has \nto go beyond some of the things that are left in the Congressional \nRecord each day as a tribute. It has to be shown in our deeds.\n\n  We will have a chance with the Murray amendment to put the necessary \nfunds in the Veterans' Department so that the hospitals and clinics \nacross America can help our veterans from other wars and our soldiers \ncoming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. The assistance which they need \ncan help right now. The longer a soldier is troubled, the longer a \nsoldier suffers from PTSD and the stress and anxiety and depression \nthat comes with it, the more difficult it is for them to finally break \naway and to return to a normal life. Quick, professional care is \nnecessary.\n  Don't look beyond the fact that many of these soldiers have spouses \nand children who are affected by their problems. They need help, too. \nFamily therapy from VA should be part of this commitment.\n  As I traveled around Illinois a few months back and met with the \nsoldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I was stunned. Some of \nthe youngest, strongest, best-looking soldiers who returned, men and \nwomen, who appeared to have no concerns at all, back at home in \ncivilian life, were struggling with demons inside, demons that were \ncreated by things that they saw, things that they did, things that they \nwere exposed to which many of us, thank God, will never have to see. We \nneed to help them. We need to make sure that our commitment to them \ngoes beyond a cheer, goes beyond a kind word, goes to the deeds that \nare necessary to prove our true commitment to the men and women in \nuniform.\n  This last group I spoke to was the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nConvention, a statewide convention in Illinois in the city of Peoria. \nIt was a good meeting. They were mainly veterans from other wars, from \nthe Persian Gulf, Vietnam, Korea, World War II. These were primarily \nmen but some women who had served our country and were coming together. \nTime and again, they asked us to not only stand behind our troops, but \nalso stand behind our veterans. They challenged me. They said: Senator, \nbe the best Senator we have ever had in this State for the veterans and \nsoldiers. I will try to show them that I can live up to the challenge.\n  With this amendment, the Murray amendment which I have supported \nbefore, and which now should pass, the Senate can go on record on a \nbipartisan basis saying we stand behind our soldiers and our veterans.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Let me say a word, Mr. President, about the President's speech this \nevening about the war in Iraq. Once again, it goes without saying that \nwe are all committed to the men and women in uniform. The last time \nthere was a supplemental appropriations bill on the floor that the \nPresident asked for, in the range of $81 billion, for the war in Iraq, \nit passed unanimously 100 to 0. I think that tells the story. Whether \nyou agreed with the President's policy beginning this war or disagreed, \nwe all agree that our men and women in uniform should have everything \nthey need to execute this war.\n  But it is a war unlike any that we fought in recent times. It is hard \nto claim territory and hold it. Fallujah, just a few months ago, was \nthe scene of great carnage, as American troops went in to root out the \ninsurgents and terrorists. We lost a lot of our wonderful soldiers in \nthat battle. They achieved their goal. They cleared out Fallujah. Yet, \njust a few days ago, we lost more soldiers in that same city; in this \ncase, several women soldiers who lost their lives in the terrorism that \nhas now become too commonplace. So claiming and holding territory is \nobviously very difficult in Iraq.\n  It is also difficult to identify an enemy that does not wear a \nuniform, does not stand in formation, and wreaks its havoc with these \nroadside bombs and other terrorist devices they use. It is a different \ntype of war.\n  We are concerned as well about the status of the Government in Iraq. \nIt is a government in formation. They are trying to put together a \nconstitution.\n  Two of my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan \nand Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Democrat and a Republican, sent a \nletter to the President to urge him, in his speech tonight, to make it \nclear to the Iraqis they have to hold fast to the timetables to form \ntheir own government and take responsibility for their own future. \nThose two Senators, one from each political party, said if they failed \nto do that, we had to make it clear to them that we would have to \nreassess our commitment in Iraq.\n  Those are strong words, bipartisan words, but I think they represent \nthe feelings of many Americans. We have done a great thing in Iraq in \nremoving Saddam Hussein. That was never the issue. The question, of \ncourse, was, what would happen afterward. We had a good plan to win the \nmilitary side of this conflict and to win the war. We did not have a \ngood plan to win the peace. More than 2 years after our invasion of \nIraq, more than 1,734 American soldiers have given their lives, more \nthan 13,000 have been gravely wounded. And, unfortunately, those \nnumbers will increase.\n  Tonight, the President will talk to us about his plan. If this, what \nwe have seen to date, is what the President's plan is in Iraq, we \nclearly need a much\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\ndifferent plan. We need a plan for success, a plan for victory, a plan \nthat will bring our troops home.\n  There is a feeling among many of us in this Chamber and across \nAmerica that we do not have that plan today. The President has to be \nhonest with us about the costs of this war, first in human terms and \nmost certainly in dollar terms. Some of our early allies have picked up \nand left--more burden on American soldiers, more burden on American \ntaxpayers.\n  Finally, this Congress needs to do its job, not just to provide the \nresources for those soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan but to also make \ncertain there is oversight. Yesterday, Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator \nLautenberg, and a few others, held a hearing from the Democratic Policy \nCommittee on Halliburton. Halliburton is, of course, one of the largest \ncontractors in Iraq. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of contracts \nhave gone their way without competitive bid and with precious little \noversight.\n  What Senator Dorgan and others have disclosed in the course of those \nhearings is nothing short of shameful. We should be holding every \ncontractor in Iraq accountable to produce good equipment, to produce \ngood armaments, to provide our troops with what they need to succeed \nand come home safely. But this Congress, dominated by the President's \npolitical party, is loathe to even raise these difficult questions. So \nwe have to hold a hearing on Monday mornings and hope that someone will \nnotice as whistleblowers come forward and talk about some of the \nscandals that are occurring with the contractors in Iraq.\n  Congress has dropped the ball. We have a responsibility, regardless \nof who is in the White House and what political party he might belong \nto, to accept our congressional responsibility to ask hard questions.\n  President Harry Truman knew that. When he was a Senator from \nMissouri, he was the one asking the hard questions of Franklin \nRoosevelt's Democratic administration during World War II: Were they \ndoing their job? Was there profiteering? Were there people taking \nadvantage of taxpayers and our troops? Senator Truman was right with \nhis Truman commission. Unfortunately, in today's Congress, there is \nnothing coming out of the Republican side of the aisle to ask those \nhard questions, to make sure our troops get what they truly deserve.\n  So tonight we will hear from the President that our goal is still \ndemocracy in Iraq. It is a good goal. It is one I hope we can achieve. \nBut it is a difficult goal. And we have to understand that the Iraqis \nhave premier responsibility for their own future.\n  Mr. President, 140,000 or 150,000 American troops, with their lives \non the line every day in Iraq, remind us that we went into this war \nwithout a plan on how it would end, without an exit strategy. I hope \nthe President will spell that out with some detail this evening. I am \nnot expecting him to say there will be a timetable for withdrawal. He \nhas already said he is not in favor of that. But we need to know what \nhis plan for success will be.\n  Tomorrow, when we vote on this amendment on the Interior bill on the \nVA funding, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure for our \nveterans and for our soldiers. We must appropriate the funds the VA \nneeds to provide our veterans the health care they deserve, to treat \nboth the lasting battle scars that can be seen and those battle scars \nthat remain invisible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1038, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call for the regular order in relation \nto amendment No. 1038.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I, at the outset, thank both Senator \nBingaman and Senator Thomas for their willingness to sponsor this \namendment, which is an important amendment for counties, especially in \nthe western part of the United States where so much of our land is held \nin the hands of the Federal Government.\n  I would like to underscore the importance of the Payment in Lieu of \nTaxes Program. PILT funds are Federal payments to local governments. We \nall understand that property taxes are the main source of revenue for \nlocal governments. Anyone who has spent any time at all in Colorado or \nin the West will recognize that local governments there do not have a \ntax base because the Federal Government owns huge tracts of land in our \nStates. In my State alone, approximately one-third of Colorado is owned \nby the Federal Government.\n  Earlier this spring, in my first Senate trip around our great State, \nI held meetings with local-elected officials. Time and time again, \nthese local-elected officials--mayors and county commissioners--\ninformed me about the importance of full PILT funding and that it is \ntheir No. 1 priority.\n  Sadly, PILT has never been fully funded by this Congress. Congress \nregularly shortchanges local governments with Federal lands by \nappropriating less than the authorized levels. To that end, one of the \nfirst bills I introduced as a U.S. Senator would make full funding of \nPILT a mandatory priority for this Congress every year.\n  In 2005, more than $226 million was distributed to approximately \n1,850 local governments in 49 of our 50 States whose jurisdictions \ncontain tax-exempt Federal lands. In my State of Colorado, over $16 \nmillion was paid to local communities for over 2.3 million acres of \ntax-exempt Federal lands. These funds have been used to help improve \nlocal schools, water, and road systems.\n  President Bush's budget request cut PILT funding for 2006 by $27 \nmillion. Fortunately, Congress has responded forcefully to that \nrequest. The House of Representatives passed a bill with $242 million \nfor PILT funding, and the good work of the Appropriations subcommittee \nin the Senate has gotten us to $235 million, which is the proposal in \nthis bill.\n  My amendment would increase PILT funding to $242 million from the \ncurrent level of $235 million in the Interior appropriations bill. That \nincrease would be offset with $7 million from the Department of \nInterior's overhead funds.\n  Earlier this afternoon, I spoke with Interior Secretary Norton and \nwith Senators Burns and Dorgan about my amendment and my strong desire \nto see PILT funding as close to full authorization levels as possible. \nI appreciate the consideration that Senators Burns and Dorgan have \ngiven to my amendment and to the importance of the issue of PILT. I \nknow they will represent the hopes and needs of rural counties in the \nconference committee and will work to ensure that the conference report \nis at least at the House level of $242 million for PILT.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take just a minute to address \n48 extraordinary hours in my life this past weekend I spent with the \nmen and women in the U.S. Armed Forces, first on Saturday in Ellijay, \nGA, at the funeral of 1LT Noah Harris of the U.S. Army, and then 24 \nhours later at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where I spent the day with U.S. \nArmed Forces in the work they are doing with the detainees in the war \non terror.\n  I wish to do the best I can today to speak for those with whom I \ntalked. I take responsibility for every word I say, but they are every \nbit a message from the people with whom I talked and who shared with \nme.\n  First, at the funeral of 1LT Noah Harris, I eulogized Noah on last \nThursday and made a promise that I would make it to Ellijay, GA, on \nSaturday to be at his service. He was a distinguished Georgian, and \nlike every other soldier who served and sacrificed, we mourn his death \nbut we praise his service to our country. But this was an extraordinary \nfuneral service.\n  A thousand Georgians--500 in the high school gym and 500 in the First \nMethodist Church--attended a 2\\1/2\\ hour service that passed in a \nmicrosecond, a service not by ministers but by laymen, Americans, \ncitizens of Georgia to praise Noah Harris but also to praise our men \nand women in harm's way.\n  When the service came to a conclusion, it was his mother Lucy and his \ndad Rick who talked for the last 20 minutes. To honor what they said \nand their son to the best of my ability, I want to recount it to all of \nyou.\n  Lucy stood up before that crowd of 500 and said: You know, when we \ngot the word of Noah's death, I knew I had two choices: I could mourn \nand I could be sorrowful and I could grieve, and I have done all those, \nbut I could also do the good and the godly thing, and that is to praise \nmy son and all those other men and women who fight in Iraq on behalf of \nfreedom and democracy.\n  She gave a beautiful and eloquent statement about the tribute her \nson's life was to that for which our men and women fight.\n  Then her husband stood up and asked rhetorically: What was it the \nAmerican press is really writing about today? Everything you hear about \nwhat is going on in Iraq is negative and wrong, questioning our motives \nand our reasons for being there. Yet in this church in quiet Ellijay, \nGA, in northwest Georgia, thousands had come to honor a man who had \nsacrificed his life in harm's way for the people of Iraq and the \nprinciples of this great Nation.\n  Rick Harris asked the question: Have we forgotten 9/11? Have we \nforgotten that since that date there has not been an attack on American \nsoil? Since we went after terror, wherever its exists, and since we \ncommitted the resources of our country, our Nation has been safer. And \nwhat we are doing is right--is not only right morally, but it is right \nfor the future of peace and freedom and democracy.\n  So for Lucy and Rick Harris, on behalf of their son, I rise today in \nthis Senate and send that message loud and clear that I got last \nSaturday from a thousand Georgians proud of their native son's service, \nsorrowful for his loss but appreciative of living in a country that has \nbeen willing to make the commitment we have made on behalf of freedom \nand democracy around the world and on behalf of the security of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  And then, Mr. President, I went to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I went with \ntwo other Members of the Senate. I went with a specific desire in mind: \nthe desire to go and see for myself that which I heard so many people \ntalk about and have seen so much about on television.\n  I learned something very interesting. There must be two Guantanamo \nBay, Cubas--the one I visited and the one all the news media talks \nabout because they did not resemble one another. I thought when I \nlanded at Guantanamo Bay and went to visit the detainees that I would \nsee men incarcerated in cyclone fences with razor wire on top of it. \nThat does not exist anymore. That was Camp X-Ray. It was closed 3 years \nago. It was the original temporary place we took the enemy combatants \nto until we could spend the millions of dollars to build the buildings \nthat now house them.\n\n[[Page S7486]]\n\n  I saw 538 people who are intent on hurting and destroying Americans, \nwho are incarcerated in a facility from which we are gaining \nintelligence that is saving lives of Americans and citizens around the \nworld. The most hardened of those I saw are in air-conditioned \nfacilities, not unlike what I have seen in the United States in \nsheriffs' jails and prisons. The food they eat is unbelievable. The \nmedical care is first rate. The security is tight and, yes, they are \ncontrolled, but they are there because they are the enemies of our \nNation and were captured in battle in the worldwide war on terror.\n  After seeing all those facilities and having totally dispelled that \nwhich television shows, I had lunch with two Georgia sailors. I \npromised them I would bring a message back to the Senate. They are on a \n6-month rotation as guards guarding the enemy combatants, the \nterrorists who threaten America.\n  I asked them: If I could take back anything, what would you like me \nto do? They said: Please tell the American media to stop saying what \nthey are saying about what we are doing in Guantanamo because what we \nare doing is right and what is being alleged is not correct. And tell \nthem what we, the guards, the American soldiers, are subjected to.\n  The two gentlemen with whom I had lunch are two African-American \ncitizens of the State of Georgia serving in the U.S. Navy. They go 12 \nhours on and 12 hours off, 4 consecutive days guarding enemy \ncombatants. Every day, they have to take a shower more than once during \ntheir duty to wipe off and wash off the human waste that is thrown on \nthem by the enemy combatants they guard. They are subjected to racial \nepithets that we in the United States would never accept. They continue \nto stay on their post and do their duty, and there is no harm to the \nenemy combatants. They are sitting there guarding the people who would \ntake the lives of your loved ones and mine.\n  They are abused every day, and what is alleged by people in this \nChamber and other places about what may or may not be happening at \nGuantanamo is not correct. The people subjected to abuse are the men \nand women in the Armed Forces of the United States who take it from \nthose who would harm us and harm our loved ones.\n  They are standing guard in the front line in the war on terror. My \ntime is about up, but I came to the floor for this time to deliver two \nmessages. First, for Rick and Lucy Harris on behalf of their son, Noah, \nI hope I did an adequate job.\n  Second, to deliver the message by those two servicemen from Georgia, \nwho stand on the front line of the war on terror guarding the enemy \ncombatants from whom we are gaining the intelligence that is saving \nAmerican lives; enemy combatants who are treated well, fed well, \nclothed well, and medically treated well; enemy combatants who would \ntake the lives of our loved ones but because of the commitment of our \nPresident, this country, and the men and women in harm's way, are \nsafely incarcerated, and from whom we are gaining the information \nnecessary to win the global war on terror.\n  I hope tonight all Americans will watch our President on TV. I hope \ntonight in some small way the message I have brought back from those \nvalued soldiers will help us to remain to stay the course against the \nwar on terror for democracy and freedom and in support of this country, \nits leadership, and the liberty and freedom we all cherish and love.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to amendment No. \n1052, an amendment offered by myself, Senator Byrd, and Senator \nFeinstein regarding emergency supplemental funding for the Veterans \nHealth Administration.\n  As my colleagues know, throughout the last 6 months I have been \ntalking to this body about my deep concern that we were not going to \nhave sufficient funding for our veterans, both our current veterans who \nare accessing the system, nor for our veterans who are now returning \nhome in record numbers from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Throughout the budget process, I asked that we consider making sure \nwe have additional funding. I was rejected in that request. Throughout \nthe appropriations process, I have made it known time and time again \nthat looking at what we know, we are not going to have sufficient \nfunding for our veterans health care.\n  On the supplemental emergency bill, I offered an amendment to add an \nadditional $1.98 billion for veterans services, and I outlined on this \nfloor for all of my colleagues the exact numbers we were looking at as \nwe went out and talked to our regional veterans administrations, as we \nheard the stories of shortfalls in every single place across this \ncountry, about service men and women who are waiting in line, about the \nhigh number of returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who would \nneed access to mental health care services for post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome, and I asked that we add emergency supplemental funding \nbecause I knew, looking at the numbers, we had a shortfall.\n  On this floor, I was defeated on that amendment. Why? Because the \nSecretary of the VA, Secretary Nicholson, sent a letter to this body \nsaying they had sufficient funds.\n  That was less than 3 months ago. Several weeks ago in the Veterans' \nCommittee I asked the Secretary, when he was before us, if they had \nsufficient funding, and he told us they had adequate funding.\n  Last Thursday, to everyone's surprise, except a few of us, we were \ntold that the VA is now over $1 billion short in funding this year. \nThis is surprising to some, but it should be appalling to all of us.\n  As I told my colleagues when I was on the floor talking about the \nsupplemental, we all know that the veterans in VA care have gone up by \n88 percent. We know that medical inflation has gone up 92 percent. But \nthe VA continued to go on a formula based on 2002 figures that did not \nadequately take into account our military who were going to be \naccessing the veterans services, nor the fact that we all know of \nmedical inflation.\n  So here we are today, and it would be easy to say I told you so, but \nthat is not going to solve the problem. So last Thursday, I called \nSecretary Nicholson. I said: How are you going to solve this problem? \nWhat are we going to do?\n  Well, he said to me that we were going to take the money out of \nmaintenance and construction projects.\n  I would let every one of my colleagues know that all of them have VA \nfacilities in their own States or in their own region that are serving \nour veterans today that need asbestos removal. There are new clinics \nthat have been promised for years. There is maintenance due, long-term \nbacklogs that have not been completed that we voted on in the 2005 \nappropriations bill and promised to our men and women back in our home \nStates would be taken care of this year.\n\n  We cannot go back on that promise right now. Those veterans are \nwaiting for that service. If we were to say, well, we have to suck it \nup and take the money out, that means we are just going to defer those \ncosts until next year. If we are today basing our figures of the VA on \n2002 numbers, then we know the $1.5 billion we are short this year is \ngoing to be multiplied by two or three times next year and those \nfacilities will not be fixed.\n  So we have a problem. We have a big problem, and we need to address \nit now. I believe the best and most important way we can do that \nquickly is through an emergency supplemental bill passed through the \nHouse and Senate to get the VA the money they need to serve our \nveterans. This is an emergency.\n  None of our veterans who served in previous conflicts should be told \nthat they have to wait 6 months or a year or 3 years. None of our \nveterans who are being served in our hospitals today should be looking \nat facilities that are falling down around them. None of our veterans \nwho are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan should be told that they \ndo not have adequate care and we are not there for them.\n  I was just in Iraq 2 months ago and the first question that my \nsoldiers from Washington State asked me is: Will my country be there \nfor me when I get home?\n  The Senate has been responsible by passing a bill last year to begin \nto put\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nin place those contracts, maintenance, and important facilities \nprojections. We cannot take that away now. Our only responsible choice \nremaining is to pass an emergency supplemental.\n  I have to say I am deeply concerned about how our VA came to this, \nand I am frankly quite angry. Less than 3 months ago, our VA said, no \nproblem. Our VA, 2-plus weeks ago, said no problem, and now they tell \nus they are well over a billion dollars short this year. In fact, what \nthey are saying is we can fix that; we can take $600 million from \nconstruction, as I just talked about.\n  We cannot let them do that.\n  The other $400 million they are talking about coming up out of a \nreserve fund. I have been on this floor before talking about this. \nThere is not a reserve fund. I asked Dr. Jonathan Perlin. He is the \nVA's Acting Under Secretary for Health. I asked him on April 5th: Is \nthere a $500 million reserve?\n  He said to me:\n\n       No . . . I do not know where that might have been \n     suggested, but there is no $500 million reserve that is \n     sitting there for future projects.\n\n  So the White House's solution, the VA's solution, to take $600 \nmillion from construction and $500 million from this reserve account \ndoes not exist. Those are already part of our appropriations and there \nis no reserve account. So it is time for us to be responsible. It is \ntime for us to face up to the fact that we have not been given accurate \nfigures from this administration on veterans, and we need to act \nresponsibly to pass an emergency supplemental.\n  I want to say that Senator Craig, the chair of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, and Senator Hutchison, the chair of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs, and Related Agencies, have been responsible in the last few \ndays by addressing this crisis. We have held a hearing this morning \nunder Senator Craig's direction to hear from the VA what their solution \nwas.\n  As I have said, that is simply unacceptable to me. It should be \nunacceptable to this Senate. I want to work with anyone to solve this \nproblem. We have an amendment that is now pending. It is amendment No. \n1052 to have an emergency supplemental to deal with this crisis. I know \nthat my colleagues on the other side feel that we must address this as \nwell, and I hope that we can work this amendment out and get it passed \non the Interior appropriations, get it passed through the House and \nsent to the President so that our members who are serving us, both in \nprevious conflicts and in Iraq and Afghanistan today, can look any one \nof us in the eye on the Fourth of July recess, when we all go home to \nmarch in parades and carry our flags, and we can say, yes, this country \nis there for you.\n  I can think of no more important issue that this body should address \nbefore the upcoming recess than this pending crisis before us. We owe \nit to the troops who have served us so honorably to be there for them \nwhen they come home. We cannot say to them that your clinics will not \nbe built, that your hospitals will not be maintained, that there is a \nhiring freeze and you will not be seen if you show up.\n  We all have talked to generals who are in Iraq, and every member of \nthis body knows that this is a 360-degree war. We have been told that \ntime and time again. Our members in the military who are serving us in \nIraq and Afghanistan do not have a front line to go behind to get some \nease from this conflict. They are in this conflict every single minute \nof every single day that they are there, and as a result of that many \nof them will be facing emotional stress and post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome when they get home.\n  It would be wrong of this country to tell those members who served us \nso well that there are no services for them when they come home. We \nhave a responsibility not as a Republican, not as a Democrat, but as an \nAmerican to be there for them. The most responsible way to do this is \nthrough this amendment with an emergency supplemental.\n  I think who said it best was George Washington back in 1789:\n\n       The willingness with which our young people are likely to \n     serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \n     proportional as to how they perceive the veterans of earlier \n     wars were treated and appreciated by their country.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this emergency supplemental funding, \nget it to the House, and get it to the White House so that we can \naddress this crisis that has come before us. We can say a lot of stuff \nabout the VA and why the numbers were wrong and why what we knew on \nthis floor were not listened to and were not told to us honestly. We \ncan spend time doing that, but I think the most important thing we can \ndo is make sure this funding is there for our soldiers, and we do it \nthrough an emergency supplemental in a responsible way.\n  The President is going to address the Nation this evening. He is \ngoing to talk to us about the importance of staying the course in Iraq. \nWell, I would say to the President and to the Members of the Senate, \nwhen we send our troops to war, part of the cost of that is making sure \nwe are there for them when they come home. I urge the President, when \nhe addresses the Nation tonight, to tell us how this administration is \ngoing to be there for our soldiers when they return and work with us to \npass this emergency supplemental as expeditiously as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n\n                         Mutual Fund Regulation\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Securities and Exchange Commission--\nSEC--has been impressively led by Chairman William Donaldson. Chairman \nDonaldson inherited an agency in turmoil. The previous chairman left an \nagency with limited effectiveness and demoralized staff. The SEC needed \na vocal, imaginative, and forceful leader to restore the trust of \ninvestors.\n  Chairman Donaldson has accomplished much during his tenure, such as \nreform of the mutual fund industry, the implementation of Sarbanes-\nOxley, the registration of hedge funds, while improving the integrity \nof exchanges. He has been the friend and protector of investors. \nUnfortunately, this has brought him a lot of criticism. I have been \nimpressed by his ability to fight for what he considers to be in the \nbest interests of investors and the public. I was deeply saddened when \nChairman Donaldson announced his resignation. I am concerned about the \nfuture of the Commission after his departure.\n  In particular, I am worried about mutual fund reform. Mutual funds \nare of particular interest to me because they are investment vehicles \nthat millions of middle-income Americans utilize that provide \ndiversification and professional money management. Wealthier \nindividuals can have their own investment managers and private bankers, \nor invest in hedge funds. Mutual funds are what average investors rely \non for retirement, savings for children's college education, or other \nfinancial goals and dreams.\n  I was appalled by the flagrant abuses of trust among mutual fund \ncompanies that were discovered by New York Attorney General Eliot \nSpitzer and the SEC in 2003. Ordinary investors were being harmed due \nto the greed of brokers, mutual fund companies, and institutional and \nlarge investors. In November 2003, I introduced S. 1822, the Mutual \nFund Transparency Act of 2003. I introduced legislation to bring about \nstructural reform to the mutual fund industry, increase disclosures in \norder to provide useful and relevant information to mutual fund \ninvestors, and restore trust among investors. Several key provisions of \nthe legislation were the requirements that mutual fund chairman and 75 \npercent of board members be independent. The transgressions brought to \nlight made it clear that the boards of mutual fund companies are not \nproviding sufficient oversight. To be more effective, the boards must \nbe strengthened and made to be more independent. Independent directors \nmust have a dominant presence on the board to ensure that investors' \ninterests are the paramount priority.\n  I applauded the efforts of the SEC to adopt proposals that will \nimprove the governance of mutual funds and that mirrored provisions \nfrom my legislation. Again, Chairman Donaldson and the majority of the \ncommissioners have made great attempts to address the widespread abuse \nof investors by the mutual fund industry. The independence requirements \nare an important part of the Commission's response\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\nthat will ultimately lead to improved governance, better protect \nshareholders from possible abuse, and improve the transparency of fees. \nThe SEC requirements for an independent chairman for mutual fund boards \nand an increase in the percentage of independent directors to 75 \npercent are significant steps towards ensuring that independent \ndirectors are better able to protect shareholders' interests. I believe \nthat the Commission must go forward with the independence rule and \naddress the concerns raised by the Federal appeals court.\n  Several of my colleagues have written to the Commission saying that \nthe reissuance of the rule would be inappropriate. I respectfully \ndisagree. It is not out of the ordinary for outgoing agency leaders to \nmove rules forward prior to their departure. The uncertainy of the \nfuture of the independence rule for the mutual fund industry and of the \noutcome of the confirmation process, require that action be taken on \nthe rule as soon as possible.\n  On May 16, I reintroduced a modified version of my original bill, S. \n1037, to further strengthen the independence of boards, make investors \nmore aware of the true costs of their mutual funds, and prevent several \nkey reforms from being rolled back. Legislation is needed to ensure \nthat the increased independence rule is applied universally among \nmutual funds, not just those that rely on exemptive rules.\n  I look forward to meeting with Representative Cox to discuss mutual \nfund regulation, prior to consideration of his nomination by the \nSenate. It is my hope that Representative Cox will be as aggressive in \nprotecting investors as Chairman Donaldson has been.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to enact mutual \nfund reform legislation. I support the efforts to move the mutual fund \nindependence requirements forward and appreciate all of the hard work \nof Chairman Donaldson and the SEC staff on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the order we agreed on was to \nrecognize the Chair. I do not want to abuse that process. I will talk \nbeyond 3, but it will not be that extensive. I ask the Chair if it \nmeets with his approval to change the order so that I speak now and the \nChair will speak when he is relieved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How long does the Senator from Massachusetts \nseek?\n  Mr. KERRY. I can't tell you exactly, 15 or 20 minutes, somewhere in \nthat vicinity.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will take the chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I ask unanimous \nconsent to add Senator Jeffords and Senator Salazar as cosponsors to \nthe Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1010, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1010.\n  I ask unanimous consent the current order in terms of the amendment \nbe waived so we can discuss this amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is the pending business.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment that will address \nan issue that is becoming a problem in my home State of Ohio and a \nnumber of other States nationwide--the explosive growth of Indian \ngambling.\n  I thank Senator Enzi, Senator DeWine, Senator Vitter and Senator \nAllard for cosponsoring my amendment.\n  Currently, there are over 400 tribal casinos in 30 States. To build \non the success of these tribal casinos, some Native American tribes are \naggressively seeking to take gambling off reservations and into local \ncommunities all across the country--from States like California to New \nYork, Oregon to Florida, and my home State of Ohio.\n  In this practice, commonly referred to as ``reservation shopping,'' \ntribes are looking to acquire new, non-contiguous land to open casinos \nnear large communities or next to major roads with easy access.\n  A loophole in the law that regulates Indian gaming, the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, allows the Department of Interior to take land into \ntrust for a tribal casino, even at great distances from their home \nreservation, if it advances the economic interest of the tribe.\n  Originally, many reservations were located in rural areas at great \ndistances from population centers. They were unable to sustain \nprofitable casinos, so they moved casinos to areas near cities that \nwere part of the reservation. Now these casinos aren't enough--the \ntribes are looking at lands great distances from their reservations and \nnear population centers like Cleveland, Chicago, Miami, the Bay Area of \nCalifornia, to name a few.\n  In Ohio, the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma has filed a land claim \nin Federal court for 146 square miles throughout the State, alleging \nthat this land was illegally taken in 19th Century treaties.\n  They have also reached an agreement with four separate mayors in the \nState to site casinos in their communities, stating that a casino \ncomplex would bring new jobs and increase the tax base. In announcing \ntheir lawsuit, the Eastern Shawnee announced they would also try to \nblackmail the State of Ohio--they will drop the land claim in exchange \nfor the right to put an unlimited number of casinos in the State. The \ntribe's attorneys said the aim was not to seize cities and farms, but \nto negotiate a deal to open casinos where the tribe has been invited.\n  It is important to note here that the population of Ohio is more than \nthree times the size of the population in Oklahoma, where the Eastern \nShawnee already have a casino. The tribe sees dollar signs, dollar \nsigns that they will make at the detriment of my constituents.\n  In response to the threat of reservation shopping nationwide, the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee has held a number of hearings \ninvestigating the current issues, and Senator McCain, the Chairman of \nthe Committee, has indicated that he will be offering legislation this \nCongress to address the reservation shopping created as an unintended \nconsequence of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. It is my hope that his \nlegislation will close some of the loopholes created by this law.\n  The amendment I have offered to the Interior Appropriations bill is \nsimply a moratorium on taking land into trust by the Department of \nInterior for the purposes of gambling unless the Governor of a State \nspecifically gives his consent. This moratorium will give Congress the \ntime needed to pass thoughtful legislation that will protect States \nfrom the threat to States rights that the proliferation of these \ncasinos will have.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask why I am opposed to the prospect of \nIndian casinos in Ohio. The answer is simple. This issue is really \nabout families. Back when I was a State representative and just \nbeginning my career in government, I was asked how I would confront the \nproblems of Ohio if I had a magic wand.\n  My answer then was the same as it is now: I would use it to \nreconstitute and protect the family, which is the foundation of this \ncountry and the reason why most of us get up in the morning, go to work \nand hurry to get home at the end of the day.\n  In the late 1980s, when I was Mayor of Cleveland, the first attack \nagainst our families was mounted by the backers of what studies call \nthe ``crack cocaine'' of gambling: casino gambling. Voters fought back \nat the polls in 1990. We defeated the effort to amend the Ohio \nconstitution that prohibits gambling in Ohio, but it wasn't long before \nit surfaced in Ohio again.\n  In 1996, as Governor of Ohio, I was proud to lead a coalition of some \n130 organizations, dozens of elected officials and thousands of \nindividual citizens, in defeating State Issue 1, another effort to \namend the Ohio constitution, the second ballot initiative that would \nhave legalized casino gambling.\n  So here we are in 2005 and it's deja vu all over again. It's a new \nmillennium, but the same forces are back, but this time they are joined \nby the Shawnee tribe. They have regrouped and reappeared in different \ndisguises.\n  This amendment, which just lasts one year, will guarantee that \nthrough\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nstealth this tribe and others can not sneak into the Department of \nInterior and get land taken into trust and abrogate the Ohio \nconstitution. It also gives urgency to the work by Senator McCain as he \ngrapples to deal with the proliferation of reservation shopping around \nthe country.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Governors Association. I \nask unanimous consent that the letter from Ray Scheppach, Executive \nDirector of NGA, be printed in the Record immediately following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, this amendment is opposed by Senator \nMcCain as chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. It is \nopposed by Senator McCain, not because he is not concerned about the \nproliferation of Indian gaming, but rather because he believes this is \nwithin the jurisdiction of his committee and that he is already \naddressing the issue.\n  He has indicated he will give me a hearing on my amendment right \nafter the July break. This issue of Indian gaming is a serious threat \nto the people of Ohio and other people throughout the country. It is an \nissue in terms of States rights and the States' Constitution and their \nability to deal with the issue of casino gambling.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully withdraw my amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                   National Governors Association,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2005.\n     Hon. George V. Voinovich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: The nation's governors appreciate \n     your efforts to ensure that states continue to play a \n     meaningful role in the trust land acquisition process. The \n     Governors are committed to working with Congress, the \n     Executive Branch and Indian tribal governments to resolve the \n     Complex issues involved in the implementation of the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA).\n       By requiring the consent of the governor before land can be \n     placed into trust for gaming purposes, your proposed \n     amendment would underscore the governors' role in the trust \n     land acquisition process and in determining whether Indian \n     gaming is consistent with existing state gaming policy.\n       Thank you for your continued leadership in support of a \n     strong role for states in our federal system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Raymond C. Scheppach,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto express my continued concerns about the proliferation of off-\nreservation gambling by Indian tribes. I know that Senator McCain is \nholding a number of hearings in the Indian Affairs Committee to \ninvestigate this issue. I urge him to act quickly on this issue. It is \nvery important to my home State of Ohio.\n  Mr. McCain, I understand the Senator from Ohio's concerns, and \nappreciate the Senator not calling for a vote on his amendment. I will \nbe holding a hearing in the Indian Affairs Committee in July and would \nwelcome Senator Voinovich to testify at that time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership \nand accept his invitation to testify on this issue before his \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Let the Chair \nconvey thanks to the Senator for his patience before making his \npresentation. It is appreciated very much.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if I may, Senator Akaka had asked if he might make \nsome comments on the amendment of Senator Murray, and so I would ask \nunanimous consent that I can yield to Senator Akaka for 3 minutes and \nthen hold the floor after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nyielding me the time.\n  I rise today in support of the amendment to rectify the funding \ncrisis for VA health care. You heard Senator Murray expound on this \neloquently. This morning, the committee held a hearing on the \nrevelation that VA is more than $1 billion in the hole for this year. \nWith the VA's announcement, we at least now have an admission that the \nVA hospitals and clinics are in the red, and this is the first step in \nturning things around.\n  Despite the tremendous pressure to keep quiet, VA's dedicated \nproviders have been forthright with us about the fact that they were \nraiding capital accounts just to make ends meet. There seems to be some \nconfusion about what kinds of projects will be done because of the $1-\nbillion shortfall. We have asked for a specific list from VA and \nhopefully we will receive that shortly. At the very least, we are \ntalking about deferred maintenance, and anyone who is familiar with the \nmilitary knows that deferred maintenance means trouble for our troops. \nThe same is true for a hospital or clinic. The purchase and replacement \nof equipment directly impacts the quality of care provided. Let there \nbe no mistake about that. Deferring capital projects may also mean that \nneeded clinics--and there are more than 120 clinics in the queue--will \nnever come to fruition. My colleagues in the Senate will be familiar \nwith this issue. Indeed, we raised the issue earlier this year on the \nSenate floor. Unfortunately, VA officials denied that trouble was \nahead. Our amendment is a way to fix the problem. But let me say that I \nam open to any approach that ensures the highest quality health care \nfor our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1029, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Hawaii. Before \ntaking time to speak in morning business, I have a couple of procedural \nitems I need to do. One, I thank the Senator from Washington, speaking \nas a veteran and as somebody who has introduced an amendment that I am \nabout to ask be withdrawn. In fact, let me do that if I may, Mr. \nPresident. I call up amendment No. 1029.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is an amendment I had been working on \nin an effort to try to add money back to the VA, and I am delighted \nthat the appropriators, led by Senator Byrd and Senator Murray, have \nundertaken to do that now. So I would ask unanimous consent--I am now a \ncosponsor of their amendment--that I withdraw this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. Senator Murray could not be more \ncorrect, and I thank her on behalf of veterans all across the country \nwho understand how this game is affecting their lives. The fact is that \nthis funding is one of the hidden costs of the war and now no longer \nhidden, and veterans are beginning to feel it and VA hospitals across \nour Nation. She has been a tireless, tenacious advocate on behalf of \nveterans, and we are all very grateful to her and grateful to Senator \nByrd for their leadership.\n  (The remarks of Senator Kerry are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the pending \namendment No. 1052, which is the emergency supplemental funding for the \nveterans services which I spoke about earlier. I thank my colleagues, \nSenators Akaka and Kerry, for their remarks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators \nto our amendment as cosponsors: Senators Jeffords, Salazar, Bill \nNelson, Dayton, Rockefeller, and Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask for the regular order \nwith respect to the amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have cosponsored the amendment offered \nby my colleague from Washington. I want to make a couple comments.\n  It seems to me, on the question of what the priorities are around \nhere, what are the right choices, veterans health care has to rank \nright up at the top.\n  We had a hearing at one point. We had Secretary Rumsfeld come, and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. We asked a lot of questions about \nthis issue because I think everyone wants the same thing. We want to \nsay to young men and women who wear the uniform of this country: Please \nsupport this country's efforts. Go fight for freedom. Answer your \ncountry's call.\n  And when they do, and put themselves in harm's way--and most of us \nunderstand what ``harm's way'' means because we have been over to \nWalter Reed, we have been out to Bethesda Naval Hospital. We have seen \nthese young men and women with lost limbs, limbs that have been blown \noff, and all kinds of other wounds. We understand the sacrifice that is \nmade.\n  We asked the Secretary about the difference between someone who is a \nsoldier on active duty and someone who has come home to a hospital to \nbe treated for a lost leg or a lost limb or other devastating injuries \nand then is moved out of the service with a discharge--what is the \ndifference between the level of health care for an active-duty soldier \nat Walter Reed or Bethesda and a veteran in a veterans hospital \nsetting? Should there be a difference? No, there should not be. These \nare soldiers: active duty or retired, but soldiers.\n  I do not think there is a debate in this Senate about whether we \nadequately fund veterans health care. We all know the answer to that. \nThe answer is no, we are not adequately funding it.\n  So the question is, will this be a priority? Will the Congress, will \nthe Senate think this is as important as some other issues?\n  Someone once asked the question hypothetically: If you were asked to \nwrite an obituary for someone you had never met and the only \ninformation with which you could write that obituary was their check \nregister, what would it tell you about the person? You could take a \nlook and determine, what did that person spend money on? What did that \nperson determine to be valuable?\n  You could make the same case with respect to the Federal Government. \nTake a look at the checkbook and evaluate, what did we determine was \nimportant? What were our priorities? Where was veterans health care, \nbecause we know the esteem in which this country holds its veterans? We \nknow that starting with the poster that says ``Uncle Sam Wants You'' \npointed to the face of Americans for decades to say: Join the service, \nrepresent this country, support and fight for it, fight for freedom. We \nknow that call. But we also know a promise was made. The promise was, \nyou do this for your country and, when you come back, we will have a \nveterans health care system available for you.\n  Some say--not publicly--why have a veterans health care system? Why \nnot just have those folks go to a regular hospital? Especially after \nmajor wars, you don't ask that question because if you go to the \nveterans hospitals or Active-Duty hospitals that are treating these \nveterans, you will discover there is a kind of medical challenge that \nyou don't find often in other hospitals.\n  I visited a young man at Walter Reed a couple times. I had appointed \nhim to West Point. He is a proud member of the armed services. He went \nto Iraq. Because of an improvised explosive device, he lost his leg. He \ncame back, was in Walter Reed, and went through a long period when they \ndidn't know whether he was going to make it. He had a lot of infections \nand serious problems. He lost his leg right up to his hipbone.\n  Go visit those folks at the military hospitals or the veterans \nhospitals and understand these are different medical challenges than \nyou find every day at the hospitals in the inner cities or the \nhospitals in the suburbs. I am not saying other hospitals don't face \nchallenges. I am saying the wounds of war are deep, challenging. Go to \nthe orthopedic section out here and understand the difference. It is a \nbig difference.\n  I have told my colleagues about a Sunday morning at Fargo, ND. I will \ntell the story again because it is so important. It illustrates such an \nimportant point in support of my colleague.\n  A man served his country, left the Indian reservation when called \nduring the Second World War and served. His name was Edmund Young \nEagle--Native American, Standing Rock Reservation. He served in Africa, \nNormandy, Europe, served as his country asked him to, never complained \nabout it. At the end of the war, he came back to the Standing Rock \nIndian Reservation, lived, had a tough life, didn't have a family of \nhis own, loved to play baseball but had a tough life all of his life. \nToward the end of his life, he went to the Old Soldiers' Home in North \nDakota, and following that, he developed lung cancer.\n  His sister contacted my office and said: My brother has never had \nvery much, but he was always very proud of serving his country and \nnever received the medals he had earned for serving in Africa and \nEurope and Normandy during the Second World War. Could you help get his \nmedals?\n  So I did. I got the medals that this Native American had never \nreceived from his country for going all around the world and fighting \nfor America. By that time, Edmund Young Eagle was transferred to the VA \nHospital in Fargo with advanced lung cancer. In his late seventies, on \na Sunday morning, I went to his room at the VA Hospital with his \nmedals. His sister came. The doctors and nurses from the ward came and \ncrowded into Edmund's room. We cranked up his hospital bed to a seating \nposition, and I pinned on his pajama top the medals that Edmund Young \nEagle had earned fighting for his country in Africa, Normandy, and \nEurope.\n  This man, who would die 7 days later, said to me: This is one of the \nproudest days of my life.\n  He was a very sick man but enormously proud that his country had \nrecognized what he had done for America in the Second World War some 50 \nyears later.\n  The fact is, he and so many like him, particularly now, those Tom \nBrokaw called the ``greatest generation'' who went off to win the \nSecond World War, beat back the forces of nazism and Hitler, the fact \nis they are now at an age where they claim an increasing amount of \nhealth care in their late seventies, eighties, and nineties. There is a \nstrain on the VA medical health care system. Added to that, the Vietnam \nWar and the age of those veterans, the gulf war, now the war in Iraq, \nthis is a system that is straining at the seams.\n  My colleague offers an amendment. She has offered it before. I have \nsupported it previously on many occasions. It says: Let us, on an \nemergency basis, decide as a country that veterans health care is our \npriority. Let someone years from now look back at what we spent money \non and have some pride in knowing that we spent money on a priority \nthat was critically important, a priority that said to us: We will keep \nour word to veterans. We promised health care, if you served your \ncountry. Now we are going to deliver it.\n\n  It is not satisfactory to me and to many others in this Chamber to \ndecide that among a whole series of priorities, providing another tax \ncut is more important than providing health care or keeping a promise \nto veterans. That is not acceptable to me.\n  That is why I am happy to join. I mentioned a tax cut as one example. \nWe tried to offer an amendment to the emergency supplementals that \npreviously went through this Congress. We just had an $81 billion \nsupplemental, none of it paid for. We have now a $45 billion emergency \nsupplemental passed by the House that is coming this direction. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma made the point that we have increased spending. \nWe sure have increased spending. No question about that. Take a look at \nwhat has increased with respect to defense spending and homeland \nsecurity spending post-9/11. I have not opposed that spending. I happen \nto think we need to replenish Army accounts when you send troops to \nIraq. I happen to think we need more security at our ports and other \nplaces. But it seems to me logical that progressives, conservatives, \nmoderates, everything in between at some point ought to decide to get \ntogether and say: If we are\n\n[[Page S7491]]\n\ngoing to spend this money, we ought to pay for it. Instead of doing \nthat, we have done emergency supplementals.\n  My colleague from Washington is saying, if you are going to do \nemergency supplementals for everything, how about doing it for the \nfirst and most important thing, and that is keeping our promise to \nAmerica's veterans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I wanted to ask if the Senator was aware that when our \namendment was offered on the supplemental, Senators on this floor were \ntold by the VA that they didn't need the funding. And last Thursday, \nthe VA announced that they were indeed well over $1 billion short for \nthis fiscal year alone for VA funding. That is why I needed to offer \nthis amendment on this bill, and hopefully the Senate will pass it. I \nhope it will pass unanimously tomorrow. Is the Senator from North \nDakota aware that is the situation we are now in?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Was there a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I was asking if the Senator from North Dakota was aware \nthat during the consideration of the emergency supplemental, when we \noffered our amendment, we were told by the administration they didn't \nneed the funding. And then last Thursday they announced that they were, \nindeed, as we had warned, well over $1 billion short. That is why we \nare offering this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say, that is why I support the amendment. It is a \nquestion of priorities. I know everyone has their own view of what \npriorities might be. One of the top priorities ought to be keeping your \npromise to America's veterans. I appreciate the amendment being \noffered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin be added to the Byrd-\nCochran amendment No. 1053 as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it is about time we got down to business \nthis afternoon and start taking care of some of these amendments. We \nwould like to dispose of this bill at least by tomorrow.\n  I call up the Coburn amendment No. 1002 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask for the regular order?\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. COBURN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is it not the offeror of the amendment who places in \norder the amendments that are called up and lays the other amendments \naside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Any Senator can ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1015, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1015 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment 1019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized in support of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we just heard a good observation about the \nincrease in spending, but it is important for the American people to \nunderstand, we did ramp up homeland security. We did ramp up defense. \nLet me read the increases in spending that have occurred in other areas \nsince 2001: legislative branch, 40 percent; judiciary, 40 percent; \nAgriculture, 25.7 percent; Defense, 55 percent; Education, 109 percent; \nEnergy, 48 percent; Health and Human Services, 53.1 percent; Homeland \nSecurity, 153 percent; Housing and Urban Development, 38.2 percent; \nJustice, 22.7 percent; Labor, Health, and Human Services, 57 percent; \nDepartment of State, 74 percent; Transportation, 40 percent; Veterans \nAffairs, 44.5 percent; General Services Administration, 404 percent; \nNational Science Foundation, 61 percent. The average has been almost 39 \npercent in the last 4 years. Outside of homeland security and defense, \nthe increase in spending by the Congress has been almost 30 percent.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate to talk about the spending \nproblems. I also want the American people to understand what is \nhappening to us presently. This chart represents the on-budget Federal \ndeficit. It is not the games that we play in Washington. This is the \ntrue amount of money we are going to spend that we don't have, that we \nare actually going to borrow money to pay for. As you can see, this \nyear it is going to be $544 billion. That is $544 billion that we are \ngoing to ask our children and grandchildren to pay back. There is no \nquestion that we have some belt-tightening to do. There is no question \nthat the authors of this appropriations bill have done some of that in \nthe bill.\n  The amendment I wish to focus on presently is an amendment that \nreduces funding for land acquisition within the bill by $121.2 million, \nfrom $154 million, for a total of $32.8 million.\n  The reasoning behind this amendment is, there is $92 million in \nreserve accounts right now to buy land that had not been spent this \nyear. The committee put forward another $154 million. Buying land to \npreserve our scenic heritage, natural wildlife areas, is a good goal. \nThe problem is, do we need to do it now when we are in a time of war, \nwhen we are borrowing from our children's future to be able to \naccomplish that? Is now the time to spend money on it? If not, is there \nanother need? Is there a priority on which we should be spending?\n  I would say that we need to have another priority. The current bill \nprovides funding for land acquisition through four separate programs: \n$12.3 million for the Bureau of Land Management, $40.8 million for the \nFish and Wildlife Service, $56 million for the National Park Service, \nand $44.9 million for the Forest Service. Within the amendment, land \nacquisition funding for both the Bureau of Land Management and the \nForest Service is eliminated, while funding for both Fish and Wildlife \nService and National Park Service is reduced by $32 million.\n  According to OMB and staff estimates, the estimated amount of \nunobligated balances for Federal land acquisition at the end of the \ncurrent fiscal year will be $92 million. OMB estimates that BLM will \nhave $28 million in unobligated balances. In contrast, the bill \nprovides an additional $12.3 million for BLM. U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, which is set to receive almost $41 million, will have an \nestimated $32 million in unobligated balances at the end of this year, \naccording to OMB.\n  Of the $121.2 million savings produced, $60 million in this amendment \nis transferred to a special diabetes program for Indians, and $61.2 \nmillion is transferred to the Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program. Both \nprograms are with the Indian Health Service. Why is that important? \nThere are some important things about diabetes with Native Americans \nthat need to be recognized.\n  The question is, Do we spend money on land or do we spend money to \nimprove the people's lives that need us the most? We have a real crisis \nin health care in Indian Country.\n  The causes are many, but one controllable factor is the delivery of \nfederally funded health care services. Quality of care is severely \nimpacted by poor oversight, lack of competitive forces, and the serious \nlack of funding prioritization. My amendment addresses the latter. \nThere are 107,000 Native Americans that suffer from diabetes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:45 \nhaving arrived, the majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n   Tribute to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Longest Serving Kentucky \n                           Republican Senator\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a leader in \nthe Senate, a true partner in guiding the 109th Congress and my friend. \nToday, we mark a momentous occasion for the senior Senator from \nKentucky, Mitch McConnell.\n  With the opening of Monday's session, Senator McConnell surpassed the \nesteemed John Sherman Cooper as the longest serving Republican Senator \nin\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\nthe history of his State. Sworn in on January 3, 1985, Senator \nMcConnell has now served for over 20 years. For the last 2\\1/2\\ of \nthese, I have worked side by side with Mitch in our capacities as \nleader and whip. I could not have asked for a steadier partner in \nguiding this Senate to accomplishment. Leading over 4 dozen strong-\nwilled, independent Senators is not always easy. One of the things I \nlike to say about the leader's job is that it is something similar to \nbeing the groundskeeper at a cemetery: You have a lot of people under \nyou, but no one ever listens.\n  But more than anyone, Mitch is able to impress upon his colleagues \nthe importance of working together to move America forward. Mitch and I \nwork side by side not only as leader and whip, but also as Senators \nfrom the great States of Kentucky and Tennessee. Committed to the Union \nonly 4 years apart, our States share the common interests of \nagriculture and commerce, a common culture of southern ingenuity, and \nhospitality, and a border over 320 miles long.\n  I have worked with Mitch on regional matters important to our States \nsince I first entered this body in 1995. He is a fierce advocate for \nthe people of his State, and I have watched him with admiration. \nKentucky and Tennessee have a history of friendly partnership, and I am \nproud that Mitch and I work in that same spirit in the Senate.\n  Mitch and I have also both had the honor of being elected by members \nof our conference to chair the National Republican Senatorial \nCommittee, the organization in this body charged with maintaining and \nbuilding a Republican majority. Mitch chaired it from 1997 until 2001, \nand then he handed it off to me, from 2001 to 2003. Mr. President, \nthere was never a smoother transition from one NRSC chair to the next \nthan when Mitch turned over the keys to me in early 2001. Under his \nleadership, Republicans maintained control of the Chamber for over 2 \nelection cycles under very extreme circumstances. When he passed the \nchairmanship to me, the NRSC was debt free, something almost unheard \nof, and in better shape than he found it. His legislative \naccomplishments are just as impressive.\n  Through his chairmanship of the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Mitch has shaped America's policy on promoting freedom \nabroad so strongly that he has become literally a hero in oppressed \nlands throughout the world. He believes in using American might to \nsupport democracy and civil institutions in nations that know neither.\n  He is not afraid to call the tyrants by their names. In Burma, an \nillegitimate junta has held Nobel laureate and democracy advocate, Daw \nAung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest for the last 15 years. And 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, she succeeded in sending a letter to Senator McConnell \nthrough a very, very circuitous route. Let me say that it didn't just \narrive in his mailbox. She told him, in her words:\n\n       You have been such a stalwart supporter of democracy. We \n     have come to look upon you as a rock-like friend.\n\n  Whenever Mitch gives a friend or a cause his support, you can count \non him. Mitch has led the fight every year to impose import sanctions \non Burma, to force its tyrannical government to free Suu Kyi and stop \njailing and harassing the country's freedom fighters. His record on \nfreedom, protecting our national security, and promoting democracy \nabroad has been crystal clear and consistent since his first days in \nthe Senate.\n  One of his earliest votes upon entering the Senate was in favor of \nsanctions against the apartheid regime then in South Africa. Through \nthe appropriations process, he provided authority and funds to conduct \ndemocracy-building programs in Syria, Iran, and China. He has always \nbeen a staunch supporter of Israel which, along with Iraq, is one of \nthe few models of democracy and liberty in a region plagued by tyranny \nand intolerance.\n  Mitch was the author of language that forced Russia to withdraw its \ntroops from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in \n1994. Throughout decades under Soviet rule, those three countries never \nformally surrendered, and they maintained their embassies here in \nWashington, DC. Thanks to Mitch McConnell, the home soil of Baltic \nstates became just as free as those embassy grounds a little sooner \nthan otherwise.\n  Mitch is a solid rock when it comes to supporting freedom here at \nhome as well as abroad. Take his fight in defense of free speech and \nagainst the changes to our system of financing political campaigns \nknown as ``campaign finance reform,'' that was one fight he ultimately \nlost. But even in losing, he won the hearts of his comrades as we \nwatched him doggedly champion what he believed in--the first amendment \nand the right of every American citizen to have a free, unfettered \nvoice in our democracy.\n  His good friend, Phil Gramm, our former Senate colleague from Texas, \nsaid on this floor:\n\n       I don't know whether they will ever build a monument to the \n     Senator from Kentucky, but he is already memorialized in my \n     heart.\n\n  Senator Gramm, you are not the only one.\n  Mitch made his case with passion all the way up to the highest court. \nAnd when he lost there, he very graciously was the first to reach out \nand congratulate his long-time opponents and began healing the divide.\n  Mr. President, when I look at the impressive career of Senator \nMcConnell, studded throughout with so many successes--and, yes, a very \nfew defeats, but always refueled again and again by his relentless \nenergy--I have sometimes wondered, where does that drive come from?\n  Perhaps the answer lies 60 years in the past. Mitch's dad, A.M. \nMcConnell, was fighting overseas in World War II. While he was away, 2-\nyear-old Mitch contracted the dreaded disease polio. In 1944, before \nDr. Jonas Salk invented his vaccine, polio very likely meant paralysis, \nsickness or death.\n  Mitch's mother, Dean, took her son to Warm Springs, GA, the polio \ntreatment center that President Roosevelt established. Learning from \nthe therapists there, she put him through a strenuous, tough regimen of \nphysical therapy to save the use of his left leg. She made her son \nexercise his leg three times a day, and it was drilled into his head \nthat to protect his leg, he had to refrain from walking on it. That \nhardly sounds like an easy reality for a typical 2-year-old. But she \nwas successful. To this day, Mitch credits his mother with teaching him \ndetermination and tenacity.\n  Today, the world is virtually free of polio, with only about a \nthousand cases diagnosed every year. Most of those are in the \ndeveloping nations. Through his subcommittee chairmanship, Mitch has \nappropriated over $160 million in the last 6 years toward wiping out \nthe deadly virus. Those funds go to the U.N., The World Health \nOrganization, and other agencies that take Dr. Salk's lifesaving \nvaccine into the world's poorest countries and deliver it to people who \nneed it, bringing us closer and closer to eliminating polio once and \nfor all.\n  No Kentucky history book would be complete without portraits of Henry \nClay and Alben Barkley. Henry Clay dominated his State and this Senate \nin the 19th century and Barkley in the 20th. Well, I submit that Mitch \nwill be viewed in the same light for the 21st century. Why? Because \neven with all of the accomplishments he has behind him, I predict that \nhis greatest contributions are still ahead with his wife and life \npartner, who is a leader in her own right, Elaine Chao, at his side.\n  Like Clay and Barkley, Mitch speaks with a voice of principle. He is \na rocklike friend to his fellow Senators, to this institution, to his \nState, to his country, and to defenders of freedom the world over.\n  I join my fellow Senators in congratulating my friend, the majority \nwhip, on reaching this milestone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Bunning, is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague \nfrom Kentucky, the senior Senator, Mitch McConnell.\n  Today is somewhat of a historic occasion for my friend, this Senate, \nand the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  As of yesterday, our colleague, Mitch McConnell, became the longest \nserving Republican Senator in Kentucky history. He surpassed the \nservice of the legendary Senator from Somerset, John Sherman Cooper.\n  For over 20 years now--7,481 days, to be exact--Mitch has honorably \nserved Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\n  In all that time, Kentuckians have been getting solid leadership and \nrepresentation here in the Senate. Mitch is an effective and devoted \nlegislator working hard on behalf of the bluegrass State. I could not \nhave had a better partner in my fight for Kentucky.\n  Some of my friends may not know what kind of role Mitch has played in \nKentucky's political scene. He has helped lead the fight to build the \nthriving, vigorous, two-party political system that Kentucky enjoys \ntoday.\n  Mitch McConnell helped set the growth of Louisville--home of the \nKentucky Derby--in motion over 20 years ago when he served as judge-\nexecutive of Jefferson County. Many of the initiatives he launched then \nto expand the city's economic growth and prestige have since borne \nfruit many times over.\n  In 1984, Judge McConnell made history with his election to the \nSenate. He was the only Republican to defeat an incumbent Democratic \nSenator anywhere in the country. He was the first Republican to be \nelected statewide in Kentucky since 1968.\n  For a lot of people, that would have been enough. But not for Mitch. \nThanks to him, 1984 was not just one election for one man. It was the \nbeginning of an emerging and competitive two-party system in Kentucky.\n  Once upon a time, most Kentucky Republican organizations could hold \ntheir meetings in phone booths. I remember those days vividly and \nsomewhat fondly because in the early 1980s, I was just one of nine \nRepublicans in the Kentucky State Senate.\n  I bet that sounds good to some of my friends on the other side of the \naisle, but in all seriousness, one-party rule is not good for anyone, \nincluding the party in power. If parties do not have to compete to sell \ntheir ideas, they stop coming up with new ideas and they get lazy. The \npeople they serve are left without a voice because the people in power \nhave no incentive to listen. I believe that to be true no matter which \nparty is in power.\n  In the eighties, Senator McConnell saw us all laboring under one-\nparty rule and decided to do something about it. He helped recruit \ncandidates to run, and he never shied away from explaining the \nRepublican message every where he went. And he did it all with his \ntrademark-focused determination.\n  Many of my colleagues know that once Mitch sets his sights on \nsomething, no one will outwork or outthink him in pursuit of his goal.\n  I am a witness to this. I first ran for the Congress in 1986, and I \nwon. At that point, and in getting to know Mitch much better, it was \nalready clear that Mitch had goals for Kentucky's Republican Party.\n  After helping to lay the groundwork for many years, these goals began \nto pay off. In 1994, we saw two Republicans--Ron Lewis and Ed \nWhitfield--win seats in the U.S. House of Representatives that had been \nheld by Democrats for years. In 1996, Congresswoman Anne Northup won \nanother seat in Louisville held by a Democrat. Congressman Ernie \nFletcher joined them in 1998, and Congressman Geoff Davis, last year, \nwon back my old fourth district House seat. Today, Kentucky sends a \nlargely Republican delegation to Congress, and my colleague worked hard \nto help make that happen.\n  When I decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 1998, and when I ran for \nreelection in 2004, Mitch was there for me. His help was phenomenal and \nsaid so much about our friendship.\n  Mitch also helped influence Kentucky's State government. For decades, \none party had a lock on the statehouse and the Governor's mansion, but \nthat is not true today. Republicans gained control of the Kentucky \nSenate in 1999, and in 2003, they captured the Governor's mansion. I \nknow Mitch was involved in these races to help build a viable two-party \nsystem in Kentucky.\n  Mitch has been a great friend in the Senate. In fact, he is my best \nfriend in this body. But he has also been a great friend to the good \nfolks of our Commonwealth over the last 20 years.\n  Last year, Mitch and I worked hard in the Senate on the passage of a \ntobacco buyout for our Kentucky tobacco farmers. This is one of the \nmost significant events in the agricultural history of Kentucky. That \ntobacco buyout literally saved the livelihood of tens of thousands of \nKentucky tobacco farmers, their families, and the communities in which \nthey live. That old quota system that dictated to the farmers how much \ntobacco they could sell was broken. My office and Senator McConnell \nreceived thousands of letters and phone calls from Kentuckians pleading \nfor help. We answered their pleas and, Mitch, our Senate majority whip, \nhad a major role in pushing this ball over the goal line.\n  Throughout my service in the Senate, I could not have asked for a \nbetter comrade in arms than Mitch McConnell. Mitch, is a fighter. When \nhe is on your side, you feel unstoppable. When he is not, you know you \nhave an uphill battle to fight. But he is always fighting for what he \nbelieves in and what is right. Kentucky is lucky to have him, and so is \nthis Senate.\n  Mitch, I appreciate you, and I am proud to call you my best friend in \nthe Senate. Congratulations on your milestone. You have my vote for \nKentucky's political hall of fame.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Under the previous order, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I extend my thanks to the \nmajority leader for his exceptionally generous remarks about my service \nhere, and I also want to take this opportunity to thank him for the \nextraordinary leadership he has provided over the last 2\\1/2\\ years. It \nhas been a great pleasure working with the Senator from Tennessee \nalmost every day as I try to assist him in conducting a chorus on our \nside that is occasionally slightly off key but, generally speaking, \nsinging the same tune.\n  To my good friend and colleague from Kentucky, we share the same \nconstituency. We have similar views on how America ought to be led. It \nhas been a distinct pleasure, I say to my friend from Kentucky, to be \nassociated with him, to enjoy his own electoral success, which has been \nquite extraordinary given the rather limited number of Republicans who \nhave been elected to the Senate from our State. I thank him for his \nincredible, generous remarks.\n  Mr. President, I stand here today with a bit of disbelief. Forty-one \nyears ago, as a young man long on desire but short on achievement and \ncertainly devoid of connections, I met the man I considered to be one \nof the greatest Senators in Kentucky's history and certainly the \ngreatest in my adult lifetime, John Sherman Cooper. I was 22 years old, \nhad just graduated from the University of Louisville, and was intent--\nabsolutely intent--on getting a Senate internship as the first step up \nwhat I hoped would be the ladder to a life of accomplishment.\n  Senator Cooper reached out and lifted me up to that first rung. He \ntook me on as an intern in his office, and this was at a time when many \nSenators did not have internship programs at all. He gave me a chance \nto do that. I had the pleasure of being the only intern in the office \nand to stay for the entire summer--June, July, and August. So he became \nmy boss, and he also became my mentor, and he became my friend. In \nfact, he was the first great man I ever met.\n  Now I stand in the same Senate Chamber as Senator Cooper, the longest \nserving Republican Senator in Kentucky's history, until yesterday. I am \nfilled with gratitude for his helping hand, gratitude for Senator \nCooper, and for a country where there are no limits to one's success.\n  Senator Cooper served for 7,479 days. My fellow Kentuckians elected \nhim to this body five times. But Senator Cooper had a most unusual \nrecord of service. It was not unbroken, nor was he elected to a full 6-\nyear term until his fifth race for the Senate. In fact, to serve his \nnearly 21 years he stood for election seven times. He won five and he \nlost two. He also lost a race for Governor before World War II. But he \nwas never afraid to put himself before the people of Kentucky and be \njudged. He knew who he was and he knew where he stood. To borrow a \nphrase, he had the courage of his convictions.\n  To most Kentuckians, Senator Cooper was our emissary to places of \npower. I viewed him with simpler eyes. He was my hero. I learned more \nfrom him than from anyone else I have encountered in all of my years in \npublic life. He taught me how to be a Senator. And he taught everyone \nwho knew him\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\nthe value of integrity, forthrightness, and moral character.\n  Senator Cooper stood fast for what he believed was right, no matter \nhow large the opposition and no matter what the cost, even if that cost \nmight mean his seat in this Chamber. When President Andrew Jackson \nsaid, ``One man with courage makes a majority,'' he was talking about \nJohn Sherman Cooper.\n  I saw that firsthand during my summer here in Washington in 1964. \nThat was the summer of my internship in the Senator's office. It was \nalso the summer of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and we all remember \nwhat a dramatic struggle that bill was.\n  Until that point, the Senate had been, for the most part, a graveyard \nfor civil rights bills since reconstruction, courtesy of the \nfilibuster. But as my generation was keen to say at the time, things \nwere a-changing.\n  By mid-June of 1964, the Civil Rights Act had been debated in the \nSenate for 57 days. One Senator filibustered against it by speaking on \nthe floor for over 14 hours. But not John Sherman Cooper.\n  Senator Cooper had advanced equality for every American citizen for \nhis entire public life. In the 1930s, as county judge of Pulaski County \nin south central Kentucky, he felt moved to help his African-American \nconstituents who were hit hard by the Great Depression just as much as \nhis White ones who were equally devastated. He was known to take money \nout of his own pocket to buy a meal for a starving family of any color. \nIn the 1940s, he was one of the first Kentucky circuit court judges to \nseat Blacks on juries.\n  In 1963, he tried to pass a bill barring discrimination in public \naccommodations. It was filibustered, just like all the others. He was \ndetermined that the 1964 Civil Rights Act would not meet the same fate.\n  Senator Cooper's office was besieged with mail from thousands who \nopposed the bill. Some just were not ready for this measure, although I \nam proud to say that things have come a long way since then.\n  Despite the considerable opposition back home, Senator Cooper never \nwavered. Steadfastly and with clear vision, he worked to get the votes \nto break the filibuster.\n  I must admit, seeing him stand his ground was a bit exciting for a \nyoung man. But I wondered how he could hold fast against such forceful \nopposition. So perhaps crossing the line of decorum between Senator and \nstaff that existed in those days, I asked him one day: How do you take \nsuch a tough stand and square it with the fact that a considerable \nnumber of people who have chosen you have the opposite view? His answer \nis one I will always remember.\n  He said, ``I not only represent Kentucky, I represent the Nation, and \nthere are times you follow, and times when you lead.''\n  From that one simple statement, I learned first-hand what I had never \nlearned in school. Senator Cooper followed the Jeffersonian model of \nrepresentative democracy: Put succinctly, the people elect you to \nexercise your best judgment.\n  He did not think a leader was someone who wet his finger and stuck it \nin the air to see where popular winds blew. He believed that even if \nvoters don't agree with every position a leader might take, they would \nsee that leader trying to do the right thing, they would respect that, \nand they would support him, or disagree with him and vote him out.\n  Senator Cooper believed that a leader should stand up for what he \nthought was right, regardless of the opposition, or the cost.\n  I think he stuck to this principle so firmly because he learned it \nthe hard way. As I said, his career was filled with many peaks, but \nalso a few valleys.\n  In 1939, he made his first bid for statewide office with a run for \nGovernor, but did not even win the primary. He won his first statewide \nrace in 1946, in a special election to fill a partial term in the U.S. \nSenate. But when he ran to hold the seat in 1948, the same electoral \nwave that propelled President Truman to a surprise second term, \nproducing that famous ``Dewey Defeats Truman'' headline, also swept \nSenator Cooper and many other Republicans out.\n  It probably did not help that Kentucky's other Senator, Alben \nBarkley, the majority leader and a beloved Kentucky figure, was \nTruman's running mate.\n  Senator Cooper won his seat back in 1952, again for a partial term, \nwhen Gen. Dwight David Eisenhower sat atop the ticket. But he lost the \nseat in 1954, when he ran against the one Kentucky politician more \npopular than he, Alben Barkley, now a former Vice President running to \nreturn to the Senate.\n  He came back in 1956 to win his old Senate seat, and this time he \nheld it until retirement in 1973. So he had three partial terms before \never being elected to a full term.\n  In 1966, his last election, he set a record for the largest margin of \nvictory for a Republican in Kentucky history, a record that held for \nnearly 40 years until one of his former interns broke it in 2002.\n  Senator Cooper's peers on both sides of the aisle respected his \nwisdom and gravitas. But he was defeated by Senator Everett Dirksen for \nRepublican leader in 1959, by a vote of 20 to 14--not exactly a \ncliffhanger as leadership races go.\n  Senator Cooper knew the bitterness of loss as well as the sweetness \nof victory. It is a sign of the respect he commanded, from both \nparties, that after every loss a new door opened, often as an important \ndiplomatic assignment on behalf of the President of the United States.\n  After his defeat in 1948, President Truman asked him to serve as a \ndelegate to the newly formed United Nations, alongside Eleanor \nRoosevelt. After his 1954 loss, President Eisenhower appointed him \nAmbassador to India, a crucial post, as this newly independent country \nwas weighing whether to align with the free world or the Soviet bloc.\n  After his retirement from the Senate, President Ford called him back \ninto public service to be America's first ambassador to East Germany. \nWith all this diplomatic experience, I think Senator Cooper brought a \nperspective to foreign-policy issues that the Senate may have otherwise \nlacked.\n  As Senator Cooper's intern, I also had the pleasure of meeting his \ncharming wife, Lorraine. Their marriage was proof of the old adage that \nopposites attract. Where he was soft-spoken, unpretentious, and humble, \nshe was vivacious, full of good humor, and very much a member of high \nsociety. She threw many Washington parties, and in fact even though it \nwas not a Washington party, I think I had my first glass of champagne \ncourtesy of Lorraine Cooper.\n  Lorraine was not a native Kentuckian, and few would have mistaken her \nfor one. When Senator Cooper ran in 1956, some of his aides recommended \nhe campaign without her. He would hear none of it. Lorraine marched \nthrough every small, rural Kentucky town in her pinwheel hat and \nbrocade dress, carrying a silk parasol and an emerald-studded cigarette \nholder, and they loved her.\n  At a diner in Berea, in central Kentucky, a woman admonished Lorraine \nfor smoking at the lunch counter. ``Listen,'' Lorraine replied. ``I'm \nsupporting the state's most valuable crop.''\n  The first Tennessean who was majority leader of the Senate, Howard \nBaker, likes to tell the story about Lorraine Cooper. Right after he \nwas chosen Republican leader, the phone rang and it was Lorraine Cooper \non the phone. She said: Howard, do you have time to see me?\n  He said: Well, of course.\n  So Lorraine Cooper got an appointment, came up to the Senate, walked \ninto his office and sat down and she looked at him. She said: Now, \nHoward, do you have any money?\n  Senator Baker said: Yes.\n  She said: You need new clothes.\n  Then she got up and walked out.\n  Senator Cooper was a confidante to Presidents. He and Lorraine were \nthe first dinner guests of John F. Kennedy after the latter's election \nto the Presidency in 1960. I know my good friend, Senator Kennedy of \nMassachusetts, has said that his brother the President thought very \nhighly of Senator Cooper, as did he.\n  Senator Kennedy once said that Senator Cooper ``always brought light \nto the problem, rather than heat.'' What a wonderful description of \nthis kind, thoughtful, wise and honorable man.\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\n  Let me add to Senator Kennedy's description that Senator Cooper \nshowed the same compassion and courtesy to the Kentucky farmer, to the \nCapitol Hill intern, or to the destitute of the Third World, as to the \npowerful and the mighty.\n  I know this from personal experience. One day in August 1965, I \nreturned to Senator Cooper's office after completing my internship one \nyear before. I was then a law student, having finished my first year at \nthe University of Kentucky College of Law.\n  I was waiting to see Senator Cooper when suddenly he appeared and \nmotioned for me to follow him. We walked together from his office in \nRussell 125 to the Capitol Rotunda, where I saw more people, and more \nsecurity, than I had ever seen before. Then Senator Cooper told me what \nwas happening: President Johnson was about to sign the Voting Rights \nAct that Senator Cooper had worked so hard and courageously to pass in \n1965.\n  Sure enough, the President of the United States emerged. Every good \nbiography of President Johnson describes him as a larger-than-life man, \nwith an imposing physical presence. Let me testify right now that they \nare correct. President Johnson seemed to tower a head taller than \nanyone else in the room. He had a huge head, massive hands, and a \ncommanding figure that immediately filled the Rotunda.\n  I was overwhelmed to witness such a moment in history, and moved that \nmy hero, at the spur of the moment, had brought me to witness it.\n  I stayed close to Senator Cooper for the rest of his life. When I \nfirst won election to this body, Senator Cooper was retired and living \nin town. He invited me to stay at his home when I came to town to be \nsworn in. He would regularly come to my office to visit.\n  Harry Truman once said, ``If you want a friend in Washington, get a \ndog.'' It doesn't sound like he had a very pleasant introduction to \nWashington. Mine could not have been more different. Senator Cooper \ngave me, as a new Senator, the gift of his 20-plus years of experience. \nWe remained close, even as his health began to falter near the end of \nmy first term.\n  John Sherman Cooper died in 1991 at 89 years old. Kentucky lost a \nleader, and the Senate lost a valued friend. Somewhere in a small town \nin Kentucky, a young boy or girl eager to enter public service lost a \nhero. I lost all three.\n  If not for John Sherman Cooper, I would not be here today. If not for \nhim, all of the lives he touched--the farmer and the businessman, the \nindigent and the rich, the white and the black, the powerful and the \nleast among us--would have a little less justice, and slightly narrower \nhorizons.\n  I stand here 2 days past the 7,479 days that grand gentleman graced \nthis floor. To a kid whose dreams and ambitions greatly outstripped his \nmeans of ascent, I cannot begin to describe how that feels. It's \nhumbling, and bittersweet. He looms in my memory. But I think of him \ntoday just as I first did on that bright day in 1964, a giant among men \nand a role model for life.\n  Thank you, Senator Cooper. You gave me more than I can ever repay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I do not know how one signs on to all of \nwhat was just stated by my friend from Kentucky. I can also compliment \nhim in a couple of areas and say that I would not be here had it not \nbeen for him. I do not know if I should mourn or celebrate that.\n  Nonetheless, if anyone ever visits Kentucky and takes in the \ntraditions of Kentucky, they will find out the former Senator was a \npart of that landscape and the present-day Senator is the same way. So \ncongratulations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield the floor back to the Senator from Oklahoma on his \namendment where we were interrupted, amendment 1019, which is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. We were in the midst of talking about whether we buy land \nor take care of diabetes with native Americans. That is what this \namendment does. It is obvious we are not going to be able to trim the \nspending in this bill, but it certainly is not obvious that we cannot \nreprioritize.\n  Let me give some facts and figures on Native American diabetes \ncompared with diabetes in every other group in this country. The \nnational U.S. population rate for diabetes is 6.3 percent. For Native \nAmericans between 45 and 74 years of age, it is 45 percent, 7 times the \nnational average. The most extensively studied, the Pima Indians, an \nestimated 50 percent of that population suffers from type II diabetes.\n  Native Americans who have diabetes suffer from increased rates of \nkidney failure, amputations, blindness, heart disease, and stroke. End \nstage renal disease in Native Americans with diabetes is six times \nhigher than any other group in this country. Diabetic retinopathy, \ni.e., blindness from diabetes, occurs in 24 percent of Native Americans \nwho have diabetes. Only 2 to 4 percent of the diabetes in the Native \nAmericans is type I; 98 percent of it is type II diabetes.\n  Alcohol and substance abuse is where the other half of this money \ngoes. Nineteen percent of Native American youth age 12 to 17 are \nconsuming alcohol at an alarming rate, headed for addiction; 12.8 \npercent of the young 12 to 17-year-olds engage in binge drinking. That \nis five or more drinks, weekly. HHS estimates that 7.6 percent of \nNative Americans over the age of 26 are classified as heavy alcohol \nusers. American Indians are five times more likely to die of alcohol-\nrelated causes than other groups and they face significant increases in \ncarcinoma of the liver and chronic diseases such as psoriasis.\n  Mortality rates from alcohol and substance abuse are seven times \nhigher in Native American populations than in the general population.\n  This amendment does not cut funding. It simply moves money from land \nto people, moves money from the purposes of why we are here to care for \nthose who cannot care for themselves. I would say in Oklahoma, it is \nvery evident to see the underfunding for the Indian Health Service, the \nnumber of true full-blooded Native Americans who cannot receive care \nthat was promised under treaty to get the care they need for their \ndiabetes, for alcohol abuse, and other substance abuse.\n  This is a simple amendment. I understand a budget point of order is \ngoing to be raised against it because it spends money faster than the \nland acquisitions do. I plan on moving to waive that point of order, \nbut I would say to my friends on the committee, and I would say to the \npeople of America, should we be buying more land when we cannot afford \nit? And if we are going to spend the money anyway, should we not be \nspending that on something that is going to increase the quality of \nlife and increase the health care of those who are least fortunate in \nour society?\n  I would also ask, having looked at this and then refer to the \nincreased spending since 2001, how many Americans have received a 39-\npercent pay increase since 2001? That is how much Federal Government \nspending, discretionary spending--that is not Medicare, that is not \nSocial Security, that is not Medicaid, but discretionary spending--has \nrisen. It is time for us to tighten our belt. This is one way to move \nthe priorities back to where they should be in terms of caring for real \npeople, not land.\n\n  The other point that I would make is when we buy land it costs us \ntwice. No. 1, it takes it off the tax rolls which decreases the amount \nof income coming to the States, local communities, and municipalities. \nBut No. 2, it markedly increases costs to care for that land. With $92 \nmillion unspent from last year, we are going to spend another $40 \nmillion to $50 million to maintain that land and close the purchase.\n  With that, I yield to the chairman of the subcommittee and thank him \nfor the time to allow me to present my case.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. The argument is made \nthere are very few of us here who do not look for extra funds to put \ninto IHS, and especially in the diabetes program. We know that is \nimportant.\n  This year, the committee has included an additional $135 million to \nsupport Indian health services. This is the largest increase in many \nyears targeted specifically at providing greater support for hospital \nand clinical services, dentistry, nursing, diabetes, and\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nother important health services. Funds for population growth and \nmedical inflation have been included for the first time in probably a \ndecade or more.\n  This increase comes at a time when most other agency budgets in the \nbill are not growing--in fact, many are declining. For example, EPA is \nreduced $144 million below their current year level; the Forest Service \n$648 million below; and the National Park Service, $52 million below. I \npoint to these reductions both to underscore the commitment all of us \nshare to improving health care in Indian country, but also to \ndemonstrate that increases for any one agency come at the expense of \nothers.\n  My colleague's amendment proposes to add funds to the special \ndiabetes program. This program was initiated through the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 and reauthorized in December 2002 to provide $150 \nmillion annually for 5 years beginning in 2004. These are not \nappropriated dollars, it is a mandatory spending program for the \nprevention and treatment of diabetes within Indian communities. In \naddition to this program, the IRS itself spends over $100 million \nannually from within its appropriation to address diabetes treatment \nand prevention. There are also other programs funded outside this \nbill--the Centers for Disease Control comes to mind--that direct funds \nto Indian country for diabetes work. I mention these programs to \nhighlight the fact there are significant resources being dedicated to \ndiabetes work now with this committee's support and we are encouraged \nby the impact these funds are having in Indian communities.\n  Alcohol and substance abuse is another area where we are directing a \nsubstantial amount of funding into tackling this problem. This budget \nproposes a $6.3 million increase bringing the total for these efforts \nup to $145.3 million. Of this funding, 97 percent goes directly to \ntribally contracted or compacted programs. The committee has been an \nadvocate for this program and has worked to increase funding over the \nyears.\n  Funding levels for these two programs may not be in amounts that are \nideal, but they are significant. Other programs of importance to our \nMembers were proposed to take substantial reductions in the budget \nrequest, which we have struggled to restore. In the end, as I have said \nbefore, we have to strike a balance in this bill. I think the committee \nbill does a good job of hitting this balance and I urge Members to \nsupport the committee position.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is no question a significant amount of money is \nbeing spent on these two programs, but when you compare it to every \nother group in this country, what you see is about $1 compared to $3 \nfor everybody else in terms of diabetes. You cannot very well square \nthat when there is six times the rate of end-stage renal disease in \nNative Americans. That is an important point because if you can prevent \nend-stage renal disease, you save $50,000 per year per person in not \nhaving them on dialysis, as well as the fact it is a miserable life \nbeing on dialysis.\n  So the point is that there are increases. I will recognize that. I \nstill say how in the world can we justify buying land when we are \nstealing $541 billion from our grandchildren? And No. 2 is why not \npeople instead of land? That is a legitimate question, especially in an \nunderserved segment of our population that needs the dollars that will \nmake a tremendous difference. I would just ask the Senator, can't we \ncome to an agreement that a portion of this money should be moved to \nsolve this very tragic problem that affects and afflicts Native \nAmericans at a higher rate than any other group in this country?\n  Mr. BURNS. This bill has such a delicate balance that there could \nbe--and I will raise it--a budgetary point of order. That is what we \nhave to work with. The Senator from Oklahoma knows how to work with \nbudgets and how we work with appropriations. It proposes to add $121 \nmillion to the Indian Health Service for a special diabetes program and \nan alcohol substance abuse program. The offset would be derived from an \nequivalent reduction in land acquisition. This transfer of funds \nresults in a change of outlays that causes the bill to exceed its \noutlay allocation.\n  Now we might work on offsets in some other areas. As to the argument \nthat you would make about land acquisition, we have always had land \nacquisition, but we have also had land sales. I wish I could stand here \nand report to you that we had as many sales as we have had acquisitions \nbecause I, for one, support the idea that there should be no net gain \nof land by the Federal Government. I come from county government. I \nknow whenever the Government buys land, it takes it off the tax rolls. \nIt hurts me as a county commissioner to provide all the programs that I \nhave been asked to provide at the county level. In fact, we passed some \nlegislation at one time when I first came here, which I was part of, of \nno net gain--or no net loss--whichever way you want to define it.\n  The way this is structured does raise a point of order, and I will \nraise that point. The pending amendment offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma increases discretionary spending in excess of the 302(b) \nallocation to the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies of the \nCommittee on Appropriations. Therefore, I raise the point of order \nagainst the amendment according to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I \nplan, in a moment, to move to waive the point of order, but before I do \nthat I think every American ought to be asking the question this is \n$544 billion which we are going into the market and borrowing on budget \nthis year, $544 billion that our kids and our grandkids are going to \nhave to pay back at a minimum of 6 percent interest every year. So we \nare going to pay back about $2 trillion on this $544 billion. That is \ngoing to be about $70,000 apiece that we are going to wrangle their \nfuture with. And the question is, Should we be buying more land if we \nare going to put our kids in debt?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian advises that the point of \norder is not debatable.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. COBURN. I do. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive is debatable, and the \nSenator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. The question the American people have to ask themselves \nis, if we are going into hock and we are going to put this kind of lien \non our kids, should we be taking money off tax rolls? Should we be \nspending more money to maintain the land? Or if, in fact, we are going \nto do this, should we not see an outcome that reduces our cost by \nreducing insulin dependence type 2, by reducing dialysis? I believe the \nchoice is very clear, that we ought to be taking care of those who need \nus the most and not add land that is going to add cost. In fact we \nshould, invest in those people where we are going to decrease the cost \nof the Indian Health Service. With that, I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n       Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I had to be absent from the \n     Senate today, and I missed votes beginning with the motion to \n     waive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 1019, \n     offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn. I had to \n     miss the votes in order to travel to Charlotte, NC, to \n     participate in a Base Realignment and Closing, BRAC, \n     Commission Regional Hearing at Central Piedmont Community \n     College. I am not absent from the Senate on days when we have \n     votes without good reason.\n       This afternoon there was nowhere more important for me to \n     be than at the BRAC Regional Hearing, which is part of the \n     process whereby the fate of the 130th Air National Guard \n     Wing, based in Charleston, WV, will be decided. I believe it \n     is a crucial part of my duty as a United States Senator from \n     West Virginia to protect the 130th. While I respect the \n     difficult work done by members of the BRAC Commission, and \n     understand that their preliminary recommendations were made \n     in a good faith effort to improve the efficiency and efficacy \n     of our armed services. However, I believe that gutting the \n     130th is wrong and I must make every effort to oppose it.\n       The 130th plays an important role in our national security, \n     as well as the security of\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\n     the greater Washington area. It has also provided hundreds of \n     National Guard personnel who responded to the call of duty in \n     Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In addition to 340 full-time \n     Guard members, the 130th employs 201 federal technicians, and \n     more than 80 active guards. The State of West Virginia also \n     employs more than 50 State employees whose jobs depend on the \n     continued presence of the 130th. At a time when enlistments \n     and retention for both our National Guard units and regular \n     Army are suffering, the 130th had 96 percent reenlistment, \n     fifth in the nation. Every single job in West Virginia is \n     sacred to me, and as these jobs also protect my home State \n     and are a vital part of our military family and national \n     security, I believe very strongly that they should not be \n     cut.\n       With regard to the amendment by Senator Coburn, I believe \n     he made very persuasive arguments about problems in Indian \n     Country of diabetes and drug and alcohol addiction. When you \n     consider that Native Americans from the ages of 45-74 have a \n     rate of diabetes roughly seven times the rate for all \n     Americans, and that drug and alcohol addiction is rampant, I \n     believe most of our colleagues would feel that all that can \n     be done to help the Indian Health Service--IHS--combat these \n     plagues should be done.\n       However, we are in a time of severe fiscal constraints, and \n     I commend the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for \n     successfully completing the difficult task of meeting so many \n     priorities as best they could. The underlying bill contains \n     about $100 million in appropriated funds for diabetes \n     programs under the IHS, and there are more than $150 million \n     available in mandatory spending in other programs targeted at \n     the same problem. Similarly, the bill funds alcohol and drug \n     abuse programs at $145.3 million. Senator Coburn would have \n     shifted additional funding to those important causes by \n     transferring funds to be appropriated for land acquisition. \n     The bill contains only about $154 million for Federal land \n     acquisition. While IHS diabetes and drug treatment programs \n     surely could have benefited from an extra infusion of cash, \n     it was also important to fund the land acquisition program at \n     a reasonable level.\n       I will support efforts to adequately fund all programs of \n     the Indian Health Service, and while I would have opposed the \n     Coburn amendment, I commend him for his obvious and careful \n     attention to this matter.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment \nbe set aside. I believe the Senator from Oklahoma has another \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1053\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator from \nMontana, my understanding is that we have a request from Senator Byrd, \nand I believe Senator Cochran, that on their behalf, the Byrd \namendment, amendment No. 1053, be adopted by voice vote. My \nunderstanding is that both sides have had that request of Senator Byrd \nand Senator Cochran. I wonder if we might be able to accomplish that, I \nwould ask the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is perfectly amenable to me. In fact, I would suggest \nthe pending business be set aside and call up amendment No. 1053.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be adopted by voice \nvote.\n  First, the unanimous consent is to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1053) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran to establish a Memorial to \nMartin Luther King, Jr. on the Washington Mall.\n  A memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr. in the heart of the Nation's \nCapital is a fitting tribute to a man whose vision and courage \ntransformed the face of our Nation. Only a short distance from us here \nin the Capitol, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his famous ``I Have \nA Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. His \ninspirational words resonated with many Americans and helped spark the \ncivil rights movement.\n  Dr. King started as a civil rights leader during the Montgomery bus \nboycott. Despite the bombings, arrests, and violence that Dr. King \nfaced as a leader of this boycott, he continued to push for change. The \nMontgomery bus boycott successfully brought the glaring inequities \nfacing African Americans to the fore of the American consciousness. In \nresponse to the boycott, the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed racial \nsegregation on intrastate busses. However, as we know, Dr. King did not \nstop with this one legal victory.\n  Dr. King continued to tirelessly advocate for the principles of \nnonviolent protest as a means of addressing the injustices facing \nAfrican Americans. Even in the face of tremendous opposition and \ncynicism, Dr. King persevered and helped concentrate the civil right \nmovement's momentum for change. It is largely due to Dr. King's efforts \nthat Congress rightly passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Over 4 decades later, I believe we are coming closer day by day to \nachieving Dr. King's dream, but still, more progress must be made. To \nmemorialize Dr. King's dream here in our Nation's Capital would serve \nas a powerful reminder of the strides we have made but the steps we \nmust still take together as a nation to weed out inequity.\n  I am pleased to have the opportunity to cosponsor this amendment with \nSenators Byrd and Cochran to honor this great individual with a \nmemorial in Washington, DC. The $10 million authorized by this \namendment will help expedite the building of this memorial, which shall \nserve to remind future generations of Dr. King's sacrifices and his \nlasting legacy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of this proposed legislation be printed in \nthe Record immediately following this statement.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1003\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1003. I would like \nto be recognized to speak on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending, and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would like to call the attention of the Members to page \n8 of the report language on the Department of Interior, Environment and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill, 2006. No. 7 is entitled, ``Report \nLanguage.'' I think it is important that we understand what this says. \nIt says:\n\n       Any limitation, any directive or any earmarking contained \n     in either the House or Senate report which is not \n     contradicted by the other report, nor specifically denied in \n     the conference report, shall be considered as having been \n     approved by both Houses of Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not have objection to that other than the fact \nthat the American people, when the report comes out of conference, will \nhave no way to measure the earmarks, the directives, and other things \nin that bill without that inclusion. This amendment requires that any \nlimitation, directive, or earmarking be included in the conference \nreport. This amendment is about sunshine so that if you get the \nconference report you can actually tell what is earmarked, what is \ndirected, what is limited by the language that individual Senators have \nplaced in the bill. I do not expect this amendment to pass. I \nunderstand that. But I think in one of the steps of us ever getting to \nthe point where we do not leave this heritage of tremendous debt to our \nchildren, sunshine has to come in. And when we pass a bill out of \nconference, the conference report ought to say what is in there, just \nlike it does when we have a conference bill on the Senate side or a \nconference bill on the House side.\n\n  The current report language actually abdicates our authority in \nlooking at what the House earmarks or what the House limits as a body. \nWe do not get a chance to look at that because it is not in the report \nlanguage coming out of conference. I believe the Senate has a \nresponsibility to vote on everything that is in that bill and have \nknowledge of everything that is in that bill. The only way a Senator \nwill be able to know that is to take the House language in their \nreport, filter through the Senate language, and figure out what is and \nwhat is not included.\n  This amendment requires that all provisions must be included in the \nconference report. It allows both the Senate and the House the \nopportunity to vote on all provisions, as opposed to only those which \nhappen to pass through their respective Chambers.\n  I believe the American people expect us to do that. I believe this \nbody was, in fact, intended to look at what the\n\n[[Page S7498]]\n\nHouse does. I believe the conference report ought to share what the \nHouse has limited, directed or earmarked for the benefit of individual \nMembers or individual States, cities or otherwise.\n  So with that, I yield to the Senator from Montana and ask that he \nwould support this amendment. It is a simple change. It is a change for \nopen and more transparent Government. It is my belief that it is \nsomething we ought to consider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. We all live by sunshine, I would tell the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  I think--I will have to ask counsel on this--whenever the House \npasses their bill and sends it to the Senate, and we take that bill to \nour committee, both the subcommittee and the full Committee on \nAppropriations, that House bill contains all of their earmarks. And \nsome of those earmarks are covered up, agreed. But that bill is \navailable for the Senators' perusal whenever it comes over here.\n  Now, most of these, however--recommended by the House and the Senate \nboth--appear in the tables of the statement of the managers that \naccompanies that conference report. They are all there. All you have to \ndo is kind of look for them. Some of them are not because the two bills \nare merged.\n  So in order to get the bills balanced out, merged, and back on the \nfloor with a conference report--and you have to remember, the staff \nreads that whole bill, every word, before it is in its final form and \ncomes back here for final consideration--some of those do get covered \nup. But in each body, all of those earmarks are a matter of public \nrecord, what goes on in their committees on the House side and the \nSenate side. This is to facilitate getting that report put together, \nthe bill coming back on this floor, and getting it passed.\n  So what the Senator is asking for is more time between the time the \nHouse passes it, we pass it, it goes to conference, and then getting it \nback on the floor and full disposal of the conference report.\n  So it is not to hide anything. The way it is done is not meant to \nhide anything. And nothing is hidden. You just have to follow the trail \nin order to dig it out. And I realize sometimes the public would have a \nhard time doing that. But as a Senator, we even have to work at it at \ntimes. But, basically, that is the reason for the process: to save \ntime, take some of the load off the staff that has to put this \ntogether.\n  So I would ask that the body oppose this particular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think we are in a time when we can take \nthe time to make sure the American public knows what is in the bills. \nAs a matter of fact, I think it is wrong if we do not take the time. I \nread almost every bill. I am one of the few Senators who do. I can tell \nyou that I will struggle through a House bill and then have to subtract \nout the conference bill to find out what was deleted from the House \nbill to be able to know what is and what is not there.\n  That is not sunshine for the American people. It is barely any \nsunshine for a Senator. I restate, the fact is, we ought to make it \neasy for the American people to find out where we are spending the \nmoney. A conference report that does not make it easy, does not direct \nwhere the money is directed, where the earmarks are, where the \nlimitations are, is less than what the American people deserve.\n  This is a simple request. It will not add that much time. It is all \nprinted out. In the conference, you all know what you are going to \nagree to and what you are not going to agree to. It is taking one \ncomputer screen: You punch ``copy,'' and it goes into the report.\n  So I would beg to differ with the chairman. I love him dearly. I \nthink he is a great man. But I think the American people deserve to \nknow what is in every report that comes out of here in terms of \nspending so they can make an evaluation: Are we doing the right thing \nmortgaging the future of our kids? Is it legitimate?\n\n  But to pass a conference report that does not give that pathway to \nthem, for them to see and make that judgment, I think is wrong.\n  I think it will help us as the Senate, as we look at what the other \nbody does, to put that in that report. I believe anything less than \nthat says we do have something to hide. We may not have anything to \nhide. But not being very transparent and very clear about what the \nlimitations, earmarks, and directives are in a bill is something less \nthan what the American people deserve.\n  I ask the chairman again to reconsider his opposition to this \namendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Well, I will tell you, I have read those conference \nreports, also--even the bills that come over from the House--like you. \nIf you have a clear paper trail, and you read everything, about 80 \npercent of all earmarks are contained in the conference report. There \nare just a few that are matched up, and we do not get to see them in \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I will. I am still going to fight for the 20 percent. How \nis that?\n  Mr. COBURN. But the point is, don't the American people need to see \nthat 20 percent? Shouldn't they be able to see that 20 percent?\n  Mr. BURNS. Sure. Listen, I helped pass a law with Senator Lieberman \non E-Government. Any citizen can go to their computer and dial it up \nonline, and they can follow it all the way through. There are ways of \ndoing that. I was part of that debate on E-Government. And we are going \nto do another E-Government bill that is going to open it up even wider, \nwe would hope.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Do you believe the average American can get on a \ncomputer, after this bill comes through conference, and see where all \nthe money is spent?\n  Mr. BURNS. I would answer that by saying those citizens who are \nreally, really interested in how we budget and how we spend do have the \ncapabilities and the knowledge to access that information and to follow \nit.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1002, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1002 of the Interior appropriations bill be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to \nspeak for 5 minutes prior to the vote. I know we have two important \nvotes that will be coming up shortly. But I did want to take this \nopportunity to indicate that I am very proud to be cosponsoring the \nMurray amendment concerning the important resources that are needed for \nveterans health care today.\n  The midyear budget review of the Department of Veterans Affairs \nconfirmed what many of us have known for some time; that the VA is \nfacing at least a $1-billion shortfall in meeting critical health care \nneeds for the current budget, the 2005 budget. As a result, the VA \nofficials say they are forced to take $600 million away from funds to \nimprove VA hospitals and other infrastructure and to borrow $400 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\nfrom funds already committed to provide health care during the next \nfiscal year. The end result is that the quality of health care for our \nveterans will suffer. Essential services and programs are now at \nrisk. This is not acceptable. We need to act today to do something \nabout it.\n\n  We are creating more veterans, as brave men and women come home from \nIraq and Afghanistan and around the world. Over 360,000 veterans have \nalready returned from Iraq and Afghanistan, and over 86,000 have sought \nhealth care from the VA. The VA's patient growth for this year rose by \n5.2 percent, an increase of over 3 percent from their original \nprojections. We have men and women coming home every day, changing one \nhat for another. They come home with the assumption that we will keep \nour promise to make sure health care is there for them.\n  We know there are an additional 740,000 military personnel also \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan. This next generation of veterans will \nalso be eligible for VA health care, putting further demands on the \nsystem. Continued funding shortfalls and rising costs have already \nresulted in unprecedented waiting times for veterans seeking care. In \nmy State of Michigan, I talk with veterans who have to wait 6 months to \nsee a doctor. This is simply not acceptable. The VA's enrolled patient \npopulation has increased 134 percent. Funding for the VA has only \nincreased 44 percent.\n  It really isn't about funding. We know this involves dollars. The \nreal issue is whether we are going to keep our promise to our veterans \nwho have kept their promise to each of us in fighting for our freedoms. \nThe President's budget fails to keep this promise. I was proud, as a \nmember of the Budget Committee, to be involved in efforts to turn that \naround. In the budget process this year, we did offer an amendment that \nwould have increased the dollars for veterans health care. That was not \nsuccessful at the time. Now is the time that we can make this right.\n  I also mention that in the President's budget this year, instead of \nadding the dollars needed for our brave men and women who are coming \nhome and putting on the veterans cap, we saw a proposal to double \nveterans prescription drug copays from $7 to $15 per prescription and \nan increase of $250 in an enrollment fee for more than 2 million of our \nveterans. I was pleased as a member of the Budget Committee to lead the \neffort that took that out of the budget that came before the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing proposed cuts with the budget proposed \nby the President, deep cuts in our VA nursing homes and private homes, \nState VA nursing homes. We are seeing continued efforts to roll back \ndollars rather than increase them.\n  I hope what we will do long term is move our veterans health care \nfunding over to be mandatory funding rather than having to go through \nthe budget process every year. We know that our veterans put their \nlives on the line for us without question. They are not asking will \nthose funds we promised really be there for them. They assume we will \nkeep our promise. Every year, we are debating whether veterans health \ncare is fully funded. Now is the time to make this a mandatory promise \nthat we keep based on the needs of our veterans, not a debate about the \nbudget. We need an emergency supplemental to address this crisis.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor with Senator Murray. I commend her for \nthe amendment. We also need to take a hard look at this year's budget \npriorities and ask why we are not putting our veterans at the top of \nthe list.\n  I urge support for the Murray amendment. Then we must get about the \nbusiness of making sure that we are getting it right for our veterans \nevery year, that we are fully funding their needs, the promises we have \nmade to each veteran who is serving us today, served us yesterday, and \nwill serve us tomorrow.\n  I urge adoption of the Murray amendment and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment that I am sponsoring with Senators Murray and Byrd, to \nprovide the Department of Veterans Affairs with an additional $1.42 \nbillion in emergency funding to shore up dramatic new shortfalls in the \nVA health care system.\n  Our soldiers are returning home from Iraq and the front lines of the \nWar on Terror by the hundreds, to begin their transition back to \ncivilian life--and they deserve our assistance and respect.\n  In California alone, there have been nearly 100,000 men and women \ndeployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, all of whom will be eligible for at \nleast two years of VA medical services when they return.\n  Over 1,400 Californians have been wounded during operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Many of these recent veterans suffered injuries that \nwill require specialty care for the rest of their lives.\n  Moreover, many of our combat veterans could have mental wounds we are \nnot even aware of yet.\n  A report issued by the Government Accountability Office in September \nof last year found that:\n\n       Mental health experts predict that because of the intensity \n     of warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan 15 percent or more of the \n     servicemembers returning from these conflicts will develop \n     post-traumatic stress disorder--PTSD.''\n\n  This is in addition to the veterans currently accessing the VA health \ncare system.\n  And now, we have learned that the VA's budget forecast projections \ndid not adequately provide for soldiers returning from Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  How, if we know this, can we sit by and insist that there is no \nproblem? This budget crunch is not just on paper.\n  In San Diego County alone, 4,000 more veterans have been treated by \nthe VA this year as compared to last, and we are still three months \nfrom the end of the fiscal year.\n  This includes over 1,700 soldiers returning from combat in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. At the same time, the number of backlogs for appointments \nis growing, leading to longer wait times for veterans.\n  And the Los Angeles Times reported on March 20, 2005, that over the \nlast decade, the VA hospital in Los Angeles has reduced the capacity of \nin-patient psychiatric beds from 450 to 90. Meanwhile, over the same 10 \nyears, Los Angeles has seen an increase of 28 percent in mental health \npatients.\n  The crunch is coming and we need to start preparing. This amendment \nstarts the preparation.\n  But I want to be crystal clear, this amendment only addresses needs \nthis year. Much more work will need to be done in fiscal year 2006.\n  It appears that the fiscal year 2006 VA budget request also made use \nof similar data forecasting as this year's, making it highly probable \nthat we will see a repeat of this shortfall next year.\n  Secretary Nicholson testifies today before the Senate Veterans \nAffairs Committee and acknowledge that the fiscal year 2006 budget \nrequest is insufficient. We look forward to the Administration's budget \namendment for fiscal year 06 to deal with this problem.\n  Clearly, we will have a lot of work to do in the fiscal year 2006 \nappropriations process. In the meantime, this amendment would add \nneeded funding this year and help to alleviate the budget problems we \nare seeing in VA hospitals across the country.\n  In closing, I would only add that this is not a Democrat issue and \nthis is not a Republican issue. This is an issue that goes to the very \nheart of how we treat those men and women who have fought bravely on \nbehalf of our nation and we need to be unified in showing them our \nsupport.\n  I respectfully urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, George Washington said more than 215 years \nago that, ``The willingness with which our young people are likely to \nserve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly \nproportional as to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were \ntreated and appreciated by their country.''\n  Today, our veterans are appreciated, but we learned last week that \nthey are not necessarily treated adequately when it comes to health-\ncare. The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, disclosed it needs at \nleast an additional $1 billion to provide healthcare to our Nation's \nveterans. If we don't do something about it, our veterans will be in \njeopardy of having necessary healthcare delayed or even denied due to \nlack of funds. We must\n\n[[Page S7500]]\n\naddress this situation without delay. Our troops risk their lives every \nday defending freedom, and sacrificing to keep us safe. If we fail to \nmeet our responsibility to them, and provide them the healthcare they \nneed, we fail to honor their service.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Senator Murray's \nimportant amendment to immediately cover this shortfall by providing \n$1.42 billion to the VA for veterans' healthcare under an emergency \ndesignation so we can ensure today's veterans receive the benefits they \nhave earned fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. I hope that none of us \nwould tolerate the injustice of soldiers who have bled for our country \nbeing denied the medical care they need.\n  While the VA is replacing the lost funds, they do so at a great cost. \nThe VA is cutting corners by squeezing other accounts. Those accounts \nprovide funds for non-recurring maintenance and equipment--funding \ncritical tasks like repairing leaky roofs, or purchasing equipment \nranging from photocopiers to defibrillators.\n  Our VA hospitals should be shrines of gratitude to those who have \nborne the battle. They should not want for anything--not new roofs, not \nphotocopiers--and most certainly not defibrillators.\n  At a time when a new generation of veterans is returning from war, \nset to use the VA in historic numbers, I hope that we will heed the \nwords of Commander James E. Sursely. Commander Sursely spoke for the \n1.2 million members of the Disabled American Veterans organization when \nhe called upon Congress to ``. . . act quickly to stem the flow of red \nink that threatens health care for today's veterans and thousands of \nmen and women injured or disabled during the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.''\n  Our veterans are humble Americans who every day exude the quiet \nstrength that comes from having served their country when it needed \nthem. Today, they need us. I ask all my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Murray amendment, and do right by our veterans without \ndelay. Let's not waste another moment in answering this call. Let's \nfill this gap now. Let's meet their need. Let's not forget that a new \ngeneration of veterans is watching to see what we do today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the vote in relation to the pending motion to waive with \nrespect to the Coburn amendment No. 1019, to be followed immediately by \na vote in relation to the Coburn amendment No. 1003, with no second \ndegrees in order to the amendments prior to the votes and with 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we decided to call up amendment numbered \n1026, the Sununu-Bingaman amendment regarding the Tongass National \nForest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. BURNS. There is no time agreement on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this year marks the 100th anniversary \nof the founding of the U.S. Forest Service. The creation of the Forest \nService in the Department of Agriculture is remembered as probably one \nof the most significant conservation legacies of President Theodore \nRoosevelt.\n  During President Roosevelt's tenure, there were established 5 new \nnational parks, 51 bird reserves, 4 game reserves, 18 national \nmonuments, and 150 national forests, including the Tongass National \nForest. All told, some 230 million acres of land was set aside for the \npublic. It is no wonder that President Roosevelt is regarded not only \nas the first but perhaps the greatest conservation President.\n  President Roosevelt shared his vision for the national forests in an \naddress to the Society of American Foresters on March 26, 1903. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       First and foremost, you can never afford to forget for one \n     moment what is the object of our forest policy. The object is \n     not to preserve the forests because they are beautiful, \n     although that is good in itself. Nor because they are refuges \n     for the wild creatures of the wilderness, though that too, is \n     good in itself. The primary object of our forest policy . . . \n     is the making of prosperous homes. Every other consideration \n     comes secondary. A forest that contributes nothing to the \n     wealth, progress or safety of the country is of no interest \n     to the Government, and should be of little interest to the \n     forester.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       Your attention must be directed to the preservation of \n     forests, not as an end in itself, but as a means of \n     preserving and increasing the prosperity of the nation.\n\n  I find it somewhat ironic that during the centennial year when we \ncelebrate the achievements of the Forest Service and the professional \nforesters who manage these forests, that this particular amendment is \noffered today. This is an amendment opposed by the Society of American \nForesters. This society represents 16,000 professional foresters from \nacross the Nation. It is opposed by the National Association of Home \nBuilders. It is an amendment opposed by the very people who were \nidentified as the core stakeholders of our national forests by the \nRoosevelt administration.\n  This amendment is opposed by organizations which, like President \nRoosevelt, believe in the wise use of our forests. It is opposed by the \nNational Association of Counties. It is opposed by America's working \nmen and women who belong to the labor unions that make up the Forest \nProducts Industry National Labor Management Committee. We have the \nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the PACE \nInternational Union, the International Brotherhood of Carpenters and \nJoiners, the United Mine Workers, the Southern Council of Industrial \nWorkers, and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers.\n  The amendment we have before the Senate now does not comport with \nPresident Roosevelt's vision for the national forests. It is an \namendment that turns our national forests, which are intended to \nsupport multiple uses, into wilderness areas. It is the falling domino \nin the nationwide campaign to lock up our national forests, throwing \npeople out of work and wreaking havoc on our local economies. And most \noffensively, to me, it is an amendment that discriminates against just \none forest--the Tongass National Forest, in the State of Alaska. It is \nonly directed to the Tongass. It covers no other national forest in the \nNation. I suggest to my colleagues in the Senate that first it is the \nTongass; next it will be the forests in your home States.\n  Even though this amendment is cloaked in the language of fiscal \nresponsibility, it should come as no surprise that the usual suspects \nare working hard for its adoption--those who seek to shut down and to \nprohibit any timber activity on national forest lands. It is not that \nthey are fiscal conservatives themselves. It is because they \nspecifically oppose logging in the Tongass. These are groups such as \nthe Wilderness Society, the Alaska Rain Forest Campaign, the National \nResources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, \nEarthjustice, formerly known as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. \nThese are organizations that have just said no, there shall be no \ntimber activity in the Tongass.\n  The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, now known as Earthjustice, is a \ngroup that maintains an office in Juneau for the purpose of appealing \nand then litigating the timber sales that are presented in the Tongass.\n  It is no wonder the Forest Service finds it difficult to efficiently \nmanage the timber program in the Tongass. I am told we have about 2 \nyears of the Forest Service planned timber offerings that are either \nunder appeal or litigation at any one time. This is four times the rate \nexperienced by the Forest Service nationally.\n  It is fair to say the professional foresters, in whom President \nRoosevelt placed his trust, no longer manage the timber in the Tongass. \nI can tell you these professional foresters are very frustrated that \nwhat we have are trial lawyers and judges who have more to say about \nmanaging our forests than they do.\n  The proponents of this amendment will tell you this is about making \nthe free market system work within our national forests. As long as the \nlitigators can tie up the timber sales, tie up the forest management in \nknots, this is not a free market scenario.\n  When Congress passed the Tongass Timber Reform Act, which caused the \ncancellation of long-term contracts and the closure of the pulp mills \nin Ketchikan and Sitka, that was not the free market. It was not the \nfree market that eliminated thousands of timber jobs in the State of \nAlaska. It was about timber politics, plain and simple.\n  It is not the free market that generates the high costs that the \nproponents of this amendment complain make the timber sales \nunprofitable. According to the Society of American Foresters, about 75 \npercent of the cost associated with timber sales in the Tongass is \nspent on environmental review, appeals, and litigation. So the \nremaining 25 percent of that is spent on actual preparation and \nadministration of the sale.\n  So again, you look at the numbers, and you say, it seems, looking at \njust the columns, the numbers are higher. But keep in mind, 75 percent \nof those costs are directly associated with the environmental review, \nappeals and litigation. So we need to be very clear about what this \namendment does. If it is passed, it essentially will enact a roadless \nrule on the Tongass National Forest. Because the Tongass is currently \n95 percent roadless, and because it has stringent environmental \nstandards, the amount of timber that could be harvested from the \nTongass would be vastly reduced.\n  The current 150 million board foot program--and keep in mind, this \nwas formulated after a very extensive scientific consultation, with \npublic participation. It was a process which took 9 years and $13 \nmillion to complete this plan. Under this program that again was \nformulated in this very lengthy process, it would be reduced to 30 to \n40 million board feet. This would result in the direct loss of two or \nmore of the mills and loss of about 680 potential jobs.\n  Now, some of you may be saying: Well, 680 jobs does not seem that \nsignificant. In the southeastern part of\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\nthe State of Alaska, where our population numbers are few and our \nunemployment numbers are very high, this is a huge loss. This is a \ndevastating loss. This would truly be nothing more than the latest \nchapter in the campaign to shut down the Tongass and kill off the \ntimber industry in southeast Alaska.\n  Now the proponents of this amendment would have us believe that if \nthis amendment fails, then somehow or other there are going to be all \nthese big corporations that stand to gain. But the timber industry in \nsoutheast Alaska is not made up of big corporations. It is made up of \nmom-and-pop businesses. These are owner-operated small businesses run \nby people such as Steve Seeley, out of Ketchikan; Kirk Dahlstrom, out \nof Klawock; Butch and Jackie DuRette. These are real people who are \ncontributing to their local economy. These are people who could have \ncut and run when the timber industry turned sour, but instead they \naccepted the risk. They stayed around, and they tried to build their \nbusinesses. Believe me, these are people who know what the free market \nis. I know these people, and I am proud to tell you of the good job \nthey do contributing to the economy of southeast Alaska.\n  So for the good of southeast Alaska, and for the good of sound forest \nmanagement, I ask my colleagues to look at this amendment, look at it \nvery carefully, look at who it is opposed by. It is opposed by the \nNation's professional foresters. It is opposed by working men and \nwomen. It is opposed by the National Association of Counties. And it is \nopposed by our Nation's homebuilders. Let's look carefully at how we \nmanage our forests and make sure we do it right.\n  One of the contentions you will hear is that the economics in the \nTongass do not work. You will hear some numbers thrown around. I think \nit is important to recognize you would be operating off of a false \nassumption or a false premise if you were saying that the Forest \nService is supposed to be a profit-making venture. As I indicated in \nthose comments made by President Roosevelt some 100 years ago, \nconservation, in Roosevelt's mind, meant the wise use of forest \nresources for the greatest good, not necessarily locking them up under \nglass down in southeastern Alaska.\n  The question of why the Forest Service does not necessarily make a \nprofit has been studied extensively. There is a think tank in Bozeman, \nMT, called the Property and Environment Research Center. They did a \nstudy in 1995 where they noted that the Forest Service is not expected \nby its governing law to make a profit. Its operations are governed by \nextensive environmental review processes that make it difficult to turn \na profit.\n  Again, look at the numbers. Look at what the task, the mission, is in \nterms of multiple use, and what it is we are asking our foresters to \ndo.\n\n  I will speak a little bit about the cost issue because there are \nthose who will suggest this amendment is not being put forward because \nthey are opposed to timber in the Tongass; they just think it is an \nunreasonable amount of money and that we are subsidizing. Well, we have \na breakdown of the various regions across the country from the U.S. \nForest Service that delineates the cost per acre of our respective \nnational forests based on State. It sets forth the net acres, the gross \nreceipts, as well as the monetary return per dollar invested.\n  If you look at the Tongass, we operate at about $6.05 in terms of \ncost per acre. As you go through this report across the country, you \nrealize that $6.05 is actually a pretty good deal in terms of how we \nare operating on a cost-per-acre basis.\n  Running down through the States--not singling out any particular \nState, but in several of the California national forests, the cost per \nacre at Six Rivers National Forest is $27.35. The cost per acre in \nPlumas, CA, is $35.86; in San Bernardino National Forest, it is \n$189.20. As to the sponsor of the amendment, if you look at the White \nMountain National Forest in the New Hampshire area, their cost per acre \nis $19.39.\n  So if we are talking about singling out one national forest in the \nentire national forest system, and we are saying it is too expensive in \nthe Tongass, and we are not going to allow for any Federal dollars to \ngo toward building roads because we think it is too expensive there, I \nchallenge you: Take a look at what is happening with the operation of \nour other national forests in terms of our cost per acre and what it \nmeans.\n  Let's look to the monetary return per dollar invested in those \nnational forests in California I made reference to. Their return per \ndollar invested is 1 percent. That is not a very good return if that is \nwhat you are going to base it on.\n  So again, to single out the Tongass, to single out the State of \nAlaska and say, ``You are the only one where we, as a Congress, are \ngoing to decide how you are going to manage your forests because we are \ngoing to tell you that there are no dollars that can go for road-\nbuilding activity,'' the land management plan that we have spent 9 \nyears and $13 million on is thrown out the window because the Federal \nGovernment is going to tell us that our costs are a little bit too \nhigh--it is wrong. It is flat out wrong, and it needs to be stopped.\n  I mentioned those who oppose this amendment. It is important for us \nto recognize who the professional managers are, the professional \nforesters, some 16,000 professional foresters across the Nation who \noppose this amendment. Our decision, should we adopt the Sununu \namendment, would override the judgment of professional foresters. It \nwould render meaningless the Tongass land management plan. We need to \nthink about what it is we are doing should we move forward in support \nof this amendment.\n  I want to leave my colleagues with a few facts again about singling \nout the Tongass for this action in this amendment.\n  Alaska is a State. We are not a colony. We may have come late into \nthe statehood battle, but we are still a State, and we deserve to be \ntreated as a State. We sought statehood so we could gain control of our \nresources. But sometimes that goal remains pretty illusive. All we are \nasking for is that we have the ability to manage our Federal lands \nresponsibly. We can--in conjunction with those professionals, those \nforesters who are working hard on this plan to make it work--manage the \nforests to provide for the multiple uses our national forests are \ntasked to do.\n  I know people think: Oh, we throw around these Alaska statistics all \nthe time. But I think it is significant in this debate to put this in \ncontext. Ninety-four percent of the land in the southeastern part of \nthe State is part of the Tongass National Forest. It is controlled by \nthe Federal Government, the U.S. Forest Service.\n  In the State of Alaska, we have 54 percent of the Nation's designated \nwilderness. In one State, our State, we have 54 percent of the entire \ndesignated wilderness.\n  What are we doing with the Tongass National Forest now? Forty percent \nof that land in the Tongass, some 6.6 million acres, is already off \nlimits to timber development. It is in a wilderness area. It is a \nnational monument. It is a land-use designation II area. It is \nabsolutely, positively off limits. That is 40 percent currently in the \nTongass.\n  Another 56 percent of the Tongass National Forest is off limits to \ntimber under the forest plan--this forest plan that I keep talking \nabout that took 9 years and $13 million that this amendment will \nessentially kick aside. Fifty-six percent of the Tongass is off limits \nunder that plan.\n  That leaves 4 percent of the Tongass, or approximately 655,000 acres, \nout of a total of 17.8 million acres in the Tongass. That 4 percent is \nwhat we are talking about that would be available for timber \ndevelopment. Allowing southeast Alaska, allowing people such as Steve \nSeeley and his sawmill, and Kirk Dahlstrom's sawmill in Klawock, \nallowing this development in an economy that is already very hard \npressed, is not going to spoil the beauty of this incredible national \nforest--these 17.8 million acres. It is not going to doom any national \ntreasures.\n  We have a plan we have worked hard to complete. We ask to be allowed \nto continue that, and to be able to provide for the few jobs we would \nlike to continue in the area for the benefit of those who choose to \ncall it home.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see the senior Senator from Alaska is \nhere. As\n\n[[Page S7503]]\n\nwell, we are joined by our colleague from Oregon. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a national forest \nthat is not in my State, and of constituents who are not in the State \nof Oregon. I do so because I see happening to my Alaskan colleagues and \ntheir constituents what I have witnessed for too many years in my own \nState of Oregon. As a predicate, I know the difference between \nenvironmentalists who make many good points, who have much to \ncontribute, and, frankly, what I would term the ``environmental \nconflict industry.'' Others have used that term. If this amendment that \nis offered by my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, were really \nabout saving money, it would be about streamlining costs associated \nwith timber production as opposed to just an amendment that would \neffectively end any kind of multiple use in the Tongass National \nForest.\n  The truth is, the Tongass is an area as big as many States in the \nlower 48. It is a vast resource. The truth is also that each of us, as \nAmericans, use many pounds of wood in our lives every day. The question \nbefore this Senate is whether we want to have timber come from our \ncountry with high environmental standards or from other countries where \nthere are few, if any, environmental standards. Many complain about the \nway the harvest is done in Indonesia or in Brazil. Some of us even \ncomplain that the way Canada harvests, across the border from the \nTongass, is done on the basis of tremendous amounts of subsidies. They \nare called crown lands. The timber companies there are essentially \ngiven the raw product, provided access to the forest, and then are able \nto compete with American timber workers. That is to our great \ndisadvantage.\n  Today I have to stand in defense of my colleagues and their State and \ntheir forest because America needs to be reminded that we have the best \ntimberlands in the world. We can either use them or watch them, too \noften, go up in catastrophic wildfires. We know how to manage forests \ntoday. We know silviculture science. We know what works and what does \nnot. Clearly, there have been abuses in the past. Clearly, things can \nbe done better in the future. But the truth is, if we, as Americans, \nwant timber products in our lives, that wood will grow and be harvested \nsomewhere, if not from our country, then from where? If not up to high \nenvironmental standards, then as against what standards?\n  If you end the road-building component of timber sales in the Tongass \nNational Forest, then you will end timber harvest in the Tongass \nNational Forest because of the size of this area. You can't helicopter \nin and out everything that could be harvested and could be made \navailable to American workers and American home builders and the tax \nbase of the State of Alaska and, obviously, the Federal Government \nthrough timber receipts as well. It is expensive to build roads in \nforests, to maintain them. But, frankly, to do nothing is to abandon \nthis industry.\n  Americans need to be reminded that timber does not come from the Home \nDepot. It comes from a tree that grows somewhere. But as to the \nenvironmental conflict industry that is pushing this particular \namendment and, I am sure, some who want to save the taxpayer money, I \nwant to suggest that it is the environmental conflict industry and not \nthe timber industry that is feeding off the American taxpayer. With \nappeals and lawsuits, the cost of basic forest management skyrockets. \nThe Tongass National Forest estimates that half of its timber budget is \nspent on paperwork that will be called into court. And to produce a \n1,000-page NEPA document is now the rule rather than the exception.\n  The Tongass currently has 13 environmental impact statements delayed \nin court. Every forest plan on the Tongass has been litigated. And the \nenvironmental conflict industry will ask that their lawyer's fees be \npaid--by whom?--by you and by me, and by the taxpayer. In 2003, \ntaxpayers were charged $200,000 by the Sierra Club for its lawsuit \nagainst the Tongass National Forest. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy \nfor the environmental conflict industry to drive up costs of forest \nmanagement and then grumble about those costs.\n  If this amendment were truly about fiscal responsibility, we would be \ndiscussing ways to produce timber from the Tongass at a lower cost \ninstead of eliminating fiber production there altogether. Or we could \nbe capping lawyers fees. Or we could be talking about other national \nforests that do not produce any revenue whatsoever, unlike the Tongass.\n  This amendment is not really about fiscal responsibility, it is about \nenvironmental responsibility. That ought to be our real objective.\n  If we buy wood products, just know that it grew on a tree somewhere. \nI would rather that it be managed in an American forest, such as the \nTongass, providing American products for American consumers.\n  I felt it important that a Senator from a State who has already \nsuffered, as they are now, and been attacked in the way that they are \nbeing attacked, ought to come down and speak for them. There are not a \nlot of people who stand up for timber workers anymore. These are not \nbig companies operating in the Tongass. These are Americans in very \nrural places, trying to produce the products of the tree in a \nscientific way, according to high U.S. standards, so that we can meet \nthe obligations of our law for multiple use as well as environmental \nstewardship.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and allow an \nenvironmentally sensitive industry, a timber industry that is living up \nto high environmental standards, to survive in a very rural and \nvulnerable part of our country in Alaska.\n  As I have said, I rise today in opposition to the Sununu amendment. I \ndo so in defense of one of the basic functions of our National \nForests--to produce timber.\n  This Friday signifies the 100th anniversary of the United States \nForest Service. We celebrate this event because our forests are still \nthere. Our forests are still beautiful. But certainly there's more to \ncelebrate than that.\n  National Forests were originally set aside to produce two \ncommodities: clean water and a continuous timber supply.\n  Ted Roosevelt said:\n\n       The object (of our forest policy) is not to preserve the \n     forests because they are beautiful . . . nor because they are \n     refuges for wild creatures. . . . the primary object of our \n     forest policy in the United States is the making of \n     prosperous homes. Every other consideration comes as \n     secondary.\n\n  With this in mind, I come to the Senate floor in defense of a \nNational Forest not in my State, and on behalf of communities who are \nnot my constituents.\n  But Alaskans are under the same siege that struck my constituents and \nNational Forests in my State.\n  It is a siege of the ``environmental conflict industry.''\n  And it is this industry, not the timber industry, that is feeding off \nthe American taxpayer.\n  With appeals and lawsuits, the cost of basic forest management \nskyrockets.\n  The Tongass National Forest estimates that half of its timber budget \nis spent on paperwork that will be called into court. And to produce a \nthousand-page NEPA document is now the rule, rather than the exception.\n  The Tongass currently has 13 environmental impact statements delayed \nin court. Every forest plan on the Tongass has been litigated.\n  And the environmental conflict industry will ask that their lawyer's \nfees be paid by the taxpayer.\n  In 2003, taxpayers were charged $200,000 by the Sierra Club for its \nlawsuit against the Tongass National Forest.\n  It is a self-fulfilling prophecy for the ``environmental conflict \nindustry'' to drive up the costs of forest management and then grumble \nabout those costs.\n  If this amendment were truly about fiscal responsibility, we would be \ndiscussing ways to produce timber from the Tongass at a lower cost--\ninstead of eliminating fiber production altogether.\n  Or we would be capping lawyers' fees.\n  Or we would be talking about other National Forests that do not \nproduce any revenue whatsoever.\n  This amendment is not about fiscal responsibility. It is about \nenvironmental responsibility.\n\n[[Page S7504]]\n\n  I would remind my colleagues that a 2 x 4 does not come from Home \nDepot. It comes from a tree somewhere. The choice of the ``where'' is \nup to us.\n  If not from Alaska or Oregon, how about the rainforests of Brazil or \nIndonesia?\n  If not according to our environmental laws, then by whose?\n  If not to feed American families, then whose?\n  The United States has the most productive forests and the strictest \nenvironmental laws in the world.\n  To export our industry and our employment is both economically and \nenvironmentally appalling.\n  I do not believe this is the intention of the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  But this amendment runs against the very grain of the National Forest \nSystem we commemorate this week.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  \n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nstatement and his support. I thank my colleague from Alaska for her \nstatement.\n  I come to the floor in opposition to the Sununu amendment, also. I \nhope Members will read it because it says:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     plan, design, study, or construct new forest development \n     roads in the Tongass National Forest for the purpose of \n     harvesting timber by private entities or individuals.\n\n  This amendment is premised on inaccurate information and faulty \nassumptions about our Nation's timber industry, the Tongass, and the \nstate of our national forests. Unfortunately, this type of information \nhas become commonplace. It is the inevitable result of special interest \ncampaigns which are designed to distort the facts and mislead the \nAmerican public. For many years, I have worked to set the record \nstraight, especially when it comes to the false claims about Alaska's \nstewardship of our natural resources. Unfortunately, this amendment \nrequires that I attempt, once more, to set the record straight.\n  Misinformation about management of our national resources now runs \nrampant. I believe it lies at the heart of this amendment. It is the \nresult of propaganda campaigns raised by extreme environmentalists and \nspecial interest groups who often get the facts wrong because they \nignore our history. Our State once had a thriving timber industry. It \nsupplied almost 2 billion board feet a year, employed over 3,000 timber \nworkers, and generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue for the \nU.S. Treasury. But in the spirit of compromise and cooperation, our \ntimber industry agreed to reduce the amount of timber it could harvest \nper year. In fact, one timber employee recently stated ``we cooperated \nourselves right out of business.''\n  The Tongass National Forest was established in 1917. At 17 million \nacres, it is the largest national forest in the United States. It is \ntwice the size of Maryland and more than 25 times the size of Rhode \nIsland. As a matter of fact, if we look at the map showing the New \nEngland area, it shows how big this forest really is. The part that is \ncovered in black is that portion of the forest that is open to timber \non a proportionate basis. The other map that I have shows the forest as \na whole and shows the result of the plans that have been developed. The \narea in blue is area that is still available for harvesting. All of the \nwhite part of that map of the Tongass is permanently closed to timber \nharvest.\n  The Tongass compromises 90 percent of the lands of southeastern \nAlaska. The remaining lands are State, more Federal, and private lands. \nThe Tongass is the only forest in Alaska in which timber may be \nharvested now. Alaska's other forest, the Chugach National Forest, \nwhich contains 5.5 million acres, is now under a management plan which \nhas reduced the allowable sale quantity to zero. The Chugach is \ncompletely closed to logging. No timber can be logged from that very \nmassive forest, 5.5 million acres.\n  Federal timber policy regarding the Tongass has had devastating \neffects on the 32 communities in Southeast Alaska that depend on timber \nharvests for their livelihood. When Congress passed the Tongass Timber \nAct in 1947, an allowable sale quantity, which we call the ASQ, for the \nTongass was set at 1.38 billion board feet per year. This level was \nslowly eroded. Under the 1959 Statehood Act, the State of Alaska was \nallowed to select only 400,000 acres of its 103-million-acre \nentitlement in Southeast Alaska.\n  Because there is little private land to support our local economies, \nCongress committed to provide support for economic development through \ntimber sales. Congress codified that support in a series of laws \nbeginning in 1971. In 1971, the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement \nAct set the ASQ, the allowable quantity, at 950 million board feet per \nyear. During subsequent years, the timber industry in the Tongass \nsupported almost 3,000 jobs and harvested an average of 520 million \nboard feet per year. However, the amount of permissible harvest was \nagain decreased in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act \nof 1980, which set an ASQ of 450 million board feet per year. At that \ntime, the Senate believed that 450 million board feet per year would \nmaintain a robust timber industry which was a major section of \nsoutheast Alaska's regional economy.\n  In addition, the Senate envisioned providing Federal funds for road \nbuilding and advanced harvesting technology.\n  As former Senator Roth stated at that time in 1980, the bill:\n\n       . . . permit[s] the established timber industries to \n     maintain a rate of production necessary for their economic \n     success. It was understood by Members of the Senate during \n     this debate that a vital timber industry was necessary for \n     the economic survival of the residents of southeast Alaska.\n\n  As Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts said:\n\n       Our commitment was to treat Alaska fairly.\n\n  The commitment was again put to the test during the debate on the \nTongass Timber Reform Act, which was called TTRA, in 1990. That plan \nset the ASQ at 450 million board feet on 1.9 million acres. The Act \nalso directed the Forest Service to provide a supply of timber which \nmeets the market demand in southeast Alaska. At that time, several \nMembers from both sides of the aisle in the Senate adamantly agreed \nthat this bill would be the final word on the Tongass.\n  As Senator Johnson of Louisiana stated:\n\n       I believe that the designation and disposition of the \n     public lands in the Tongass National Forest pursuant to this \n     act represent a responsible balance between the preservation \n     of wildlife areas and the availability of lands for more \n     intensive use as determined appropriate by administrative \n     planning and management. I further believe that this \n     agreement will allow Alaskans the certainty they need and \n     deserve by resolving the issue once and for all.\n  Now, that was in 1990. Senator Bingaman--now an original cosponsor of \nthe Sununu amendment, as a matter of fact--said at the time:\n\n       This is a balanced bill that will adequately protect this \n     majestic national forest, while assuring a sustainable supply \n     of timber for current and future needs. . . . This \n     legislation recognizes that some areas should be protected, \n     while others should be managed for a sustained supply of \n     timber.\n\n  That was at the time of the 1990 act.\n  I remember speaking on the floor prior to passage of the bill. After \nyears of broken promises and severe declines in the timber industry, I \ntrusted our colleagues to do the right thing and resolve the issue of \nthe Tongass once and for all. That is what everybody at the time said--\nthat Act was the final legislation pertaining to the Tongass timber \nharvest. I called on all Members of the House and Senate to listen to \nthe voice of Alaskans. I received a promise, commitment, and assurance \nof those involved, who had the power to change these laws, that they \nrecognized this was the end, that there would be no further divisions \nof the Tongass.\n  In 1997, however, the Forest Service completed the Tongass land \nmanagement plan, which currently guides management of the Tongass. The \ndevelopment of that involved an unprecedented level of scientific \nreview and public involvement. It took over 10 years and cost the \ntaxpayers of the United States $13 million.\n  I opposed the plan because it contained again a drastic reduction in \nthe amount of timber allowed to be harvested. It reduced the allowable \nsale quantity level to 267 million board feet per year. I thought the \nlevels were\n\n[[Page S7505]]\n\nmuch lower than they needed to be, and they violated the commitment \npreviously made to me. Numerous scientists who found that the Tongass \ncould sustain far greater development supported my conclusion.\n  Yet, today, that plan seems like the golden age of the Tongass timber \nindustry. I now find myself defending a plan I initially opposed, \nbecause of continued efforts to erode the promises made to our State.\n  This plan addresses how to manage the Tongass--a largely undeveloped \nforest landscape--over time. The centerpiece is a biological \nconservation strategy that protects the ``biological heart,'' as they \ncalled it, of the Tongass, designed to assure the sustainability of all \nresources and values, while allowing development on a relatively small \nportion of the Tongass to support communities in southeast Alaska \nthrough timber harvesting.\n  Mr. President, 93 percent of all forested areas in the Tongass are \nset aside under the 1997 plan; 93 percent are not available for timber \nharvesting. Timber harvesting can actually now occur on only 676,000 \nacres, or 4 percent of the 17 million acre forest. The allowable sale \nquantity under this plan is 267 million board feet--down, as I said, \nfrom over 1 billion board feet. An ASQ of 267 million board feet per \nyear is the bottom quantity, as far as I am concerned.\n  Since 1990, the volume of timber harvested from the Tongass has \ndropped from hundreds of board feet per year. Last year, only 46 \nmillion board feet of timber was harvested--46 million board feet of \ntimber from a forest of 17 million acres.\n  To comply with the Tongass Timber Reform Act, the current plan seeks \nto plan, prepare, and sell about 150 million board feet per year. \nDelays caused by litigation have prohibited the Forest Service from \naccomplishing this goal on the Tongass. Fourteen projects are currently \nunder litigation. They represent over 238 million board feet of timber \nthat should have been harvested in years gone by.\n  Direct timber jobs in the Tongass have declined from over 3000 in \n1990 to less than 700 today. Unemployment in parts of southeast Alaska \nis well over 10 percent, all because of extravagant acts of those who \noppose the very Act they championed at the time it passed in 1990.\n  Mr. President, 150 million board feet per year could support 959 \ndirect timber jobs, totaling over $35 million in direct wages, Each \ndirect timber job is estimated to support another 1.7 jobs in the local \neconomy. These jobs are an important high-wage sector of the economy \nand provide much needed year-round employment for southeast Alaska. The \nbenefits of a sufficient and sustained timber supply are obvious.\n  The timber industry in southeast Alaska has changed dramatically over \nthe period we have described. The large pulp mills are closed. Three \nmedium sawmills, one small sawmill, and a handful of micromills remain, \nbut they are primarily idle because of the level of timber that can be \ncut right now. These businesses are family owned and community based \nand depend upon a supply of timber from the Tongass for their survival.\n  The remaining mills are involved in efforts to increase the demand \nfor, and the stumpage values of, the timber in southeastern Alaska.\n  These people are trying to build a more integrated industry to \nprovide finished products, such as window and door trim, to local, \nnational, and international markets.\n  The Tongass timber program is working to complete investments in \ndrying and planing lumber, having it graded, to sell in the local \nregion.\n  Wood resources in southeast Alaska are now known to have unique \nqualities. Wood density and lumber strength is high. New lumber grades \nfor Alaska yellow cedar and hemlock have recently been issued, which \nsurpass the strength of other species currently used in construction in \nthe lower 48, such as Douglas fir. This is also expected to increase \nthe value of Alaska's timber.\n  In other words, we are trying to do what we can through technology to \nincrease value of our timber, even though the amount of the timber is \nsteadily declining.\n\n  The efforts of those remaining in the Tongass industry to adapt to \ncurrent conditions will be worthless if Congress adopts the Sununu \namendment. As I said, the amendment prohibits the Forest Service from \nusing funds appropriated for the ``planning, designing, studying, or \nconstruction'' of timber roads.\n  Planning, designing, and studying are necessary to assure that we \nmeet the multiple use consideration of the national forests. This \nforest area is full of small streams that contain migratory salmon. \nWildlife is there. There are recreation values. A whole series of \nvalues require the Forest Service to study the areas that can be \nharvested. Careful planning, designing, studying, and construction is \nnecessary to protect those values, as well as provide a transportation \nroute so timber can be taken to market.\n  This amendment will effectively enact a roadless rule in the Tongass. \nIt would prevent access to more than 300,000 acres of unroaded timber \nbase in the areas that are open for timber harvest. Access to the small \namount that is available should not be denied because of this \namendment.\n  Data provided by the Forest Service shows at a minimum southeast \nAlaska will lose two mills and about 680 more jobs. These numbers will \nnot support the industry described if this amendment passes.\n  Law requires that a sufficient timber supply be provided to meet \nmarket demand. That was one of the basic considerations that came from \nthe 1990 Act. Current market demand is about 150 million board feet per \nyear in our own area. Under this amendment, we would harvest less than \n40 million board feet per year, bringing the industry to a standstill. \nI ask the Senate to reject this approach that would further renege on \nthe obligation to southeast Alaska to fulfill the commitments that were \nmade to Alaska and to southeastern Alaska under the Tongass plan.\n  Some of the Senators claim the Sununu amendment is about our fiscal \nresponsibility to ensure taxpayers are not subsidizing the Tongass \ntimber industry. But this is not about fiscal responsibility.\n  National environmental groups have spent millions appealing and \nlitigating timber sales in the Tongass National Forest, causing program \ncosts to soar and the number of sales to collapse. Almost 75 percent of \nall the costs associated with timber sales in the Tongass National \nForest are spent on NEPA, appeals based on that Act, and litigation. \nThe remaining 25 percent is the actual preparation and administration \nof a sale, including the building of roads.\n  Compliance with NEPA and other Federal laws and responses to appeals \nand litigation currently total about $110 per thousand board feet, or \n$110,000 per million board feet.\n  Without these costs, timber sale preparation and administration for \nthe Tongass Forest would cost about $36 per thousand board feet. The \naverage timber sale generates about $42.5 per thousand board feet. \nWithout frivolous appeals and lawsuits, the Tongass timber program \nwould yield a reasonable profit margin and make money for U.S. \ntaxpayers.\n  Administrative appeals and litigation increase the cost of Tongass \ntimber sales exponentially compared with the rest of the United States. \nThe Forest Service estimates the timber sales in the Tongass are \nappealed and litigated more than four times that of timber sales in the \nnational forests in the lower 48. It is the cost of this litigation and \nthe cost of the environmental programs that are instilled by these \nextreme environmentalists that drive up the cost in the Tongass. Now \nthey say we should stop harvesting timber because of the cost. Despite \nextensive environmental review and public participation, the majority \nof the timber projects in the Tongass are appealed and/or litigated.\n  Taxpayers are not subsidizing the timber industry. Under the National \nForest Management Act, timber sale purchasers are required to \ncompetitively bid and pay market value for the sales they purchase. \nPurchasers also pay for all logging, transportation, and manufacturing \ncosts.\n  In addition, the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act mandates that \nnational forests be managed for multiple use benefits such as fish, \nwildlife, recreation, and clean water.\n  Ecological benefits include various land management objectives such \nas\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\nimproving forest health and reducing the risk of catastrophic fire.\n  All of those costs are what the environmental groups say are part of \nthe cost of the timber sale program. They are not. Seventy-five percent \nof all the costs have nothing to do with harvesting timber. They have \nto do with the attacks of extreme environmental groups that now bring \nthis amendment to say you cannot use Federal money to build these \nroads, or even plan them, because it costs too much.\n  In the Tongass, timber sales also provide basic infrastructure, such \nas roads and docks. This infrastructure provides residents and visitors \nwith access to hunting, fishing, recreation, and wildlife viewing. The \nwhole spectrum of tourist activity in southeast Alaska is supported by \nthe roads constructed. Some roads constructed by timber sales serve as \nthe basic road system between communities and ferry terminals, which \nare the water highways of the island communities of southeast Alaska.\n  That area has no roads. Even our capital cannot be reached by road. \nThis is an island area. It must have roads basically from the edge of \nthe water to the area available for harvesting which, by definition, is \nback away from the view shed that we keep along the water's edge to \nassure that tourists will have the proper view of the area.\n  I do believe these water highways between our southeastern islands \nare connected, in a way, by virtue of the forest roads that are \ndeveloped under these timber sale programs.\n  These timber sales provide benefits beyond revenues earned. Economic \nbenefits include new jobs, additional income for individuals and \nbusinesses. Basic tax receipts of this area depend on the harvesting of \ntimber in the Tongass.\n  The problem that I see now is that these communities have come to \nrely on timber sales not only for jobs but for their local economies. \nTimber sales revenues are important to local communities which receive \n25 percent of the proceeds of these sales for public schools and roads, \nas do all areas that have national forests. By prohibiting these roads \nwhich will kill the sales, in effect, the contribution that is brought \nabout by the laws that pertain to national forests will not be realized \nin Southeast Alaska because there won't be any harvest or 25 percent to \nsupport the schools that come out of the national program.\n  That program applies to the entire United States. The timber roads \nprogram applies to all States where there are national forests. In the \nyear 2004, the timber harvest for all 10 forest regions was about 2 \nbillion board feet. The gross receipts totaled $217 million and \nexpenditures amounted to over $268 million, and that number does not \ntake all costs into account.\n  The 1998 timber sale performance information reporting system found \nnet losses in 8 of the 10 forest regions. Some States may be able to \nshow a profit or even break even, but clearly the national timber sale \nprogram does not.\n  As a matter of law and policy, national forest managers are required \nto behave differently from private forest managers, so it does not make \nsense to judge their performance by private sector standards--profits.\n  If the Forest Service's goal was to maximize profits, contrary to the \nMultiple Use-Sustained Yield Act, the Forest Service would allow export \nof timber and sell it to the highest bidder worldwide in the global \neconomy. But that would essentially outsource all of the value-added \nforest products industry of the United States, putting local mills out \nof business, eliminating jobs, and leaving local communities with few \nalternatives for revenue. Given our current economic climate, the \nUnited States cannot afford that policy.\n  I want to share a quote from President Roosevelt. Senator Murkowski \nmentioned he established the Tongass National Forest. I think it is \nrelevant today. He said:\n\n        . . . First and foremost, you can never afford to forget \n     for a moment what is the object of our forest policy. That is \n     not to preserve forests because they are beautiful, though \n     that is good in itself, not because they are refuges for the \n     wild creatures of the wilderness, though that too is good in \n     itself; but the primary object of our forest policy, as the \n     land policy of the United States, is the making of prosperous \n     homes.\n\n  This national forest concept was supposed to provide an alternative \nto the development of privately owned timber and be a yardstick for the \nmanagement of timber resources in our country.\n  The construction of timber roads is important for both the economic \nand environmental health of our forests. They provide access to timber \nused for wood, paper products, and home construction. They enable \ncitizens to access our forests for public recreation, and they enable \nForest Service employees to manage those forests for the public good.\n  The timber road program in Alaska is managed in the same manner as \nthe timber road program of every national forest in the United States. \nThe only difference in our case is we provide special protections, such \nas culverts, to ensure safe fish passage, and we protect the terrain. \nWe have learned from the mistakes of the past. We do not build roads \nthe same as they do in other areas. We strive to strike a balance \nbetween conservation and economic development.\n  And now with this amendment, some Members of the Senate would \npenalize Alaska for doing the right thing. We have developed a basic \napproach to use our timber areas to protect other values besides timber \nharvests. We could seek to significantly reduce the amount of these \nprotections required for our timber road system, and we could \ndrastically reduce the funds required, but that would be inconsistent \nwith proper stewardship of our national forest lands.\n  Because only 1 percent of Alaska's lands are privately owned, it is \nimperative that the Federal Government allow us to use some of our \nresources on Federal lands. The Federal Government manages, by the way, \n235 million acres of Alaska's land.\n  We have a long, proud history as responsible stewards of our natural \nresources. Alaskans will always manage our lands in a way that ensures \nits vitality. Timber is a renewable resource. It can be--and will be--\nmanaged as such under the Tongass land management plan.\n  Much of Alaska will remain pristine wilderness. We have set aside a \ntremendous amount of it. But we need some certainty that we will be \nable to harvest small portions of the forest which are not already set \naside. We need to know we will be able to sustain the timber industry \ntoday with the assurances of the past. We need assurances that our \nefforts will not be met by more resistance, such as the frivolous \nlawsuits and amendments such as this.\n  In order to give our communities a chance to be prosperous, Congress \nshould allow the Tongass to be managed under the forest management plan \nwithout further unwarranted interference.\n  I remind the Senate, the same environmental groups that caused the \nTongass to lose money through frivolous litigation and stalling \ntactics, as I said, are now calling for an end to the timber program \nunder the guise of fiscal conservatism. It is disingenuous and \nduplicitous, and their approach is given sanction and credibility by \nthis amendment. This amendment should be defeated.\n  I do hope that our colleagues will consider this: Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense has repeatedly opposed Federal funds for the entire \nNational Forest System. They argue that 105 of the 111 national forests \nspend more money in the operation of forests than they collected \nthrough timber sales. They want us to meet the cost of all multiple use \nvalues the cost of recreation, the cost of conservation, the cost of \nprotecting wildlife--by the revenues coming in from the small amount of \nareas of the forest allowed to be harvested.\n  This group singled out several national forests as wasteful. I want \nto point out to the Senate that the Taxpayers for Common Sense attacked \nforests in California, Alaska, Montana, Oregon, Idaho, New Mexico, \nArizona, Colorado, Washington, and Utah. I urge the Senators involved \nin this amendment to consider this. Why single out Alaska? Why is it \nthat Alaskan roads cannot be built with Federal money? They are being \nbuilt in all these other national forests deemed wasteful.\n\n  I am surprised my colleagues from New Hampshire and New Mexico would \noffer this amendment in view of the conditions of the forests in their \nown States. According to the Wilderness Society, the Forest Service's \ntimber program in New Hampshire lost between $813,000 and $1.2 million. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nbeing attacked for something that does not exist in Alaska alone.\n  In New Mexico, the timber program lost between $365,000 and $414,000.\n  The same economics are applied to the Tongass Timber Programs as in \nall National Forests. The difference in Alaska is that four times as \nmany lawsuits are brought against Tongass timber sales than in the rest \nof the United States.\n  If this amendment is designed to protect the taxpayer, then \nrestrictions on Federal funds for timber roads should apply to all \nforests in every State. And I think special interests will come after \nthose other areas, if this amendment is passed.\n  I call this an ill-conceived amendment. I urge it not be adopted. It \nwould add weight to the logic embraced by Taxpayers for Common Sense \nwho have attacked, as I said, almost every forest in the United States. \nIt will send us down a slippery slope by setting a precedent for \nhalting road programs in national forests.\n  The roads designed and built by the Forest Service are in the best \ninterests of the Nation because they protect all the values of the \nmultiple-use concept of our national forests. This is not only \nimportant to the timber industry, but it is important to millions of \nAmericans who rely on roads for access to national forests.\n  I do not want to encourage environmental groups to continue waging \nfrivolous lawsuits in the hopes of making timber programs throughout \nthe United States too expensive to continue. What they are doing is \nincreasing the costs. Again, I point out, 75 percent of the costs in \nAlaska are involved in compliance with the National Environmental \nPolicy Act and the appeals and litigation that ensue whenever the \nForest Service offers a timber sale in the Tongass.\n  Adopting this amendment would unfairly and unjustly distinguish one \nState--our State--sending a sobering message to Alaskans: Despite \nCongress's statements and actions in the past, a Senator voting for \nthis amendment will be telling Alaskans that their economic well-being \nis secondary to special interests, and when push comes to shove, \nCongress will forget about the commitments of the past, forget about \nthe promises of the past, and move to satisfy this extreme \nenvironmental movement that is the basic cause of the problem as far as \nthe forests are concerned.\n  If Congress chooses to adopt this amendment, none of our forests are \nsafe. No forest can afford to sit idly by. These special interest \ngroups are designing ways to destroy an important Federal program based \non spurious allegations with regard the economics involved. Those \neconomics are affected more by the environmental movement, which is \nchallenging most timber sales in the Tongass, than by the forest \nactions themselves.\n  Above all, I ask the Senate to remember that this amendment goes back \non congressional promises made to Alaska. In exchange for withdrawing \nover 100 million acres of land for parks, refuges, and forests, \nincluding 17 million acres in Tongass National Forest, Congress \npromised that it would leave intact sufficient land to maintain a \nrobust timber industry in Alaska.\n  Unlike the timber industry in other States, Alaska's timber industry \nis reliant on the Tongass, which comprises 90 percent of Southeast \nAlaska. Only 676,000 acres are currently open for timber harvesting.\n  Since 1980, jobs in the Alaskan timber industry have shrunk from over \n3,000 to less than 500 today. We have only four small family-owned \ntimber mills left.\n  This amendment is not about fiscal responsibility, it is a back-door \nattack on the timber industry to benefit this extreme environmental \nmovement.\n  As I said, 75 percent of the timber sale cost is from NEPA, the \nNational Environmental Protection Act, compliance, appeals, and \nlitigation. Without those, the Tongass would make a 13-percent profit.\n  Many of the national forests in the United States have monetary \nreturns per dollar invested, which is less than the rate of return of \nthe Tongass, and they are not considered at all in connection with this \namendment. This amendment would set a precedent that litigation can \nmake the cost of timber programs in all national forests too expensive \nto continue.\n  If this amendment was really about fiscal responsibility, then all \nnational forests would be included. Most of the timber programs \nthroughout the United States--as I said, 8 out of 10 of them--are not \nprofitable. In fact, according to the Forest Service--and I close with \nthis point--the Tongass is one the best managed forests in the Nation. \nIt has one of the lowest costs per acre, including the timber program.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak on my amendment. I had an \nopportunity to present more complete remarks last night so I will try \nto speak briefly this evening.\n  I appreciate the work of both Senators from Alaska and understand \nthat this is naturally an issue of great personal interest and \ncommitment for them.\n  I wanted to address briefly a few of the general remarks that were \nmade, especially those, for obvious reasons, that referred to me. \nFirst, I do not think I have ever been accused of being an extreme \nenvironmentalist. I certainly do not consider myself an extreme \nenvironmentalist.\n  In that regard, I believe one simply has to look at the basic premise \nof this amendment. It does not create a new wilderness designation. For \nmy part, I have opposed President Clinton's roadless initiative. I have \nsupported the multiuse concept in national forest land across the \nentire country and will continue to do so. So I just do not think it is \nfair or appropriate to throw around a label like that cavalierly, and I \ntrust that it was not meant that way.\n  Second, I emphasize the point that from my perspective, this is about \nfiscal responsibility and fiscal restraint.\n  The suggestion was made a number of times that it was not. Frankly, I \ndo not think that is quite appropriate because it suggests a set of \nmotives that just are not there.\n  One does not have to go any further than the amendment I offered last \nweek to the Energy bill to strike some of the more egregious taxpayer \nsubsidies in that Energy legislation or my vote against the highway \nbill that broke the budget or my vote against a prescription drug bill \nthat we knew then and we know now had costs far in excess of its \nprescribed $400 billion or my vote against the Energy bill in its final \nform today. I believe it is fair to stand on my record that the votes I \nhave cast, the amendments I have offered of this type that have dealt \nwith taxpayer subsidies, have all been motivated by one thing and one \nthing only, and that is doing what I believe is appropriate and right \nwhen we are handling taxpayer resources.\n  In the case of the support and the subsidies that go to private \nlogging firms, I believe we have to draw a line somewhere. When we look \nat the Tongass and see $49 million in costs for a timber program that \nyields for the taxpayers $800,000 in revenues, something is not right. \nThe opponents of the amendment will say: Well, only $15 million, $20 \nmillion, or $25 million is going directly for the cost of building \nroads. But in my book, $25 million for $800,000 in revenue is still a \npretty bad deal.\n  There are a lot of reasons listed for the high cost of a timber \nprogram on the national forests, and I am very sympathetic to many of \nthe concerns raised: high legal costs, an unbearable bureaucracy, \nregulatory costs associated with not just completing, in some cases, \nredundant environmental studies but then defending them in court. I am \nwilling and I have voted in the past to support efforts to deal \ndirectly with those costs and to support efforts to allow appropriate \nconsideration, but deliberate consideration, of those challenges. I \nwill continue to do so.\n  Because there are such things as frivolous lawsuits that are in the \npipeline does not justify a $15 million subsidy or a $25 million \nsubsidy or a $35 million subsidy or a $48 million subsidy. The subsidy \nitself cannot and should not be used to defend or respond to bad \nbehavior in other ways. So we need to fight those costs, the legal \nabuses, and burdensome environmental regulations\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\nthat are not appropriately applied, but those issues are separate from \nthe question of whether we should use taxpayer funds to subsidize the \nconstruction of roads to support private timber firms.\n  Again, I come back to the basic point that this is about fiscal \nresponsibility. When I hear that phrase, ``this is not about fiscal \nresponsibility,'' it really has to be read as questioning my motives \nor, frankly, the motives of any of those who are supporting this \namendment. I do not think the Senate floor is the appropriate place for \nthat kind of a question.\n  The facts are pretty straightforward. In fiscal year 2004, the timber \nprogram on the Tongass cost $49 million, and $800,000 was yielded in \nrevenues. That does not mean that profitability as applied to a private \nfirm should be the standard for any multiuse effort or any effort to \nharvest timber on national forest lands because we know national forest \nlands are unique, and we know that the Forest Service has to be \ninvolved in doing things that many private timber firms either cannot \nor would not be asked to do in the private sector. So I recognize that.\n  The Senator from Alaska made a point that the loss in New Hampshire \nin the timber program was about $800,000. If so, I would hope that over \ntime we can do better than that in my state, but there is a big \ndifference between $800,000 and $48 million. The disparity of cost or \nthe costs associated per million board feet taken out are similarly \nquite significant, the loss per million board feet in New Hampshire \nbeing approximately one-third of that in the Tongass in data that I \nhave seen.\n  So profit should not be the standard, but at the same time it is hard \nfor me to justify taxpayers paying the cost of the roads. I do not \nthink asking private firms to pay for the cost of building the roads to \naccess the timber they purchase is too much of a burden to bear.\n  Finally, with regard to the multiuse concept that was mentioned, I \nstrongly support the development and application of forest plans that \nare put together locally using local stakeholders. It has been very \nsuccessful in New Hampshire. I imagine it has been successful in other \nparts of the country. In New Hampshire, we enjoy national forest lands \nfor recreation, hunting, fishing, economic interests, and a timber \nmanagement program. But even where multiple use is concerned, we need \nto strike a balance, a balance between the taxpayers' interest and a \nbalance between the long-term health of the forest itself. Where the \ntaxpayers are concerned, a subsidy of $45 million or $48 million per \nyear, stretching as far as the eye can see at this particular time, is \nunnecessary.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. I hope this at least \ncan lay the foundation for looking at subsidies not just in this \nindustry but in other areas with a little bit of a sharper eye. At a \ntime when we have $300 billion or $400 billion deficits, I do not think \nthere is any area of the budget that does not deserve tougher scrutiny.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to respond \nto several of the remarks raised by my colleague from New Hampshire. I \nstart off my comments by stating very clearly it was certainly not my \nintention, nor do I believe it was the intention of Senator Stevens, to \nquestion motives or to imply somehow our colleague is an environmental \nextremist.\n  If, in fact, that was perceived from the remarks, that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire falls in that category, again from my perspective \nthat was not my intention, and I certainly would not want him to think \nthat I have put him in that category of those who, as the Senator from \nOregon indicated, are engaged in ``professional environmental \nconflict,'' I think was the terminology he used.\n  I do wish to speak very briefly to a couple of the issues. The \nSenator from New Hampshire indicated that he was not, through his \namendment, proposing any addition of wilderness designation. He stated \nthat was not his intent. I understand that is not the intent. However, \nthe practical effect, if we were to withhold any Federal dollars, any \nopportunity for Federal revenues to come in and help with the road \nbuilding in that area, that would be the practical effect in the \nTongass. It would put off limits those areas to any harvesting of the \ntimber. If we cannot build a road in there, the harvesting will not \nhappen.\n  As the Senator from Oregon mentioned, we are dealing with an \nincredible land mass. The acreage in the Tongass is 17.8 million acres. \nAs has been said many times this evening, the area we are talking about \nthat would be available for development is a small fraction of that. \nJust 4 percent of that would be available for any form of development, \nbut still, if one is not able to put a road in, if they are not able to \naccess the area, the harvesting does not happen, and in effect what is \nbeing created is an off-limits area, off-limits to development, off-\nlimits to recreational use, off-limits to pretty much anything.\n  I was born in the Tongass. I was born in Ketchikan. At the time that \nI was born, Ketchikan was a very thriving timber community. The Tongass \nis not a place where one just goes to take a walk. It is an old growth \nforest that is as tangled and deep a forest as one can possibly \nimagine.\n  So those who would say, We want to make sure we have access to the \nTongass for recreational purposes, the way that one is able to access \nfor recreational purposes is through the roads that have been built as \nwe have harvested in certain areas. My family goes out there and we \nwant to use the area for hunting, but we do not go off the beaten track \nbecause it cannot be accessed. The animals are not in the areas that \nhave not been cleared, to a certain extent. So for those who will \nengage in the multiple use of the Tongass, these roads are significant.\n  The statement was made that those of us who are in opposition to this \namendment are saying that this really is not about the fiscal issue. I \nguess I have to just stop on that one and say, okay, if we really are \nlooking at this from a cost perspective and we are looking to minimize \nthe extent of Federal dollars going out and to be as cost efficient as \nwe possibly can, why are we just looking at the Tongass alone? If what \nwe are really talking about is to get those efficiencies, to make sure \nwe do not have unnecessary subsidies, then tell me why this is just \nabout one national forest in 1 State out of all of the 50 States. \nBecause we are not going to balance the budget on what is happening in \nthe Tongass in terms of the dollars that go out there.\n  I wish to speak just a little bit to the dollars. My colleague has \nindicated that the Tongass spent $49 million on its logging program and \nthe logging roads in 2004. The total budget to operate the Tongassis is \n$49 million. In fact, the timber program on the Tongass cost $22.5 \nmillion. He has also indicated that the timber revenues on the Tongass \nin 2004 were $800,000. In fact, the timber revenues were nearly $2 \nmillion. So it is important to make sure we are using the right \nnumbers.\n  Let us just look at what that $49 million buys us. Is this all about \nroads? No, it is not. Now, the road maintenance is an aspect of that, \nbut it is also for bridge and road construction unrelated to timber \nharvesting, other engineering projects. The work that the Forest \nService does in the Tongasssupports subsistence harvest, the fish and \nwildlife, basically keeping the grocery store open for thousands of \nrural Alaskans.\n  Senator Stevens mentioned the fish culverts that are inserted to \nallow for the fish passage. We build those so fish can get to where \nthey need to get. It is one of those things we do to make sure we are \ncaring for the environment and are good stewards.\n\n  We developed an invasive species strategy to help prevent the \nnonnative plants from coming in and taking over, as we are seeing in \nsome parts of the lower 48.\n  Basically, the bottom line is these dollars that are going out are \nnot all directed at road building. They are dollars spent on \nrecreation, visitor service, heritage, wilderness, minerals, \nvegetation, watershed, subsistence, wildlife, fish habitat, fire \nsuppression, and land acquisition. And administrative costs are \nincluded in there, as well. So when we look to the Tongass and those \ncosts, we must put it into perspective.\n  I spent a few minutes in my previous remarks looking at the costs per \nacre on other national forests across the 50 States, what is the dollar \nreturn on\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\nyour investment if we are trying to make that connection. These are \nimportant to recognize. What is very important to recognize is the \nTongass is not so way out of whack in terms of its management and its \ncosts that it should be sending off signals and red flags. In fact, my \ncolleague from Alaska has indicated the Tongass has been singled out \nand has been declared the best managed national forest in the system. \nThat ought to count for something.\n  For my colleagues who are saying this is simply a fiscal issue and we \nneed to look at it from the numbers perspective, let's look at it from \nthe numbers perspective. Let's use the right numbers, but let's also \nrecognize there is something terribly wrong with an amendment that \npulls one national forest out of all of our national forests and says: \nThere is too much going to you; we have to shut it off.\n  Folks, that is not right. It is not fair. I certainly hope my \ncolleagues, when we have an opportunity to take this up in the Senate, \nvote down this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, many States, especially those in the West, \nare dominated by Federal lands. For those States, and many others, the \nInterior appropriations bill is a singularly important piece of \nlegislation because of the funding it provides for our public land \nagencies.\n  Take Nevada, for instance. While my State contains nearly 71 million \nacres within its borders, 61 million of those are managed by Federal \nagencies. That's 86 percent of my State, or nearly 9 out of every 10 \nacres. And if that number doesn't get your attention, consider the fact \nthat two out of every three acres in Nevada are controlled by one \nFederal agency: the Bureau of Land Management.\n  I offer these statistics to highlight the significance of today's \ndebate. While the Department of Interior may not be the center of \nattention in some areas of our country, in the West, the agencies \nfunded under this bill have a measurable impact on our quality of life, \nour access to public resources, and the protection of our greatest \npublic assets.\n  Senator Burns and Senator Dorgan have done a good job crafting this \nbill. We all know that this year is especially tough in terms of \noverall funding allocations and that some tough decisions had to be \nmade. Considering the constraints they faced, these two senators have \nproduced impressive legislation. I commend them for the time and effort \nthat they and the rest of the committee have put into this bill.\n  Particularly, I am pleased that the committee funded a number of \npriority projects in Nevada. One of the key projects that this bill \nprovides funds for is the construction and improvement of the Jarbidge \nCanyon Road. This road in northern Elko County washed out over 10 years \nago and has been a major source of controversy ever since.\n  With the funding that the committee has helped provide, we will \nfinally be able to bring resolution to the issue in a way that ensures \ngreater access to our public lands while also protecting a threatened \npopulation of bull trout and shielding the road against future floods. \nThis is a win-win situation for sportsmen, for the county, for the U.S. \nForest Service, and for local residents.\n  I am also pleased that the committee saw fit to provide funding for a \nnumber of sewer and water projects that are difficult and often \nimpossible for small and rural communities to fund on their own. Even \nin some of Nevada's larger population areas, the amount of Federal land \nin those areas still makes raising funds for these projects very \ndifficult. So I thank the committee for their efforts to provide EPA \ngrant funding.\n  I also want to recognize their efforts to increase funding for the \nPayment-In-Lieu-of-Taxes program. ``PILT,'' as the program is popularly \nknown, provides millions of essential dollars to Nevada's counties each \nyear. Without these funds, the provision of basic local government \nservices such as law enforcement and street repairs would be severely \ndiminished. I look forward to the day when we will fu1ly fund this \nprogram and finally live up to the responsibilities we have to our \nrural counties.\n  I am also strongly supportive of the increased funding levels \ncontained in this bill for the National Endowment for the Arts, the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities, and the Historic Preservation \nFund. As our distinguished friend Senator Byrd has taught us on so many \noccasions, life can be not only enriched but measurably improved by a \nfuller understanding of our history, our cultural roots, and our common \nheritage. These programs deserve our respect and our support.\n  Before I close, let me remark briefly that we have a profound \nresponsibility this year, and every year, to make sure that our public \nlands and our public resources are properly managed. As the demand for \nhealthy outdoor recreation grows, so too must our commitment to proper \nstewardship.\n  I am concerned that in all too many places, budgets for agencies such \nas the BLM and the Park Service have stagnated or shrunk while the \noverall usage of our public resources has skyrocketed. The Lake Mead \nNational Recreation Area, for instance, now sees nearly 8 million \nvisitors a year, a strong increase from 10 years ago. But this same \npark has lost 40 rangers and support staff positions since 2002. We \nneed to solve this and similar problems before our greatest natural \ntreasures are lost or permanently compromised.\n  I look forward to a healthy debate on this bill and I hope Democrats \nhave a chance to offer their amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1052\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bill under consideration on the Senate \nfloor is intended to provide appropriations for the Department of \nInterior. Unfortunately, we were forced by circumstances to shift our \nfocus during the course of debating this bill to consideration of an \nemergency issue which faces our Nation that relates to funding for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. This is because the President's budget \ndid not provide enough funds to provide quality health care to veterans \nacross America during the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs admitted to Congress \nthat its budget for the current fiscal year will be at least $1 billion \nshort of the amount needed. Part of the reason for this is reportedly \nthat the Department based its budget needs on faulty estimates. \nReportedly, the VA thought it would see a 2.3-percent increase in \npatient demand for services. In reality, they have experienced \nincreases of 5.2 percent. In other words, the Bush administration \nmiscalculated. Their estimate of veteran patient load was less than \nhalf of what actually proved to be the case.\n  Senator Patty Murray of Washington has been our leader on this issue. \nRepeatedly in the Committee on the Budget and in the Senate she has \nsaid the Veterans' Administration was not asking for enough resources \nto take care of the veterans from other wars and the returning soldiers \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan. She spoke at length in the Senate about the \nmany opportunities we have had in the Senate over the last few months \nfor the Bush administration officials to state their true budget needs. \nThey repeatedly said they needed no more money this year. Now, \nbelatedly, they admit they are at least $1 billion short of what they \nreally need.\n  With the Murray amendment that Senator Byrd is joining and offering, \nthe Senate has an opportunity to address this serious shortfall and to \nprovide to America's veterans the real resources they need and deserve. \nOne of the medical services that unquestionably, indeed, desperately \nneeds funds is the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. The war \nin Iraq is producing a new generation of American veterans whose wounds \nare invisible. Already, we see recently returned veterans with \ndepression, anxiety, substance abuse, and post traumatic-stress \ndisorder.\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\n  As our men and women come home from battle, we must be ready to give \nthem the help they need, the help they deserve, the help we promised. I \nhave noted on numerous occasions the special need for additional VA \ncapacity to treat returning veterans suffering from PTSD. Last year, \nthe New England Journal of Medicine published data showing that roughly \none in every six returning Iraqi veterans will likely suffer this \ndebilitating mental health condition. With the number of troops having \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan now exceeding 1.1 million, it is \nabsolutely clear--it has been clear for some time now--that the VA is \ngoing to see a big increase in the need for post-traumatic stress \ndisorder treatment. Even the toughest warriors can have troubled \nfeelings following the stress of combat. It is no sign of weakness. It \nis no sign of cowardice. It certainly is no sign of failure.\n  Frankly, they need to ask for help, and we need to give it. All our \nveterans need to know that services are available to them and they \nshould not be ashamed to use them. Unfortunately, the VA's current \ncapacity to help them is lacking. The Government Accountability Office \nreported last September that officials at six out of seven VA medical \nfacilities said they may not be able to meet an increase in demand for \nPTSD services. Their own internal committee has made repeated \nrecommendations about the need to expand PTSD treatment capability \nwithin the Department, but the GAO has also recorded that the Veterans' \nAdministration has not fully implemented any of these recommendations.\n  Given the failure of the VA to expand PTSD treatment, as its own \nexperts have advised, given the failure of the VA to adequately see the \ncoming increase in patient need, given the failure of the VA to budget \nfor its real requirements, it is time for Congress to do something, to \ntake strong corrective action.\n  I have introduced legislation to fill in the gaps in the VA's \ntreatment structure for PTSD to ensure that counselors and PTSD teams \nare available in every veteran center and VA hospital. But even before \nwe make these structural changes, we can provide the funding increases \nto prevent long delays in service. This amendment we will consider from \nSenator Murray and Senator Byrd is an important step toward that goal.\n  It is a sad fact under the Bush administration's leadership that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs has failed to adequately budget for the \nhealth care needs of American veterans. Sad, but it is true. Where the \nadministration has failed, Congress must step in and correct the \nproblem. This amendment will help fill the gap.\n  In less than 20 minutes, President Bush will be speaking to America. \nHe will be talking about the situation in Iraq. He will give his speech \nin the company of some of the best and bravest men and women who serve \nin our Armed Forces. He will undoubtedly say to them, on behalf of all \nMembers, that we stand behind them. His words will be heartfelt and \nthey will truly represent the way we feel about the men and women in \nuniform. But our commitment to soldiers and to veterans has to go \nbeyond statements on television. It has to go beyond speeches. It has \nto go beyond some of the things that are left in the Congressional \nRecord each day as a tribute. It has to be shown in our deeds.\n\n  We will have a chance with the Murray amendment to put the necessary \nfunds in the Veterans' Department so that the hospitals and clinics \nacross America can help our veterans from other wars and our soldiers \ncoming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. The assistance which they need \ncan help right now. The longer a soldier is troubled, the longer a \nsoldier suffers from PTSD and the stress and anxiety and depression \nthat comes with it, the more difficult it is for them to finally break \naway and to return to a normal life. Quick, professional care is \nnecessary.\n  Don't look beyond the fact that many of these soldiers have spouses \nand children who are affected by their problems. They need help, too. \nFamily therapy from VA should be part of this commitment.\n  As I traveled around Illinois a few months back and met with the \nsoldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I was stunned. Some of \nthe youngest, strongest, best-looking soldiers who returned, men and \nwomen, who appeared to have no concerns at all, back at home in \ncivilian life, were struggling with demons inside, demons that were \ncreated by things that they saw, things that they did, things that they \nwere exposed to which many of us, thank God, will never have to see. We \nneed to help them. We need to make sure that our commitment to them \ngoes beyond a cheer, goes beyond a kind word, goes to the deeds that \nare necessary to prove our true commitment to the men and women in \nuniform.\n  This last group I spoke to was the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nConvention, a statewide convention in Illinois in the city of Peoria. \nIt was a good meeting. They were mainly veterans from other wars, from \nthe Persian Gulf, Vietnam, Korea, World War II. These were primarily \nmen but some women who had served our country and were coming together. \nTime and again, they asked us to not only stand behind our troops, but \nalso stand behind our veterans. They challenged me. They said: Senator, \nbe the best Senator we have ever had in this State for the veterans and \nsoldiers. I will try to show them that I can live up to the challenge.\n  With this amendment, the Murray amendment which I have supported \nbefore, and which now should pass, the Senate can go on record on a \nbipartisan basis saying we stand behind our soldiers and our veterans.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Let me say a word, Mr. President, about the President's speech this \nevening about the war in Iraq. Once again, it goes without saying that \nwe are all committed to the men and women in uniform. The last time \nthere was a supplemental appropriations bill on the floor that the \nPresident asked for, in the range of $81 billion, for the war in Iraq, \nit passed unanimously 100 to 0. I think that tells the story. Whether \nyou agreed with the President's policy beginning this war or disagreed, \nwe all agree that our men and women in uniform should have everything \nthey need to execute this war.\n  But it is a war unlike any that we fought in recent times. It is hard \nto claim territory and hold it. Fallujah, just a few months ago, was \nthe scene of great carnage, as American troops went in to root out the \ninsurgents and terrorists. We lost a lot of our wonderful soldiers in \nthat battle. They achieved their goal. They cleared out Fallujah. Yet, \njust a few days ago, we lost more soldiers in that same city; in this \ncase, several women soldiers who lost their lives in the terrorism that \nhas now become too commonplace. So claiming and holding territory is \nobviously very difficult in Iraq.\n  It is also difficult to identify an enemy that does not wear a \nuniform, does not stand in formation, and wreaks its havoc with these \nroadside bombs and other terrorist devices they use. It is a different \ntype of war.\n  We are concerned as well about the status of the Government in Iraq. \nIt is a government in formation. They are trying to put together a \nconstitution.\n  Two of my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan \nand Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Democrat and a Republican, sent a \nletter to the President to urge him, in his speech tonight, to make it \nclear to the Iraqis they have to hold fast to the timetables to form \ntheir own government and take responsibility for their own future. \nThose two Senators, one from each political party, said if they failed \nto do that, we had to make it clear to them that we would have to \nreassess our commitment in Iraq.\n  Those are strong words, bipartisan words, but I think they represent \nthe feelings of many Americans. We have done a great thing in Iraq in \nremoving Saddam Hussein. That was never the issue. The question, of \ncourse, was, what would happen afterward. We had a good plan to win the \nmilitary side of this conflict and to win the war. We did not have a \ngood plan to win the peace. More than 2 years after our invasion of \nIraq, more than 1,734 American soldiers have given their lives, more \nthan 13,000 have been gravely wounded. And, unfortunately, those \nnumbers will increase.\n  Tonight, the President will talk to us about his plan. If this, what \nwe have seen to date, is what the President's plan is in Iraq, we \nclearly need a much\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\ndifferent plan. We need a plan for success, a plan for victory, a plan \nthat will bring our troops home.\n  There is a feeling among many of us in this Chamber and across \nAmerica that we do not have that plan today. The President has to be \nhonest with us about the costs of this war, first in human terms and \nmost certainly in dollar terms. Some of our early allies have picked up \nand left--more burden on American soldiers, more burden on American \ntaxpayers.\n  Finally, this Congress needs to do its job, not just to provide the \nresources for those soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan but to also make \ncertain there is oversight. Yesterday, Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator \nLautenberg, and a few others, held a hearing from the Democratic Policy \nCommittee on Halliburton. Halliburton is, of course, one of the largest \ncontractors in Iraq. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of contracts \nhave gone their way without competitive bid and with precious little \noversight.\n  What Senator Dorgan and others have disclosed in the course of those \nhearings is nothing short of shameful. We should be holding every \ncontractor in Iraq accountable to produce good equipment, to produce \ngood armaments, to provide our troops with what they need to succeed \nand come home safely. But this Congress, dominated by the President's \npolitical party, is loathe to even raise these difficult questions. So \nwe have to hold a hearing on Monday mornings and hope that someone will \nnotice as whistleblowers come forward and talk about some of the \nscandals that are occurring with the contractors in Iraq.\n  Congress has dropped the ball. We have a responsibility, regardless \nof who is in the White House and what political party he might belong \nto, to accept our congressional responsibility to ask hard questions.\n  President Harry Truman knew that. When he was a Senator from \nMissouri, he was the one asking the hard questions of Franklin \nRoosevelt's Democratic administration during World War II: Were they \ndoing their job? Was there profiteering? Were there people taking \nadvantage of taxpayers and our troops? Senator Truman was right with \nhis Truman commission. Unfortunately, in today's Congress, there is \nnothing coming out of the Republican side of the aisle to ask those \nhard questions, to make sure our troops get what they truly deserve.\n  So tonight we will hear from the President that our goal is still \ndemocracy in Iraq. It is a good goal. It is one I hope we can achieve. \nBut it is a difficult goal. And we have to understand that the Iraqis \nhave premier responsibility for their own future.\n  Mr. President, 140,000 or 150,000 American troops, with their lives \non the line every day in Iraq, remind us that we went into this war \nwithout a plan on how it would end, without an exit strategy. I hope \nthe President will spell that out with some detail this evening. I am \nnot expecting him to say there will be a timetable for withdrawal. He \nhas already said he is not in favor of that. But we need to know what \nhis plan for success will be.\n  Tomorrow, when we vote on this amendment on the Interior bill on the \nVA funding, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure for our \nveterans and for our soldiers. We must appropriate the funds the VA \nneeds to provide our veterans the health care they deserve, to treat \nboth the lasting battle scars that can be seen and those battle scars \nthat remain invisible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1038, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I call for the regular order in relation \nto amendment No. 1038.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I, at the outset, thank both Senator \nBingaman and Senator Thomas for their willingness to sponsor this \namendment, which is an important amendment for counties, especially in \nthe western part of the United States where so much of our land is held \nin the hands of the Federal Government.\n  I would like to underscore the importance of the Payment in Lieu of \nTaxes Program. PILT funds are Federal payments to local governments. We \nall understand that property taxes are the main source of revenue for \nlocal governments. Anyone who has spent any time at all in Colorado or \nin the West will recognize that local governments there do not have a \ntax base because the Federal Government owns huge tracts of land in our \nStates. In my State alone, approximately one-third of Colorado is owned \nby the Federal Government.\n  Earlier this spring, in my first Senate trip around our great State, \nI held meetings with local-elected officials. Time and time again, \nthese local-elected officials--mayors and county commissioners--\ninformed me about the importance of full PILT funding and that it is \ntheir No. 1 priority.\n  Sadly, PILT has never been fully funded by this Congress. Congress \nregularly shortchanges local governments with Federal lands by \nappropriating less than the authorized levels. To that end, one of the \nfirst bills I introduced as a U.S. Senator would make full funding of \nPILT a mandatory priority for this Congress every year.\n  In 2005, more than $226 million was distributed to approximately \n1,850 local governments in 49 of our 50 States whose jurisdictions \ncontain tax-exempt Federal lands. In my State of Colorado, over $16 \nmillion was paid to local communities for over 2.3 million acres of \ntax-exempt Federal lands. These funds have been used to help improve \nlocal schools, water, and road systems.\n  President Bush's budget request cut PILT funding for 2006 by $27 \nmillion. Fortunately, Congress has responded forcefully to that \nrequest. The House of Representatives passed a bill with $242 million \nfor PILT funding, and the good work of the Appropriations subcommittee \nin the Senate has gotten us to $235 million, which is the proposal in \nthis bill.\n  My amendment would increase PILT funding to $242 million from the \ncurrent level of $235 million in the Interior appropriations bill. That \nincrease would be offset with $7 million from the Department of \nInterior's overhead funds.\n  Earlier this afternoon, I spoke with Interior Secretary Norton and \nwith Senators Burns and Dorgan about my amendment and my strong desire \nto see PILT funding as close to full authorization levels as possible. \nI appreciate the consideration that Senators Burns and Dorgan have \ngiven to my amendment and to the importance of the issue of PILT. I \nknow they will represent the hopes and needs of rural counties in the \nconference committee and will work to ensure that the conference report \nis at least at the House level of $242 million for PILT.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, whatever our position on the Iraq war, we \nshould all be concerned that the President does not have a winning \nstrategy on Iraq. Our current strategy is not working, and Congress and \nthe American people know it. I say this with sorrow and regret for our \ntroops, for their families, and for our country.\n  Administration officials repeatedly claim that the insurgents are \ndesperate, dead-enders, and in their last throes. The American people \nknow they are not. Secretary Rumsfeld insists progress has been solid. \nWith American casualties currently averaging nearly three a day, the \nAmerican people know it is not. Secretary Rumsfeld insists the Army is \nnot being stretched to the breaking point, but month after month \nrecruiting goals go unmet and generals are sounding the alarm. \nSecretary Rumsfeld insists that we are not in a quagmire. The American \npeople believe we are.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld says the administration is not painting a rosy \npicture. The American people know that they are. By last June, after \nthe President declared mission accomplished, 852 American \nservicemembers had been killed in action. Today, the number has doubled \nto more than 1,700. By last June, 5,000 American servicemembers had \nbeen wounded in action. Today, the number has nearly tripled to over \n13,000. A year ago, the United States had 34 coalition partners in \nIraq. Today, we have just 25, and another 5 are scheduled to pull out \nby the end of the year.\n  The administration has been consistently wrong about Iraq. The \nAmerican people know things are not going well and that we need to \ncorrect the course we are on. The administration statements do not \nsquare with reality, and the credibility gap continues to widen. It is \nironic that Americans are learning\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\nthe truth not from our own administration but from an ally. The truth \nshould come from the White House and not Downing Street.\n  More than anything else, what America hopes to hear from the \nPresident tonight is the unvarnished truth of what is really going on \nin Iraq, how he plans to put a new strategy in place and assure \nsuccess. He needs to clearly articulate our goals, the benchmarks for \nmeasuring progress, and the game plan to win. When President Bush \naddresses the Nation tonight, all of us hope he will state a new and \nmore realistic and more effective strategy for the United States to \nsucceed in Iraq.\n  Our current strategy is not worthy of the sacrifices our men and \nwomen in uniform are making. The war has clearly made America less safe \nin the world. It has strengthened the support for al-Qaida and made it \nharder to win the real war against terrorism, the war against al-Qaida.\n  The President needs an effective strategy to accelerate the training \nof a capable Iraqi security force. The President needs an effective \nstrategy to rescue the faltering reconstruction effort, create new \njobs, new hope for the Iraqi people, and neutralize the temptation to \njoin the insurgents. The President needs an effective strategy to bring \nthe international community into Iraq and to achieve the adoption on \nschedule of a constitution that protects all the people of Iraq. He \nneeds an effective strategy to give our troops the equipment they need \nto fight the war and to ensure that veterans returning from Iraq have \naccess to the quality health care services they so richly deserve. He \nneeds an effective strategy to repair the damage the war has caused to \nour military and to our reputation in the world.\n  Realism is hard medicine to swallow. President Bush must face the \nfacts and accept them. Our men and women in uniform deserve no less. \nOur strategy is not working, and I hope the President will outline a \nwinning strategy this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7513-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another matter, we all wish the very \nbest to Chief Justice Rehnquist. He has made the quality of the Federal \ncourts the special mission of his leadership, and the Nation and \njudiciary are grateful for that leadership. Hopefully, he will continue \nto serve as long as he wishes and is able.\n  In the event of a resignation, a new Justice should be someone who is \ncommitted to the rule of law and the rights and freedoms of all \nAmericans and can therefore win broad support in the Senate and the \nNation. Like many Presidents before him, the President can easily \nchoose such a nominee if he follows the constitutional requirement that \nhe obtain the Senate's advice as well as its consent. I hope President \nBush chooses the path of consultation and consensus and not the path of \nconfrontation and conflict.\n  The Constitution requires the Senate to be an independent check on \nthe President, especially in protecting the independence and fairness \nof our judges. The Founders very deliberately made the appointment of \nFederal judges a shared responsibility of the Senate and the President. \nIt is ridiculous for some on the other side to claim that the Founders \nwould not have wanted such consultation to occur. In fact, the Founders \ncame within a hair's breath of assigning the entire responsibility for \nappointing judges to the Senate. It was a last-minute compromise at the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 that gave the \nresponsibility to the President but only with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee has clearly pointed \nout, the advice function is as important as the consent function in the \nexercise of the shared power of the President and the Senate in \nappointing judges and Justices. Presidents all the way back to George \nWashington and right up to Bill Clinton have consulted with the Senate \non Supreme Court nominations, and when they have done so the result has \nbeen a better Supreme Court.\n  The wise procedure was made even more explicit in the memorandum of \nunderstanding written by the 14 Senators from both parties last month \nwhen they urged the President to consult with Members of both parties \nin the Senate. Why are some of our Republican colleagues in the Senate \nso opposed to such consultation? Do they fear that if the President \nseeks the advice of a broad range of Senators, he may be persuaded to \nmake a consensus nomination to the Supreme Court? Are they against \nconsensus? Do they see the Supreme Court nominations merely as \npolitical footballs in their political games? Before any person can be \nappointed to the Federal court, the Senate and the President have to \nagree that the person will be best for the whole country, not just for \na narrow ideological and radical faction.\n  Some Presidents have ignored the requirement to obtain the advice of \nthe Senate, but no President can avoid the requirement to obtain the \nconsent of the Senate. I certainly hope President Bush will not heed \nthose who think consultation and consensus are obsolete. Whether the \nconfirmation process goes smoothly will be determined by the \nPresident's selection.\n  He can pick judges with us as the Founders wanted or he can pick \nfights with us as some of his political advisers and Senate friends \nseem to want.\n  The President's choice is clear. He could follow the Constitution and \nseek the advice of the Senate before he makes a nomination. If he does \nthat, the confirmation process is more likely to be expeditious, \nconstructive, and a unifying force for the entire Nation. Or he can \nlisten only to the advice of the fringe factions of his own party, \npeople so extreme they have even called for the impeachment of six of \nthe current nine Justices because those Justices refuse to bow to the \nideological dictates of the rightwing. If he does that, the \nconfirmation process will be divisive and corrosive and likely \nunsuccessful. There are hundreds if not thousands of excellent lawyers \nand judges who could be consensus choices for the Supreme Court, and \nSenators will help the President find them if he seeks our advice. If \nhe takes our bipartisan advice, he will have no trouble obtaining our \nbipartisan consent.\n  The next person who serves on the Supreme Court will not just serve \nfor the remainder of the Bush administration. The lives and freedoms \nand rights of our children and our grandchildren may well be directly \naffected by the decisions of that Justice in the coming decades. For \ntheir sake and the Nation's sake we cannot accept a choice based on \npartisan politics or ideological agendas. What the Court and the Nation \nneed is a demonstrated commitment to the rule of law and the basic \nvalues of our Constitution. I urge President Bush to listen to a \nrespected former Republican, Senator John Danforth:\n\n       If he truly wants to appoint a conservative he should make \n     sure it is a judicial conservative, someone who is going to \n     apply the law, not his political or philosophical beliefs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7513-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7513-S7516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENT BUSH'S IRAQ STATEMENT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, tonight, as we all know, President Bush is \ngoing to speak to the Nation about the situation in Iraq. I think that \nwe all have a pretty good sense of much of what he is going to say. He \nwill talk, as he should, about the extraordinary courage of our troops \nacross the world; he will talk, as he should, about the march of \ndemocracy; and he will speak with pride about Iraqi elections and the \nend of tyranny. He will stress, as we all share, the importance of the \nwar on terror. All of us in this Chamber stand in awe of the courage of \nour troops and all of us in this Chamber and in this country are \npassionate about democracy. But the fact is that honoring our troops \nand extolling the virtue of democracy, those words alone are not going \nto be enough to improve the situation and the reality of the perilous \ndirection that we are currently headed in Iraq. What we need are not \njust the words extolling the virtues of things with which we all agree. \nWhat we need is a policy that is going to address the complex and in \nsome ways self-inflicted predicament that we face today. The best way \nto honor troops, Mr. President, the best way to protect our troops, is \nto provide them with the best policy possible. The fact is that that is \nnot what we have today. Yesterday, I attended the funeral of \nChristopher Piper of Marblehead, MA, special\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\nforces, who died of wounds from an IED, and two other of his fellow \nsoldiers died previously in that same incident. The overwhelming \noutpouring of emotion and patriotism--kids holding flags along the \nsides of the streets, people, good citizens, patriots all, coming out \nto say goodbye to their native son--was moving beyond words.\n  Christopher Piper, and all of the soldiers like him currently serving \nand all those who will go over there, deserve a Government leadership \nthat makes the best decisions possible to be able to provide them the \ngreatest security possible to accomplish the mission as rapidly and \neffectively as possible.\n  Today, I regret to say, the experience in Iraq has proven again and \nagain to America and the world that we have no realistic comprehensive \nstrategy to reduce the risks to our soldiers and to achieve our goals. \nWhile our military has done--and continues to do--a superb job, our \ncivilian leadership has not, and our soldiers are paying the price \nevery single day. It is time for a realistic plan for success.\n  To achieve that plan, we have to begin by tearing down the wall of \narrogance. When the Vice President absurdly claims the insurgency is in \nits last throes, it insults the common sense and intelligence of the \nAmerican people, and he diminishes our stature in the world. How can we \nexpect the Iraqi people to take us seriously and do their part when the \nWhite House says the insurgency is fading, and yet Iraqis live in \nconstant fear--explosions waking them up in the night, reminding them \nof the danger inherent in a short walk to work or to school the next \nmorning.\n  I know that we should not dwell on mistakes. We need to understand, \nhowever, the consequences of the decisions we have made and our ability \nto effectively move forward because the only way you can move forward \nand have a comprehensive strategy is to understand where you have been. \nWith allies reading the Downing Street memo and the American people \nincreasingly aware that the rationalization for war changed midstream, \nit now becomes that much harder to rally the collective strength of the \nNation and the world to our cause.\n  We have to acknowledge the past in order to overcome it because the \ntruth is that, until this moment, the stubbornness of this \nadministration has made a difference. It hurts our chances for success. \nIt leads to frustrated expectations of Americans themselves. It makes \nit much more difficult for the Iraqi people to embrace the cause, and \nit makes it so much easier for sidelined nations to turn their back on \na common interest and say: OK, it is their deal, let them go solve it \nbecause they don't seem to understand it.\n  The bottom line is that when it comes to war and the safety of \nAmerican troops, there is no time for excuses. All of our troops \ndeserve the best we can provide, and they deserve it now. This is the \ntime for the administration to tell the truth about what is happening \non the ground and be open to new ideas about how we are going to get \nthe job done. Admitting mistakes is a necessary hurdle and a \nconstructive tool for this administration if it wants to build the \nstrength necessary to get it right in Iraq. Admitting mistakes paves \nthe way for elected officials and the American people to come together \nand to move forward. Admitting mistakes actually lays the groundwork \nfor the climate of cooperation that allows allies to add to our \nstrength. Admitting mistakes eases the concerns of the Iraqi people and \nhelps us make them understand that there will be no success unless they \nembrace the burden of their own future. And that includes acknowledging \nthat Iraq today is something that it was not before the war--a breeding \nground for jihadists. Today, there are 16,000 to 20,000 insurgents, and \nthe number of jihadists among them is growing, according to our own \nestimates. So this is a growing challenge, and we need to take \nimmediate steps to address it. Our officer corps reports that every \ntime our troops kill or capture an insurgent, there are three more who \njust step forward to take his place. That is not a compelling strategy \nfor success.\n  So I hope that tonight we hear something new from the President. I \nhope the President will recognize that the American people demand more \nthan a communications strategy--they demand real leadership, with real \ndecisions and real choices that provide a strategy for success and that \nget our troops home. If the President does this, he will begin to \nrestore the confidence of the American people and the respect of the \nworld. In showing real leadership, he will make it clear to the Iraqi \npeople that it is time for them to take the lead.\n  I also hope the American people understand that there still can be a \nplan for success in Iraq if we move quickly, if we make the right \nchoices, if we reach across the aisle for bipartisan effort, if we \nreach out to other nations. The mistakes that we have made do not \nchange the fact that our military is the most powerful and competent in \nthe world and that democracy is one of the world's most powerful ideas. \nThe mistakes do not change the fact that the Iraqi people understand, \nthrough the powerful memory of generations, that they have a unique \nopportunity to shape their own future. If the President finally opens \nto these new ideas and gets this right, tells the truth about the \ncomplex challenge, and the Iraqi people get serious about doing their \npart and bearing the burden, we can have the success that we need and \nseek in Iraq.\n  So what can the President say tonight to get things right in Iraq and \nput us on the road to success? The President can start by immediately \ndeclaring that the United States does not seek permanent bases or any \npermanent military presence in Iraq. Erasing suspicion of indefinite \noccupation is critical to eroding support for the insurgency. Getting \nthat right also means using the extraordinary leverage that we have to \nget the Iraqis to do their part. Our massive military presence is all \nthat stands between the Iraqi people and complete chaos. Our special \nforces are protecting Iraqi leaders. With this kind of leverage, it is \nnothing short of shocking that the administration allowed 6 months to \ngo by from the last election before including Sunnis in the political \nprocess. This was an obvious crucial prerequisite to success.\n  Yet there was no sense of urgency and minimal pressure applied. It is \ntime for the administration to use its leverage to insist that the \nIraqis do their part and establish a truly inclusive political process \nand meet the deadlines for finishing the Constitution and holding new \nelections in December. There can be no wavering from those dates.\n  Getting it right also means putting together a real plan for training \nIraqi troops and following through on it. This should be our top \npriority. It is the key to getting our troops home and avoiding a \nhumiliating withdrawal. It is time to move beyond fudging the numbers \nand finally put the training of Iraqi troops on a true 6-month wartime \nfooting. That includes ensuring that the Iraqi Government has the full \nbudget necessary to be able to deploy and continue the training.\n\n  It is also time to stop using the in-country training requirement as \nan excuse for refusing offers made by Egypt, Jordan, France, and \nGermany to do more. Why would we turn down the opportunity of other \ncountries to help us do more? Why would we turn down the opportunity to \nbe able to give our troops the relief they deserve?\n  Getting it right also means drawing up a detailed plan--a real plan, \nshared with the Congress of the United States--with the clear milestone \nof transfer of military and police responsibilities to the Iraqis after \nthe December elections.\n  The administration's plan should take into account both political and \nsecurity objectives, including Iraqi force structure and capacity, and \nit should be specifically tied to a series of specific tasks and \nresponsibilities. This plan must have more than just dates and numbers. \nIt must make it clear to the Iraqi Government that American patience is \nlimited.\n  The Iraqi people need to understand that in America, today, when we \nsee Army recruitments suffering, families organizing to protect their \nkids from recruiters, and when we see the divorce rate for military \nofficers skyrocketing--I am told the divorce rate among officers for \nthe last year is up some 70-plus percent; and since the year 2000, up \nover 300 percent--when we see this kind of damage to the long-term \ncapacity of the American military, we need to take it seriously. I\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nknow the Iraqi people already understand that our troops are skilled \nand brave. Now they need to understand we must see legitimate progress \nthat offers a real chance of American troops beginning to come home.\n  At the same time, if the administration wants the Iraqis to bear the \nburden, they need to move beyond the hollow ``stay as long as it takes \nno matter what'' talk that provides an endless security blanket--a \ndisincentive for Iraqis to stand up for Iraq--and, instead, they must \ntalk forcefully about the transfer of responsibility.\n  If the administration gets this plan right, and the Iraqis succeed in \nadopting a new constitution and holding elections as planned, trained \nIraqi security forces should be ready to take on more responsibility at \nthe critical moment when support for the insurgency is diminishing. \nThat is the kind of careful, strategic planning we need to set the \nstage for American forces to be able to be reduced in number, as the \nIraqi security forces assume more of the mission. But, again, this \nsimply will not happen unless the Iraqi forces themselves assume more \nof their part. We must make the Iraqi Government understand the \npatience of America is finite, and that real progress must be achieved. \nWe all understand that deploying capable Iraqi security forces is \nimperative to success. It always has been imperative to success. Yet \nthe numbers we have been given again and again have been false. But the \nadministration would also have us believe Iraqi forces alone could end \nthe insurgency. That is simply not true. I hope the President strikes a \ndifferent tone tonight and commits to work simultaneously, equally, \nforcefully on all fronts--security, economic, and political.\n  The administration should know by now that overly optimistic \npredictions for Iraq and rebuilding Iraq have actually been a drag on \nour mission. Reconstruction lags behind even in the Shiite south and in \nthe Kurdish north, where security is far less of an issue. This sends \nthe wrong message to those whom we ask to sacrifice for freedom.\n  We need to speed up work in these areas in order to demonstrate that \nprogress will be made in the rest of Iraq. If Iraqis, particularly \nSunnis, who fear being left out in the cold, see electricity flowing, \njobs being created, infrastructure being built, and a government of \ntheir own choosing being formed, the lure of the insurgency will \ndiminish. The violence and risk to our troops will decrease. To get it \nright in Iraq, we must show all Iraqis they are fighting not only for a \nfuture of freedom but for a tangibly improved future for their lives on \na day-to-day basis, and for their children.\n  Getting it right also means understanding the neighborhood. It means \ngetting those with an interest in Iraq, such as the Saudis, to act now.\n  Iraq is surrounded by Sunni neighbors with significant resources, yet \ncomplaints fall from these neighbors about being left out and about \ntheir concerns falling on deaf ears. Many of these countries could do \nmuch more to help, and we should encourage them to do so. Even short-\nterm improvements, such as providing electricity from their grids, or \nsupplying diesel fuel--an offer that has been made but is yet \nunfulfilled by the Saudis--would go a long way.\n  But we have to do our part and address their legitimate concerns. If \nwe want these nations to step up to the plate and help us to secure \nIraq's borders and help, particularly because of their Sunni \nbackground, to bring Sunnis into the political process or help to \nrebuild Iraq's economy and infrastructure, then we have to offer a \ncoherent, strategic security plan for their region. We have to address \ntheir fears of an Iran-dominated crescent, and their concerns about our \nsporadic mediation between Israel and the Palestinians. This \nadministration needs to show it understands there has to be some give-\nand-take in the process.\n\n  The administration could also give a significant boost to the \nrebuilding effort by recognizing the great untapped potential of \nprivate sector contributions. The conference that just took place in \nBrussels was a donor conference. What we need is more than donors; we \nneed investment. The administration, working with the Iraqi Government, \nshould organize a development conference for Iraqi businessmen and \ntheir regional counterparts who wish to invest in Iraq. Regional \ninvestment would not only strengthen Iraq's economy, it would give \nneighboring governments a greater stake in Iraq's success and another \nincentive for them to be able to provide more help. And the \nadministration might want to consider the effect on regional \nbusinessmen when they read headlines about Halliburton's extraordinary \ndominance of local contracts.\n  Much of what I have discussed today--from administration mistakes, to \nthe steps we need to move forward--all deals with laying the groundwork \nfor long-term success. But the reality is, the elections are 6 months \noff. Iraq is not going to be rebuilt overnight, and it is going to take \ntime to get the Iraqi troops ready.\n  In the coming months, even with perfect planning, there will be \nviolence, turmoil, and hardship. That is why tonight it is critical \nthat President Bush make clear there are actions we can take in the \nshort term to ease the burden on our troops. He needs to get this \nright, not only to save American lives, but to elevate the confidence \nof the American people. For this to happen, the President must \nreconsider some hastily brushed aside options.\n  To date, the administration has been unwilling to entertain the idea \nof empowered militias, instead singularly focusing on a unified Iraqi \nsecurity force. But Iraq, like Afghanistan, has numerous tribal, \nreligious, and ethnic militias, such as the Kurdish Peshmerga or the \nShiite Badr Army.\n  The fact is, these forces are structured, and, most importantly, they \nare accepted by the provincial populations. They are capable of \nproviding protection while helping with reconstruction. In the interim, \nwhile a fully capable Iraqi security force is established, these forces \ncould meet some of the critical security needs. They could fill the \ngap. If they can help do the job, why not let them?\n  It is time for the administration to put aside its concerns and prod \nthe Iraqi Government to give the militias legitimacy. We can do this by \nintegrating them into a kind of national guard, a force that would \nprovide security in their own areas where they are respected and \naccepted.\n  The administration also needs to get it right on border security. For \n2 years now, Senators and others have been commenting on the absence of \nadequate border security. The jihadists have been able to move in at \nwill. If we want to ease the burden on our troops in the short term, we \nneed to put that kind of adequate border security force in place. The \ntruth is, it has been absent since day one, which is a shame, because \nthat is precisely where our allies could help.\n\n  As opposed to providing security in urban areas, border security is \ngenerally much less risky for troops. The administration needs to work \nwith the Iraqi Government to reach out to the world and establish a \nmultinational force to secure Iraq's borders. Such a force, if \nsanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, could attract participation by \nIraq's neighbors and powerful nations with a vested interest, such as \nIndia.\n  The administration has narrowed our options in Iraq, but there are \nstill better choices available to us. There is still time to get it \nright in Iraq, and I hope, for the sake of our troops, the President \nwill do so tonight.\n  We are at a critical juncture in this conflict, both at home and \nabroad. The last thing we need is the administration growing even more \nstubborn or more defensive. Today, our Nation needs honest, open \nleadership, and a comprehensive strategy for success. It is time for \nthe President to reach out and work across the aisle and across the \nglobe to clean up this mess.\n  The President must seize this opportunity to move forward, as the \nnext months are so critical to the future of Iraq and to the future of \nour security. If the administration fails to take the steps that are \navailable to them, and fails to hold the Iraqis accountable, we will \nstumble along, our troops at greater risk, casualties rising, the \npatience of the American people wearing thin, and the specter of \nquagmire staring us in the face.\n  Every misstep, every measure untaken, every wise course not followed \ncarries an unbearable cost. The American people have a right to expect\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\naccountability. We need to decrease the risk to our troops and \nstrengthen our chances for success. Our troops deserve better than they \nare getting. They deserve leadership that is equal to their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7516-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      BONE MARROW AND CORD BLOOD THERAPY AND RESEARCH ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support The Bone \nMarrow and Cord Blood Therapy and Research Act of 2005. I introduced \nthis legislation with Senators Hatch, Dodd, Ensign, and Reed yesterday \nand I appreciate their interest in this important legislation.\n  The Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Therapy and Research Act will help \nprovide adult stem cell transplant material for those patients who need \nthem, and also provide adult stem cells for scientific research.\n  The House has passed similar legislation and we need to act in a \ntimely matter on this bill. The legislation that we introduced \nyesterday also reauthorizes the National Marrow Donor Program, an \nimportant program helping to provide adult bone marrow to sick \nindividuals. Unfortunately, thousands of Americans have died because \nthere was not an appropriate donor of bone marrow. However, umbilical \ncord blood may provide an alternative to bone marrow transplantation. \nUltimately, given the current limitations of bone marrow \ntransplantation, cord blood could become a more widespread lifesaving \ntherapy.\n  I am proud of the valuable work and research taking place in North \nCarolina. In particular, Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg of Duke University, the \ndirector of the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, is \nleading the fight on monumental diseases such as diabetes and \nAlzheimer's. Dr. Kurtzberg and her team are pioneers in the field, \nhaving already performed more than 600 cord blood transplants with \nunrelated donors more than anyone else in the world.\n  Cord blood transplantation has already been used to treat a number of \ndiseases including leukemia, lymphoma, and sickle cell anemia. The \nlegislation we introduced yesterday will establish an inventory of \n150,000 new cord blood stem cell units that reflects the diversity of \nthe people of the United States. The goal of this legislation is to \ncreate a network so that 95 percent of Americans who need a transplant \nwill be able to receive an appropriately matched transplant. Calling \ntransplants the ``ultimate in recycling,'' Dr. Kurtzberg believes, as I \ndo, that cord blood has the potential to save the lives of countless \npatients nationwide.\n  The Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Therapy and Research Act establishes a \nnetwork of qualified cord blood banks to collect, test, and preserve \ncord blood stem cells. Additionally, this legislation will help match \ndonors and recipients. I am hopeful that this legislation will provide \nfacilities like the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank at Duke with the ability \nto save thousands of lives as the number of bone marrow donors and cord \nblood units increases.\n  The Senate needs to move forward on this legislation so that the \nFederal Government can help provide the infrastructure allowing these \ntherapies to be extensively used. I stand ready to work with my \ncolleagues so that we can enact this legislation quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7516-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 honoring army specialist nick idalski\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Crown \nPoint. Nick Idalski 23 years old, died on June 21 during combat \noperations west of Baghdad near Ramadi. With his entire life before \nhim, Nick risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold \nclose to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  A 2001 graduate from Crown Point High School, Nick was killed in \ncombat just 1 month before he was scheduled to return home. He had been \nin the Army for less than 2 years, first being sent to South Korea for \na short time before his deployment to Iraq. His family recounted to a \nlocal newspaper Nick's passion for being a soldier and helping other \npeople, saying that he died doing something he truly loved. They shared \ntheir memories of how selfless, jolly, and determined Nick was, and \ntheir pride in him when he decided to join the Army. I stand here today \nto express the same feelings of pride and gratitude for this young \nHoosier's sacrifices and those made by his family on behalf of our \ncountry.\n  Nick was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nHe was a member of the Army's 2nd Infantry Division, and had been \nstationed in Ramadi since August. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his mother and stepfather, Kim and Richard Greenberg; his \nfather, Tony Idalski; his two brothers, Steve and Nathan Idalski; his \nstepbrother, Kevin Greenberg; two stepsisters; and his longtime \ngirlfriend, Lisa Wheeler.\n  Today, I join Nick's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Nick, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Nick was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Nick will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Nick's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Nick's actions will live on far \nlonger than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Nick Idalski in the official \nRecord of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I think about \nthis just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain that \ncomes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like Nick's can \nfind comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Nick.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7516-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7516-S7517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL HISTORY DAY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. OBAMA.

On \nFriday, July 1, 2005, Antonio Villaraigosa will be sworn in as mayor of \nthe great city of Los Angeles, CA.\n  With nearly 4 million residents, Los Angeles is a huge and dynamic \ncity, and running it well will be a huge challenge.

He has worked with \nDemocrats and Republicans from all backgrounds and all parts of \nCalifornia to improve education, protect the rights of working \nfamilies, expand health care coverage, and make our communities safer, \nbetter places to live.\n  Time and again, he has demonstrated the leadership skills that will \nhelp him make Los Angeles one of the world's great cities of the 21st \ncentury.\n  Antonio Villaraigosa has already made history by becoming the first \nLatino mayor of Los Angeles since 1872, but he has set his sights even \nhigher. He hopes to make history by making Los Angeles work for all its \nresidents, and I will do all I can to help him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7517-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. PHYLLIS LEVENSTEIN\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on May 28, New York and our \nNation lost one of its finest child advocates, innovators, and \nclinicians. Dr. Phyllis Levenstein, longtime Wantagh, NY, resident and \nfounder of The Parent-Child Home Program, an international early \nliteracy, school readiness program, passed away shortly after returning \nto Long Island to celebrate the program's 40th anniversary.\n  She was born Phyllis Aronson in Boston and grew up in Detroit. After \ngraduating from Wayne State University in 1937, she taught in Detroit \nbefore coming to New York, where she earned a master's degree in social \nwork in 1944 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1969. She met \nher husband, Sidney Levenstein while working as a social worker in \nManhattan during World War II. They married in 1946 and moved to \nWantagh in 1957. Sidney, an Adelphi University Professor, who died in \n1974, helped Phyllis develop The Parent-Child Home Program model.\n  In 1965, she identified parent-child interaction as the key to the \ndevelopment of early language skills and working with her husband, a \nstatistician, created a pioneering model program. The Parent-Child Home \nProgram, which Dr. Levenstein first piloted in Freeport, NY, in 1965, \nis a home-visiting program for families with 2- and 3-year-olds \nchallenged by poverty and low levels of education. The program \nencourages parent-child verbal interaction through talking, reading, \nand playing and helps families create a language-rich environment in \ntheir homes. Longitudinal research shows that children who complete the \n2-year program enter school ready to learn and graduate high school at \nthe same rate as middle-income students. The program that began serving \njust 5 Long Island families in 1965 will reach 5,000 disadvantaged \nfamilies across the country this year.\n  Dr. Levenstein's genius was in seeing the critical importance of \nparents engaging in continual verbal interaction with their young \nchildren through talking, reading, playing, and asking questions.\n  Over the years, she conducted and published significant research on \nthe program's design and outcomes. The 88-year-old clinical \npsychologist was working on an expanded edition of her 1988 book about \nparent-child verbal interaction, ``Messages from Home,'' when she \npassed away. A practicing clinical psychologist, Dr. Levenstein was in \nprivate practice in Wantagh for 44 years and continued to see patients \nup until her death. She also was affiliated with Stony Brook University \nand a number of Long Island mental health and child guidance centers.\n  Dr. Levenstein was a fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric \nAssociation and the American Psychological Association and a member of \nthe American Educational Research Association and the Nassau County and \nNew York State psychological associations.\n  Her children describe her as a person who derived true joy from \nhelping people and say that her soft touch was well-matched by her \nscientific tough-mindedness. Her principled humanism led as well to a \nlifelong impassioned advocacy of peace and social justice. Her \ncolleagues will remember her great intelligence, intensity, and wisdom, \ncoupled with integrity, warmth, and humility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7517-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7517-S7518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                McCROSSAN BOYS RANCH CELEBRATES 50 YEARS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to congratulate the McCrossan Boys Ranch of Sioux Falls, SD, as \nit celebrates 50 years of outstanding service on June 29, 2005.\n  Established by Melinda Bell McCrossan, as the result of trust she \ncreated in honor of her late husband, the McCrossan Boys Ranch is a \nprivate, not-for-profit organization ``dedicated to providing a place \nfor boys to grow into men.'' Since its inception, Mrs. McCrossan \ndetermined that the ranch would be ``a home where boys find a new hope \nfor a better life.''\n  In 1953, money from the trust was used to purchase four hospital \nbuildings from the Sioux Falls Air Force Base that had been used during \nWorld War II. The buildings were transported 8 miles northwest of Sioux \nFalls, to the current location of the McCrossan Ranch. In 1955, the \nMcCrossan Boys Ranch came to fruition as a working horse and sheep \nranch designed to help boys between the ages of 10 and 18 handle the \nconflict in their lives and successfully live up their own potential.\n  Education has always been one of the ranch's top priorities, as the \norganization stresses formal education, which includes academic and \nvocational instruction, as well as productive work and life skills. \nPrior to 1978, all residents on the ranch attended local public \nschools. However, now that the ranch operates its own on-campus \napproved special education program through a partnership with East \nDakota Educational Cooperative, 85 percent of all residents attend the \nranch's school. The other 15 percent attend local public schools, as \nreintegration into the public school system is the ranch's ultimate \ngoal for all the boys.\n  Although residents are there for a myriad of reasons, the McCrossan \nBoys Ranch makes certain to provide each student with ample individual \nattention, in addition to the required weekly group goals sessions. \nAnger management, corrective thinking, victim empathy and various other \nissues are also addressed through these workshops.\n  In early 2004, McCrossan Boys Ranch received national accreditation \nfrom the American Corrections Association, with a 99.6 percent rating. \nThis honor makes the ranch one of only three correctional facilities in \nall of South Dakota to hold this prestigious accreditation. In fact, \nonly 1,500 correctional organizations throughout the Nation maintain \nthis accreditation.\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to recognize the McCrossan Boys \nRanch for its 50 years of outstanding service. It is an honor for me to \nshare with my colleagues the exemplary leadership and strong commitment \nto education McCrossan Boys Ranch provides. I strongly commend their \nyears of hard work and dedication, and I am very pleased that their \nsubstantial efforts are being publicly honored and celebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7518-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING THE CITY OF CORSICA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of Corsica, SD. It is at this time that \nI would like to draw attention to and commemorate the achievements and \nhistory of this charming city on the South Dakota prairie, which stands \nas an enduring tribute to the fortitude and pioneer spirit of the \nDakotans.\n  Corsica, located in northern Douglas County in southeastern South \nDakota, was founded out of a need to service a new railroad built \nseveral miles from the existing towns of Harrison and Armour. On August \n17, 1905, Corsica officially became a town when 25 acres of prairie \nwhere auctioned off to the highest bidders. It was suggested by several \nof the railroad company's employees that the town be named Corsica in \nhonor of the island of Corsica, their native home, and the new \nresidents agreed.\n  Corsica grew rapidly and within weeks included the Floete Lumber \nCompany, a grocery store, the Hafsaas boarding house, Corsica State \nBank, Farmers State Bank, a newspaper office, and several restaurants. \nThe town was incorporated on January 24, 1905, and local elections \nquickly followed to select city officials.\n  After 2 years, Corsica's population was estimated at nearly 500 \npeople, and the town then boasted three general stores, a furniture \nstore, two newspapers, two hotels, two livery stables, two churches, a \nwater system, and a public hall.\n  The history of Corsica is, however, marked with its share of tragedy, \nas well. On October 16, 1907, the first fire of which there is a record \nburned one of the town's most prosperous businesses to the ground. John \nVan Ommeren's livery barn was completely destroyed and five horses, \nseveral buggies, and other personal belongings were all lost. \nAdditionally, 8 years later, on July 15, 1915, a tornado struck the \ncommunity, resulting in severe damage. Despite the devastation, \nCorsica's dedicated and resilient residents committed themselves to the \nrebuilding effort with undaunted determination.\n  One of Corsica's unique landmarks is the Priscilla Club Library, \nestablished in 1912. The library began as a book club, the Priscilla \nClub, comprised of 12 women sharing a dozen books between themselves. \nIt evolved into an organization of women selling their embroidery and \nholding suppers in order to raise funds and purchase additional \nvolumes. This small but well intentioned club amassed an immense \ncollection of literature and cultural artifacts requiring an entire \nbuilding to accommodate it all. The library now houses more than 10,500 \nbooks and hundreds of audiovisual materials. For a community of only \n625 residents, this collection is a tremendous accomplishment and \ntreasure.\n  Through the years, the proud residents of Corsica have demonstrated \ngreat flexibility and perseverance in their ability to thrive on the \nprairie of the Dakotas. I take this opportunity to recognize the \nhistory of the small city of Corsica and congratulate its residents as \nthey celebrate their vibrant, century-long history on July 2-4, \n2005.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7518-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING COMMISSIONER PAT KLABO\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nstand today in recognition of the long career of public service had by \na very special woman, Aberdeen City Commissioner Pat Klabo, who is \nretiring from her position on June 30 after 18 years of dedicated \nservice in city government. A tireless advocate for the health and \nwell-being of her community, Commissioner Klabo's presence will surely \nbe missed by residents of South Dakota's third-largest city.\n  Commissioner Klabo's rise to prominence in local government was not \nsomething preordained. As in most stories of American democracy, her \ncall to lead was motivated not by personal ambition or pedigree but by \nthe calls of those around her to take up the mantel of leadership. Her \nfirst foray into public service began when these calls of concerned \ncitizens were beckoning her to bid for the Aberdeen mayor's office back \nin 1987. After a spirited campaign, she was defeated by fellow city \ncommissioner Tim Rich, but was then appointed to fill out the remainder \nof Mr. Rich's term. Ever since that appointment, Commissioner Klabo has \nbecome a veritable fixture in Aberdeen politics.\n  In her position as commissioner of the water and wastewater \ndepartments for the last 17 years, Commissioner Klabo has proven to be \na very capable leader on a number of issues that impact the vitality of \nboth Aberdeen and the entirety of northeastern South Dakota. She was \ninstrumental in overseeing the improvements made to Aberdeen's water \ntreatment plant, an act that will prove key to the city's prospects for \ngrowth in the new millennium. Commissioner Klabo also oversaw the \ncity's expanded use and development of wells on private lands, a \npartnership between public service and private enterprise that has \nproven beneficial to all in the community.\n  Even with such dedication to local government, Commissioner Klabo \nstill somehow finds the time and energy to engage in other pursuits \nthat benefit the community. Her work as a part of the group Persons \nWith Disabilities is a prime example of this. Forty years of service \nhelping some of society's most vulnerable individuals speaks to the \nhighest character of humanity. Commissioner Klabo is also a founding \nmember of the Aberdeen Mayor's Committee for Persons with Disabilities, \na body on which she has now served for more than a decade. In this \nposition, she has ensured that people with disabilities have a voice at \nthe table when important decisions are made at city hall.\n  It is my great pleasure to share a few words about Ms. Klabo's \naccomplishments with my colleagues and to note in the public records \nher contributions to my home State. It will be difficult to lose such a \ncommitted civil servant, especially one who has proven to be such an \nasset to her community. On the behalf of all South Dakotans, I would \nlike to wish her the very best for her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7518-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7518-S7519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE COMMUNITY OF STICKNEY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town of \nStickney, SD. On July 4, 2005, Stickney residents look back on their \ncommunity's proud past and look forward to a promising future.\n  Located in southeastern South Dakota in Aurora County, Stickney was \nplatted August 17, 1905. Like many towns in South Dakota, Stickney got \nits start with help from the railroad, specifically the Milwaukee \nRailroad. In fact, the town was named for the oldest railroad agent in \nthe United States, John B. Stickney of Mazomanie, Wisconsin.\n  Just before Christmas, 1905, construction of the tracks was finally \ncomplete. Shortly thereafter, on January 1, 1906, ``Maude,'' the line's \nfirst train, ventured into town. Following Maude's arrival, Stickney \nquickly flourished. By mid-1906, the town boasted three lumber \ncompanies, two hardware stores, two livery barns, a funeral home, a \ngeneral store, a post office, a hotel, a pool hall, a blacksmith shop, \ntwo banks, and four grain elevators.\n  On June 29, 1906, John McNeil published Stickney's first newspaper, \nPostal Card. Not long after its inception, McNeil sold the paper to \nJ.S. Schuldt, who converted the printing shop into a schoolhouse. Grade \nschool classes were held in the rear of the building, while high school \nclasses were taught in the front. This establishment, like the paper, \nwas also short lived, as a new school was constructed in 1907 to better \naccommodate the rapidly increasing number of students.\n  In the century since its founding, Stickney has proven its ability to \nthrive. Stickney's more than 300 proud residents celebrate the \ncommunity's 100th anniversary on July 4, 2005, and it\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\nis with great pleasure that I share with my colleagues the history of \nthis great community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7519-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE FAYETTEVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat I rise today to honor the Fayetteville Public Library which was \nrecently named the 2005 ``Library of the Year'' by Thomson Gale and \nLibrary Journal. The Library of the Year Award honors the library that \nis most dedicated to community service through its creativity and \nleadership. Thompson Gale and Library Journal will present a check for \n$10,000 to the Fayetteville Public Library later this month during the \nAmerican Library Association's annual conference in Chicago, IL.\n  I would like to recognize Louise Schapter, executive director of the \nFayetteville Public Library, and her outstanding staff, for their \ncommitment to providing such a quality community resource to the \ncitizens of Northwest Arkansas. During Ms. Schapter's tenure, library \nusage has soared. Visits have increased from 192,179 to 576,773, \ncheckouts have risen from 271,187 to 718,159, program attendance has \ngrown from 14,448 to 41,658, and cardholders have leaped from 15,662 to \n48,419. What a remarkable accomplishment.\n  I would also like to mention that the library has more than 160 \nregular volunteers, who deliver books to the homebound, shelve and \ncover books, staff the computer lab and conduct various programs. This \ninvolvement by the community is truly commendable and makes all of us \nin Arkansas proud.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Fayetteville \nPublic Library on receiving this well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7519-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7519-3", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7519-4", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Croatt, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 38.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1318. A bill to protect States and Federal judges by clarifying \nthat Federal judicial immunity covers all acts undertaken by judges \npursuant to legal authority; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation to protect State and Federal judges against civil lawsuits, \nby clarifying that Federal judicial immunity covers all acts undertaken \nby judges pursuant to legal authority.\n  To put it mildly, these are not easy days for members of the State \nand Federal judiciary. I am unaware of any member of this body who has \nnot, at one time or another, criticized a member of the State or \nFederal judiciary for issuing one ruling or another--including the \nnumerous controversial rulings that have captured the Nation's \nattention in recent years. Indeed, in each of the two previous \nCongresses, the Senate unanimously approved strongly worded resolutions \n``strongly disapprov[ing]'' the infamous decision of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit striking down the voluntary recitation of \nthe Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. See S. Res. 71 (108th \nCong.) and S. Res. 292 (107th Cong.).\n  To be sure, judges are supposed to follow and apply the law--not \nlegislate from the bench. On numerous occasions, I have spoken out \nagainst instances of judicial activism. But there are appropriate and \ninappropriate ways to register one's disapproval and disagreement.\n  The First Amendment guarantees every American the right to express \ndisagreement with government officials--including State and Federal \njudges. There is certainly nothing inappropriate about criticizing \njudicial rulings with which one sharply disagrees. But it is entirely \ninappropriate to threaten the impeachment and removal of judges simply \nfor issuing rulings with which one disagrees. It is inappropriate to \nfile lawsuits against judges in the hope of pestering or bankrupting \nthem in retaliation for judicial actions one does not like. And it is \nabsolutely deplorable for any person to undertake violence, threats of \nviolence, or other illegal acts against judges.\n  As a former State trial judge and State supreme court justice of 13 \nyears, who has a number of close personal friends who still serve on \nthe bench today, I am outraged by recent acts of courthouse violence. I \npersonally know judges and their families who have been victims of \nviolence. I have grieved with those families. And during the Easter \nrecess earlier this year, I met with an old friend, a Federal judge in \nTexas, to make sure that we are doing everything that we can to protect \nour judges and courthouse personnel against further acts of violence. \nSo I look forward to legislation that will soon be introduced to \nstrengthen courthouse security and to otherwise bolster protections \nagainst violence for judges, their staff, and their families.\n  Today I would like to introduce legislation to protect State and \nFederal judges against a different kind of threat--a lesser threat than \nviolence to be sure, but an important one nonetheless: the threat of \ncivil litigation in retaliation for unpopular judicial actions. For \ncenturies, our common law\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\nhas protected judges against civil litigation by conferring upon them \ncourtroom immunity. It has long been understood that judicial immunity \nis an essential element of protecting judicial independence and \nensuring that judges have the ability and freedom to do their jobs. As \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee noted less than a decade ago: ``Even \nwhen cases are routinely dismissed, the very process of defending \nagainst those actions is vexatious and subjects judges to undue \nexpense. More importantly, the risk to judges of burdensome litigation \ncreates a chilling effect that threatens judicial independence and may \nimpair the day-to-day decisions of the judiciary in close or \ncontroversial cases.'' Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996--S. 1887, \nS. Rep. No. 104-366 at 37 (1996).\n\n  Throughout its legal existence, judicial immunity has been for the \nmost part a creature of the common law. But there have been times when \nCongress has seen fit to step in and to strengthen judicial immunity--\nparticularly when the courts have undertaken an unduly narrow view. In \n1996, for example, Congress enacted the Federal Courts Improvement \nAct--important legislation that included a provision reversing a U.S. \nSupreme Court decision in order to expand the protections of judicial \nimmunity.\n  It is appropriate for Congress once again to consider legislation to \nstrengthen judicial immunity. This time, I hope Congress will respond \nto a recent decision by a Federal district court in Fort Worth, TX. \nThat decision applied recent Supreme Court precedents in good faith, \nbut in a manner that leaves judges potentially exposed to vexatious \ncivil litigation. In Alexander v. Tarrant County, the Federal district \ncourt held that traditional judicial immunity does not protect State \njudges acting in their administrative capacities. Specifically, the \ncourt held that State judges authorized under State law to supervise \nlocal correctional facilities could not claim judicial immunity against \nsuit. As a recent news report and editorial by the San Antonio Express-\nNews make clear, that decision has left judges throughout the State of \nTexas in a state of uncertainty and anxiety about their exposure to \nlawsuits and liability. As the editorial rightly argues, the Alexander \nruling, and I quote, ``has sent shock waves through the judiciary. . . \n. Judges have a tough job. They should not be burdened with defending \nthemselves for the administrative duties they perform.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of those articles be printed in the \nRecord at the close of my remarks.\n  The legislation I introduce today is simple and straightforward. It \nprotects State and Federal judges against civil lawsuits, by clarifying \nthat Federal judicial immunity covers all acts undertaken by judges \npursuant to legal authority. Specifically, it provides that State and \nFederal judges shall be immune against any Federal civil cause of \naction respecting the discharge of any legislatively or \nconstitutionally authorized duty, except for actions involving malice. \nThe legislation would not preempt any judicial immunity that already \nexists under current law.\n  This legislation was drafted with the support of two Texas State \njudges--the Honorable Dean Rucker, who presides over the 318th District \nCourt in MidIand, and who chairs the Judicial Section of the State Bar \nof Texas, and the former chairman, the Honorable Mark Atkinson of the \nHarris County Criminal Court. I want to thank them both for their \nservice to Texas and for their help with this legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that their letter of support be printed in the Record \nat the close of my remarks. I am also grateful for the technical \nassistance provided by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, as \nwell as by the office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, which has \nbeen intimately involved in the defense State judges against vexatious \nlitigation. Finally, I am especially grateful for the support of the \nChief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court, Wallace Jefferson, and I ask \nunanimous consent that his letter of support likewise be printed in the \nRecord at the close of my remarks.\n  I hope that legislation to protect judges against deplorable acts and \nthreats of violence will soon be introduced and quickly be enacted, and \nI hope that the legislation I introduce today to protect judges against \nvexatious litigation will likewise be considered favorably by my \ncolleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Judges Skittish Without Immunity\n\n                          (By Zeke MacCormack)\n\n       Kerrville.--Becky Harris didn't get far with her most \n     recent status report to the Kerr County Juvenile Board on the \n     detention center she manages.\n       After just two words, she was stopped by state District \n     Judge Steve Ables, who said such a briefing could leave him \n     and other board members ``buck naked'' and personally liable \n     in the event of a lawsuit.\n       The concern stemmed from a recent federal judge's ruling \n     that ``judicial immunity'' enjoyed by judges for courtroom \n     duties doesn't necessarily extend to administrative duties \n     they perform.\n       Judges still have qualified immunity as elected officials, \n     but a ruling last fall by U.S. District Judge Terry Means in \n     a lawsuit against 19 criminal court judges in Tarrant County \n     has sent a chill across the Texas bench.\n       ``It's got judges spooked all over the state,'' Kerr County \n     Judge Pat Tinley, one of three judges on the juvenile board, \n     said last week. ``Until the Legislature reduces their \n     (judges') exposure, they're all going to be as jumpy as the \n     dickens.''\n       Legislation now pending in Austin offers only a partial \n     fix. It would bolster protections for judges acting in regard \n     to adult probation departments, but not on juvenile matters, \n     such as the aborted April 13 briefing in Kerr County.\n       ``If we know what Becky's doing, and it turns out that \n     something goes south, and there's a huge incident, the fact \n     that we knew about it puts us maybe in a role of getting \n     sued,'' Ables said, according to a transcript of the meeting.\n       Until legislation can solidify immunity for judges, he \n     said, ``we're telling everybody who's dealing with any type \n     of administrative duty, `Stay as far away from it as you can. \n     Don't make any decisions.' ''\n       State District Judge Karl Prohl, another member of the \n     juvenile board, suggested Harris instead brief county \n     commissioners, who assumed oversight of the center Feb. 14 \n     when the county closed on the $1.9 million purchase of it.\n       But, he told her, ``we can visit on an individual basis as \n     friends.''\n       Dean Rucker, a district judge in Midland who is chairman of \n     the State Bar of Texas judicial section board, said he's \n     ``always had some concern about how far our judicial immunity \n     went,'' adding the federal ruling ``seems to indicate it has \n     some limits.''\n       The Tarrant County case stems from the 2001 pneumonia death \n     of Bryan Alexander, 18, of Arlington, a detainee at a 350-bed \n     detention center in Mansfield run by Correctional Services \n     Corp.\n       Serving a six-month sentence on a misdemeanor, Alexander \n     died after days of coughing up blood and seeking medical \n     help. A nurse at the center was convicted in 2002 of \n     negligent homicide for failing to give adequate care, got \n     four years of probation and was ordered to pay $11,000 in \n     restitution.\n       In 2003, Alexander's family won $38 million in a negligence \n     lawsuit in state court against the nurse and Correctional \n     Services. That's on appeal.\n       The family then filed a federal civil rights lawsuit \n     against all Tarrant County judges with criminal court \n     jurisdiction, in their individual capacity.\n       Last fall, Means let the lawsuit continue after denying a \n     motion to dismiss that was based on a claim of judicial \n     immunity. Means said the lawsuit's allegations are that \n     judges performed administrative acts that fell outside their \n     statutorily required duties regarding the center.\n       The local government code in Texas law says district judges \n     trying criminal cases shall create community supervision and \n     corrections departments and are entitled to help manage them. \n     ``What Judge Means is saying is, `If you're going to assume \n     those administrative duties, act responsibly,' '' said Mark \n     Haney, attorney for Alexander's family.\n       He said the Tarrant County judges approved an inadequate \n     budget for the center, hired an operator for it who had \n     problems elsewhere, and approved a policy that said ill \n     detainees could not seek outside medical help until they'd \n     taken over-the-counter drugs for three days. ``You can't just \n     give out a budget and then turn a blind eye to \n     consequences,'' Haney said.\n       Assistant Attorney General David Harris, who is helping \n     defend the judges, said ``most judges were under the \n     impression, I believe, that as long they were performing \n     tasks assigned to them by the Legislature and making their \n     best efforts, they would be protected by judicial immunity.''\n       The judges had no direct management role in the center, he \n     said, and relied on the operator and staff to act \n     responsibly.\n       Harris has spoken to judges at conferences on how the case \n     might affect them. ``They need to be aware of the fact that \n     they are not always acting in a judicial capacity, even if \n     they think they are,'' he said.\n       He wouldn't comment on the deliberations of the Kerr County \n     Juvenile Board. ``I'm not advocating that any of them shirk \n     their responsibility as a judge. I want them to approach \n     their duties informatively, and to act discreetly and with an \n     eye toward liability,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\n       Harris is slated to testify Tuesday before the Senate \n     criminal justice committee on a bill sponsored by Sen. John \n     Whitmire, D-Houston.\n       A Whitmire aide said the bill, which passed the House last \n     month, clarifies that judges have judicial immunity when \n     forming an adult probation department, passing its budget, \n     naming its director and approving a community justice plan.\n       But it doesn't address juvenile boards that judges also \n     serve on, because those duties are covered by a different \n     statute, the aide said.\n       Haney said insulating judges from liability could backfire. \n     ``If there is no accountability, then I think it invites \n     irresponsible behavior,'' said Haney, who expressed amazement \n     at the Kerr Juvenile Board discussion. ``That is just as \n     irresponsible as acting with deliberate indifference,'' he \n     said.\n       Some Kerr County commissioners also expressed concern about \n     it, with Commissioner Jonathan Letz describing the juvenile \n     board's posture as ``head in the sand.''\n       Commissioner Buster Baldwin said limited oversight by the \n     judges might have fostered the financial woes that left the \n     county with the choice of buying the insolvent juvenile \n     center or losing it.\n       Reacting later, Ables, the district judge, said the \n     juvenile board was more closely involved in supervising the \n     facility before it was sold.\n       ``Everybody (on the board) felt we could be involved \n     because we had judicial immunity,'' until word of the Tarrant \n     County ruling circulated early this year, he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From The San Antonio Express-News]\n\n                       Extend Immunity for Judges\n\n       State lawmakers should protect judges from litigation \n     spawned by the administrative duties they perform off the \n     bench.\n       A federal court recently ruled that the immunity judges \n     have for the duties they perform in the courtroom does not \n     extend to their administrative actions, a decision that could \n     have a big impact across the state.\n       In many counties, district court judges who try criminal \n     cases are charged by state law with establishing community \n     supervision and corrections departments.\n       However, the law does not provide the judges with \n     protection from litigation for the decisions they make in \n     that capacity.\n       As Express-News staff writer Zeke MacCormack reported, a \n     federal court judge's ruling in a Tarrant County case has \n     sent shock waves through the judiciary.\n       In that case, U.S. District Judge Terry Means denied a \n     motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed against the 19 Tarrant \n     County criminal court judges by the family of a man who died \n     in custody.\n       The judges claimed judicial immunity. Means ruled they did \n     not possess it for administrative acts.\n       Legislation pending in Austin would give judges judicial \n     immunity when administering an adult probation department and \n     providing a community justice plan.\n       However, it doesn't address their actions as members of the \n     juvenile boards that oversee juvenile detention centers and \n     juvenile probation departments across the state.\n       Judges have a tough job. They should not be burdened with \n     defending themselves for the administrative duties they \n     perform.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Judicial Section,\n\n\n                                           State Bar of Texas,\n\n                                San Antonio, Texas, June 27, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the judges of the State \n     of Texas, we would like to thank you for your proposed \n     legislation addressing the important issue of immunity for \n     judges in the performance of their duties.\n       The issue of judicial immunity for the performance of \n     certain administrative duties was one of the Texas \n     judiciary's highest legislative priorities during the recent \n     regular session of the legislature. Governor Perry has now \n     signed legislation that provides judicial immunity to Texas \n     judges in the oversight of their local community supervision \n     and corrections departments.\n       Your efforts to address the issue of judicial immunity at \n     the federal level are of the utmost importance to Texas \n     judges. If adopted, the legislation you have crafted will \n     provide comprehensive immunity for judges in the performance \n     of their statutorily and constitutionally authorized duties.\n       We extend our heartfelt appreciation for your efforts and \n     for your steadfast support of the judiciary.\n           Yours very truly,\n     Dean Rucker,\n       Chair, Judicial Section, State Bar of Texas.\n     Mark Atkinson,\n       Chair, Criminal Justice Legislative Committee Judicial \n     Section, State Bar of Texas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   The Supreme Court of Texas,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, June 27, 2005.\n     Senator John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: The Supreme Court of Texas is aware \n     that Texas judges are concerned about a recent federal \n     judge's ruling that the immunity judges have traditionally \n     been accorded, does not necessarily extend to administrative \n     duties they perform. So worried are Texas judges, in fact, \n     that the Judicial Section of the State Bar of Texas made \n     judicial immunity for administrative duties one of the its \n     highest legislative priorities during the recent regular \n     session of the Texas Legislature.\n       As Chief Justice of The Supreme Court of Texas, \n     constitutionally charged with the responsibility of \n     overseeing the administration of justice in the State, I \n     share these concerns. The practical impact of limiting a \n     doctrine that has offered protection for well over a century \n     in this country--and centuries before in England--may be a \n     reluctance by Texas judges to discharge their administrative \n     duties, many of which are critical to a healthy, functioning \n     judicial branch.\n       Texas citizens will be the unwilling victims of this \n     reluctance. Contrary to suggestions in the media, judicial \n     immunity was not fashioned for the protection or benefit of \n     judges. Rather, the doctrine was intended to benefit the \n     public, who has a keen interest in a judiciary that functions \n     with independence and without fear of the personal \n     consequences of discharging their duties.\n       I commend the leaders within the Texas judiciary who worked \n     hard this session to press for legislation that protects the \n     independence of the judiciary, through these reform efforts \n     and others. I likewise applaud the Governor and our \n     distinguished legislators who, through the stroke of a pen \n     and the casting of a vote, tell Texas judges that they \n     support judicial independence, not only with impressive \n     rhetoric, but through recordable actions.\n       Despite these successes on the state level, more \n     comprehensive reform may be in order. I support your efforts \n     to do so at the federal level and extend my sincere \n     appreciation for your continued support of the judiciary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Wallace B.

A bill to provide multilateral debt cancellation for Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in our search for ways to eliminate the \ncrushing poverty that afflicts billions of people around the world, \nexperience has taught us to be humble. There is no single policy or \nprogram that can deal with the underlying causes and symptoms of \npoverty.\n  But as the Hippocratic Oath reminds us, in the search for cures, \n``First, do no harm.''\n  Right now, the burden of debt owed by the poorest nations of the \nworld to the richest does harm not only to them, but to us.\n  In our new global environment, countries whose peoples live in abject \npoverty are not just a moral challenge to those of us who are blessed \nwith affluence.\n  They can threaten the entire edifice of political and economic \nstability.\n  New technologies that have brought so much good to the world have \nshrunk the gaps in time and distance that once allowed us the luxury of \ninattention.\n  Now the very symbols of the technological superiority of our age, \nfrom the cell phone to the internet to jet airliners, have been \ntransformed into weapons in the hands of those who are the declared \nenemies of our way of life.\n  They allow stateless actors to reach out from the shadows, from weak \nand failed states, to attack us here at home.\n  Poverty-stricken states are fertile ground for drug production and \ntrafficking, feeding our own drug problems here.\n  With the scourge of AIDS and other diseases loose in the world, we \ncannot afford the existence of more states that cannot feed, house, \neducate, or innoculate their citizens.\n  For all of these reasons, we ignore the poverty that plagues other \nnations at our own peril.\n  That is why we need the legislation I am introducing today, with \nSenators DeWine, Feingold, Lugar, and Obama, the Multilateral Debt \nRelief Act of 2005.\n  This legislation takes a first step in addressing that poverty it \nrelieves the poorest nations of the world, specifically those who \nqualify for the Heavily Indebted Poor Country initiative of over a \nbillion dollars a year in debt service payments that they are obliged \nto send the World Bank, the IMF, and the African Development Bank.\n  Since I worked with the President Clinton on the Enhanced HIPC \ninitiative in 1999, we have searched for a\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\nworkable definition of ``sustainable debt'' an amount that would not \ncripple a country's ability to take care of its own citizens and \nachieve economic growth.\n  In the end, it became clear that definition would continue to elude \nus. Whatever the best use of the limited resources of the poorest \nnation may be, sending checks to the multilateral banks established by \nthe richest nations of the world is nowhere near the top of the list.\n  With the strong leadership of Prime Minister Blair, who will preside \nover the upcoming G8 Summit in July, we have cut the Gordian Knot of \ndebt owed by the poorest nations of the world.\n  The announcement of the G8 Finance Ministers earlier this month on \n100 percent debt relief cuts through years of debate and opens the way \nfor a fresh start.\n  One hundred percent debt relief for those countries who meet the HIPC \nqualifications gets that debt out of the way of the many tasks before \nthose countries in their search for economic growth.\n  None of our own foreign assistance programs will work to their best \nadvantage if we send that assistance into nations who will turn around \nand send some of their money right back here to Washington, to the \nWorld Bank, to the IMF.\n  We must remember that this is indeed only the first step on a long \npath. With the funds this legislation will authorize, a burden of debt \nwill be lifted, but we will still need to promote health, education, \nand other pillars of economic development.\n  We will need a more creative approach to trade with the poorest \nnations, who represent no economic threat, except for the threat that \ncomes from their poverty itself. We have nothing to fear from a world \nin which fewer people wake up hungry, sick, and uneducated.\n  But with as much as $40 billion in outstanding debt stock owed by 18 \ncountries to be removed from the books right away, our efforts in those \nareas have a greater chance to succeed. Up to $56 billion will be \nforgiven under this plan, once all 38 eligible countries are fully \nqualified.\n  I am pleased to note that this is a bipartisan initiative, one I \nshare with Senators DeWine, Feingold, Lugar, and Obama, an effort that \nbegan with the Clinton Administration and has progressed to this \nhistoric agreement under President Bush.\n  This legislation authorizes the funds needed for our share of the \ndebt relief. It provides for further relief for other countries as they \nbecome eligible.\n  It lifts not only a debt burden from poor countries, but a moral \nobligation from our shoulders.\n  The poverty reduction it will promote will help millions around the \nglobe and contribute materially to a more stable and secure world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Smith, and Mr. \n        Hagel):\n  S. 1321. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe excise tax on telephone and other communications; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Telephone Excise \nTax Repeal Act of 2005, a bill that would abolish a tax that is \nseverely outdated.\n  The telephone excise tax originated on long distance service under \nthe Spanish American War Act of 1898. At that time, only the wealthy \nhad telephones, the U.S. had no income tax, and the country relied on \nexcise taxes to fund the war. However, you would not know the intent of \nthis tax by looking at your phone bill. The charge on your phone bill \ndoesn't say ``luxury tax'' or ``war tax.'' So why does this tax still \nexist?\n  Although created to cover war expenses in 1898, the revenue from the \ntelephone excise tax goes into the general receipts of the U.S. \nTreasury and is not earmarked for any particular government function or \nservice. From its inception, the federal telephone excise tax was \nrepeatedly imposed on a temporary basis. However since 1932, the tax \nhas continuously been imposed. This tax has been scheduled to expire--\npartially or completely--at least 17 different times. In 1990, and just \nbefore the tax was set to expire, Congress made the tax permanent at 3 \npercent of local and long distance services.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation stated in its January 2005 report \n``there is no compelling policy argument for imposing taxes on \ncommunications services.'' The Congressional Budget Office took this a \nstep further by stating in February 2005 that the tax ``has harmful \neffects on economic policy.''\n  Repeal of this tax provides consumers with two main benefits--removal \nof a regressive tax and elimination of an ``invisible tax.'' First, the \ntax is considered a regressive tax because lower-income individuals \nspend a higher percentage of their income on the taxed item than those \nwith higher-incomes. A 1987 study by the CBO concluded that excise \ntaxes on telephone service had a greater impact on low-income families \nthan did excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. \nStudies have shown that individuals and families with income less than \n$10,000 spend almost 10 percent of their income on telephone bills. \nIndividuals and families earning $50,000 spend two percent of their \nincome for telephone service.\n  Second, repeal eliminates this ``invisible'' tax that consumers pay \nthrough their telephone companies. Because phone companies collect the \ntax from their customers, the government is spared the expense. \nHowever, this convenience for the government makes the tax \n``invisible'' to consumers by tying it to the payment of their phone \nbills. Additionally, any administrative costs associated with the \ncollection of this tax are most likely passed forward to the consumers, \nartificially raising the cost of telecommunications with no benefit \nfrom the additional taxes.\n  Telephone service providers lose as well under the current tax, and \nits repeal would further reduce the cost of telecommunications for \nconsumers. Providers carry the administrative costs of being the \ngovernment's tax collector. Additionally, while providers do not bear \nthis tax directly, the tax raises the cost of services for consumers \nand in turn reduces both the number of subscribers and the amount of \nservices requested.\n  Common sense dictates that repeal of the telephone excise tax is long \noverdue. Communication is not a luxury. Rather, communications have \nbecome part of the basic fabric of our social and economic life. The \ngrowth of the technologies on which communications rides and the \nwidespread use of communications in general should be encouraged and \nnot taxed. The telephone tax is a regressive, inequitable, inefficient \nand unnecessary tax that Congressional policy makers have found to \nserve no rational policy purpose. I strongly urge my Senate colleagues \nto join me in supporting the repeal of the telephone excise tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 1322. A bill to allow for the prosecution of members of criminal \nstreet gangs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senators Leahy, \nKennedy, and Feingold in introducing the American Neighborhoods Taking \nthe Initiative Guarding Against Neighborhood Gangs (ANTI-GANG) Act, \nwhich is a comprehensive bill that will help State and local \nprosecutors prevent, investigate, and prosecute gang crimes.\n  Gang violence is a serious, nationwide program. The National Youth \nGang Survey estimated that in 2002 there were 21,500 gangs comprised of \n731,500 members in the United States. The FBI has noted that ``[s]treet \ngangs and other loosely knit groups are responsible for a substantial \nportion of the increase in violent crime in the United States.'' The \nproblem is clearly felt in Chicago, IL, where over 40 percent of the \nhomicides last year were gang-related. The Chicago Police Department is \ncurrently tracking 68 identified gangs, with an estimated 68,000 \nmembers.\n  I would like to commend the State and local prosecutors and law \nenforcement agencies for their work in fighting this problem. The ANTI-\nGANG Act would authorize $862.5 million in grants over the next five \nyears to provide them with the tools they need and have\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\nspecifically requested of Congress to combat violent gangs.\n  For example, the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) wrote \nthe following: ``We must find new methods of protecting those \nindividuals brave enough to come forward as witnesses. Our biggest \nproblem is getting the financial help to establish, and run, meaningful \nwitness protection programs.'' The National Alliance of Gang \nInvestigators (NAGI) also has identified a trend in witness \nintimidation that is ``dramatically affecting the prosecution of \nviolent gang offenders.'' The ANTI-GANG Act responds by authorizing \n$300 million over five years for the protection of witnesses and \nvictims of gang crimes. This bill also would allow the Attorney General \nto provide for the relocation and protection of witnesses in state \ngang, drug, and homicide cases, and it would allow States to obtain the \ntemporary protection of witnesses in State gang cases through the \nFederal witness relocation and protection program, without any \nrequirement of reimbursement for those temporary services.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also authorizes $250 million over five years for \ngrants to develop gang prevention, research, and intervention services. \nHowever, these grants should not be limited to those areas already \nidentified as ``high intensity'' interstate gang activity areas. The \nNAGI also has identified a trend of gangs migrating from larger cities \nto smaller communities, which is fueled in large part by an increase in \ngang involvement in drug trafficking. This may be related to the spread \nof methamphetamine, which is the fastest-growing drug in the United \nStates and, according to Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, the \n``single-greatest threat to rural America today.'' In response to these \ntrends, the ANTI-GANG Act would allow rural communities and other \njurisdictions to apply for these grants, to prevent gang violence from \noccurring in the first place. The ANTI-GANG Act also authorizes $262.5 \nmillion over five years for the cooperative prevention, investigation, \nand prosecution of gang crimes. Most of this funding would be for \ncriminal street gang enforcement teams made up of local, State, and \nFederal law enforcement authorities that would investigate and \nprosecute criminal street gangs in high intensity interstate gang \nactivity areas (HIIGAAs). Importantly, this bill would allow HIIGAAs to \nbe integrated with High Intensity Interstate Drug Trafficking Areas \n(HIIDTAs), to avoid conflicts in those areas where the two entities \nwould coexist.\n\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also authorizes $50 million over five years for \ntechnology, equipment, and training to identify gang members and \nviolent offenders and to maintain databases to facilitate coordination \namong law enforcement and prosecutors;\n  In addition to these new resources, the ANTI-GANG Act will \neffectively strengthen the ability of prosecutors to prosecute violent \nstreet gangs, by creating a stronger Federal criminal gang prosecution \noffense. This new offense criminalizes participation in criminal street \ngangs, recruitment and retention of gang members, and witness \nintimidation. At the same time, it responds to concerns raised by the \nNDAA regarding potential conflicts with local investigation and \nprosecution efforts, by requiring certification by the Department of \nJustice before any prosecution under this bill could be undertaken in \nFederal court.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also promotes the recruitment and retention of \nhighly-qualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a \nstudent loan forgiveness program modeled after the current program for \nFederal employees. Almost a third of prosecutors' offices across the \ncountry have problems with recruiting or retaining staff attorneys, and \nlow salaries were cited as the primary reason for recruitment and \nretention problems. This proposed loan forgiveness program is supported \nby the American Bar Association, the NDAA, the National Association of \nProsecutor Coordinators, the National Legal Aid and Defender \nAssociation, and the American Council of Chief Defenders.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act will effectively strengthen the ability of \nprosecutors at the local, State, and Federal level to prosecute violent \nstreet gangs, and it will give State and local governments the \nresources they need to protect witnesses and prevent youth from joining \ngangs in the first place. This bill achieves these important goals \nwithout increasing any mandatory minimum sentences, which conservative \njurists such as Justice Anthony Kennedy have criticized as ``unfair, \nunjust, unwise.'' It also does not unnecessarily expand the Federal \ndeath penalty--a measure which has been included in other Federal gang \nlegislation but is opposed by the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, NAACP, ACLU, and National Association of Criminal Defense \nLawyers.\n  Finally, the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Coalition \nhas raised the following concerns regarding Federal gang legislation \nthat would allow more juveniles to be prosecuted as adults in the \nFederal system: ``[T]he fact remains that transfer of youth to the \nadult system, simply put, is a failed public policy. Comprehensive \nnational research on the practice of prosecuting youth in the adult \nsystem has shown conclusively that transferring youth to the adult \ncriminal justice system does nothing to reduce crime and actually has \nthe opposite effect. In fact, study after study has shown that youth \ntransferred to the adult criminal justice system are more likely to re-\noffend and to commit more serious crimes upon release than youth who \nwere charged with similar offenses and had similar offense histories \nbut remained in the juvenile justice system. Moreover, national data \nshow that young people incarcerated with adults are five times as \nlikely to report being a victim of rape, twice as likely to be beaten \nby staff and 50 percent more likely to be assaulted with a weapon than \nyouth held in juvenile facilities. A Justice Department report also \nfound that youth confined in adult facilities are nearly eight times \nmore likely to commit suicide than youth in juvenile facilities.''\n  In light of these concerns, the ANTI-GANG Act provides Congress with \nthe necessary data to decide whether to expand the Federal role in \nprosecuting juvenile offenders, by requiring a comprehensive report on \nthe current treatment of juveniles by the States and the capability of \nthe Federal criminal justice system to take on these additional cases \nand house additional prisoners. The American Bar Association has \nwritten that this study is ``the more prudent course of action at this \ntime.''\n  The ANTI-GANG Act is a comprehensive, common-sense approach to fight \ngang violence. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The American Neighborhoods Taking the Initiative--Guarding Against \n                   Neighborhood Gangs (Anti-Gang) Act\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The American Neighborhoods Taking the Initiative--Guarding \n     Against Neighborhood Gangs (ANTI-GANG) Act of 2005 is a \n     comprehensive, tailored bill that will help State and local \n     prosecutors prevent, investigate, and prosecute gang crimes \n     in their neighborhoods. This bill contains four major \n     provisions:\n       (1) It gives State and local prosecutors the tools they \n     need and have specifically requested of Congress to combat \n     violent gangs by authorizing $52.5 million for the \n     cooperative prevention, investigation, and prosecution of \n     gang crimes; $10 million for technology, equipment, and \n     training to identify gang members and violent offenders and \n     to maintain databases to facilitate coordination among law \n     enforcement and prosecutors; $60 million for the protection \n     of witnesses and victims of gang crimes; and $50 million for \n     grants to develop gang prevention, research, and intervention \n     services.\n       2. It replaces the current provision on criminal street \n     gangs in Federal law, a seldom-used penalty enhancement, with \n     a stronger measure that criminalizes participation in \n     criminal street gangs, recruitment and retention of gang \n     members, and witness intimidation. The ANTI-GANG Act targets \n     gang violence and gang crimes in a logical, straightforward \n     manner.\n       3. It will provide Congress with the necessary data to \n     decide whether to expand the federal role in prosecuting \n     juvenile offenders by requiring a comprehensive report on the \n     current treatment of juveniles by the States and the \n     capability of the Federal criminal justice system to take on \n     these additional cases and house additional prisoners.\n       4. It promotes the recruitment and retention of highly-\n     qualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a \n     student loan\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\n     forgiveness program modeled after the current program for \n     Federal employees.\n       The ANTI-GANG Act will effectively strengthen the ability \n     of prosecutors at the local, State, and Federal level to \n     prosecute violent street gangs, and it will give State and \n     local governments the resources they need to protect \n     witnesses and prevent kids from joining gangs in the first \n     place. This bill achieves these important goals without \n     increasing any mandatory minimum sentences, which \n     conservative jurists such as Justice Anthony Kennedy have \n     criticized as ``unfair, unjust, unwise''. It also respects \n     the traditional principles of federalism, by requiring \n     certification by the Department of Justice before any \n     prosecution under this bill may be undertaken in Federal \n     court and by not unnecessarily expanding the Federal death \n     penalty.\n\n\n            SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE ANTI-GANG ACT\n\n     Title I--Criminal Street Gangs\n       Sec. 101. Criminal Street Gamgs--Definitions. Defines a \n     criminal gang as a preexisting and ongoing entity, e.g. \n     having already committed crimes; targets violent criminal \n     street gangs by requiring that at least one predicate gang \n     crime be a violent gang crime; establishes evidentiary \n     relevance of gang symbolism in prosecutions; and allows \n     Federal prosecution of neighborhood gang activity when those \n     activities substantially affect interstate commerce.\n       Sec. 102. Criminal Street Gangs--Prohibited Acts, \n     Penalties, and Forfeiture. Creates three new Federal crimes \n     to prosecute cases involving violent criminal street gangs. \n     1. It prohibits the recruitment and forced retention of gang \n     members, including harsher penalties if an adult recruits a \n     minor or prevents a minor from leaving a criminal street \n     gang. 2. It prohibits participation in a criminal street gang \n     if done with the intent to further criminal activities of the \n     gang or through the commission of a single predicate gang \n     crime. 3. It prohibits witness intimidation and tampering in \n     cases and investigations related to gang activity. Before the \n     Federal government may undertake a prosecution of these \n     offenses, the Department of Justice must certify that it has \n     consulted with State and local prosecutors before seeking an \n     indictment and that federal prosecution is ``in the public \n     interest and necessary to secure substantial justice.''\n       Sec. 103. Clerical Amendments.\n       Sec. 104. Conforming Amendments.\n       Sec. 105. Designation of and Assistance for ``High \n     Intensity'' Interstate Gang Activity Areas. Requires the \n     Attorney General, after consultation with the governors of \n     appropriate States, to designate certain locations as ``high \n     intensity'' interstate gang activity areas (HIIGAAs) and \n     provide assistance in the form of criminal street gang \n     enforcement teams made up of local, State, and Federal law \n     enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute criminal \n     street gangs in each designated area. The ANTI-GANG bill also \n     allows for HIIGAAs to be integrated with High Intensity \n     Interstate Drug Trafficking Areas (HIIDTAs), to avoid \n     conflicts and bureaucratic morasses in those areas where the \n     two entities would coexist. Subsection (c) authorizes funding \n     of $40 million for each fiscal year 2006 through 2010.\n       Sec. 106. Gang Prevention Grants. Requires the Office of \n     Justice Programs of the Department of Justice to make grants \n     to States, units of local government, tribal governments, and \n     qualified private entities to develop community-based \n     programs that provide crime prevention, research, and \n     intervention services designed for gang members and at-risk \n     youth. Subsection (f) authorizes $50 million for each fiscal \n     year 2006 through 2010. No grant may exceed $1 million nor \n     last for any period longer than 2 years.\n       Sec. 107. Gang Prevention Information Grants. Requires the \n     Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice to \n     make grants to States, units of local government, tribal \n     governments to fund technology, equipment, and training for \n     state and local sheriffs, police agencies, and prosecutor \n     offices to increase accurate identification of gang members \n     and violent offenders and to maintain databases with such \n     information to facilitate coordination among law enforcement \n     and prosecutors. Subsection (f) authorizes $10 million for \n     each fiscal year 2006 through 2010. No grant may exceed $1 \n     million nor last for any period longer than 2 years.\n       Sec. 108. Enhancement of Project Safe Neighborhoods \n     Initiative to Improve Enforcement of Criminal Laws Against \n     Violent Gangs. Expands the Project Safe Neighborhood program \n     to require United States Attorneys to identify and prosecute \n     significant gangs within their district; to coordinate such \n     prosecutions among all local, State, and Federal law \n     enforcement agencies; and to coordinate criminal street gang \n     enforcement teams in designated ``high intensity'' interstate \n     gang activity areas. Subsection (b) authorizes the hiring of \n     94 additional Assistant United States Attorneys and funding \n     of $7.5 million for each fiscal year 2006 through 2010 to \n     carry out the provisions of this section.\n       Sec. 109. Additional Resources Needed by the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation to Investigate and Prosecute Violent \n     Criminal Street Gangs. Requires the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation to increase funding for the Safe Streets \n     Program and to support the criminal street gang enforcement \n     teams in designated high intensity interstate gang activity \n     areas. Subsection (b) authorizes $5 million for each fiscal \n     year 2006 through 2010 to expand the FBI's Safe Streets \n     Program.\n       Sec. 110. Expansion of Federal Witness Relocation and \n     Protection Program. Amends 18 U.S.C. 3521(a)(1), which \n     governs the Federal witness relocation and protection \n     program, to make clear that the Attorney General can provide \n     for the relocation and protection of witnesses in State gang, \n     drug, and homicide cases. Current law authorizes Federal \n     relocation and protection for witnesses in State cases \n     involving ``an organized criminal activity or other serious \n     offense.''\n       Sec. 111. Grants to States and Local Prosecutors to Protect \n     Witnesses and Victims of Crime. Authorizes the Attorney \n     General to make grants available to State and local \n     prosecutors and the U.S. Attorney for the District of \n     Columbia for the purpose of providing short-term protection \n     to witnesses in cases involving an organized criminal \n     activity, criminal street gang, serious drug offense, \n     homicide, or other serious offense. State and local \n     prosecutors will have the option of either providing the \n     witness protection themselves or contracting with the United \n     States Marshals Service for use of the Federal witness \n     protection and relocation program. Subsection (d) authorizes \n     $60 million for each fiscal year 2006 through 2010 to fund \n     the program. By providing significantly increased resources \n     and flexibility for State and local prosecutors, this \n     provision responds in a meaningful way to the need for \n     effective witness protection emphasized by prosecutors during \n     the September 17, 2003, hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n       Sec. 112. Witness Protection Services. Amends 18 U.S.C. \n     3526 to allow States to obtain the temporary protection of \n     witnesses in State gang cases through the Federal witness \n     relocation and protection program, without any requirement of \n     reimbursement for those temporary services. Currently, \n     complex reimbursement procedures deter State and local \n     prosecutors from obtaining witness protection services from \n     the Federal government in emergency circumstances.\n     Title II--Related Matters Involving Violent Crime Prosecution\n       Sec. 201. Study on Expanding Federal Authority for Juvenile \n     Offenders. This section requires the General Accounting \n     Office to do a comprehensive report on the advantages and \n     disadvantages of increasing Federal authority for the \n     prosecution of 16- and 17-year-old offenders. Some have \n     proposed indicting and prosecuting more juveniles in Federal \n     courts as a step in combating gang violence. Although there \n     is insufficient data to support this proposition, it is \n     appropriate for the GAO to review the current treatment of \n     such offenders by the States and the capability of the \n     Federal criminal justice system to take on these additional \n     cases and house additional prisoners. With this review, \n     Congress can knowledgeably consider whether to expand the \n     Federal role in prosecuting juveniles.\n       Sec. 202. Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act. This \n     section establishes a student loan repayment program for \n     prosecutors and public defenders that is modeled after the \n     program currently available to federal employees. This would \n     increase the ability of Federal, State, and local prosecutors \n     and public defenders to recruit and retain highly-qualified \n     attorneys. Attorneys in this program must agree to serve for \n     a minimum of three years. Participants can receive up to \n     $10,000 per year and a total of up to $60,000; these amounts \n     are identical to the limitations in the program for federal \n     employees. Subsection (h) authorizes $25 million for fiscal \n     year 2006 and such sums as may be necessary for each \n     succeeding fiscal year.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the introduction \nof the ANTI-Gang Act with my good friends on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenators Durbin, Kennedy and Feingold.\n  The American Neighborhoods Taking the Initiative-Guarding Against \nNeighborhood Gangs Act of 2005 is a bill carefully crafted to target \nviolent criminal street gangs whose activities extend beyond the \nneighborhood and have a substantial impact on Federal interests.\n  As a former county prosecutor, I have long expressed concern about \nmaking Federal crimes out of every offense that comes to the attention \nof Congress. I know that States have competent and able police \ndepartments, county sheriffs' offices, prosecutors and judges. Gangs \nare, more often than not, locally-based, geographically-oriented \ncriminal associations, and our local communities are on the front lines \nof the fight against gang violence. We should be supplementing the work \nof our State and local law enforcement officers, not usurping them. \nThis is why this bill specifically targets only those gangs where there \nis a provable Federal interest. This is why this bill requires \nconsultation with our State and local counterparts before embarking on \na Federal prosecution of historically State crimes. And this is why \nmajor provisions of the bill are directed toward helping State and \nlocal law enforcement officers prevent, investigate, and prosecute gang \ncrimes in their own neighborhoods.\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\n  There are four major sections of the bill: first, the bill gives \nState and local prosecutors financial resources to guard against \nneighborhood gangs by authorizing $62.5 million for the cooperative \nprevention, investigation, and prosecution of gang crimes; $50 million \nfor grants to develop gang prevention, research, and intervention \nservices; and $60 million for the protection of witnesses and victims \nof gang crimes. Federal funds are provided for hiring new Assistant \nU.S. Attorneys and to fund technology, equipment and training grants to \nincrease accurate identification of gang members and violent offenders \nand to maintain databases with such information to facilitate state and \nfederal coordination.\n  The first defense in protecting our youth against gang influence is a \ngood offense. I have long thought that programs aimed at combating gang \nactivity must incorporate gang prevention and education--programs that \nwould examine why our youth choose to associate in gangs and prey on \nothers--to be effective. When Senator Hatch appropriately targeted gang \nviolence as a subject for a full Judiciary Committee hearing in 2003, \nall agreed that we should be doing more to deter our youth from joining \ngangs in the first place. This bill heeds that call.\n  Another unifying theme of the expert witnesses at the Committee's \nhearing was the serious need for Federal assistance in protecting \nwitnesses who will provide information about and testify against gangs \nfrom intimidation. Our bill not only provides funding to help protect \nwitnesses, it also makes it a Federal crime to intimidate witnesses in \ncertain State prosecutions involving gang activity.\n  Second, the bill defines a Federal criminal street gang by using \nwell-established legal principles and providing recognizable limits. \nRather than create yet another cumbersome and broad-reaching Federal \ncrime that overlaps with numerous existing Federal statutes, this bill \nactually targets the problem that needs to be addressed: violent \ncriminal street gangs. It recognizes that gangs are ongoing entities \nwhose members commit crimes more easily simply because of their \nassociation with one another. Gangs prove the old adage: there is \nsafety in numbers. Gang members can be sheep-like in their loyalty and \nallegiance to the gang. In this regard, the bill also explicitly and \nevenhandedly addresses the evidentiary significance of gang symbolism \nin gang prosecutions\n  In addition to witness intimidation, other important crimes \nestablished by this bill include: 1. participation in criminal street \ngangs by any act that is intended to effect the criminal activities of \nthe gang; 2. participation by committing a crime in furtherance of or \nfor the benefit of the gang, and 3. recruitment and retention of gang \nmembers. There are increased penalties for those who target minors for \nrecruitment in a criminal street gang.\n  Third, the bill requires a comprehensive report on the current \ntreatment of juveniles by the States, and the capability of the Federal \ncriminal justice system to take on these additional cases and house \nadditional prisoners, so that Congress can make an informed decision \nabout whether or not to expand the Federal role in prosecuting juvenile \noffenders.\n  Some have suggested that the Federal Government has been unable to \nproceed effectively against gang crime because of Federal law's \nprotections for juvenile offenders. I have not seen sufficient evidence \nto support this claim, but I think that Congressional consideration of \nthis issue would benefit greatly from a comprehensive General \nAccounting Office study on this topic. We need to know both whether \njustice would be served by increasing the Federal role, and whether the \nFederal system--including both our prosecutors and the Bureau of \nPrisons--is prepared for such a step.\n  Fourth, the bill promotes the recruitment and retention of highly-\nqualified State and local prosecutors and public defenders by \nestablishing a student loan forgiveness program modeled after the \ncurrent program for Federal employees.\n  We have worked very hard in crafting this legislation not to further \nblur the lines between Federal and State law enforcement \nresponsibilities or to add more burdens to the FBI as the primary \nFederal investigative agency. Federal law enforcement has been faced \nwith a unique challenge since the September 11 attacks. The FBI is no \nlonger just an enforcement agency, but also has a critical terrorism \nprevention mission. This mission is a daunting one, and our Federal law \nenforcement resources are not limitless. I, for one, do not want the \nFBI or U.S. Attorneys to focus these limited resources on cases that \nare best handled at the local level.\n  Combating gang violence should not be a partisan battle. The tragedy \nof gang violence affects too many. No community can afford to lose a \nsingle youth to the arms of a waiting gang. No gang should be allowed \nto flourish without consequence in our communities. I urge the Senate's \nsupport for this important bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join my colleagues \nSenator Durbin, Senator Leahy, and Senator Feingold in introducing this \nimportant legislation, the ANTI-GANG Act.\n  Gang violence is a serious problem in many communities across the \nNation, and it deserves a serious response by Congress. The keys to \nsuccess include aggressive steps to take guns out of the hands of \ncriminal gang members and other violent juvenile offenders, and \neffective prevention programs that discourage gang membership and \nprovide realistic alternatives for at-risk youth.\n  As one example of what works, I urge my colleagues to consider the \ninnovative, cooperative crime-fighting strategy developed in Boston. It \nengaged the entire community, including police and probation officers, \nclergy and community leaders, and even gang members in a united effort \nto reduce gang violence, strengthen after-school prevention programs, \nand take guns out of the hands of juvenile offenders.\n  The project also established new and effective channels of \ncommunication between the police and neighborhood leaders. This \nstrategy was very successful--juvenile homicides dropped 80 percent \nfrom 1990 to 1995. It succeeded without prosecuting more juveniles as \nadults, without housing nonviolent juvenile offenders in adult \nfacilities, and without spending large sums of money on new juvenile \nfacilities.\n  The Massachusetts Legislature's Joint Committee on Public Safety \nissued a report last January which concluded unequivocally that \nsuccessful anti-gang programs depend on a ``wide variety of \nsolutions.'' Relying on recommendations by the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention, the report noted that ``preventing \nyouth from joining gangs is the most cost-effective long-term \nstrategy.'' Reflecting the input from an investigative hearing and a \nworking group of ten mayors in metropolitan Boston, the report \nrecognized that there is ``no silver bullet for combating gang \nviolence.''\n  It would be a mistake for Congress to ignore these successful efforts \nto stop gang violence. Since different communities may find different \nways to combat these difficult issues, the bill does not adopt a one-\nsize-fits-all approach that will only make the current problem of gang \nviolence worse. Instead of ignoring the primary role of State and local \ngovernments in fighting violent gang crimes in their communities, our \nANTI-GANG Act strengthens that role, by giving local law enforcement \nand prosecutors the resources they need by authorizing $862 million in \ngrants over the next 5 years.\n  The provisions in the bill for witness relocation and protection are \nparticularly important. Our bill meets this need by authorizing $60 \nmillion in assistance. The urgency of preventing witness intimidation \nin gang-related cases can not be overstated. Effective prosecution of \nsuch violence depends upon it.\n  In addition, our bill amends the current law on Federal witness \nrelocation and protection to make clear that the Attorney General can \nuse these provisions to protect witnesses in State gang, drug, and \nhomicide cases. We also permit States to obtain the temporary \nprotection of witnesses in gang cases, without any requirement of \nreimbursement. The current complex reimbursement procedures deter State \nand local prosecutors from obtaining assistance for witness protection \nfrom the Federal government, even in emergencies.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act respects the primary role of State and local \ngovernments in fighting street crime, but it\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\nalso recognizes that violent gangs can have a substantial impact on \nFederal interests. According to the most recent National Drug Threat \nAssessment, criminal street gangs are responsible for the distribution \nof much of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and other illegal \ndrugs being distributed in communities throughout the United States. \nSuch gang activity interferes with lawful commerce and undermines the \nfreedom and security of entire communities.\n  The Act strengthens the ability of prosecutors at all levels--\nFederal, State and local--to prosecute violent street gangs, and it \ndoes so without increasing mandatory minimum sentences or unnecessarily \nexpanding the Federal death penalty to include State murder offenses.\n  Finally, the Act encourages the recruitment and retention of highly-\nqualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a student \nloan forgiveness program modeled on the current program for Federal \nemployees. According to the National District Attorneys Association, \nthis provision ``would allow prosecutors to relieve the crushing burden \nof student loans that now cause so many young attorneys to abandon \npublic service.'' The provision is also strongly supported by the \nNational Legal Aid and Defender Association and the American Council of \nChief Defenders.\n  I commend my colleagues for their leadership in developing this \nimportant legislation to protect American communities from gang \nviolence without undermining fundamental principles of fairness and \nFederal-State relations. I urge the Senate to adopt this approach, and \nresist any suggestion that we need to federalize the State and local \njuvenile justice systems in our country.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the ANTI-GANG \nAct, introduced today by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin. \nThis critical legislation will provide State and Federal law \nenforcement with the tools and resources needed to successfully fight \nthe expanding presence of violent gangs that bring drugs like \nmethamphetamine into our communities.\n  Time and time again, we in Congress have heard the call of \nprosecutors and law enforcement for more resources to combat the \nproblem of gang violence. The ANTI-GANG Act gives local prosecutors and \nlaw enforcement what they have asked Congress for most--targeted \nfinancial assistance. The bill will help combat the growth and \nproliferation of violent gangs by authorizing funds for the cooperative \nprevention, investigation, and prosecution of gang crimes. In addition, \ngrant money will be made available for the protection of witnesses and \nvictims of gang violence. These funds will not be tied to restrictive \nformulas that would keep the majority of the assistance from reaching \nsuburban and rural communities. This money will be able to go to the \ncommunities in Wisconsin and the rest of the country where rural and \nsmaller law enforcement agencies are financially limited in their \nability to deal with the exploding increase in gang violence associated \nwith methamphetamines and other narcotics.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also promotes hiring and long-term service of \nhighly qualified prosecutors and public defenders by establishing a \nstudent loan forgiveness program. Prosecuting gangs is some of the most \ndemanding and challenging work a prosecutor will tackle. Loan \nforgiveness will allow the recruitment of the very best Assistant \nDistrict Attorneys and Assistant Attorneys General and allow them to \nremain in public service longer so they can use their wealth of \nexperience to combat gang violence.\n  The ANTI-GANG Act also replaces the current Federal RICO statute, \nwhich was never intended to be used against violent street gangs, with \na tough statute that not only criminalizes participation in criminal \nstreet gangs, but also addresses the serious problem of the recruitment \nand retention of gang members. The ANTI-GANG Act targets gang violence \nand gang crimes in a logical, straightforward manner. The bill also \nrecognizes that the vast majority of gang investigations and \nprosecutions have been and will continue to be done at the State and \nlocal level. The bill requires that Federal prosecutors consult with \nState and local law enforcement and certify that a Federal prosecution \nis in the public interest\n  Finally, the ANTI-GANG Act will provide Congress with the data \nnecessary to decide whether to expand the Federal role in prosecuting \njuvenile offenders by requiring a comprehensive report on the current \ntreatment of juveniles by the States and the capability of the Federal \ncriminal justice system to take on more juvenile cases and to house \nadditional young prisoners. Some have proposed indicting and \nprosecuting more juveniles in Federal courts as a way of combating gang \nviolence. It is very hard to know whether this will work, and what \neffect if might have on the criminal justice system. With the review \nrequired by the ANTI-GANG Act, Congress can intelligently consider \nwhether to expand to Federal role in prosecuting juveniles.\n  We all know that the gang problem is a serious one, and that it is \nonly getting worse. Other members of Congress have proposed different \napproaches to combating the gang problem, and the House of \nRepresentatives has passed its own gang bill. But the ANTI-GANG Act is \nthe approach most responsive to the needs of State and local \nprosecutors who are on the ground fighting this problem, day in and \nday. Other approaches go down the wrong path.\n  State and Federal prosecutors have not demanded unchecked and \nincreased Federal jurisdiction over State crimes that diminishes the \nStates' historic and primary role in fighting violent street gangs. \nThey did not come to us seeking new and expanded Federal death penalty \ncrimes, but rather effective laws that focus on the recruitment and \nretention of gang members. They never mentioned needing a massive and \nunwarranted reworking of the Federal rules used to prosecute juveniles \nas adults, regardless of whether the juvenile is in a gang or not. And, \nto my knowledge, no prosecutors have put increased mandatory minimums \ntargeted at first offenders on their wish list. All of these approaches \nsound tough, but they aren't what prosecutors and law enforcement have \nasked for and they won't solve the gang problem.\n  Our citizens should be able to send their children to school, use \ntheir parks, and walk their streets without fearing that gang violence \nwill grow unfettered in their community. The ANTI-GANG Act is an \nimportant step towards making all of our neighborhoods safe. I am proud \nto cosponsor it and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 1323. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located on Lindbald Avenue, Girdwood, Alaska, as the ``Dorothy \nand Connie Hibbs Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Dorothy Hibbs came to Girdwood in 1952 \nand was its Postmaster from 1954-1976. During this time, the Post \nOffice was housed in a two-story hotel called The Little Dipper. Mail \ncame into Girdwood via train. The train would slow down and throw the \nsack of mail to Dorothy who would be waiting by the tracks. \nUnfortunately, this building burned down during the 1964 earthquake. \nAfter the Post Office burned, the operation moved to Dorothy's home \nuntil another building could be acquired.\n  Connie Hibbs began her love for the post office at a young age when \nher mother, Dorothy, was Postmaster of Girdwood. Because of her hard \nwork and efforts, Connie became the Girdwood Postmaster in 1979 and \nheld that position until 2005.\n  Connie came with her mother to Girdwood in 1952 and remained for 52 \nyears. While her mother was Postmaster, Connie helped in the Post \nOffice and at the age of thirteen began making money orders and sorting \nmail. Girdwood and the Post Office have always been a part of Connie's \nlife. Connie says she loves Girdwood. It is her town. She spent the \nmost wonderful years of her life there as the Postmaster and a ``Post \nOffice Kid.''\n  Connie and Dorothy believe in the importance of the Postal Service \nand the need to enhance the service in Girdwood. It is only appropriate \nthat we honor them by dedicating the Girdwood Post Office after them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\n  S. 1324. A bill to reduce and prevent childhood obesity by \nencouraging schools and school districts to develop and implement \nlocal, school-based programs designed to reduce and prevent childhood \nobesity, promote increased physical activity, and improve nutritional \nchoices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 1325. A bill to establish grants to provide health services for \nimproved nutrition, increased physical activity, obesity and eating \ndisorder prevention, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, obesity ranks among the most serious health \nproblems facing America today.\n  Since 1970, the percentage of overweight children between 6 and 19 \nhas quadrupled. Today, nearly one out of three children is overweight \nand about one in six is obese.\n  Obese children develop type II diabetes at an alarming rate and they \ncan begin puberty as early as age seven. Over 70 percent of obese \nchildren become overweight or obese adults. And, obesity in adults can \nhave catastrophic effects--including heart disease, cancer, and stroke \nat very high rates. The medical profession knows this.\n  In the last several weeks, the American Medical Association has \nissued new guidelines for fighting obesity. And earlier this week, a \ngroup of economists reported that nearly 12 percent of all health care \nspending stems from obesity.\n  Obesity threatens our health, it threatens our future. And \nsuccessfully addressing it requires action.\n  Dealing with it requires national leadership and community level \ncommitment.\n  Through continued public education campaigns, we have reduced youth \nsmoking. And I'm convinced we can do the same with obesity. That's why \nI'm reintroducing two bills to confront the challenge.\n  The first is called the Childhood Obesity Reduction Act: it will give \nthe obesity crisis the attention it deserves. I am grateful to my \ncolleague Senator Wyden for his work in cosponsoring it.\n  The bill has two major components: first, it will establish a bi-\npartisan Congressional Council on Childhood Obesity which will evaluate \nplans to fight this health problem and give awards to ``Congressional \nChallenge Winners.''\n  Second, it will establish a private, non-profit foundation to fight \nobesity around the country.\n  The second bill, the Improved Nutrition and Physical Activity Act of \n2005, or IMPACT, will provide the resources we need to fight obesity \neverywhere in the country.\n  This bill, which Senators Bingaman, Dodd, and Clinton have joined me \nin sponsoring, commits us to three policies: first, we'll train more \nhealth professionals in the problems associated with being overweight \nand ways that they can help Americans fight obesity.\n  Second, we will mobilize America's community organizations to fight \nthis problem. Through education, outreach, and intervention, schools, \nnon-profits, and churches will get the resource they need to fight \nobesity. We will also give States more flexibility to use existing \ngrant programs to fight obesity.\n  Finally, we will redouble our efforts to collect information about \nobesity's extent, consequences, costs, and the ways we can deal with \nthem.\n  Obesity stems from a combination of behavior, environment, and \ngenetics. We cannot and should not expect any single Federal effort to \nend it. Much of the work in fighting obesity will depend on families \nand communities.\n  And both the Childhood Obesity Reduction Act and IMPACT 2005 bill \nwill give this crisis the attention . . . and the resources . . . it \ndeserves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Childhood Obesity Reduction \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, obesity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading \n     preventable cause of death.\n       (2) In 1999, 13 percent of children aged 6 to 11 years and \n     14 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in the United \n     States were overweight. This prevalence has nearly tripled \n     for adolescents in the past 2 decades.\n       (3) Risk factors for heart disease, such as high \n     cholesterol and high blood pressure, occur with increased \n     frequency in overweight children and adolescents compared to \n     children with a healthy weight.\n       (4) Type 2 diabetes, previously considered an adult \n     disease, has increased dramatically in children and \n     adolescents. Overweight and obesity are closely linked to \n     type 2 diabetes.\n       (5) Obesity in children and adolescents is generally caused \n     by a lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, or \n     a combination of the 2, with genetics and lifestyle both \n     playing important roles in determining a child's weight.\n       (6) Overweight adolescents have a 70 percent chance of \n     becoming overweight or obese adults.\n       (7) The 2001 report ``The Surgeon General's Call to Action \n     to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity'' suggested \n     that obesity and its complications were already costing the \n     United States $117,000,000,000 annually.\n       (8) Substantial evidence shows that public health risks can \n     be reduced through increased public awareness and community \n     involvement.\n       (9) Congress needs to challenge students, teachers, school \n     administrators, and local communities to voluntarily \n     participate in the development and implementation of \n     activities to successfully reduce and prevent childhood \n     obesity.\n\n          TITLE I--CONGRESSIONAL COUNCIL ON CHILDHOOD OBESITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improved Nutrition and \n     Physical Activity Act'' or the ``IMPACT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In July 2004, the Secretary of Health and Human Service \n     recognized ``obesity is a critical public health problem in \n     our country'' and under the medicare program language was \n     removed from the coverage manual stating that obesity is not \n     an illness.\n       (2) The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey \n     for 2002 found that an estimated 65 percent of adults are \n     overweight and 31 percent of adults are obese and 16 percent \n     of children and adolescents in the United States are \n     overweight or obese.\n       (3) The Institute of Medicine reported in ``Preventing \n     Childhood Obesity'' (2004) that approximately 60 percent of \n     obese children between 5 and 10 years of age have at least \n     one cardiovascular disease risk factor and 25 percent have \n     two or more such risk factors.\n       (4) The Institute of Medicine reports that the prevalence \n     of overweight and obesity is increasing among all age groups. \n     There is twice the number of overweight children between 2 \n     and 5 years of age and adolescents between 12 and 19 years of \n     age, and 3 times the number of children between 6 and 11 \n     years of age as there were 30 years ago.\n       (5) According to the 2004 Institute of Medicine report, \n     obesity-associated annual hospital costs for children and \n     youth more than tripled over 2 decades, rising from \n     $35,000,000 in the period 1979 through 1981 to $127,000,000 \n     in the period 1997 through 1999.\n       (6) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \n     have estimated that as many as 365,000 deaths a year are \n     associated with being overweight or obese. Overweight and \n     obesity are associated with an increased risk for heart \n     disease (the leading cause of death), cancer (the second \n     leading cause of death), diabetes (the 6th leading cause of \n     death), and musculoskeletal disorders.\n       (7) According to the National Institute of Diabetes and \n     Digestive and Kidney Diseases, individuals who are obese have \n     a 50 to 100 percent increased risk of premature death.\n       (8) The Healthy People 2010 goals identify overweight and \n     obesity as one of the Nation's leading health problems and \n     include objectives for increasing the proportion of adults \n     who are at a healthy weight, reducing the proportion of \n     adults who are obese, and reducing the proportion of children \n     and adolescents who are overweight or obese.\n       (9) Another goal of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate \n     health disparities among different segments of the \n     population. Obesity is a health problem that \n     disproportionally impacts medically underserved populations.\n       (10) The 2005 Surgeon General's report ``The Year of the \n     Healthy Child'' lists the treatment and prevention of obesity \n     as a national priority.\n       (11) The Institute of Medicine report ``Preventing \n     Childhood Obesity'' (2004) finds that ``childhood obesity is \n     a serious nationwide health problem requiring urgent \n     attention and a population-based prevention approach . . .''.\n       (12) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates the annual expenditures related to overweight and \n     obesity in adults in the United States to be $264,000,000,000 \n     (exceeding the cost of tobacco-related illnesses) and appears \n     to be rising dramatically. This cost can potentially escalate \n     markedly as obesity rates continue to rise and the medical \n     complications of obesity are emerging at even younger ages. \n     Therefore, the total disease burden will most likely \n     increase, as well as the attendant health-related costs.\n       (13) Weight control programs should promote a healthy \n     lifestyle including regular physical activity and healthy \n     eating, as consistently discussed and identified in a variety \n     of public and private consensus documents, including the 2001 \n     U.S. Surgeon General's report ``A Call To Action'' and other \n     documents prepared by the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and other agencies.\n\n[[Page S7535]]\n\n       (14) The Institute of Medicine reports that poor eating \n     habits are a risk factor for the development of eating \n     disorders and obesity. In 2002, more than 35,000,000 \n     Americans experienced limited access to nutritious food on a \n     regular basis. The availability of high-calorie, low nutrient \n     foods have increased in low-income neighborhoods due to many \n     factors.\n       (15) Effective interventions for promoting healthy eating \n     behaviors should promote healthy lifestyle and not \n     inadvertently promote unhealthy weight management techniques.\n       (16) The National Institutes of Health reports that eating \n     disorders are commonly associated with substantial \n     psychological problems, including depression, substance \n     abuse, and suicide.\n       (17) The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and \n     Associated Disorders estimates there are 8,000,000 Americans \n     experience eating disorders. Eating disorders of all types \n     are more common in women than men\n       (18) The health risks of Binge Eating Disorder are those \n     associated with obesity and include heart disease, gall \n     bladder disease, and diabetes.\n       (19) According to the National Institute of Mental Health, \n     Binge Eating Disorder is characterized by frequent episodes \n     of uncontrolled overeating, with an estimated 2 to 5 percent \n     of Americans experiencing this disorder in a 6-month period.\n       (20) Additionally, the National Institute of Mental Health \n     reports that Anorexia Nervosa, an eating disorder from which \n     0.5 to 3.7 percent of American women will suffer in their \n     lifetime, is associated with serious health consequences \n     including heart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, and \n     death. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, \n     Anorexia Nervosa has one of the highest mortality rates of \n     all psychiatric disorders, placing a young woman with \n     Anorexia Nervosa at 12 times the risk of death of other women \n     her age.\n       (21) In 2001, the National Institute of Mental Health \n     reported that 1.1 to 4.2 percent of American women will \n     suffer from Bulimia Nervosa in their lifetime. Bulimia \n     Nervosa is an eating disorder that is associated with \n     cardiac, gastrointestinal, and dental problems, including \n     irregular heartbeats, gastric ruptures, peptic ulcers, and \n     tooth decay.\n       (22) On the 2003 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 6 percent of \n     high school students reported recent use of laxatives or \n     vomiting to control their weight.\n\n                        TITLE I--TRAINING GRANTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, across this country, on couches in front of \ntelevisions and video game consoles, a silent killer called obesity is \nstalking America's youngsters--in epidemic numbers. Today, Senator \nFrist and I are introducing a bipartisan bill, ``The Childhood Obesity \nReduction Act'', to jump-start a nationwide, community-based campaign \nagainst this menace and help our children grow up healthy.\n  In my home State of Oregon, obesity may well become the number-two \nkiller of our citizens--after tobacco, also the number-one killer \nnationally. According to the Oregon Department of Human Services, fully \n22 percent of the adults in Oregon are obese and 60 percent are \noverweight. Even more tragic, and why we are here today, is that U.S. \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says at least 31 \npercent of low income children between two and five years of age in \nOregon are overweight or at risk of becoming overweight. A lot of those \noverweight kids are going to become overweight and obese adults if we \njust sit on our hands today. Our children are beginning to show signs \nof devastating diseases that will only lead to a life-long illnesses \nand increased health care costs. And no statistic can measure the \nemotional toll that illness takes on a child, their families and others \nwho love them.\n  The Frist-Wyden legislation, ``The Childhood Obesity Reduction Act'', \nwill work to turn the tide against childhood obesity in two ways. \nFirst, it will give teachers, parents and other community leaders a \none-stop shop to fight obesity. The Congressional council created by \nthis bill will launch a comprehensive website to help everyone from \nPhysical Education teachers to scout leaders learn what's working in \nschools and public-private programs. It will also offer information \nabout how to connect with those successful programs and how to adapt \nthem in their own schools.\n  For example, when a teacher wants to see what can be done to help \nkids get 30 minutes of activity, something that studies have shown \nhelps to combat childhood obesity, that teacher could go to the website \nand see what others in a similar situation have done. They would be \nable to see there are partners like Nike who are willing to step up to \nthe plate and help with programs. But that teacher might also see that \nphysical activity is only one part of the solution and they might find \nways to bring in the nutritional aspect as well through other programs \nthat have already proven successful.\n  The website will also offer help in establishing goals for cutting \nchildhood obesity at that school or in that community--and all these \nplans will have been evaluated by outside experts for their \neffectiveness.\n  Second, after two years, the Congressional council turns the work \nover to a brand-new foundation. The foundation will keep the one-stop \nwebsite up and running. But at the same time, they'll be able to raise \nmoney, and use it to reward programs that work and fund programs that \nare sorely needed where childhood obesity threatens most.\n  Here's an example of how the second component of our bill would work: \nsay an urban school wants to work on getting kids to choose vegetables \ninstead of French fries. When they visit the Web site, they may find a \nsuccessful program about actually growing fresh vegetables--so they \ndon't think vegetables just come from a freezer or a can. The \nFoundation will have the wherewithal to do more than just share that \ninformation--they may be able to provide the seed money, literally, for \na school garden that will grow fresh produce, and change the way those \nchildren look at food.\n  It is not realistic to think that children won't be in a situation \nwhere unhealthy choices for foods and snacks are available. The goal \nought to be to help them know what the healthy choices are, how to \nbalance what they eat and drink and to know that they need exercise. \nAnd the Foundation can keep pursuing those goals for the long term.\n  I believe that our bipartisan bill is significant for two reasons. \nFirst, it emphasizes both sides of the equation--the need for proper \nnutrition and the need for physical activity. Second, it and because it \nwill create an immediate, one-stop resource, in the form of a Web site, \nabout what we know is working now so that individuals can begin to \nmobilize their communities and help their children. These are also \nimportant steps in assisting our children to become healthy adults.\n  All of us have the same, simple goal here: getting America's children \nhealthy. There are a lot of folks competing for our kids' attention in \nthis arena. A lot of the competition is pretty attractive: food that's \nnot so nutritious but sure tastes good, and video games that don't burn \nany calories but can occupy you for an entire afternoon. It's tough for \nkids to make good choices on their own. That's why it's time to \nmobilize this nation--and particularly this Congress, by way of \nlegislation--to beat the epidemic of obesity plaguing our children.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to reintroduce the Improved \nNutrition and Physical Activity Act or the IMPACT Act today with my \ncolleagues Senators Frist, Bingaman, and Dodd. This legislation would \ntake several important steps toward promoting healthy eating and \nphysical activity and combating obesity and eating disorders. Eating \ndisorders and obesity have become serious and 2 growing public health \nconcerns in our country. Childhood obesity has emerged as an important \nissue in the public, as we have seen a significant increase in the \nnumber of Americans who are overweight or obese. Today, more than 15 \npercent of children and adolescents are considered seriously \noverweight. We know that obesity and the lack of exercise are directly \nlinked with a broad array of health problems, including heart disease, \nhigh blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis-related disabilities, \ndepression and some cancers.\n  In New York State alone, almost 60 percent of adults are overweight \nor obese, while 43 percent of the children in New York City's public \nelementary schools are overweight and a quarter qualify as obese. Obese \nadults incur significantly higher annual medical expenditures than \nthose of normal weight adults. The cost now rivals that attributable to \nsmoking. I believe that while nutrition education is one part of the \nsolution to the obesity problem facing our youth, it is not enough to \nsimply say that childhood obesity is caused by eating too much junk \nfood. Instead, we must be aware of the complex environmental, genetic, \nand behavioral factors that have influenced the epidemic.\n  Included among the factors that affect children's eating habits and \nactivity levels are increased hours in front of the TV or computer, \nworking parents spending more hours at the office trying to make ends \nmeet, deteriorating healthfulness or foods available in schools, \nreduced access to recess and physical education in schools, changes in \nthe physical design of neighborhoods and communities, and low self \nesteem. And sadly, as the number of people battling obesity has \nincreased, eating disorders have also reached epidemic proportions in \nthe United States. It is estimated that between 8 and 10 million people \nexperience an eating disorder, with millions of new cases being \ndiagnosed each year. Eating disorders do not discriminate--they affect \nmen and women or all ages, racial and ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic \nclasses, and religions.\n  Eating disorders are linked to a variety of health problems including \nheart failure, kidney failure, osteoporosis, gastric ruptures, and \ndeath. Eating disorders are also often associated with a variety of \nmental health problems including depression, substance abuse, and \nsuicide. The age of onset for these disorders is getting younger and \nyounger. According to the Center for Mental Health Services, 90 percent \nof those who have an eating disorder are women between the ages of 12 \nand 25.\n  Research indicates that 50 percent of females between the ages of 11 \nand 13 see themselves as overweight, and by the age of 13, eighty \npercent have attempted to lose weight. We know that the most common \nbehavior that will lead to an eating disorder is dieting. In fact, 51 \npercent of 9 and 10 year old\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\ngirls report feeling better about themselves when they are on a diet. \nIt is estimated that currently as many as 17 percent of high school \nstudents have been diagnosed with an eating disorder. Our youth today \nare striving to reach an unrealistic body ideal. Fears of falling short \nof this ideal are leading to dire consequences. That is why I am proud \nto co-sponsor of the IMPACT Act.\n  This legislation would take several important steps toward promoting \nhealthy eating and physical activity to combat obesity and eating \ndisorders. This legislation addresses the growing public health \nproblems of increasing rates of obesity and eating disorders by: \ntraining students and health professionals to diagnose, treat and \nprevent obesity, overweight, and eating disorders; funding \ndemonstration programs that promote healthy eating behaviors and \nphysical activity to prevent eating disorders, obesity and being \noverweight, and related serious and chronic medical conditions; \ndirecting the Center for Disease Control to collect information \nregarding fitness levels and energy expenditure among children; \nauthorizing the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality to review all research carried out under this act and include \nsuch information, where it is relevant, in its health disparities \nreport; allowing states to use their Preventive Services Block Grant \nmoney to address and prevent overweight, obesity, and eating disorders; \nmandating a report on obesity and eating disorders research; \nauthorizing a report on the effectiveness of a National Public \nEducation Campaign on changing children's behaviors and reducing \nobesity.\n  Each of these steps is needed to address our country's growing \nproblems of obesity and eating disorders. Any comprehensive approach to \npromote healthy lifestyles and prevent disordered eating in our youth \nmust be multifaceted. It must include education about nutrition and \nphysical activity, and most importantly, it must encourage open \ncommunication about body image and self esteem. Such an effort will \nrequire the leadership and resources of healthcare providers, local \ncommunities, advocacy organizations, parents and families, and schools.\n  It is time that we promote and celebrate healthy bodies and healthy \nlifestyles regardless of size, weight indexes, or arbitrary numbers on \na scale. This is a delicate task and we must make sure not to let an \nunhealthy emphasis on thinness jeopardize the health of our children. I \nlook forward to working with all of my Senate colleagues to promote \nhealthy lifestyles across the lifespan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7538-1", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 182--SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO INCREASE CHILDHOOD CANCER \n                   AWARENESS, TREATMENT, AND RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Allen, \nMrs. Lincoln, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Reed, Mr. Salazar, and Ms. Mikulski) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 182\n\n       Whereas an estimated 12,400 children will be diagnosed with \n     cancer in the year 2005;\n       Whereas cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in \n     children under age 15;\n       Whereas an estimated 2,300 children will die from cancer in \n     the year 2005;\n       Whereas the incidence of cancer among children in the \n     United States is rising by about one percent each year;\n       Whereas 1 in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age \n     20;\n       Whereas approximately 8 percent of deaths of those between \n     1 and 19 years of age are caused by cancer;\n       Whereas while some progress has been made, a number of \n     opportunities for childhood cancer research still remain \n     unfunded or underfunded;\n       Whereas limited resources for childhood cancer research can \n     hinder the recruitment of investigators and physicians to \n     pediatric oncology;\n       Whereas peer-reviewed clinical trials are the standard of \n     care for pediatrics and have improved cancer survival rates \n     among children;\n       Whereas the number of survivors of childhood cancer \n     continues to grow, with about 1 in 640 adults between the \n     ages of 20 and 39 having a history of cancer;\n       Whereas up to \\2/3\\ of childhood cancer survivors are \n     likely to experience at least one late effect from treatment, \n     many of which may be life-threatening;\n       Whereas some late effects of cancer treatment are \n     identified early in follow-up and are easily resolved, while \n     others may become chronic problems in adulthood and may have \n     serious consequences; and\n       Whereas 89 percent of children with cancer experience \n     substantial suffering in the last month of life: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Congress \n     should support--\n       (1) public and private sector efforts to promote awareness \n     about the incidence of cancer among children, the signs and \n     symptoms of cancer in children, treatment options, and long-\n     term follow-up;\n       (2) increased public and private investment in childhood \n     cancer research to improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment, \n     rehabilitation, post-treatment monitoring, and long-term \n     survival;\n       (3) policies that provide incentives to encourage medical \n     trainees and investigators to enter the field of pediatric \n     oncology;\n       (4) policies that provide incentives to encourage the \n     development of drugs and biologics designed to treat \n     pediatric cancers;\n       (5) policies that encourage participation in clinical \n     trials;\n       (6) medical education curricula designed to improve pain \n     management for cancer patients; and\n       (7) policies that enhance education, services, and other \n     resources related to late effects from treatment.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, over 12,000 children are diagnosed with \ncancer each year and sadly, cancer will claim the lives of over 2,000 \nof these children each year. Today, I am proud to be submitting the \nChildhood Cancer Awareness Resolution with my friends Senators \nLieberman, Brownback, Allen, Lincoln, Landrieu, Salazar, Reed, and \nMikulski to help raise awareness about childhood cancer and support \nchildren and their families who are suffering from this terrible \ndisease.\n  Cancer is the number one disease killer of children. Every day 43 \nchildren will be diagnosed and approximately 10 of those children will \nnot survive.\n  Until we meet the day when every child can live a life free of \ncancer, we must continue to promote awareness and strengthen our \ninvestment in childhood cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in raisipg awareness of \nchildhood cancer by supporting The Childhood Cancer Awareness \nResolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7538-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7538-S7539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 183--RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS \n     OF THE MIGRATORY BIRD COMMISSION ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 72ND \n ANNIVERSARY AND THE FIRST DAY OF SALE OF THE 2005-2006 MIGRATORY BIRD \n                     HUNTING AND CONSERVATION STAMP\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 154) designating October 21, 2005, as \n     ``National Mammography Day''.\n       A resolution (S. Res. 155) designating the week of November \n     6 through November 12, 2005, as ``National Veterans Awareness \n     Week'' to emphasize the need to develop educational programs \n     regarding the contributions of veterans to the country.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolutions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolutions and preambles be agreed to en bloc, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 154) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2005, \n     212,930 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,410 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were \n     diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly \n     500,000 of those cases, the cancer resulted in death;\n       Whereas African-American women suffer a 30 percent greater \n     mortality rate from breast cancer than White women and more \n     than a 100 percent greater mortality rate from breast cancer \n     than women from Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian \n     populations;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide safe screening and early \n     detection of breast cancer in many women;\n       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early \n     detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year \n     survival rate of more than 97 percent;\n       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American \n     Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and\n       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends \n     that each woman and her health care provider make an \n     individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 21, 2005, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate programs and activities.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 155) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 155\n\n       Whereas tens of millions of Americans have served in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States during the past century;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Americans have given their \n     lives while serving in the Armed Forces during the past \n     century;\n       Whereas the contributions and sacrifices of the men and \n     women who served in the Armed Forces have been vital in \n     maintaining the freedoms and way of life enjoyed by the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas the advent of the all-volunteer Armed Forces has \n     resulted in a sharp decline in the number of individuals and \n     families who have had any personal connection with the Armed \n     Forces;\n       Whereas this reduction in familiarity with the Armed Forces \n     has resulted in a marked decrease in the awareness by young \n     people of the nature and importance of the accomplishments of \n     those who have served in the Armed Forces, despite the \n     current educational efforts of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs and the veterans service organizations;\n       Whereas the system of civilian control of the Armed Forces \n     makes it essential that the future leaders of the Nation \n     understand the history of military action and the \n     contributions and sacrifices of those who conduct such \n     actions; and\n       Whereas, on November 9, 2004, President George W. Bush \n     issued a proclamation urging all the people of the United \n     States to observe November 7 through November 13, 2004, as \n     ``National Veterans Awareness Week'': Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) designates the week of November 6 through November \n     12, 2005, as ``National Veterans Awareness Week''; and\n         (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate educational activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/06/28/senate-section/article/S7540-2", "month": "06", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29, 2005\n\n  Mr. BURNS.
