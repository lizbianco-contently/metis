Mr. President, we have a lot of activity going on, both on \nthe floor and also off the floor. We have several conference reports, \nin terms of appropriations bills--Homeland Security and Department of \nDefense. We are making real progress. We will address those next week. \nAn issue which I am constantly asked about by press and constituents is \nwhat progress is being made and how much progress is being made on the \nlegislation surrounding terrorist camps and terrorist military \ntribunals and terrorist surveillance. There is a lot of activity at the \ncommittee level. Negotiations are underway and, hopefully, we will be \nable to report back more on that later this afternoon.\n  Today, I believe most of the debate postcloture time will be used on \nborder security and on the issues surrounding immigration. We will have \nvotes on Monday and, I would say, they are likely Friday. As I have \nsaid each day this week, we may have to be in next Saturday. I urge our \ncolleagues to focus on accelerating their work at the committee level \nso we can finish at a reasonable time next week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the majority leader made a decision as \nto when we are going to vote Monday?\n  Mr. FRIST. Monday afternoon around 5 o'clock to 6:30. There have been \nseveral questions about that.\n  Mr. REID. The other question is, I recognize that other than delaying \nthings, if the majority wants to go home, that is what we do because we \nhave fewer votes than they have. But my Senators are asking, and staff \nis asking, is this Friday and Saturday the date that the majority is \ngoing to go home?\n  Mr. FRIST. Next Friday or Saturday.\n  Mr. REID. The reason I say that, if there is some anticipation that \nif things don't work out, we are going to go beyond next week, our \nfolks should know that.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is very important, Mr. President, that we keep \neverybody's schedules clear because there are campaigns going on. \nPeople need to get back to their States. It is our intent that we are \ngoing to stick with it. Unless there is an unforeseen emergency of some \nsort, we will finish next week. We will be out this month. My intention \nis to finish Friday, working with the Democratic leader in that regard. \nThere is very important business for us to do, and that should send a \nsignal that we have to keep our committees and conferences working for \nthe rest of today, tomorrow, and over the course of the weekend and \ninto next week.\n\n[[Page S9860]]\n\n  Unless there is something very surprising, I expect we will be out \nthis month. I would like for it to be Friday, but it may be Saturday.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader and I have had private conversations. \nIt is my further understanding that the majority leader is planning on \ncoming back the following Monday after the elections?\n  Mr. FRIST. The following week.\n  Mr. REID. Monday or Tuesday?\n  Mr. FRIST. Right. It is clear that over the next 8 or 9 days, we have \nunfinished business we absolutely must do. Looking at the calendar, \neither that Monday or Tuesday of the week following the elections, we \nwill be back in.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \ncome together to pass an update of the physician Medicare payments and \nto stop what will be over a 5-percent cut that will take place in \nJanuary if we do nothing.\n  We need to have a sense of urgency about this issue. Eighty Senators \non both sides of the aisle--80 out of 100--came together and signed a \nletter to our leader asking that a positive Medicare payment update for \n2007 happen before the Senate adjourns. Senator Reid spoke on the floor \nin support of that effort. I urge our Senate leader to come to the \nfloor, and in the final days of the session before we break for the \nelections do what 80 people in this Senate--80 Senators out of 100--\nhave come together and agreed physicians must be provided, which is a \npositive Medicare payment update for 2007.\n  I am deeply concerned that after the election we may or may not have \nthe focus in order to be able to get that done before the end of the \nyear. It is vital not just to physicians but to the people we \nrepresent--the seniors, people with disabilities--that we get this \ndone. Eighty Senators out of 100 have sent a letter to our two Senate \nleaders and have urged that we act now. Senator Reid has indicated his \nsupport for doing that. We need our Senate leader to bring this to the \nfloor so we can get it done.\n  I joined these 80 Senators in sending that letter in July because we \nknow that if we don't provide even a minimum update, we destabilize the \nMedicare system and put all patient access to health care at risk. That \nis not an understatement.\n  There needs to be a tremendous sense of urgency about this issue. \nWhat has happened since July 17 when we sent the letter? Nothing. There \nhas been no committee hearings, no markups--despite 80 Senators \nagreeing that we have a need to provide a minimum update for physician \nservices. There has been no effort by the majority leader to bring this \nissue to the floor. We have had no willingness to bring up an issue \nthat has incredible significance to tens of millions of Americans all \nacross our country.\n  I am here this morning because we have only 7 days or 8 days--\nwhatever the number is--left before we adjourn for the elections. We \ndon't know what will be happening after that. We certainly know there \nare many critical issues left and much to be done. The appropriations \nprocess isn't completed. There are many items on the agenda after the \nelection. It is very uncertain what will be happening. We know that \nright now we can get it done. We do know with certainty that come \nJanuary there is going to be a 5-percent cut for physicians and fewer \nphysicians being able to care for our seniors and people with \ndisabilities if we do not act.\n  With 80 people urging that we act, this should be a simple process. \nThis should be, as they say, a no-brainer to bring this to the floor \nand simply get it done. We need to do something today. There is no \nreason not to do this today. We can get it done quickly. Eighty \nSenators wrote:\n\n       The undersigned Members respectfully urge you to ensure \n     that these impending cuts are addressed before Congress \n     adjourns. At a minimum, we must provide physicians with a \n     positive Medicare payment update for 2007.\n\n  So we have the critical mass necessary to get this approved. The \nchange we are seeking in law directly tracks MedPAC's recommendation \nfor what the physician payment update should be for 2007. So we have a \nsolid policy. We have an overwhelming majority of Senators, based on \nsolid policy, and we know if we don't make this change, our seniors and \npeople with disabilities are going to lose access to their doctors.\n  We know from a recent survey conducted by the AMA that if the \nscheduled cuts go into effect, 45 percent of doctors will decrease the \nnumber of Medicare patients they accept. Fifty percent of doctors will \ndefer the purchase of health information technology which, I might add, \nis an area where we, under our budget jurisdictions for Medicare and \nMedicaid and other health care programs, will reap huge savings, \nhundreds of billions of dollars with health information technology. But \nyou cannot tell a physician who is trying to make ends meet to be able \nto continue to serve people that, by the way, we are going to cut your \npayments coming in, but we want you to buy new hardware and software \nand train people and do all of these other things so that the Federal \nGovernment can save dollars. It doesn't make any sense.\n  We also know that 37 percent of doctors practicing in rural \ncommunities--and in my great State of Michigan, we have a huge, \nbeautiful rural part of our State. I grew up in one of those small \ntowns, in Clare, in the northern low peninsula.\n  I understand about access to physicians and access to health care. We \nknow that 37 percent of doctors practicing in rural communities will be \nforced to discontinue rural outreach, and 43 percent of physicians will \ndecrease the number of new TRICARE patients they serve. So we clearly \nhave a need.\n  Also, we know that when we cut payments, whether it is to physicians, \nhospitals, home health care agencies, or nursing homes, we do not \nreally save any money. We just create more people who cannot get the \ncare they need when they need it. And what happens? They walk into the \nemergency room sicker than they should be. They get the care they need. \nOur hospitals provide that care. But then they have to recoup those \ncosts, so they roll those costs over to everybody with insurance. In a \nState with a huge manufacturing base, with employers that provide \nhealth care, this goes right on their backs. Businesses large or small \nend up seeing their health insurance rates go up. So the private sector \nends up paying for all of these expenses, and it does not save money to \ncut physicians' payments or other Medicare or Medicaid payments, either \none, because then the private sector has to look for ways to cut. They \nask working people and their families to pay more for health care or \nthey cut the kind of health insurance they have. What happens? More \npeople walk into the emergency room. This happens every day.\n  What are we waiting for? We have 7, 8 days left. We have a clear \nproblem and a clear solution and a clear majority of Senators who want \nto see this fix happen.\n  Over 20,000 M.D.s and D.O.s in Michigan provide more than 1.4 million \nseniors and people with disabilities in Michigan with high-quality \nmedical\n\n[[Page S9861]]\n\nservices under the Medicare Program. Our Michigan families get \nwonderful care from wonderful doctors. Our American families receive \nwonderful care from wonderful doctors. But the question is, Will they \nbe able to continue to receive those services? I would argue, not \nunless we do something now about the payment system used to reimburse \nphysicians for Medicare services.\n  Beginning January 1, 2007, the Medicare sustainable growth rate \nformula will cut payments to physicians and health care professionals \nby 5.1 percent. What does that mean in real dollars? In Michigan alone, \nit is $137 million in cuts to Medicare. The average cut for a physician \nin Michigan will be $34,000. As medical costs go up--as we see the cost \nof sustaining an office and other costs and medicine going up, \neverything is going up--we are cutting back on the physicians' \nreimbursements. These cuts will be particularly devastating for primary \ncare doctors, the very doctors, according to the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission, MedPAC, many Medicare beneficiaries rely on for \nimportant health care management.\n  Again, we are scheduled to adjourn in 7 days. It is time to resolve \nthis issue so that our physicians know they are going to be able to \ncontinue to care for Medicare patients come January.\n  This is not a new issue. MedPAC considers the Medicare SGR formula a \nflawed, inequitable mechanism for controlling the volume of services \nand first recommended repeal of the Medicare SGR formula in 2001. Since \nthen, they have consistently recommended repealing the formula. I have, \nin fact, put forward a bill that would do that and set up a physicians \ncommission to recommend what should be done. We don't have time for \nthat between now and the end of the year, but we do have time to do \nwhat needs to be done in the next 7 days, which is to stop the cut that \nis scheduled to take effect in January. We need to stop that, and \ninstead of a freeze that was given last year, we need to give a modest \nupdate for our physicians so they will know that we understand how \nimportant their services are to seniors and people with disabilities.\n  In conclusion, I wish to share a couple of letters I have received. I \nhave received so many letters from physicians around Michigan \nexpressing grave concern. These are people who care very much about the \npeople they serve. They are trying to keep it together so they can \ncontinue to serve people, whether it is in Detroit, Lancing, or Grand \nRapids, up north, in the upper peninsula.\n  I received a letter from a physician in Cheboygan, MI, which is a \nsmall town on the lower tip of the northern peninsula. Timothy M. \nBurandt, D.O. in surgery, wrote me a letter that says:\n\n       In 1982, I graduated from medical school and took an oath \n     to care for all patients in need. As a general surgeon \n     practicing in rural northern Michigan, I am committed to \n     caring for all of my neighbors, not just those with \n     insurance.\n       My expenses keep going up as I also have a responsibility \n     to my staff to support them with fair wages and benefits.\n       Without adequate reimbursement, I cannot continue to offer \n     my services to everyone who walks through my door. There \n     simply aren't enough resources. Please don't force me to \n     choose which patients I should care for. I would rather \n     retire early and close the practice.\n\n  I don't want Dr. Burandt to have to close his practice in Cheboygan, \nMI. The families in Cheboygan, MI, cannot afford for him to close his \npractice, and there is no excuse for us not to act so he doesn't have \nto.\n  Also, Tara Eding, a doctor of internal medicine in Hamilton, MI, \nwrites:\n\n       It will be very difficult to remain in practice as \n     internist. The majority of my practice (including 3 other \n     partners) is made up of Medicare patients. It is already \n     difficult to maintain a primary care practice in this field. \n     We have recently had to ``trim'' overhead by cutting staff, \n     restricting our services, etc. and I only see things getting \n     worse. If these cuts are made it will drive us out of \n     practice.\n       I have already stopped accepting new Medicare patients and \n     if these cuts go through I will not have a choice. I will be \n     forced to stop participating in one way or another. We would \n     not be able to keep our practice open as it exists today.\n\n  There is a sense of urgency in these letters. There is a sense of \nurgency that we need to feel on the floor of the Senate. We have 80 \npeople in this body on both sides of the aisle who have called on our \nleaders to act. We have a sound policy, we have a sense of urgency, and \nwe have time to get this done in the next few days.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1547\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 1574, a bill to provide for \na minimum update for physician services under Medicare, and that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the amendment at \nthe desk to strike the language pertaining to an update for 2006 be \nconsidered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is necessary that we object. The Senator from Michigan \nmakes a tremendously valuable point. I hope the Senate does the right \nthing after we come back from the recess for the elections in November \nto deal with this critical issue which deals with our doctors and \nMedicare, but at this moment in time, I have to object to proceeding.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The minority time for morning business has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9861-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9861-S9862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE GOLD STAR AND BLUE STAR MOTHERS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, 70 years ago, Congress passed a resolution \nproclaiming that the last Sunday in September be designated as Gold \nStar Mother's Day. As we approach the last Sunday in September, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to recognize the Gold Star mothers \nthroughout the country and particularly those in the State of Colorado.\n  I hope we will all take time this Sunday, September 24, to honor \nthese mothers and fathers who have so bravely endured the loss of a son \nor daughter killed while serving in the Armed Forces. Colorado has lost \nmany young men and women to combat since the horrendous attacks of 9/\n11. One day is not long enough for us to ever fully honor these parents \nwho have had to suffer the unmanageable pain of losing a child, but we \nwill try.\n  Across the State of Colorado and across the Nation, many of these \nmothers have come together not only for support but also to volunteer \ntheir time, serving veterans and families of soldiers, encouraging \npatriotism and national pride, and honor their children through service \nand allegiance to the United States. Through their volunteer efforts, \nthey keep alive the memory and spirit of those whose lives were lost in \nthe war. They continue to inspire compassion, strength, and \nfaithfulness for all Americans.\n  To mark this weekend, the Blue Star mothers of Colorado will be \nhosting Colorado's first annual Gold Star Mother's Day weekend. There \nwill be several events throughout the weekend celebrating the lives of \nthose soldiers who so courageously gave the ultimate sacrifice for \ntheir Nation. Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the ceremony \nmyself, but my wife Joan and I send our thoughts and prayers to those \nwho will be attending the event.\n  Words truly cannot express America's gratitude for our Armed Forces \nand their service and sacrifice to this Nation. Those who have fallen \nserve a cause greater than themselves and deserve special honor. To \ntheir mothers and fathers: You, too, deserve special honor as you \ncontinue to carry on the patriotic duties and legacy your sons and \ndaughters sadly could not. I thank you for your courage and for your \nservice to the United States of America.\n  Over the last 3 years, our Nation has been locked in a terrible \nstruggle against radical extremists across the Middle East. I readily \nadmit this fight is one we did not anticipate. But I do know that every \nlife given in the name of freedom has not been given in vain.\n  While they continually experience many dangerous challenges, our men \nand women of our Armed Forces continue making strides in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We have fought a terrible enemy that has no regard for \nhuman life. Yet despite our challenges, we have seen tremendous \nprogress, especially toward helping to create partners in our fight \nagainst terrorism\n\n[[Page S9862]]\n\nworldwide. Indeed, much of our success depends on the men and women in \nthe new democratic governments formed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they \nare stepping up to the challenge. In Iraq, people from all walks of \nlife--Sunnis, Shias, Kurds--have participated in multiple elections and \nreferendums across the country for the first time in Iraq's history.\n  Remarkably, after democratic elections in Afghanistan, women are \nholding positions of power in local and national governments, something \nthat was impossible under the Taliban's rule. The sovereign governments \nare working with regional and international partners in achieving \nunited democracies--an achievement only allowed through our fighting \nmen and women in combat.\n  Many remarkable achievements have been made through the sacrifices of \nthe men and women in the military, but perhaps the most important of \nall is what has not occurred in our country: since we took military \naction against these Islamic extremists and brought the fight to them, \nwe have not seen an attack on American soil. The sacrifices that the \nsons and daughters of our Gold Star mothers have made and continue to \nmake are protecting us on our shores. Unfortunately, we have seen that \neven after the death of terrorist leaders, such as Abu Mus'ab al-\nZarqawi, the forces of Islamic extremists vow that they will continue \nto wage war on American civilians. Our success against this type of \nenemy is only ensured by the brave men and women of our Armed Forces. \nThey provide safety and security to our Nation, and we are truly \ngrateful for what they have done.\n  While the cost has been high, the cost of doing nothing would be even \ngreater. These words provide little comfort to the families who have \nlost loved ones, but we will always remember those who have lost their \nlives in support of our freedom and thank them for their sacrifice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of fallen heroes from Colorado be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Pfc.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk to our \ncolleagues about something going on in America at this very moment that \nprobably is very pleasing to the average consumer. I came to the floor \nof the Senate over a month ago to deliver a speech using this map. I \ncalled it the ``No-Zone Speech.'' I called it the ``No-Zone Speech'' \nbecause all of these red areas around our Nation, off our shores, in \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, are no-zones to oil exploration and \ndevelopment. Why? Because we have said politically we don't want to go \nthere. Yet it is believed by the U.S. Geological Survey that in the no-\nzone rests maybe 80 billion or 90 billion barrels of oil.\n  I gave that speech in late July of this year at a time when we were \ndebating a very small area down here that could supply upwards of 3 \nbillion or 4 billion barrels of oil, known as lease sale 181. The \nSenate finally got it, worked out their differences, and passed that \nlegislation. They are now working with the House to try to resolve \nthose differences.\n  But something phenomenal has happened at the gas pump. During the \ntime I delivered that speech, the Senate was working on lease sale 181, \nand American consumers were paying over $3 a gallon for their gas. What \nhappened? If you went to the pump yesterday in certain parts of our \ncountry, you paid less than $2 a gallon, and in my State of Idaho you \nare paying 30 cents or 40 cents less a gallon than you did in late July \nor early August. What happened?\n  Let me tell my colleagues what we think happened. It is about the \nvery reality of America developing its oil reserves and becoming less \ndependent upon foreign, unstable sources.\n  About a month ago, Chevron announced they had discovered in the gulf \nin what is known as deepwater areas 20,000 feet below the ocean's \nsurface, and 8,000 feet below the ocean's floor, possibly one of the \nlargest oil find discoveries in the history of the United States. That \nannouncement, coupled with the fact that there had been no hurricanes \nin this area, coupled with the fact that all of the oil development and \nrefinement that was taken off line by Katrina is now back on line and \noperating, and the reality that there was a new reserve of oil that was \nsecure to our Nation and not dependent upon a foreign unstable \npolitical power, changed the dynamics of the oil market.\n  The $70-plus a barrel for crude that refiners were paying in late \nJuly was always believed by many of us who study the market to have $20 \nof the $70 as purely risk money and speculative price. That is gone. \nThat is gone because of this very large discovery down in the gulf and \nthe reality that the Congress is going to act responsibly for the first \ntime and allow some development, some exploration in the no-zone.\n  To think we could become increasingly independent of unstable foreign \nsources of oil would be phenomenally important for this country and our \neconomy and, most importantly, for the consumer. I am quite sure that \nthe person who pulls up to the gas pump in Mid City USA today and is \npaying 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 cents to a dollar less than they paid a \nmonth ago is a pretty happy person, and they ought to be. But, more \nimportantly, they ought to be recognizing what they should be asking \nthe Congress of the United States to do, and that is to advance the \ndevelopment of drilling in the no-zone.\n  The Presiding Officer is a Senator from Alaska. She and I and others \nhave worked for years to develop the rest of the oil reserves in Alaska \nin the ANWR\n\n[[Page S9863]]\n\narea, where there could be 30 billion or 40 billion barrels of oil, but \nAmerica's politics has said no, and America's consumers have suffered. \nThen we work our way down the coast, down through California and all \nthe other areas where the politics of those areas say, no, you can't \ndrill here, and yet we believe there are trillions of cubic feet of gas \nand potentially billions of barrels of oil.\n  I have worked on the Energy Committee of the Senate since 1990. I \nhave watched as others have worked with me and watched American \nconsumers and the oil industry of our country becoming increasingly \ndependent on foreign sources. In 1990, it was about 40 percent \ndependency, and then 42 and then 45 and then 50 and then 55 and then \n60. At the peak of this summer's consumption, upwards of maybe 65 \npercent of our oil was coming from those unstable political regions of \nthe world where, at any moment, a terrorist attack or the bombing of a \nship could spike the oil market because the supply would diminish, and \nthat is why we saw $70 a barrel for oil in speculative prices.\n  At just the moment when we are doing lease sale 181, the new \ndiscovery happens in the gulf, and the market recognizes that $20 worth \nof speculation on risk goes away, and American consumers are beginning \nto recognize the value of being less dependent on foreign oil.\n  A very wise admiral a long time ago fought a very important battle \nwith the politics of America and the politics of an old-style Navy, and \nhis name was Rickover. He said: As long as our surface and subsurface \nNavy is dependent upon refueling with diesel fuel all over the world, \nwe will not be free and independent. The politics of that was very \nrigorous. In 1982, Admiral Rickover delivered a speech before Columbia \nUniversity where he talked about the battles he fought to develop the \nfirst Nautilus nuclear-powered submarine. He said that the political \nbattle to get the submarine was more difficult than the design of the \nsubmarine itself.\n\n  Well, that was then, and that was many years ago, and most of us have \nforgotten that political battle because what we now know is that most \nof our Navy, both subsurface and surface, is nuclear powered. From the \ntime the new nuclear Navy vessel is built, slides from the drydock into \nthe water, and begins its mission around the world, it is never \nrefueled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The majority's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 \nadditional minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. So that Navy vessel never has to pull into a port anywhere \nin the world to refuel itself. It is totally independent. It can travel \nthe world. It can go into the Indian Ocean where it would be very \ndifficult to refuel a diesel-powered vessel, and it sails on. That is \nwhy we are the dominant naval power of the world today, because of the \nvision of a man years ago who said: We must be independent--independent \nof energy sources for our Navy.\n  Why can't America demand energy independence for all of us? Can you \nimagine what would happen in our economy today if the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that are paid for oil from Iraq, from Kuwait, from \nVenezuela, and other unstable political areas of the world simply \ndidn't have to be paid? Instead we would pay producers in our country \nfor developing the resources that our country still has in the no-zone. \nCan you imagine our strength as a country? Can you imagine our foreign \npolicy if we didn't have to recognize that we had to work to keep \ncertain areas of the world stable because they are a source of our \nenergy, they are a source of our very heartbeat as a country? They are \nthe very source of the heartbeat of the economy of our country.\n  The recent discovery in the deep waters of the gulf proved the point \nand proved it loudly, and the markets reacted, and the consumers are \nbenefiting today.\n  This President gets it. He understands it. It is why his first task \nas a President when he came to power was to develop an energy task \nforce and to lay out for the Nation a national energy strategy that \nwould move us toward energy independence. Oh, the gnashing of teeth, \nthe ringing of hands that occurred on the floor of the Senate: We dare \nnot drill in ANWR. We dare not go here. We must not do this.\n  During the course of all that rhetoric we became increasingly \ndependent upon unstable political areas of the world for our oil. And \nthe American consumers began to pay the price a couple of years ago \nwhen gas went above $2 and then $2.10 and then 50 cents more and then \n$2.80 and, of course, this summer over $3 a gallon.\n  America's farmers today are now paying $3.20 to $3.50 a gallon for \ndiesel, and they can't control their input costs. Many of them are \nfinding themselves in financial difficulty because of the cost of \ndiesel or the cost of fertilizer because, of course, it takes natural \ngas to produce fertilizer and nitrogen and phosphates.\n  America, wake up. America, get on your phone and call your \nCongressman and call your Senator and say: No more no-zone. Allow us to \ndevelop our resources and to do so in an environmentally sound way \nbecause we now have the technology. We proved it in the shallow waters \nof the gulf a decade ago. We are now proving it in the deep waters of \nthe gulf as we speak.\n  Clearly, America could be energy independent. There is no question \nabout it. The ability of the farmer to produce corn that is developed \ninto ethanol, the ability of our country to drill in the no-zone says \nthat America could once again stand unafraid around the world as it \nrelates to the political stability of the oil development and the oil-\nproducing regions of a very unstable world.\n  The reason we are dependent today is politics, plain and simple. The \nreason the Senator from Alaska continually argues for the responsible \nand environmentally sound development up here in the northern reaches \nof Alaska is because we can do it and do it right, and there are \nbillions of barrels of oil up there and trillions of cubic feet of gas. \nAnd America, once again, as Admiral Rickover understood decades ago, \ncan be independent as she stands for other causes around the world.\n  What a difference a day makes. What a difference one oil find makes \nbecause that new Chevron oil find and that new trend in deep water may \nwell increase our oil reserves by 25, 30, 40, 50 percent. What would \nhappen if we were doing the rest of the development in this area, if we \nwere doing the gas development up through Virginia and along the east \ncoast, if we were developing offshore in California, if we were \ndeveloping in the ANWR in Alaska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, the reality is very simple and very \nobvious. It is all at the pump, and the American consumer, I hope, has \nawakened to the reality of what a difference a day makes in the price \nof gas and the impact on their family budget and their pocketbooks. \nLet's drill and develop the no-zones.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9863-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Emergency Farm Relief Act of 2006\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \nlegislation I introduced earlier this month, the Emergency Farm Relief \nAct of 2006. This bipartisan legislation now has 22 cosponsors in the \nSenate. As I have indicated, it is fully bipartisan. We have a strong \nrepresentation from both parties in the cosponsorship of the \nlegislation. It is designed to provide much needed relief to producers \nwho have suffered from natural disasters in 2005 and 2006.\n  Let me direct the attention of my colleagues to the headlines from \nacross my State last year. These headlines talk of massive flooding. In \nfact, last year in North Dakota, over 1 million acres could not be \nplanted at all. Hundreds of thousands of additional acres were planted \nand then drowned out.\n  ``Heavy Rain Leads to Crop Diseases.''\n  ``Crops, Hay, Lost to Flooding.''\n  ``Area Farmers Battle Flooding, Disease.''\n  ``Rain Halts Harvest.''\n  ``ND Anthrax Outbreak Grows.''\n  These were the headlines all across my State.\n  ``ND Receives Major Disaster Declaration.''\n  While we recognize that in 2005 the worst disasters were in the \ngulf--Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina--there was another part of \nthe country hit by disaster, little noticed, and that is my part of the \ncountry.\n  Last year, every county was declared a disaster by the Secretary of \nAgriculture. This is what we saw last year: massive flooding all across \nNorth Dakota, especially eastern North Dakota. In fact, at one point I \nwent up in a plane and flew over southeastern North Dakota, and from \nhorizon to horizon, all I saw was water. It was extraordinary, the \nworst cross-land flooding we have suffered perhaps in our history. It \ngot virtually no attention except by those who experienced it. As I \nindicated, there were a million acres that were prevented from even \nbeing planted. They couldn't plant. They couldn't get in the field even \nto plant. We suffered an extraordinarily serious disaster last year.\n  Now, irony of ironies, this year we are suffering from drought. The \nscientists tell us this is the third worst drought in our Nation's \nhistory. This drought extends right now through the center of the \ncountry.\n  This is from what is called the U.S. Drought Monitor. It is a \nscientific evaluation of drought conditions in the country. It goes \nfrom abnormally dry to exceptional drought. The dark brown is \nexceptional drought. That is the most severe category. You can see the \nepicenter of this drought is right in North Dakota and South Dakota. \nNow the entire State of North Dakota is considered in drought \ncondition. In our State, it goes from severe to exceptional drought. We \ndon't have just abnormally dry or moderate; we are severe to \nexceptional drought in every part of our State.\n  This is the headline from the Grand Forks Herald in July of this \nyear:\n  ``Dakotas Epicenter of Drought-Stricken Nation.''\n  Experts say the dry spell is the third worst on record. In our entire \nhistory, this is the third worst drought, only eclipsed by the 1930s \nand an earlier period.\n  In July, Senator Dorgan, Congressman Pomeroy and I, our Governor, and \nthe agriculture commissioner of North Dakota went on a drought tour. \nThis is what we found. This is a pasture in Grant County. It is \nvirtually worthless for grazing. I could show picture after picture of \nwhat we saw.\n  One of the most amazing things we found was a corn crop that was \nirrigated--irrigated corn, and the kernels had not formed. Why? Because \nnot only have we had drought but we have had extreme heat. These are \nthe temperatures for the month of July in North Dakota. All of those in \norange are over 90 degrees, many of them over 100 degrees. You can see \nin the second week of July: 96, 101, 105, 94, 101, 105. But the real \ntale is told on July 30, when in my hometown it reached 112 degrees. \nThat is why even irrigated corn did not produce.\n  Here is a picture from a Burleigh County cornfield. This is corn in \nthe southern part of Burleigh County, which is my home county. You can \nsee there is virtually nothing growing. It is like a moonscape. These \nare the conditions we faced all across North Dakota.\n  It is true that there are some places that had good crops, if you \njust had the right mix of weather conditions, even though there was \ndrought. Perhaps they had irrigation or for some other reason they had \na good crop, but much of North Dakota has been devastated. I am told by \nthe bankers of our State that if we do not get help, 5 percent to 10 \npercent of the producers in North Dakota will be forced off the land. \nThat is how severe this crisis has become.\n  During the August recess, I organized a drought rally in Bismarck, \nND. Hundreds of farmers and ranchers came from all across the State. \nOur Governor attended, as did Senator Dorgan and Congressman Pomeroy \nand our agricultural commissioner. The message was loud and clear: If \nthere is not assistance that is meaningful, if it does not come soon, \nthousands of farm families are going to lose their livelihood. That is \nthe reality of what we confront.\n\n  In late August, the Secretary of Agriculture traveled to South \nDakota. He proposed there a program that is totally and completely \ninadequate. The program he proposed is mostly money that is already in \nthe budget. It is not new money, just a shuffling of the deck.\n  On September 12, the Secretary notified me that all North Dakota \ncounties had been designated as primary disaster counties for the 2006 \ncrop year. Why aren't we satisfied? Because all that makes available \nare low-interest loans. This crisis is so severe that more loans are \njust going to drive people deeper into debt and are going to further \npressure them off the land.\n  On September 12, when the Secretary notified me that all North Dakota \ncounties had been designated as disaster counties, it was also the day \nI was joined by hundreds of farmers from across the country, dozens of \nSenators--colleagues from the House and Senate--at a press conference \nonly a few yards from here. Thirty-four national farm organizations \nhave announced that they are asking Congress to provide this disaster \nrelief which is contained in my legislation; 34 national organizations \nhave united behind my legislation.\n  So the question before the Congress of the United States is, Will we \nact and will we act in time? I pray that this Congress will act, and I \npray we will act in time. If we fail, thousands of farm families will \nbe forced off the land and will lose their livelihoods. That is the \nreality we confront. That is why Senator Nelson and I have come to the \nfloor today. All I can do is ask colleagues to remember that when the \nGulf States suffered horrendous disasters in Hurricane Karina and \nHurricane Rita, all of us came to help. We are asking for that same \nconsideration now, as the center of the country suffers from truly a \ndevastating drought.\n  I will yield the floor, but before I do so, if I could just say to my \ncolleague, Senator Nelson, I thank him for his leadership, as he has \nrepeatedly pressed for this assistance to pass. I think we should say \nfor the record that this assistance has passed in the Senate twice \nalready, by overwhelming margins. In fact, there was an attempt to take \nit out of one of the supplemental appropriations bills and 72 Senators \nvoted for it. Seventy-two Senators voted to keep it in. So there is \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Our problem has been that the President has issued a veto threat, and \nthe House of Representatives so far has upheld that veto threat by \nrefusing to consider the Senate legislation. We believe we should give \nthem one more chance because now this drought disaster has deepened and \nbeen joined by, of course, the effects of Hurricane Ernesto, which did \nenormous damage in North Carolina and Virginia, right up to Maryland.\n  Now is the time. People need help. They deserve it. This disaster \nassistance will only give help if people have suffered a loss of at \nleast 35 percent. This doesn't make them whole. They would still suffer \nenormous losses. But at least it would give them a fair, fighting \nchance.\n  I want to repeat, you only get help under this legislation if you \nhave suffered a loss of at least 35 percent. It is not too much to ask \nthat we provide\n\n[[Page S9865]]\n\nthis kind of assistance to those who have suffered natural disaster. \nThis is not regional legislation, it is national legislation. Anyone, \nanywhere, who has suffered a loss of at least 35 percent would be \neligible for some assistance.\n  Again I acknowledge the leadership of my colleague from Nebraska who \nhas been so persistent and so determined to get help to our producers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as if in morning business about S. 385, the Emergency Farm Relief \nAct of 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for his support and for his continuing interest and \nefforts to bring this to a conclusion.\n  I came to the floor last week as well in an attempt to provide much \nneeded emergency relief to our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and rural \nsmall businesses that have been devastated by the long running drought \nthat I have nicknamed Drought David. Some have asked why did I give it \na name. A drought, unlike a hurricane or a flood, is a slow-moving \ndisaster that can linger over the course of years. In some places, \nDrought David is celebrating its fifth birthday, and in other places it \nis celebrating its seventh birthday. But by giving it some identity, we \nhope we can give it the same kind of identity that is very often given \nto a hurricane which is named. It is not just a storm--it is Hurricane \nErnesto or Katrina. I felt that giving this continuing drought a name \nwould help give an identity so people could focus on this being a \nnatural disaster, a devastation of major economic proportions to large \nareas within our country that can have the same impact in terms of \neconomic loss which very often a hurricane will cause in its wake.\n  At this time, I ask a simple question of the Senate: If not now, \nwhen? When will this Senate provide the relief needed by our Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers? Unfortunately, my question was answered last week \nby the procedural tactics to block an up-or-down vote.\n  So, today, I have two questions to ask my colleagues: If not now, \nwhen? And, most importantly, if not now, why? Why do we refuse to \nprovide relief to farmers and ranchers suffering from this particular \nnatural disaster when we provide relief, as we should, to others for \nnatural disasters like hurricanes? Is relief from the Senate seriously \nbased solely upon the sensational nature of the disaster and the news \nreports of the disaster? If a Drought David were able to grab the \nheadlines like a hurricane, would relief be constantly and consistently \nblocked?\n  That is not acceptable to the farmers and ranchers I know, and it is \nnot acceptable to me--and I am sure it is not acceptable to a majority \nof my colleagues in the Senate.\n  As Senator Conrad has pointed out, at least on two occasions, we have \nalready voted to provide this kind of relief, and now procedurally it \nis being blocked.\n  Last week, I told the Senate about the damage this drought has caused \nto farmers and ranchers in Nebraska. As my colleague has indicated, in \nthe State of North Dakota, the damage is considerable.\n  I told the Senate last week about how the drought has caused $342 \nmillion in damage so far this year for Nebraska alone.\n  Keep in mind this is in many cases 5 or 7 years old. The multiples \nare pretty clearly tremendously important to the State of Nebraska. \nStill the Senate has refused to act.\n  Last week, I talked about how the drought forced farmers in Nebraska \nto spend an extra $51 million just for irrigation costs during this \nsummer. Still, the Senate refused to act.\n  Last week, I talked about how just this year the drought has cost \nNebraska farmers $98 million in crop losses and $193 million in \nlivestock production losses. And still, the Senate refused to act.\n  Senator Conrad and I and many of our colleagues have put together a \ncomprehensive package to provide emergency funding to farmers and \nranchers who suffered weather-related production shortfalls, quality \nlosses, and damage to livestock and feed supplies. Our bill also helps \nfarmers overcome the losses they suffered because of energy price \nspikes after the hurricane last year.\n  I warn my colleagues again that the devastating impacts of the \ndrought threaten to drive many of our farmers and ranchers out of \nbusiness. We no longer can expect family farmers to make a go of it day \nin and day out with these ongoing losses. People have said that maybe \nthe Crop Insurance Program would be able to provide the kind of \nassistance that is required. No crop insurance program can ever provide \nyear in and year out for a 5-year or a 7-year period of losses. It is \nnot designed to do that, and it is not priced to do that. It is not \nequipped to do that, and actuarially it simply won't work. It would be \nthe equivalent of insuring your house, and every year for 5 years the \nhouse burned. You rebuild it, it burns; you rebuild it, it burns. No \ninsurance program is designed nor will it function to take care of that \nkind of loss.\n  Without our farmers and ranchers, we cannot expect to continue to \nsecure our national food supply. And without our farmers and ranchers, \nwe cannot hope to grow our domestic production of alternative renewable \nfuels.\n  Again I ask, if not now, when? If we fail to act and by our inaction \nwe allow farmers and ranchers and rural businesses to dry up under the \ndevastating impact of the drought, then we have failed not only those \nfarmers and ranchers and small businesses, but we have also failed our \nNation because we will have failed to ensure our food and fuel \nsecurity.\n  This is why I ask my second question: If not now, why? I think our \nfarmers and ranchers deserve more than procedural gimmicks. They at \nleast deserve answers from this body about why they will not get the \nrelief they so desperately need.\n  I have spoken to my friend and colleague, Senator Harry Reid, and he \nhas informed me that no one on the Democratic side of the Senate is \ngoing to block or will block an up-or-down vote on this relief.\n  I hope today as we ask this question for the consideration of this \nbody we will make a bipartisan effort to bring about relief to these \nparts of the country that are undergoing such devastating losses.\n  I ask again, if not now, why? Surely the Senate can spare an hour of \nits day to consider this issue and certainly to vote for farmers and \nranchers and rural businesses that help this Nation and the world and \nof whom we are asking to provide more and more of our Nation's fuel \nsupply as well. Surely, we can find some time to vote for providing \nthem the relief they need. I think they deserve at least that much.\n  That is why I am prepared to continue to fight for this relief and \ncontinue to work to get relief out to our farmers.\n  I know my colleague and others are also joining in that. One way or \nthe other, I will work to get this done. If nothing else, I am going to \ncontinue to fight to get this emergency relief included in any \ncontinuing resolution that Congress will have to pass before it leaves \nin a week.\n  I ask my colleague from North Dakota if he needs to have any more \ntime yielded to him.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3855\n\n  If not, I ask unanimous consent that the Agriculture Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 3855, the emergency drought \nassistance bill, and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, the bill be read a third time, and without further \nintervening action or debate the Senate proceed to vote on passage of \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On behalf of the Senator from Alaska, I will \nobject. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I know that the occupant of the Chair is \nacting as a representative of her party, whatever her particular \nposition might be. I want to lay it out on the record because I know \nthe Chair can't explain her own position. She is precluded by the rules \nfrom doing that. We don't hold the Chair personally responsible in any \nway for this objection. We understand that she is required to do so. \nAny occupant of the chair would be so required. It is probably \nimportant to put that on the record.\n  Madam President, we deeply regret that there has been objection \nraised.\n\n[[Page S9866]]\n\nWe deeply regret that we are not given the chance to pass legislation \nwhich has already passed this body twice before but that has been \nblocked because the President has threatened a veto and the House has \nso far gone along with his threat.\n  Again, the Senate has acted twice in overwhelming numbers to pass \ndrought relief. Goodness knows it is needed.\n  I was home just this last weekend. I was all across the northern tier \nof North Dakota. In every location, farmers came to me, ranchers came \nto me, and said: Kent, is there not an understanding in Washington what \nis happening here? Does no one care? If there is no response and if it \ndoes not come soon, thousands of us are going to be gone.\n  One of the most prominent bankers in my State, I say to my colleague \nfrom Nebraska, came to me this weekend and said: Kent, if there is not \ndisaster relief, 10 percent of the farmers in my portfolio are going to \nbe out of business. They will not get financing. They will not even get \nfinancing to go into the fields next year.\n  One of the farmers said to me: It has been 5 years since I had a \nnormal crop.\n  Between this extraordinary flooding, these extraordinary droughts--\nand I don't pretend to know whether global warming or global climate \nchange is part of this. What I do know is something is happening that \nis absolutely extraordinary in our part of the country. We have gone \nfrom massive flooding to massive drought this year. Flooding and \ndrought of that proportion has never been seen before in my State--or \nat least rarely seen. On the drought monitor, they say this is the \nthird worst drought in our Nation's history.\n  We need to act. We are not asking to make people whole. They will not \nbe made whole by our disaster relief bill. They only get help if they \nhave at least a 35-percent loss. Then the help only comes to the losses \nover that amount.\n  We are not asking to make people whole. We are not asking that people \nhave some big windfall. We are asking that people be given a fair \nfighting chance.\n  That has been denied today. But today is not the end of the story. We \nare going to come back. Again, we want to acknowledge this body has \ntwice overwhelmingly passed disaster assistance. We appreciate that. \nOur problem is not in this body. Very frankly, our problem is in the \nother body and at the White House. That is where our problem lies.\n  I again want to thank very much my colleague from Nebraska for his \nsteadfast leadership on this issue. That is so important to the people \nwe represent.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, let me also acknowledge that \nthe objection entered was not a personal objection by the Senator from \nAlaska but one procedurally required of her in her capacity.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 20 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                          Energy Independence\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about an \nequally important issue to many of our States and follow up on the \nearlier comment by my colleague from Idaho on energy independence for \nthe Nation, and the importance of that at this particular time to the \nGulf of Mexico, America's only energy coast and an area that I need not \nhave to explain again is in one of the most challenging situations of \nits entire history.\n  I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senators from \nNebraska and North Dakota regarding the drought.\n  We have had similar droughts, amazingly, in our State, even with the \nhurricanes. But as Senators who represent farm State communities, \nagriculture is very important to the State of Louisiana. We have been \nin a situation that they have been in. I know people think of us as a \nState with a lot of rain, and obviously a target for hurricanes, but we \nhave also been stricken by serious drought.\n  The point of my comment about what was said is this: Sometimes things \nhappen out of the ordinary, extraordinary situations, as they have just \ndescribed, which deserve an unprecedented and extraordinary response.\n  I know we in Washington deal with that very well because we like \neverything that is sort of in the box, but we also don't like \neverything to kind of be one way. The fact is, when serious, \nextraordinary circumstances happen, we need to make a quick and \nappropriate response. It is most certainly appropriate for these \nSenators to come to the Senate and ask for a quick and immediate \nresponse to part of our Nation. This drought is not just, of course, in \nNebraska and North Dakota. The pictures have shown pockets of severe \nand unprecedented drought, and whether it is because of global warming \nor whether it is just because of the severe weather patterns caused by \nsomething else, we can debate that until the cows come home. The fact \nis we have farming communities, rural communities, suffering right now. \nThey need our best effort. I support seeing what we can do to help.\n\n\n                   Natural Gas in the Gulf of Mexico\n\n  I will speak this morning for a few moments about an issue which is \nalmost equal to the concern of farmers in America; that is, the price \nof natural gas. Farmers, like many industry groups, use natural gas. In \ntheir case, fertilizers are produced using a lot of natural gas, and \nfertilizers go into the farmers' fields.\n  Natural gas is also used as a raw material to create virtually 50 \npercent of the products created in American gas. And we have a great \nshortage. It is driving the price high, historically high--not the \nhighest it has ever been but historically high prices.\n  The only way we can get the price of gas down--and we need to; that \nis what the Senator from Idaho spoke about, energy independence and \nstabilizing prices--is to increase the supply and to make the supply \nsources more diverse so industries, if the price of gas is high, can \nuse coal, or if the price of coal is high, they can use oil, or if the \nprice of oil is high, they can use alternative fuels or ethanol.\n  We have been in a mad dash against time to expand our source of fuels \nand to increase the supply, where we can, in the most environmentally \nsensitive way possible. It has been a debate which has gone on for \ndecades. It will continue to go on for decades because some States \nproduce gas, some produce oil, some produce coal, and some do not \nproduce any of that and have nuclear powerplants and think that is the \nway to go. Some of us have more wind than others, some of us have more \nsun than others.\n  This is a debate which is natural in a democracy. Just because it is \ndifficult does not mean we have to stop trying. We have to press \nforward on the issue of a greater supply and greater independence for \nAmerica. We are dangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil and \ngas.\n  Madam President, 72 Senators--unprecedented in this day of \npartisanship, in this day of not even being able to agree on the time \nof day or the weather conditions outside--72 Senators came together \nunder the leadership of Senator Domenici, the chairman of our Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee. The Presiding Officer serves on that \ncommittee and has been a wonderful voice of reason for the Senate. We \npassed a bill to open more supplies of gas in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  The Senator from Idaho showed a much larger and more colorful chart. \nI thought his looked terrific, and I will ask to borrow it one day, but \nI do not have it at this moment and this chart will suffice. It shows \nareas that are basically off of production. The white areas off the \nAtlantic coast, the coast of California, and around Florida have not \nbeen open to production for the last 35 years. There are many reasons--\nsome of them good and some of them not good--we can't drill in these \nareas.\n  We will continue to debate for decades to come what to do off the \nshores of Washington, Oregon, California, Florida, Georgia, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Connecticut, \nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine. That debate will go \non for the next many years. I will be on one side of that debate, and \nmy colleagues will be on the other. I believe you can access resources \nappropriately. However, we are\n\n[[Page S9867]]\n\nnot going to resolve that issue in the next week. We are not going to \nresolve that issue in the next month. I predict we will not resolve \nthat issue for the next year. However, we have farmers in the Dakotas, \nNebraska, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Kansas who are \ndesperate for gas now. They cannot wait 10 years or three decades until \nwe figure out the politics of drilling on the Atlantic and Pacific \ncoast. They need help now.\n  For Congress to be able to help them and not help them is a crime. \nFor Congress to be able to help them and not help them is a crime, it \nis a shame. It should not stand.\n  We have the political support and the votes now--among Democrats and \nRepublicans in the House and the Senate, today--to open more drilling \nin the Gulf of Mexico. We have not been able to open sections in the \ngulf because of disagreements between Florida and Alabama for decades. \nBecause of the good work of the Senators from Alabama, Mr. Shelby and \nMr. Sessions, and the good Senators from Florida, Mr. Martinez and Mr. \nNelson--they worked for months in the most difficult of political \nsituations to come up with a way to open more oil and gas drilling in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, a place that everyone agrees has tremendous \nreserves, that everyone agrees is where we should drill. There are no \nfights among Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Now Alabama \nand Florida have come to agreements. Their Governors have agreed. Their \ngeneral political establishments have agreed--not unanimously but the \nvast majority.\n\n  We are here, a week until we leave, and we are going to do nothing--\nthat is what some people say--because it is not good enough. I don't \nknow what school of politics or leadership they came from. All I know, \nas a leader, you take things a step at a time. You cannot change the \nworld in 1 day. You have to change it a little bit at a time. It takes \ntime to educate people and to talk to them about the benefits. I have \ntaken as many Senators as will go with me out on the rigs. I took the \nSecretary of the Interior out there to show him. It takes a while to \ntake a lot of people out there. They are busy. They have other things \non their minds. We are doing the best we can to try to educate people \nall over the country about the benefits.\n  We started drilling offshore in the 1940s. The first well was a \nlittle town in southwest Louisiana called Creole. It was just basically \nwashed away in the hurricane. The brave little town, Creole, LA, put \nthe first well offshore about four decades ago. The industry has \nblossomed since then.\n  The purple spots on this chart represent pipelines of natural gas. \nBut the purple spots represent more than pipelines; they represent \njobs, economic hope, and economic strength of the greatest Nation on \nEarth. Without these pipelines, without this gas, we cannot produce \nhardly anything in the United States of America--from plastics, to \nmanufacturing, to steel, to electricity. We keep the lights on in North \nAmerica. We are proud of it. We want to do more of it. We can do more \nof it.\n  We have a bill and the political leadership to open the gulf, but \nsome people around the Capitol do not want to do that until we figure \nout the politics of drilling off the coast of California--I suggest \nthat is going to take a little more than a few weeks--or until we \nfigure out the politics of drilling off the Atlantic coast. I suggest \nthat is going to take a little bit more work. I am willing to do the \nwork. I have done a lot of the work for the last 10 years. I am \ncontinuing to do the work. It is not going to happen in the next month.\n  Meanwhile, our manufacturing cannot stay competitive with China. With \ncheap oil and cheap gas coming in from other parts of the world, they \nare laying off workers, unable to make long-term capital decisions \nbecause this Congress can't figure out, this leadership can't figure \nout how to get a bill passed that opens gas and oil in the Gulf of \nMexico. It would not be opened without a bill. It can't open without a \nbill.\n  Maybe in the ``plan''--lots of things are in a plan. I have plans for \nmy house, to decorate. That is not to say it is going to get done \nbecause there is someone else in my house--my husband--who has ideas of \nhis own about how this works. Just because you have something in a \n``plan'' doesn't mean it is going to happen. Just because MMS has these \nthings in their plan does not mean it will happen, but it could happen \nwith a bill that we could pass. If our bill is law, obviously it will \nmake it happen.\n  I will show the picture of the gulf here. This is what the Gulf of \nMexico looks like. These are active wells. The bigger picture was white \nspaces with no one else drilling. These are all the drills, the yellow \nare the leases, and these are the active wells. We are producing 30 \npercent of the Nation's needs from here. We are proud to do it. We will \nkeep doing it.\n  There is still a lot of white space we could open. That is what we \nare trying to do--open a little off the Alabama shore, give Florida the \nbuffer they have asked for. Some people do not agree with that, but we \nhad to come to terms with the situation in Florida. Their State is \ndivided on this issue. Some people in Florida want to drill, some \npeople don't want to drill. This was a compromise, as is everything \nhere, and we figured out a way to give Florida a buffer, open up some \nmore oil and gas drilling.\n  The next chart shows the area we came up with after a lot of work. \nThis lease sale that we could open opens up 9 million new acres of oil \nand gas. This will not solve my colleagues' problem, Senators Kent \nConrad and Ben Nelson, it will not solve their drought problem, but it \nwill give relief to farmers everywhere when the gas prices come down \nand the oil and gas starts coming on line.\n  To put the 9 million acres in perspective--and the Presiding Officer \nwill know this better than anyone--we have fought for 40 years over \nwhether to open ANWR, and ANWR is 6,000 acres. And our debate for 40 \nyears has been about whether to open 2,000 acres.\n  Our bill--and we have 72 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, led by \nSenator Domenici--will open 9 million acres. But some people around the \nCapitol don't think that is a significant step. They do not think that \n9 million acres makes a difference. They just think this is nothing and \nwe should keep working until we can get everything opened, and they are \nsure that will happen next year.\n  I will share the national membership list of the Consumer Alliance \nfor Energy Security. There are probably 100 or more organizations, led \nby corporations, nonprofit organizations, agriculture, chemical, \nconsumers, manufacturers--the list goes on. It is a very broad-based \nlist. It is not just an industry list; it is retailers, et cetera--the \nnational Chambers of Commerce, the Forestry Association, environmental \norganizations that understand this country is at great risk unless we \nopen access, that understand we need to do it a step at a time. We are \nmaking progress, but we have to take this a step at a time. We want to \ntake this step now.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this list printed in the Record to \nindicate that this group is on the record wanting greater access on the \nissues I am speaking about.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Consumer Alliance for Energy Security\n\n\n                        national membership list\n\n       Albemarle Corporation; Adhesive and Sealant Council, Inc.; \n     Advanced Service Corporation; Agriculture Energy Alliance; \n     Agriculture Retailers Association; Air Liquide; Air Products; \n     Aluminum Association; American Forest & Paper Association; \n     American Gas Association; American Fiber Manufacturers \n     Association; American Iron and Steel Institute; American \n     Public Gas Association; Arizona Chamber of Commerce; Arkema \n     Inc.; Ashland Inc.; Associated Oregon Industries; Associated \n     Oregon Loggers; Bayer Corporation; Bowater.\n       Carousal Promotional; CF Industries; Chemtura Corporation; \n     China Mist Tea; Ciba Specialty Chemicals; Citation Homes; \n     Colorado Agri-Business Association; Colorado Association of \n     Wheat Growers; Colorado Farm Bureau; Concerned Pastors, \n     Church of God in Christ; CoTransCo; David J.

But I want to go back to this 9 million acres. This \nwill not open without our bill. It may be in the plan, but it is under \nmoratoria. This section is under moratoria. It cannot be lifted with a \nmagic wand. The only way it can be lifted is if we pass a bill to lift \nit. If we do not pass a bill, it will stay closed, and the oil and gas \ncompanies that have pipelines in the gulf, that have the infrastructure \nin the gulf, that have the expertise in the gulf will not be allowed to \ndrill there. Meanwhile, prices go high, we lose manufacturing, \neverybody loses jobs in their States, and we wring our hands here \nsaying we cannot do anything.\n  Well, we can do something. Chevron did something pretty big last week \nor 2 weeks ago. Chevron and some of its partners discovered a major oil \nand gas find, as shown here on the map. Look how small this is. It is \njust one of these little dots, just one of them. It is so tiny on the \nmap, but it is so huge. This one discovery of Chevron called the Jack \nRig--the Jack find--and several right here in the deep water of the \nGulf of Mexico will double the reserves of the country's oil.\n  It is a significant find. It is as significant as finds in Saudi \nArabia. It is surprising, in some sense, to some people who thought we \ndrilled everything we could in America. But the fact is, Americans are \na pretty smart group of people. And our partners around the world, with \nwhom we make partnerships, can usually figure things out pretty well. \nWith the right incentives and the right ingenuity and with necessity, \nwe can find oil and gas in places we never thought we could.\n  This well is 28,000 feet deep. They found oil and gas here that is \ngoing to be a great help in the event we continue to have problems in \nthe Mideast, if we continue to have problems in Venezuela. It does not \nlook very promising there to me right now.\n  This is one small, little dot. It is probably not more than--I am not \nsure--maybe a couple hundred acres. So when people say to me: Senator, \nyour bill or Senator Domenici's bill that opens 9 million acres does \nnot do anything--and I look at what the Jack Rig did, which is right \nhere--I have to tell them I don't buy their argument, and I don't think \nthe American people do.\n  Opening more area in the Gulf of Mexico where the infrastructure is, \nwhere we have proven reserves--and because the information is \nproprietary--and you can understand why it is proprietary because this \nis a competitive business. All we can find out, according to the \ngeologists who made this discovery, is that they think they have tapped \ninto a ``fairway''--which is the way it was quoted in the newspaper--a \n``fairway'' of oil and gas, ready reserves within our grasp in the area \nthat is used for drilling, with people who know how to work on the \nrigs, in a political environment that is safe.\n  And we cannot, and will not, before we leave next week, take this \nstep because we have to wait to open drilling all over America off the \ncoast? I do not think that is a wise decision. I think we should take \nthe steps now that we can take, establish revenue sharing, which is \npart of the bill for Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and \nallow these States to be full and equal partners in sharing the \nbenefits of these resources because we most certainly share the burdens \nof pipelines, that while we are proud of them, they most certainly have \nan erosion factor.\n  Our wetlands are being lost at an alarming rate--I have spoken about \nthat many times--not just because of the impacts of oil and gas, which \nare somewhat contributory to this situation, but mostly because this \nmighty Mississippi River, which also serves the Nation's economy in a \nvery significant way, has been leveed over the centuries, and it cannot \noverflow like it used to. So the land cannot replenish itself. And so \nit continues to subside. And with global warming, it is now \nexacerbated. But that is not the subject of this talk.\n  We will put our money to great use in Louisiana. Every \nenvironmentalist should be very happy to know that our money is going \nto be used to protect and preserve this great wetlands, which is an \nenormous treasure for the Nation, and one that gives so many benefits, \nand, most importantly, with the recent hurricane, it helps protect \ngreat cities, and not just Louisiana communities, but it also protects \nMississippi. We are happy to protect our neighbors when we can.\n  This wetlands protects the gulf coast, and we need to get it restored \nfor the benefit of both the States of Mississippi and Louisiana. And it \ncreates some buffers, obviously, to Alabama, should the storm come this \nway. It will hit us first before hitting Mississippi or Alabama, and \nour wetlands reduce that surge. Having said that, we need to press on \nwith a pro-production bill in the Gulf of Mexico, laying the \nfoundation, as Senator Domenici has suggested, for revenue sharing.\n  Now, I would like to read into the Record statements that have been \nmade by Republican Senators, not Democratic Senators, although I do \nhave some of those I could read into the Record. But for the purposes \nof this debate, they are statements by Republican Senators who strongly \nsupport the Senate version, and why they support the Senate version, \nbecause I want to communicate that some people on the other side or \nsome people in the Capitol and other people are saying it is just the \nDemocrats who are stopping this broader drilling bill, and if Democrats \nwould just get their act together, we could get it done.\n\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. There are some Democrats \nopposed to the broad drilling bill, but there are many Republicans here \nopposed to the broad drilling bill.\n  Let me read one of the statements. And I am sure Senator Graham from \nSouth Carolina would not mind me restating his own speech on the floor \nof the Senate. He said, on August, 2--this is Senator Lindsey Graham, \nRepublican from South Carolina:\n\n       I do support passage of S. 3711, but I do not support the \n     bill passed by the House of Representatives earlier this \n     year. The careful compromise that is the Senate bill cannot \n     be found in the version passed by the House. I will not \n     support any legislation that opens South Carolina's coast to \n     drilling for oil. . . . I . . . encourage my colleagues in \n     the House that if they are truly serious [they will live to \n     the framework of the Senate bill].\n\n  Now, he said ``for oil.'' He may be willing to open it for gas. I \nwill grant you that. And the House bill allows a choice between oil and \ngas. But, like I said, that debate is complicated. It is multistate. It \nwill take much longer than the week we have, much longer probably than \neven next year. And the need is immediate and the need is great.\n  I know my colleagues have come to the floor, and I asked for 20 \nminutes, so I am going to wrap up my remarks in about 1 minute to give \nothers an opportunity to speak.\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\n  Let me quote from Senator Martinez, a Republican Senator from \nFlorida:\n\n       I will take a moment to thank [the House] for their \n     diligence and vigilance. [I will thank the House Members for \n     their good work. But at this time] I cannot support the House \n     version. I have had clear assurances from our leaders [here \n     in the Senate] that we are committed to working from the \n     framework of the Senate bill. That has been important to me, \n     and while I respect the hard work of our House colleagues [on \n     this subject]--\n\n  And we have some great leaders in the House, both Republicans and \nDemocrats--those are my words. He goes on to say:\n\n     and their autonomy as a body of Congress--\n\n  He says he respects that, but we must prevail in the Senate version.\n  Senator Warner said:\n\n       Many of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the \n     Gulf of Mexico bill, and they stem from what is in the House \n     bill. They said they do not want to lift the moratorium as \n     the House bill would do.\n\n  So even Senator Warner, who supports drilling off the coast of \nVirginia and has made his position clear, understands there is still \nwork to be done in order for that to happen.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let's not make the perfect the enemy of \nthe good. Let's not tell our agricultural community, our manufacturing \ncommunity, our utilities, our petrochemical industry to wait when we \nhave a bill that will open 9 million acres of gas and oil, provide \ngreat companies such as Chevron and others the opportunity--both big \noil and independents that create a lot of jobs--to explore more here \nsafely off our coast.\n  It increases our economic strength. It produces jobs immediately. It \nlowers energy prices for all consumers. And it does make our Nation \nmore secure.\n  I am going to close with this: I do not know how my colleagues feel \nabout being beholden to the politics of the Mideast right now. I do not \nknow how my colleagues feel about being beholden to the politics going \non in Venezuela. I do not feel comfortable with it. I do feel \ncomfortable about the politics of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and \nTexas. They are Americans. And we have our deal together. We want to \ndrill for all Americans, for the security of our Nation.\n  Please, allow us to give this country more oil and gas. Please allow \nus to lower prices. And let's take it a step at a time. I promise my \ncolleagues--the Senator from Pennsylvania knows very well the people in \nPennsylvania need relief. I say to the Senator, they cannot wait \nanother year or two. They need it now. He knows that well. He has been \na strong advocate for his people in Pennsylvania. But we have to open \nthis up now. And we will come back and work offshore Alaska, offshore \nmaybe some of these other States, when their Governors and when their \nlegislators and when their political leadership can get their \nneighborhoods together.\n  But the neighborhood of the gulf is together. Our Governors are \ntogether. Our Senators are together. And our people are together. We \nwant to do this for America. Please let's do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                            ENERGY SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I will pick up where the \nSenator from Louisiana just left off, and congratulate her for her \nenergetic support for energy security in this country. This is a huge \nissue. It is actually the reason I came to the floor to talk today, to \ntalk about energy security. I am going to talk about a comprehensive \napproach I am introducing today, and a big part of that comprehensive \napproach is the passage of the legislation the Senator from Louisiana \nhas talked about in addition to additional things she has talked about \nthat we would like to do. If we could do them this year, great, let's \ntry to do them this year.\n  Let's try to do more OCS this year. But let's get done as much as we \ncan this year. Let's, if we can, pass the Senate bill. If there are \nadditional provisions we can accomplish this year to--the Senator from \nAlaska is here behind me. The Senator from Louisiana mentioned the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. Let's try to get those done. Maybe there are \nsome other things we can add, maybe in different pieces of legislation, \nto move this ball forward. There are conference reports that are going \nto be coming out, and it is not unheard of to place a little tidbit or \ntwo in a conference report. Let's sit down and have serious \nnegotiations and discussions with the House to try to get as much as we \npossibly can without walking out of here empty handed.\n  So I would very much like to see that done. I congratulate the \nSenator from Louisiana, as well as all of those who have stepped \nforward--the chairman of the Energy Committee, obviously, Senator \nDomenici, and Senator Stevens, who is here on the Senate floor--for all \nof their efforts to try to do something that I think is vitally \nimportant.\n  I think the Senator from Louisiana put it in the right context. The \ncontext is that we are at war with a group of people we are funding \nbecause of the high cost of energy. Let's just be very honest about it. \nThis is a very serious war we are involved in, and we are directly \ncontributing huge amounts of American resources to the people who would \nlike to destroy everything we believe. That is a country that is on a \nmission of suicide. We need to have more energy security because that \nleads to better national security.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Santorum pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3926 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor his comments and hope more people will listen to him. He is \ncertainly on the right track as far as this Senator is concerned.\n\n\n        Advanced Telecommunications and Opportunities Reform Act\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to remind the \nSenate that the Senate Commerce Committee reported to the Senate a \nbipartisan bill, the Senate communications bill, and it is critical \nthat the Senate consider this bill on the floor.\n  It is a bill that is good for the consumer. This bill seeks to reduce \nphone rates for our troops overseas. This bill makes available \nimmediately $1 billion for our first responders. That is money that has \nbeen held in the Treasury since last December awaiting authorization \nfor this money to be released.\n  This money will be used to train, coordinate, and provide \ninteroperable equipment to those first responders. This is money they \nabsolutely must have.\n  This bill creates caches of emergency communications equipment which \nwill be located throughout our Nation, equipment that is absolutely \nnecessary in the event of an emergency, particularly emergencies caused \nby terrorist activity in the future.\n  This bill encourages broadband deployment for consumers. We are \nbehind the world in deployment of broadband. This bill reduces consumer \ncable rates, a step that is vital to assure that our people can \ncontinue to expand the use of cable in terms of communication.\n  This bill creates choices for consumers for both video and phone \nservice. It is a bill to level the playing field between the various \nproviders of communications capability for all Americans.\n  This bill will broaden the base for universal service. This is a \nconcept that makes communications available to rural America which is \ncritical, and it is critical to consider a way to make it more \naffordable and to make sure that the contribution required from users \nof our communications system is as small as possible, but at the same \ntime meets the needs so that every American can have available \ncommunications.\n  I believe availability of communications is a new right for American \ncitizens. Everyone must have the ability to learn of emergencies and \nhave the ability to communicate.\n  This bill exempts the Universal Service Fund from the Antideficiency \nAct. That will be good for our Nation's schools and libraries that rely \non universal service funding. It is necessary because of the \nfluctuations in the use of this fund, and it should not be considered \nunder the Antideficiency Act.\n  This bill permits municipalities to provide broadband service \nthroughout\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\nAmerica in both urban and rural communities. The so-called Wi-Fi \nconcept will be expanded.\n  The bill expands access for the blind and hearing impaired to the \nvoice over the Internet. VOIP is a brandnew system. It must be \navailable to those with disabilities, as well as all other Americans.\n  There is wide support for the Senate communications bill. Several \ndays ago, a letter that was signed by over 100 companies sent to our \nleaders was made available. These are companies involved in the \nmanufacture, design, and construction of telecommunications networks. \nThese 100 companies express support for our bill because it encourages \nbroadband deployment. They support the bill's lighter regulatory \napproach to the concepts of net neutrality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to read this. The letter is \naddressed to Senator Bill Frist and Senator Harry Reid, the two leaders \nof our parties in the Senate. It says:\n\n       Dear Senators Frist and Reid:\n       As leaders in the networking and communications industries \n     striving to produce new technologies for our nation and the \n     world, we are pleased to support the Advanced \n     Telecommunications and Opportunities Reform Act (H.R. 5252) \n     as approved by the Senate Commerce Committee. It is our hope \n     that the full Senate will approve this legislation in the \n     very near future.\n       We are particularly pleased that an Internet Consumers Bill \n     of Rights has been incorporated into this bill to address the \n     so-called ``network neutrality'' issue. We believe this \n     approach to net neutrality will ensure that consumers have \n     access to the content of their choice.\n       We are strongly opposed to the adoption of mandated net \n     neutrality regulation sought by large Internet content \n     businesses for a number of reasons. First, the Internet has \n     benefited greatly from the relative absence of regulatory \n     restrictions, which has allowed content businesses to grow \n     and prosper. Congress has wisely refrained from burdening \n     this still-evolving medium with regulations, except in those \n     cases where the need for policy action has been clear, and it \n     can be narrowly tailored. This is not the time to deviate \n     from this posture.\n       Second, it is too soon to enact network neutrality \n     legislation. The problem that the proponents of net \n     neutrality seek to address has not manifested itself in a way \n     that enables us to understand it clearly. Legislation aimed \n     at correcting a nebulous concern may have severe unintended \n     consequences and hobble the rapidly developing new \n     technologies and business models of the Internet. Third, \n     enacting network neutrality ``placeholder laws'' could have \n     the unintended effect of dissuading companies from investing \n     in broadband networks.\n       We believe Congress would benefit from objective and \n     unbiased analysis of the claims made on both sides of this \n     debate, and that protecting consumer access while requiring \n     the FCC to study the issue is a reasonable way to proceed.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this legislation. We stand \n     ready to build the world-class products that will be \n     available to consumers as a result of the increased \n     investment this bill will promote.\n\n  It is signed, as I said, by 100 companies.\n  By supporting this bill, because it encourages broadband deployment, \nthey support the lighter regulatory approach to net neutrality, as I \nsaid. There has been much debate on this issue in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, in the House committees, on the House floor, in newspapers, \nand in the ``blogosphere,'' as it is called now. But some Senators \nstill prevent full debate on this issue on the Senate floor. It is time \nnow for the Senate to allow debate on this bill to start. America needs \nthis bill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               September 19, 2006.\n     Hon.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments regarding \nthe pending business, H.R. 6061, the act that came to us from the House \nof Representatives which is titled the Secure Fence Act of 2006, the \nessence of which would provide the authority for the United States to \nconstruct a variety of features across large portions of our border \nwith Mexico to prevent illegal immigration.\n  The point of this legislation is, of course, to follow through with a \nseries of appropriations that we have now provided for to enhance our \nability to put National Guard troops at the border, construct more \nfencing, construct more roads, more vehicle barriers,\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nmore sensors, more lights, more cameras, and provide more Border Patrol \nto patrol this large area of our border.\n  The combination of all of these, personnel and infrastructure and \ntechnology enhancements, will enable us to gain effective control of \nour border. I am pleased that as a result of the appropriations we have \npassed over the last couple of years, we are now beginning to see our \nefforts pay off. In many areas of the border, the enhanced security is \npaying off. It is noticeable. I will cite some of the statistics to \npoint that out.\n  I express support for this legislation because it provides a roadmap. \nIt makes it very clear where we are going. It establishes principles by \nwhich the Department of Homeland Security can operate with the funding \nwe have been providing and will provide in the future.\n  The essence of the legislation, as I said, is to provide more \nreinforced fencing, more physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, \nand sensors. The Secretary of Homeland Security obviously will \ndetermine the appropriate sequencing of when these things are \nconstructed and the appropriate mix as to where you put the fencing, \nwhere you put the vehicle barriers, the sensors, and so forth. The bill \nitself, for example, recognizes that in mountainous areas, you would be \nexempt from providing some of the fencing. But the bottom line is to \nprovide a combination of things which, in concert with personnel, will \nmake it much more difficult for illegal entry into the United States. \nThe net result will be that it will be much more difficult for \nsmugglers and illegal aliens to gain entry into the country, it will \nsignificantly reduce crime rates in border towns, it will clearly \nimprove the quality of life for Arizona and for the constituents I \nrepresent, and it will preserve the fragile desert lands and \narcheological resources which are being destroyed by the illegal \npedestrian and vehicular traffic, again particularly along the area of \nthe border between the State of Arizona and the area of Senora in \nnorthern Mexico.\n  Let me talk for just a moment about the environmental impact because \nthat has been a matter of some concern to those who view this \nlegislation as simply involving the creation of some kind of a wall. \nNow, let me make it clear. This is not a wall. Fencing, per se, is not \na wall. In fact, part of what we would be doing here is replacing the \nso-called landing mat fencing, which does look like a wall, with chain \nlink-type fencing that you can see through. There are two reasons for \nthis. The landing mat fencing is the steel landing mats that are left \nover from primarily World War II that can be stood on end and welded \ntogether, embedded in concrete pilings, and represent a barrier to \nentry into the country. They are high and it is hard to get over them \nbut not at all impossible. All you need is a ladder on the other side \nof the fence and a willingness to fall down and maybe break an arm on \nthis side, and a lot of people do that.\n  The fencing is deteriorating. It is very difficult to repair because \nof its age. And for the Border Patrol, they can't see through it, so it \nrepresents a disadvantage to them because they can't see who is \namassing on the other side of the border. They can't see where rocks \nare being thrown from, and now rock-throwing has been a highly \ndangerous problem for members of the Border Patrol. So they would \nprefer to have either single or, even better, double fencing which they \ncould see through and which is a more modern design than this landing \nmat fencing. So far from being a wall, what is contemplated in this \nlegislation is exactly the opposite. It involves a fence which you can \nsee through combined with other kinds of technology such as vehicle \nbarriers, cameras with which we can see illegal entry, sensors with \nwhich we can detect it, and lights which help us to see.\n  Now, we are not going to put the fencing along the entire border, \nobviously. In some parts of the border, particularly near urban \ncommunities, we will extend the fencing. In other areas, the \nlegislation contemplates vehicle barriers. This is important because in \ncertain flat areas of the desert, a lot of vehicles are being brought \nacross now. Ordinarily they are stolen in the United States, taken \nacross the border, filled with some kind of contraband, be it illegal \ndrugs or the human cargo the Coyotes pick up, and then they bring that \nacross the border. Frequently, those vehicles are abandoned on our side \nof the border, representing an environmental hazard.\n  But what the Border Patrol has discovered is that as they have begun \nto get more operational control or jurisdiction over the border area \nbecause of the increased number of Border Patrol agents and vehicles \nand fencing and so on that we have already provided, the Coyotes and \nthe cartels--the drug smugglers, the gangs--are fighting for this \noperational control of territory, and they are using weapons. What the \nBorder Patrol tells me is that whenever they see a vehicle, they know \nit is a problem because it has a more valuable cargo and is likely to \nbe defended with weapons. That is one reason they are so insistent on \nputting vehicle barriers in some areas of the border.\n  In some areas, fencing will not be appropriate, and cameras will do \nthe job. I have been in the control rooms where we have one person able \nto monitor many different TV screens that represent the views of many \ndifferent cameras, some of which are infrared, so you can see at night. \nThis way, you don't have to have fencing all along the border; you have \ncameras which can show you what is happening. When you see groups of \nillegal immigrants massing on the other side of the border, preparing \nto cross, the person in the control area calls the Border Patrol, and \nthey are able to get to the location in time to stop the entry or to \npick up the people and return them if they have already entered.\n\n  Again, you don't need fencing across the entire border. It is not a \nwall. It is not solid fencing. It is a combination of things which, \nworking together, will enable us to secure the border.\n  I mentioned the environment because I think it is important for us to \nrecognize that more fencing and these other techniques can actually \nhelp improve our environment. It does not degrade the environment. The \nillegal border crossing traffic has created thousands of new trails and \nroads on Federal lands in Arizona. I am going to submit for the Record \nthe documentation of each of the things I am saying here rather than \nprovide them orally, but for each of these comments I am making, there \nis documentation through hearings that have been held, through reports \nthat have been issued, through stories that have appeared in newspapers \nand so on.\n  For example, the Defenders of Wildlife notes that since 2002, 180 \nmiles of illegal roads have been created in the Cabeza Prieta National \nWildlife Refuge alone. This is a wildlife refuge we have set aside for \nthe pronghorn antelope and bighorn sheep and other species we want to \nprotect, and the entry of all of these vehicles, illegally creating \nthese new roads, is substantially disrupting the habitat, for example, \nfor the bighorn sheep. The illegal roads divert the normal flow of \nwater, and they rob native plant cover of the moisture it needs to \nsurvive. The proliferation of trails and roads damages the flora and \nfauna--the cactus, for example, and other sensitive vegetation--and \ndisrupts and even prevents the revegetation of the area. You can see \ntracks in the desert that were created over 50 or 60 years ago, and it \ntakes that long for the fragile desert to recover. That is one of the \nunfortunate results of all of this illegal immigration, which could be \nprevented with more vehicle barriers and fencing along the border.\n  The trails obviously create soil compacts and then erosion which, in \nother areas, results in damage. I have seen with my own eyes the tons \nof trash that is left behind. If you can imagine millions of people \nover the course of time trying to cross the border and leaving behind \nhundreds of thousands of plastic water jugs and items of clothing and \nelements in backpacks and the like, it is just incredible, what you \nsee, and it creates all kinds of problems. This proliferation of trash \nand, by the way, concentrations of human waste, I would also note, \nimpacts wildlife and vegetation and water quality. It detracts from the \nscenic qualities, obviously, and can affect human and animal health \nfrom the spread of bacteria and disease. Trash is also ingested by \nwildlife and livestock, which sometimes results in illness or even \ndeath of the livestock and wildlife.\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\n  In the early 1990s, over 300 wildfires were caused by campfires of \nillegal immigrants, which additionally poses a threat both to the \nenvironment and to human safety in these areas.\n  The damage is not limited to the compaction, and so on, by human \ntraffic. As I noted, vehicles coming across create their own special \nset of problems. Abandoned vehicles are often left in place, and the \nburden of removing them falls to the Government, which has to very \ncarefully try to get to the vehicles without creating new roads and \ntrails and get them removed without causing even more environmental \ndamage. If they are not removed quickly, they are often set on fire by \nvandals. They have fluids that leak into the watershed and into water \ncourses. As I said, further removal causes additional damage as the tow \ntrucks are forced to navigate previously unspoiled areas of the desert.\n  Interestingly, the illegal immigrants frequently take vegetation from \nthe environment to build shelters, and by taking a lot of the ocotillo \ncactus, for example, they are removing a very important species from \nthe desert to build these camouflages, drug stashes, and temporary \nshelters.\n  Also, interestingly, when illegal aliens fill water bottles in the \nwetland locations, it has been determined that they have actually \ninfected these protected Federal wetlands with invasive parasites and \ndiseases which have been carried with them in the water levels which \nhave harmed native fish and wildlife. In fact, in a report to the House \nof Representatives committee, according to this report, new tapeworms \nand fungi have already impacted populations of endangered fish and \nfrogs.\n  So when we talk about the potential damage to the environment from \nthe fences, it is easy to see that there is far more of a benefit than \na cost to creating impediments to illegal entry which is creating the \nkind of environmental impacts I am talking about.\n  Just to give one summary impact, Coronado National Forest, which is \non the border in the area of Tucson, experienced the following \nenvironmental degradation from the period 1996 to 2006: 298 abandoned \nmotor vehicles, 300 miles of significant damage to environmental \nresources caused by off-road vehicle use, 120 human-caused wildfires.\n  There is an interesting parallel with the fence which was built in \nthe San Diego area. There was concern about the environment there as \nwell. But not only has the construction of that triple fence in the \narea of San Diego virtually stopped illegal immigration in that area, \nit has significantly reduced crime on both sides of the border because \nthe criminals who used to congregate in the area are no longer \ncongregating in the area because they can't get across. The result is \nthe San Diego fence has significantly improved the environment in the \narea, with grasslands coming back and the return of protected species \nthat hadn't been reported in the area for years. I believe all of this \nis an important element in that debate, demonstrating that the \nadditional fencing and other border technology can help to prevent \nenvironmental damage.\n  But what of the primary purpose of the fencing to prevent illegal \nentry? This is important for a variety of reasons. Due to the close \nproximity of the border to a number of major highways in the State of \nArizona, illegal immigrant and drug trafficking is often intense. When \nsmugglers can manage to reach the roads, they often resort to excessive \nspeed, driving without lights, and driving down the wrong side of the \nroad to escape law enforcement. There have been a lot of injuries and \ndeaths and attacks on Border Patrol that have resulted. We had an \nactual shoot-out on the freeway between Tucson and Phoenix between two \nrival gangs who were contesting to see who could own the illegal \nimmigrants in the van at issue. Frequently, these vans are wrecked, \noverturned, and a lot of illegal immigrants are killed or injured.\n  In the one unfortunate case, in the town of Sierra Vista near the \nborder, an elderly couple in the community had just gotten married--I \nbelieve it was the week before--and they were simply driving through an \nintersection, minding their own business, when, with excessive speed in \norder to avoid apprehension, a load of illegal immigrants came crashing \nthrough, hit their vehicle, and killed them both. You can imagine the \nsorrow as well as the anger in this small community when these \nwonderful people, who were known to many of the residents of the \ncommunity, when their lives were extinguished right after they were \nmarried and looking forward to some very happy years because of this \nillegal activity. This has real impacts on people's lives in the United \nStates, and that is another reason to end it.\n  We had testimony in the subcommittee which I chair--of the Judiciary \nCommittee--Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security, about the \nnumber of illegal immigrants who cross who are criminals or who are \nwanted for crimes. It isn't just a matter of keeping people from \nentering the United States to work. The testimony was, by the head of \nthe Border Patrol, that now over 10 percent of the illegal immigrants \napprehended coming into this country are criminals. I am not talking \nabout immigration violations; I am talking about serious crimes such as \nhomicide, rape, assault, kidnapping, serious drug crimes. It is not \nonly overloading our law enforcement and court systems, but it is also \ncreating a huge problem at the border.\n  The U.S. attorney for Arizona, Paul Charlton, testified that last \nyear assaults at the border were up 108 percent. Why? Because, as I \nsaid before, the Border Patrol and law enforcement is now contesting \nthe territory that before the cartels and the coyotes had some degree \nof control over, and they are fighting back. They are fighting back \nwith weapons, and they are also fighting back with things like rocks, \nwhich you may not think is a threat until you get hit in the head with \none and are severely injured and maimed, really, for the rest of your \nlife.\n  There is a lot to protect with more fencing, more vehicle barriers, \nmore cameras, more sensors, and the like at our border. It is \ninteresting that vehicle barriers, which are important because, as I \nsaid, whenever the Border Patrol sees a vehicle, they know they have a \nproblem because of an important value in the load. Vehicle barriers \nhave worked in the Buenos Aires National Wildlife area, for example, \nwhere there has been a 90-percent reduction. In the Organ Pipe Cactus \nNational Monument there has been a 95 percent reduction in vehicle \ntraffic. It can work. But we have to do it.\n  People say we have tried it and it doesn't work. We have barely \nstarted. In fact, there are almost four times as many New York City \npolice officers as there are members of the Border Patrol. So our \neffort now to build up the Border Patrol, add this fencing, add the \nvehicle barriers, add the cameras, and all these things to the border \nis beginning to have an impact. It can work. We simply have to do more. \nThat is what this legislation would provide.\n  I will not cite the statistics, but there is great evidence that the \nfencing in the San Diego area has substantially reduced the amount of \nillegal traffic across the border. It used to represent about half of \nthe border crossings. It is now down to 10 percent. In the area of the \ntriple fence, it is practically zero, I am told.\n  The bottom line is that we can make a substantial difference by not \nonly appropriating the money--I saw, just a moment ago, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee here, and the subcommittee in charge of \nappropriations for this effort. The Senator from New Hampshire was on \nthe Senate floor a moment ago. I commend him again for his efforts, \nprimarily in the last couple of years, to make funds available to do \nall these things.\n  As I said, we are moving forward with this at the border, and it is \nbeginning to make a difference. What the legislation passed in the \nHouse of Representatives will enable us to do is to have a clear path, \na clear guideline of exactly what we are going to do. It provides \ndiscretion to the Department of Homeland Security about what exactly to \ndo in what areas. It is not a fence along the entire border, it is a \ncombination of these different things as the Department of Homeland \nSecurity deems appropriate. But we believe, in consultation with the \nBorder Patrol, with local officials, that they can determine where best \nto put each of these assets and how to sequence their construction in \nsuch a way as to eventually gain control of the border, and that should \nbe our first goal here: to\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\nestablish control of the border, to secure the border so we can move on \nwith the other elements of comprehensive immigration reform which, \nincidentally, I support very strongly. But I think most of us agree a \nfirst step must be to secure the border.\n  I commend this bill to my colleagues. I hope we will be able to get \ncloture on Monday and we can proceed to its adoption. For those \nconstituents in my home State of Arizona, this would be a very big \nbenefit since over half of the illegal immigrants now entering the \nUnited States come through my State of Arizona. This is critically \nimportant for my State, but it is also important for the United States, \nand I hope my colleagues will join together to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome background materials on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Nearly 50 percent of the illegal aliens crossing the \n     southern border of the United States enter through Arizona in \n     the Tucson and Yuma Sectors.

(Source: Office of Legislative Affairs, U.S. Customs \n     and Border Protection).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would just like to add to what my \ncolleague from Arizona has said about the importance of border \nsecurity. One of the clear priorities in the debate about immigration \nis what are we going to do to take steps to ensure that we stem the \nflow of illegal immigration in this country. The Senator from Arizona \nhas been a great leader on this issue. I commend him for that. Of \ncourse his State is right down there on the border. But, ironically, \neven in my State, the State of South Dakota, which is somewhat removed \nfrom the border, we are experiencing the effects, some of the negative \neffects of immigration.\n  In fact, I had a meeting not long ago with law enforcement personnel \nin my State--State, Federal, local law enforcement--to talk about the \nmethamphetamine issue which has become a real epidemic in my State like \nit has in many other places. In fact, methamphetamine arrests were up \n45 percent last year in Sioux Falls, which is\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\nour biggest city. There is what is known as the I-29 corridor, from \nSioux City to Sioux Falls, beyond to South Dakota, and up into North \nDakota. It has become afflicted with the methamphetamine crisis.\n  As I met with them, one of the things that became very clear is that \nmuch of what is driving the methamphetamine scourge in our area of the \ncountry is people who have come here illegally. It is illegal \nimmigrants who come in and set up these distribution systems in this \ncountry, and they are targeting the Indian reservations. There have \nbeen a number of stories about how the methamphetamine--if you want to \ncall them cartels or whatever--have looked for places in the United \nStates where they have wide open space, which we have on our \nreservations in South Dakota and we do not have sufficient law \nenforcement to necessarily keep up with some of those problems. They \nare targeting Indian reservations.\n  I talked to one law enforcement individual from one of the \nreservations who said they had just sent back somebody who had come \ninto this country, broken the law on the reservation, for the ninth \ntime. That is how easy it has become to get in and out of this country \nillegally. That is why it is important this issue be addressed.\n  I understand there are differences of opinion in the Senate about how \nto address this; whether or not we ought to have a comprehensive \napproach or how we deal with those who are already here illegally. I \nthink those are all points of debate and issues we need to continue to \ndiscuss and resolve. But we have to start fundamentally with stopping \nthe problem now. The people of this country expect us to act. It is a \nmatter of national security.\n  We have the possibility of terrorist organizations using our open, \nporous border as an opportunity to get a foothold in this country. As I \nhave said, we have a lot of law enforcement issues related to people \nwho come here illegally and then commit illegal acts--the \nmethamphetamine incidents I talked about in South Dakota being one \nexample. But, clearly, we need to start sealing, securing this southern \nborder to make sure the people of this country have confidence that we \nare taking the steps necessary to stem the flow of illegal immigration \nand to get this issue under control.\n  I appreciate the work the chairman of the Budget Committee and others \nhave done to put more resources and funds toward that because I think \nit has made a profound difference already. But, frankly, this \nlegislation we are considering today is important because it will send \na loud, clear message to the people in this country that we are serious \nabout this issue of illegal immigration, starting with securing the \nborder.\n  The other issues that follow from that we can debate. There is an \nagreement on that. I think the one thing there is agreement on, the one \nthing people in this country want to see action on now is let's get \nthis border secure. So this border security bill that has come over \nfrom the House and is being debated in the Senate, I hope we will get a \nvote on it and be able to pass it through the Senate and put something \non the President's desk that will move us in the right direction, a \ndirection that will discourage people from coming here illegally. The \nthing we want to do is discourage people from coming here illegally.\n  I say that as a person one generation removed from immigrant status. \nMy grandfather and great-uncle came here from Norway in 1906. We are a \nnation of immigrants. People come for the same reason they did: they \nwant to experience the American dream.\n  We are a welcoming nation, and we are also a nation of laws. We need \nto enforce those laws, and this legislation moves us in that direction. \nIt deals with what is the first priority in this debate, and that is \nsecuring the American border so that not only from a national security \nstandpoint, a law enforcement standpoint but, frankly, just so people \nin this country know and people in other countries in the world who \nwant to come here illegally know that we are a nation of laws, and we \nare going to enforce those laws.\n\n  That is where this debate should start. This will give us an \nopportunity to do something about which I think there is broad \nagreement. We can address the other issues in due time, but right now, \nin the time we have left in the Senate before we adjourn, it is \nimportant we address this issue.\n  I want to speak to one other matter. I came to the floor yesterday, \nand I want to follow up on something I said.\n  For anybody who watched the comments at the United Nations made by \nHugo Chavez of Venezuela, it should have removed any doubt about the \nimportance of American energy independence. We need to become energy \nindependent. We get a million barrels of oil a day from Venezuela. This \nis a country whose leader was spewing hatred at the United States; \nsomeone who, in the past, has said that the President and his \nadministration were responsible and behind the 9/11 attacks.\n  This is a country, and many of the other countries like that one, \nwhere we get the majority of our energy. They are countries that are \nhostile to the United States. They want to use the leverage they have \nas a political weapon against the United States.\n  The way we avoid that from happening is America becomes energy \nindependent. We need more sources of American energy. We need to take \nsteps so that we have the supply in this country that will enable us to \nmeet the needs that we have in our economy, without having to get \nenergy from the Middle East or from Venezuela, OPEC, other countries \nthat have very hostile intentions toward the United States.\n  Yesterday, I came down here to talk about a bill that will move us in \nthat direction. I have legislation that is pending in the Senate. It \nhas passed the House. As a matter of fact, it passed the House by a \nhuge margin, 355 to 9, broad bipartisan support coming from the House. \nIt comes here from the Senate. Senator Salazar and I have a substitute \namendment to that which has been cleared by the Republicans in the \nSenate. The House has said as soon as we send it back to them they will \npass it and it will be put on the President's desk. But we have a \nseries of secret holds on the Democratic side in the Senate.\n  I know that is part of the tradition of the Senate. I don't happen to \nthink it is a good part of the tradition of the Senate, that people can \nput a secret hold on a bill and you don't have any idea who has a hold \non it, what their issues are. I have my suspicions, since this is an \neven-numbered year, about why some of these holds are being placed on \nthis bill. Nevertheless, it has the relevant committee's blessing. It \nhas been approved by the committees here.\n  As I said, we have cleared all the traps on the Republican side of \nthe aisle in the Senate. So the legislation is ready to be passed, sent \nback to the House, sent to the President, and signed into law. But we \nhave a series of secret holds on the Democratic side in the Senate. \nThat is wrong. Whatever the motivations are, this is policy that is \nimportant to the country.\n  I just mentioned the issue of energy security, of energy \nindependence. This is an issue that strikes at the very heart and core \nof almost every issue we are debating in the country today, whether it \nis the economy and the cost of energy, whether it is national security, \nforeign policy--energy, the fact that we depend upon foreign sources \nfor our energy supply in this country, is a very serious and vexing \nproblem. We have to address it. We need to put policies in place that \nwill create more supply here in America.\n  This legislation, again, very briefly--to explain it because I \nexplained a little bit yesterday--fills the distribution gap that we \nhave in the area of renewable energy. We passed an energy policy last \nsummer. Part of our policy is a renewable fuels standard which \nguarantees a market for ethanol and other types of bioenergy. We now \nhave a lot of plants around the country that are operating at full \ncapacity, producing ethanol. We have plants under construction. My \nState of South Dakota has been at the forefront of that movement, but \nwe will very shortly be at a billion gallons a year production of \nethanol.\n  The problem we have is we do not have a way of getting it to the \nconsumer in this country because we don't have enough refueling \nstations, gas stations, and convenience stores that have installed the \npumps that are necessary to deliver E85 to consumers in this country.\n  This was an ad that was run in one of the local publications here, \nCongress\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\nDaily. I saw it a few days ago. I saw it again today in that same \npublication. It is put out by the Auto Alliance. The Auto Alliance in \nthis country, which represents the major car manufacturers, is very \nmuch supporting this legislation. What this ad says is that there are 9 \nmillion alternative fuel autos in this country today--and counting: 9 \nmillion cars in America today that are what we call flex-fuel vehicles; \nthat is, they are capable of running either on traditional gasoline or \nE85 ethanol. Nine million vehicles--they are ramping up, building, and \nmanufacturing more flex-fuel vehicles. If you watch the television \nadvertisements today and you see the auto manufacturers run their \nadvertising, they are talking more and more about flex-fuel vehicles. \nThis is an important priority for the auto industry. They have the cars \nthat are out there that are capable of using E85. The problem is, there \nare not enough filling stations that have it available.\n  In their letter that they sent in support of this bill, the Alliance \nof Auto Manufacturers says--and I used the number yesterday. This is a \nslightly different number, but it is in the ballpark. I said there were \n600 gas stations in this country that offer E85 out of a total of \n18,000. In their letter they say 830 gas stations, so maybe it has gone \nup a little bit, out of the total number of gas stations in the country \nthat have E85 ability.\n  There are 9 million vehicles and counting that can run on flex fuel \nusing E85 or other bioenergy--only using the high number of 830 \nrefueling stations where they can get that.\n  In the Midwest where I am from, in South Dakota, we have a number of \nfilling stations that make E85 available. But that is the exception and \nnot the rule.\n  Our bill provides an incentive for these refuelers to install E85 \npumps, not just E85. This isn't just an ethanol issue; other \nalternative energy types of fuels can be used. But it provides an \nincentive for them to install pumps to make renewable energy and \nalternative sources of energy more readily available to consumers in \nthis country. It does it very simply by providing grants up to $30,000 \nper pump at the gas station. Because they can install more than one, \nthey can take advantage of the incentive more than once. If they \ninstall an E85 pump, they can get up to $30,000 to do that. The cost of \ninstalling one of those pumps, depending on where you are in the \ncountry, is between $40,000 and $200,000.\n  The simple fact is, this incentive will go a long way. As has been \nnoted, and as I said, the auto manufacturers sent a letter supporting \nthe bill, as has the National Association of Convenience Stores which \nrepresents all of the gas stations around the country. They are \nsupporting this; the auto manufacturers are supporting this.\n  It does not affect the budget because we paid for it. The way we paid \nfor it is by using the fines that are paid by foreign auto \nmanufacturers for violations of fuel efficiency standards. Take a fine \nwhich has been paid and apply those dollars toward a program that \nprovides incentives for fuel retailers to install five pumps and other \npumps that offer other forms of alternative energy.\n  But, frankly, as I said before, it is an important priority. We have \nauto manufacturers making the cars, ethanol producers that are \nproducing the ethanol, you have consumers in this country who want this \nproduct, and you have a requirement now, because of the renewable fuels \nstandard that we passed last year and put into law in the Energy bill, \nthat States meet those standards. You have all of these things \nclicking. And Hugo Chavez comes to the United States and at the U.N. in \na vitriolic way attacks our country and our leaders. Here we are \ngetting a million barrels of oil a day from that country.\n  We need American energy. We need to be energy independent. We need to \nmove America in a direction toward the future and take us away from \nrelying on the traditional sources of energy.\n  We get almost 55 percent of our energy from outside the United \nStates--and that has to change.\n  This legislation is broadly supported. It came out of the House by a \nvote of 355 to 9. It is broadly supported.\n  I have had Senators from both sides of the aisle come up to me--and, \nof course, I said it is cleared on the Republican side. I have had \nDemocratic Senators say they really support the legislation. This is a \ngood thing.\n  Again, I am at a loss--it is a mystery to me--to try to explain why \nanyone would be opposed to this. The only thing I can suggest is there \nare perhaps some election year motivations. I don't know the answer to \nthat. I hope that is not the case.\n  This is the right thing to do for the country. It is the right policy \nto put in place for America's future. I call on my colleagues on the \nDemocratic side who have these anonymous, secret holds--we don't know \nwho is holding it up. I wish I knew the answer to that. I would love to \nhave them come down here and defend their position because there is \nabsolutely no logical reason anybody would object to this piece of \nlegislation which implements policy, consistent with the energy policy \nthat we adopted last summer, the renewable fuels standard, and make \navailable for people in this country E85 ethanol.\n  There are 9 million automobiles in this country and counting that can \nrun on E85. If you use the generous estimate, there are 850 refueling \nstations. That is a terrible gap. We need to fill that gap in the \ndistribution system in this country. This legislation would do that.\n  It is ready for action in the House, and it is ready to go to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  But we have, as I said, some anonymous and secret holds on the \nDemocrat side preventing this legislation from moving forward.\n  I ask my colleagues--I urge my colleagues--on the other side of the \naisle to release those holds and allow this bipartisan legislation, \nthis important legislation, to get to the President's desk so we can \nbegin to lessen our dependence on foreign sources of energy, on \ndictators, and countries like Venezuela and Iran, and have American-\ngrown energy that will make America independent as we head into the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank you. I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for 5 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Equal Opportunity for Asian Americans\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to bring to the \nattention of our colleagues a full-page article which ran in the \nbusiness section of the Washington Post recently headlined ``American \nCore Values, Equal Opportunity.'' I had some discussion in my caucus \nthis week focusing on diversity and focusing on diversity of our own \nstaff here on Capitol Hill and how well we are doing. This is an issue \nthat is on my mind.\n  Some of my colleagues may be familiar with something called the 80-20 \nEducational Foundation which seeks to promote equal opportunity for \nAsian Americans. The president of the foundation, as it turns out, is a \ncolleague and friend of mine, a constituent. He is former Lieutenant \nGovernor, recently retired physics professor at the University of \nDelaware, Dr. S.B. Woo.\n  Here are some of the findings of 88-20's research as spelled out in \nthe article in the paper.\n  No. 1. When compared to Whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, and \nwomen, Asian-Americans have the lowest odds of rising to management \nlevel positions in private industry, universities, and even in the \nFederal Government.\n  No. 2. This is interesting because 80-20's research also indicates \nthat Asian-Americans are much more likely to obtain a college degree or \nhigher than Whites, African-Americans, Hispanics, or women.\n  The data indicates that Asian-Americans have half the chance of \nWhites of rising to management-level positions.\n  If this is right, then this is wrong.\n  From the charts, we can also see that African-Americans, Hispanics, \nand women are still lagging behind as well. They are also less likely \nto rise to management level positions. And, perhaps more troubling for \nthe future, they are also much less likely to obtain advanced degrees.\n  This country was founded on the premise that all men and all women \nare created equal and that we must always strive for equality and \njustice for all of us.\n  We have made great strides over the years. We have taken steps to get \ncloser to that goal of equality and justice\n\n[[Page S9876]]\n\nfor all. As I have often said, we can obviously make it better.\n  But an important part of that fight--which I think is illustrated in \nthe Washington Post--is keeping vigilant. We must continue to stay \nvigilant to promote equal opportunity for all Americans, not just \nAsian-Americans. Each of the groups in these charts faces different \nbarriers, different challenges. And although we have made great \nprogress in the opportunities for all Americans, we cannot become \ncomplacent and assume that there is no work left to be done.\n  The fight for equal opportunity is a fight we must not allow to lag.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider the important information that is \npresented here today and maybe take the opportunity to look at it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post item printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       America's Core Value: Equal Opportunity\n       What makes America great also enhances competitiveness.\n       Asian Americans yearn to make greater contributions to our \n     country.\n       However, today, Asian Americans have the least opportunity \n     to enter management and the slowest rate of progress towards \n     equal employment opportunity, despite having the highest \n     educational attainment.\n       As the world's economic and geopolitical centers shift, can \n     our nation afford to waste some of her best human resources?\n       [Chart 1]\n       [Chart 2]\n       Research Shows\n       A. Asian Americans have the lowest odds of getting into \n     management in private industries, universities and the \n     Federal government. 2.1 million Asian Americans work in the \n     three sectors (see Chart 1). Data come from government \n     sources and the methodology from the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission.\n       B. Should Asian Americans be more patient? The rate of \n     progress from 1996 to 2001 for all workers in Chart 1 was \n     studied. Although Asian Americans are twice the distance from \n     equal opportunity (the blue dashed line) compared with \n     Hispanics and women, Asian Americans' rate of progress is \n     only half that of the latter groups. At the current rate, \n     equal opportunity will not be reached by Asian Americans in \n     another 75 years or three more generations.\n       C. Asian Americans face these realities of low odds and a \n     three-generation waiting period despite having the highest \n     educational attainment, according to data from US Census 2000 \n     (see Chart 2). Educational attainments have come to all from \n     deep sacrifices of parents and sheer diligence by their \n     children.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I understand I have 14 minutes with respect \nto postcloture debate. I ask unanimous consent to speak beyond those 14 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Medicare Part D\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my deep concerns \nabout the Medicare Part D Program. The ``D'' was supposed to stand for \na new prescription drug benefit, but now seniors are finding that ``D'' \nreally stands for doughnut hole. Unlike most other types of health \ninsurance, the Medicare drug benefit was intentionally designed with a \ncoverage gap or doughnut hole that requires beneficiaries to pay for \nall yearly prescription drug spending between $2,250 and $5,100.\n  Let me explain. It is baffling to most people that the Part D Program \nwas designed so that beneficiaries paying premiums each month receive \nsupport for their drug costs until they have spent $2,250, and suddenly \nthe insurance goes away. The premium stays, but the insurance goes away \nuntil you reach $5,100. That is an unusual insurance program, to say \nthe least. Seniors will experience this lapse in coverage once their \ndrug costs have exceeded $2,250. When they are in the doughnut hole, \nthey have to pay for all the drugs out of pocket, as well as paying the \nmonthly premium. That does not sound like a sensible insurance program. \nThat is, in effect, what this Part D Program involves.\n  According to one estimate published in the journal Health Affairs, \nthe average Part D beneficiary will spend almost $3,100 this year on \nprescription drugs. So the President's idea of cost containment is not \nto drive pharmaceutical manufacturers to rein in prices but to just cut \noff seniors' benefits when they most need the coverage.\n  Many Medicare beneficiaries with high drug expenses already have \nbegun to fall into the doughnut hole and are struggling to pay for \ntheir medications or are unable to fill their prescriptions at all. It \nhas been reported that average Medicare Part D beneficiaries will also \nbegin falling into the doughnut hole this week. It almost sounds like \n``Alice in Wonderland,'' where suddenly you are swept into a new world \nas you go through the hole. A world that requires seniors to come up \nwith their the resources to pay for these premiums as well as their \nprescription drugs.\n  I am hearing from many seniors in my State facing problems with \nMedicare Part D. I know I am not alone. I think every Member of this \nSenate, when they go home and talk to seniors, is hearing it. We will \nhear it with more frequency as their expenses increase and their \nexperience with the doughnut hole increases.\n  In one case, an individual sent a letter to the Rhode Island attorney \ngeneral and copied me on it because they thought a crime was being \ncommitted. They literally thought they were being robbed because one \nday they got help with the prescriptions, and the next day there is no \nhelp at all.\n  Now ``D,'' besides standing for doughnut hole, stands for dire \ncircumstances. These are the circumstances in which seniors will find \nthemselves unless we do something to fix this problem because the \ndoughnut hole will only get bigger and bigger year after year.\n  Today, over 38 million Americans on Medicare have some form of \nprescription drug coverage. Of these beneficiaries, 10 million have \ncoverage through a standard Part D prescription drug plan, and up to 7 \nmillion could be subject to the doughnut hole between now and the end \nof the year. The numbers will only grow in the coming years if the \nadministration allows drug prices to continue to escalate. What trips \nseniors into the doughnut hole is the cumulative spending on drugs. If \ndrug prices go up, seniors very quickly reach that threshold where the \ndoughnut hole kicks in. Tragically, many beneficiaries are unaware that \nthis coverage gap exists and only learn about this lapse after they \nhave fallen into the hole. To add insult to injury, these beneficiaries \nare expected to continue paying monthly premiums through their drug \nplans even though they receive absolutely no coverage in return. This \nis a very unusual health care plan, to be paying a monthly premium but \nnot be eligible for coverage.\n  When we pay health care premiums, we hope we don't have to use any of \nthe coverage, that we are healthy and well, but we all have in the back \nof our minds the knowledge: If something happens that month, I am \neligible, I can get the help. Not so in the doughnut hole. Seniors keep \npaying the monthly premium, and then they pay, out of pocket, the full \ncost of the prescription.\n  I didn't support the Medicare Modernization Act which created Part D \nbecause I believed the benefit was insufficient and the emphasis on a \nprivately administered program made it excessively complex. By relying \non over 40 private plans in each region, each with a different benefit \nstructure, many beneficiaries are confused about the plan offerings and \nwhich plan may suit them best. Moreover, a recent General Accounting \nOffice report finds an alarming number of private Part D plans are \nproviding inaccurate or incomplete information to Medicare \nbeneficiaries about the coverage and benefits provided under the \nvarious plans.\n  No doubt, there are some people who have benefited from this new \nprogram, but for too many Part D enrollees with complex medical \nconditions, the benefit has largely been a source of great confusion \nand concern. We could have done it differently. We could have done it \nmore simply. We could have done it more efficiently.\n  Many of the problems we are seeing today could have been averted if \nthe\n\n[[Page S9877]]\n\nAdministration had not made the program needlessly complicated and if \nthey had done a better job of preparing the public. Despite all of the \nserious shortcomings of Medicare Part D, the program has taken effect. \nIt is now incumbent upon us to work together to turn things around and \nimprove the situation.\n  In an effort to provide some modest short-term relief to seniors, I \nam working with Senators Dorgan and Bingaman on the Prescription \nFairness Act. This bill has a simple premise: beneficiaries should not \nhave to continue paying monthly premiums when they have no drug \ncoverage. The bill waives the Medicare Part D premium for any month \nthat a senior falls into the doughnut hole. During this time, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services would be responsible for \noffsetting these monthly premium costs. It seems only fair to me. We \nare making seniors pay premiums, yet they do not qualify for the \nbenefit. If they don't qualify for the benefit, let's absolve them of \nthe premiums until they do, once again, qualify for the coverage.\n  There is another aspect of the doughnut hole that needs to be \naddressed. That is the fact that expenditures by other drug subsidiary \nprograms do not count against beneficiaries' true out-of-pocket costs--\nthis is an acronym, TrOOP: true out-of-pocket costs--during this lapse \nin Part D coverage.\n\n  Medicare beneficiaries on fixed incomes should not be penalized for \nseeking assistance from other programs that provide prescription drugs \nor drug assistance.\n  Here is the problem: You go into the doughnut hole. You are desperate \nfor your prescriptions. The expenditures have to come out of your \npocket to qualify again. You cannot go to a State agency, perhaps, that \nhas a program because that spending will not be counted. I think that \nis another problem we have to address.\n  The Helping Fill the Prescription Gap Act--another proposal which I \nhave cosponsored--would allow costs incurred by federally qualified \nhealth centers and patient assistance programs to count toward a \nbeneficiary's annual out-of-pocket threshold. If they can get the help, \nqualify for the help, it should be counted, as they try to extricate \nthemselves from the doughnut hole.\n  While these two bills are designed to help ease the burden of \nMedicare beneficiaries in the doughnut hole, serious structural \nproblems of the program must also be addressed.\n  ``D'' also stands for--besides ``doughnut hole,'' ``dire \ncircumstances''--for the dubious claims the Administration has made \nabout the plan's costs and the savings they would deliver for \nconsumers.\n  The Administration's original cost estimates for the program were \nwoefully inaccurate, and the benefit is now expected to top $700 \nbillion in the first decade--$300 billion more than was originally \nadvertised.\n  The fundamental premise behind the Medicare Part D benefit--that \nvigorous competition among private insurers would lead to lower drug \nprices--simply has not proven to be true.\n  ``D'' also stands for the do-nothing Republican Congress that during \nthis year's budget debate failed to pass a Democratic amendment that \nwould give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to \nnegotiate the best deal for Medicare prescription drugs.\n  Instead of harnessing the purchasing power of over 40 million \nMedicare beneficiaries, the Administration plan called on private \ninsurance plans to administer the program and to negotiate directly \nwith the pharmaceutical companies on drug prices.\n  Here I think is the structural flaw in this overall program. In order \nto pull together the bargaining power of the largest number of seniors, \nthe Government should be able to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical \ncompanies. The pharmaceutical companies have market power. Many of \ntheir drugs are patented and cannot be produced by anyone else. They \ncan drive the price up.\n  The only way in a market you counter that type of monopolistic \npricing power is by banding together as consumers so you have one \nentity negotiating for the consumers against one entity who controls \nthe product. You will get a better price.\n  That is what we do in the VA system. The VA system has the legal \nauthority to negotiate prices with drug companies. They have thousands \nand thousands of clients in their hospitals and in their outpatient \nsettings, and they simply go and say: If you would like to sell us this \nsignificant volume of drugs, give us your best price. That is the way I \nbelieve we can get drug prices if not down, at least lower the \nescalation in costs. If we do not rein in price growth, the estimate of \n$700 billion over 10 years, I believe in a year or two, could be even \nhigher.\n  Families USA conducted a survey that compared the lowest Part D \nprices with those the Veterans' Administration negotiated for the five \nmost commonly prescribed drugs to seniors, and the variation in price \nis staggering. The VA can negotiate on behalf of our Nation's veterans \nwhile Medicare is barred from doing so--legally barred. It is part of \nthis legislation: a rather large benefit to the pharmaceutical \nindustry, to the detriment of taxpayers and seniors.\n  We can save money, and we can pass these savings on to seniors, we \nhope, but we cannot tie our hands. We have to be able to, as a large \nentity, as Medicare, negotiate these prices.\n  I want to work with the President and my colleagues in the Congress \nto strengthen Medicare for the long term. But the Administration has \nfailed so far in their approach to Medicare reform.\n  Under the current Part D Program, drug companies hold all the cards. \nA recent New York Times article revealed that the shift of dual-\neligible beneficiaries from Medicaid drug coverage over to the Part D \nProgram has been a financial boon to drug manufacturers.\n  Previously, under Medicaid--a separate program which is a joint \nState-Federal program--seniors could qualify in certain cases for drug \nassistance. In the States, the Medicaid programs were negotiating with \nthe pharmaceutical companies for prices. But with the passage of Part \nD, these dual-eligibles were automatically enrolled into the Medicare \nPart D Program. And what happened to drug prices? They zoomed out of \nsight. That, to me, is evidence that we can do much better, not only to \nprotect seniors but to protect taxpayers.\n  Now, I believe the pharmaceutical companies deserve a fair return on \ntheir investment. They have invested in drug research and development. \nBut allowing them to dictate prices for millions of elderly and \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries is a bad deal for the Federal \nGovernment and a bad deal for the American public.\n  These are just some of problems with Medicare Part D that must be \naddressed.\n  And while Part D is receiving most of the attention lately, seniors \nalso face a 5.6-percent increase in Part B premiums for doctor visits \nand outpatient services in 2007, which will absorb a disproportionate \namount of their Social Security cost-of-living adjustments--their \nCOLAs. In fact, Part B premiums have almost doubled since President \nBush took office, so seniors living on fixed incomes will now pay \nalmost $1,200 just for these premiums alone.\n  This is another example of the growing squeeze, economically, on \nmiddle-income Americans. When you look at working Americans, young \nAmericans with families, you have seen tuition costs go up \nextraordinarily so. You have seen health care costs go up, and many of \nthese families do not have the benefits of the Medicare Program at all. \nTheir costs are going up significantly. And gasoline prices are high. \nBut incomes are not keeping up.\n  In fact, in real terms, inflation-adjusted terms, from 2000 to 2005, \nthe median income of American families has fallen by $1,300. So you \nhave falling income and increasing prices. It is this vice that is \nsqueezing middle-income Americans.\n  And then, when you go to seniors, they are looking at some relief in \nMedicare Part D, but they are falling in the doughnut hole and finding \nthat relief is elusive. They are also finding their Part B premiums \ngoing up. They are being squeezed hard also.\n  Now, through all of this, the Administration has proposed no \nsubstantive changes to the Medicare Program to help these \nbeneficiaries. We have to take action. I hope in this Congress--\nalthough the days are dwindling down\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\nto a precious few--but certainly in the next Congress we have to start \nlooking seriously at reforming Medicare Part D, at making it more \naffordable for seniors and more affordable for taxpayers.\n  Let's make the ``D'' stand for what it should stand for: doing right \nby our seniors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Oil Company Royalty Payments\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, all of us in the Senate know that each of \nthe executive branch agencies have an inspector general. Last week, the \ninspector general at the Department of Interior made an extraordinary \nstatement about the lack of ethics, in his view, at the Department of \nInterior. I have come to the Chamber this afternoon to discuss that and \nto bring to the Senate's attention some new developments on this issue.\n  What the Interior Department's inspector general, Mr. Earl Devaney, \nsaid last week is essentially that the Department has lost its ethical \ncompass, and specifically the inspector general stated:\n\n       Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the \n     highest levels of the Department of Interior.\n\n  Mr. Devaney pointed to a number of instances where he thought the \nDepartment was essentially defending the indefensible and was \nparticularly troubled by the way the Department's royalty efforts--the \nefforts to collect money owed to the Federal Government--were going \nforward.\n  This morning, there are new developments on this issue which are \nparticularly relevant to the Senate's work for the rest of the session. \nThis morning, there was a news account documenting how for some time \nthe nonpolitical auditors in the Interior Department have been raising \nconcerns about underpayment of millions of dollars of royalties for oil \nand gas leases. What the article says is these auditors, who are \nnonpolitical, professional people, were overruled by their superiors \nwhen they wanted to go out and aggressively protect the taxpayers of \nthis country. Some of these auditors, according to these news reports \nthis morning, were so outraged by the Interior Department's failure to \ncollect the full amount of royalties that were owed the people that \nthey have filed False Claims Act lawsuits against the oil companies for \ndefrauding the Government.\n  For example, one senior auditor identified an oil company scheme to \nreduce its royalty payments by apparently selling oil it extracted from \nFederal lands at a discount, thereby reducing the amount of royalty it \npaid to the U.S. Treasury. According to the news accounts, the \nsuperiors in that instance told the auditor not to pursue a collection \nof the oil company's underpayments. So the auditor felt that, to get \nany justice for the taxpayers, he had to go out and file a false claims \nlawsuit against the company responsible. Apparently, after he did that, \nhe was subjected to retaliation by Interior Department officials, and \nthen he was eventually terminated.\n  Several additional false claims lawsuits have recently been unsealed \nas well where, here again, auditors apparently uncovered underpayments \nbut were not allowed to pursue collection of the full amounts owed to \nthe Government. In each of these cases, the Federal Government declined \nto join the suit to recover on behalf of the taxpayers the money that \noil companies allegedly were underpaying for their oil and gas leases.\n  If this were just one isolated case, you could say that maybe this \nwas a person who just had a bad experience and they are angry at this \npoint. But when you have a number of cases--a number of cases brought \nby nonpolitical professional people, people who are putting themselves \nat risk by bringing this out--that issue becomes too important for the \nGovernment to ignore.\n  I am bringing it to the attention of the Senate this afternoon \nbecause it goes to the heart of something I have been talking about for \nmany months. In fact, months ago, I spent over 4 hours right in this \nspot trying to blow the whistle on the fact that it was time to stop \nstonewalling on this issue of collecting billions and billions of \ndollars in royalty payments that are owed by oil companies that are \nextracting that oil from land owned by the people of this country.\n  In this case, the Interior Department's inspector general has \nidentified underpayments of just a tiny fraction of what is owed, but \nit seems to me this highlights how serious a problem this is. It also \nundermines the argument of the administration and some supporters of \nthe oil industry that this money is going to be collected if the \nCongress just stays out of it and the executive branch goes after it on \nits own. That is one of the reasons that apparently we can't get a vote \non an effort to collect these royalties here in the Senate, because \nsome have said the executive branch is on this case, they are going to \ngo after it, and they are going to bring in these dollars. Well, today, \non the front page of one of the country's newspapers, we are seeing \nthat not only is the administration not going after these royalty \npayments, but when independent, professional auditors go out and try to \ncollect the money, not only is there no effort to support them, but \nthey end up getting rolled when they try to bring these cases and \ncollect money that is owed to the taxpayers of this country.\n  Under Federal law, oil companies are supposed to pay the Federal \nGovernment royalties when they extract oil or gas from Federal lands or \noffshore drilling. During the 1990s, to encourage drilling when oil \nprices were low, Congress provided relief to suspend royalty payments \nwhen prices were below certain threshold levels. It was, however, the \nintent of Congress that royalties would resume when the prices got back \nabove those thresholds. But the leases that were signed during 1998 and \n1999 failed to include the price threshold. As a result, a number of \noil companies have been allowed to extract oil without paying the \nroyalties that are owed under these leases, even when the oil prices \nwent to record levels, as we saw this past summer.\n\n  The Government Accountability Office has estimated that the failure \nto include price thresholds in just those leases--just the ones I \nmentioned--could cost the Federal Treasury and the taxpayers $10 \nbillion. What is more--and I think this will be truly eye-opening for \nthe Senate and for the country--is that given the fact there is \nlitigation pending surrounding this program, the loss to the taxpayers \ncould perhaps soar to as much as $80 billion, according to an estimate \nby an industry source.\n  That is why I took the time a few months ago to stand on the floor of \nthe Senate for well over 4 hours to make the case of reforming the oil \nroyalty program, and that is why I have come to the Chamber today to \nbring to the attention of the Senate the concerns that are coming from \nthe professional auditors.\n  When we debated it, or when I had a chance to raise the concern \nbefore the Senate on that occasion and others, I heard some saying that \nthe Interior Department is going to go out and get these funds, they \nare going to make sure the taxpayers don't get ripped off. We have \nheard that argument advanced time and time again. It essentially has \nbeen stated that the Interior Department has begun the efforts to \nrenegotiate those leases that are costing the $10 billion I mentioned \nand that Congress can only get in the way by trying to take legislative \naction.\n  Well, these news reports that have come out this morning make it very \nclear that Interior officials are not willing to address the problems \nwith the royalty program on their own. When given the chance to pursue \nthe issues raised by nonpolitical auditors working for the Department, \naccording to this morning's report and these lawsuits, those high up in \nthe Department blocked the auditors' efforts to collect the full amount \nowed to the U.S. Treasury and to taxpayers.\n  The Interior Department's negotiations with the oil companies on the \n1998 and 1999 leases didn't even start until after Congress included \nlanguage in the Interior appropriations bills to prevent companies from \ngetting new leases unless they renegotiated their\n\n[[Page S9879]]\n\nold leases to include price thresholds. And the mediation process that \nis now underway between the companies and the Interior Department is \nnonbinding, so the companies can walk away at any point. In my view, \nthat is why Congress ought to step in now and require the Interior \nDepartment to fix the royalty program through legislation.\n  The companies are doing everything they can to keep this issue from \ncoming to a vote on the floor. That is what happened when I stood in \nthis spot for more than 4 hours a few months ago. The oil companies \nknew on that occasion that if there was a vote here in the Senate to \nreform this program which is so out of hand--because even our esteemed \nformer colleague who is from the State of Louisiana, former Senator \nBennett Johnston, said the program is out of hand. If we had a vote \nthat day, the vote would have been overwhelming to fix the royalty \nprogram. But we could not get that vote because there were some in the \nSenate who knew that the taxpayers would win, and they didn't want to \nhave the vote. Now the session is about to end. The subsidies are going \nto continue. Based on this morning's report, auditors who are \nprofessional are being overruled by their superiors when they want to \nget those dollars owed to the taxpayers.\n\n  In my view, time is not on the side of those of us who want to put a \nstop to these senseless subsidies. The oil companies and their \nsupporters know that the time left in this session is limited, so if \nthey can keep the Senate from voting on these royalties, the \nlegislation that the House adopted after my discussion in the Senate \nwill almost certainly disappear when the Interior bill gets rolled into \nsome kind of an end-of-the-session comprehensive bill called, around \nhere, omnibus legislation.\n  The negotiations now underway with oil companies, that have the most \ngenerous deals of all, in my view, are going to get dragged out and \ndelayed and postponed until the last legislative vehicle leaves town. \nThen the oil companies can walk away from the table, return to claiming \nthose needless subsidies, and I assume fewer auditors will step forward \nin the future because they will see that there has not been a Congress \nbacking them up.\n  We have seen the ``run out the clock scenario'' play out before. It \nhappened, for example, on the issue of needless tax breaks to the oil \ncompanies. I was able to get legislation through the Senate Finance \nCommittee to begin the effort to roll back some of the tax breaks that \nthe oil companies were getting. These were oil companies getting breaks \nthat even they said they didn't need when I asked them questions when \nthey came before the Senate Finance Committee. But by the time we were \ndone on the tax side, the oil companies had been able to water down \nmuch of what I had originally gotten out of committee, and they are \nstill getting billions and billions of dollars in tax breaks that they \nthemselves have testified before the Senate they do not need.\n  I believe, on the basis of the news reports that we saw this morning \nand the fact that the inspector general of the Department of Interior \nhas said that anything goes with respect to ethics at the Interior \nDepartment, that this Senate ought to step in and protect the taxpayers \nof this country. This Senate ought to address this problem, which the \ninspector general has called ``indefensible'' and has, in effect, said \nthe Department is still trying to defend it. My view is that if the \nSenate ducks this issue, it will be very difficult to explain to the \nAmerican people how Congress can propose to allow additional billions \nof dollars of royalty money to be given away before it puts a stop to \nwhat already has gone out the door.\n  The distinguished Senator from Louisiana and my colleague who is my \nseatmate, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, has \nsure made a good case to me about the suffering that folks in New \nOrleans and in her State have endured. But what has been troubling to \nme is how do you make a case for starting a new royalty program, a new \noffshore oil royalty program, when you are wasting money on the last \none that got out the door? So I will continue to try to make the case, \nforce the Senate to reform this oil royalty program, and I am going to \ncontinue to press this every time I think there is a new development in \nthis case.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the important article by Mr. Andrews in \nthe paper today describing the efforts of these auditors to try to make \nsure taxpayers do not get stiffed.\n  It is one thing if one person comes forward. It is another when you \nhave a whole pattern of these cases, by people who are nonpolitical, \nwho are professional people. We have had a bipartisan effort in the \nSenate to change this. I have been particularly appreciative that \nSenator Kyl, Senator DeWine, and Senator Feinstein have joined me in \npast efforts. But we have not been able to offer that amendment and \nactually get a vote on a bipartisan proposal that would finally clean \nup this program and protect the taxpayers of this country.\n  As a result, some of the most profitable companies in the country are \ncontinuing to get billions and billions of dollars of royalty relief \nand giveaways that are paid for by the taxpayers of this country.\n  It was one thing to start that program back in the days when oil was \n$19. It is quite different when you have royalty relief, taking hard-\nearned dollars out of the pockets of our citizens when that relief \nclearly is not necessary. I urge colleagues in the Senate, on both \nsides of the aisle, to join me in these efforts to clean up this \nprogram, stop the outrageous giveaway of taxpayer money, and take a \ngood look at this morning's report. The combination of what the \ninspector general has said and what these independent auditors have \nsaid this morning, in my view, is too important to ignore. The Senate \nought to step in and make sure the taxpayers' interests in this country \nare protected.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Secure Fence Act. \nThe bill before us will certainly do some good. It will authorize some \nbadly needed funding for better fences and better security along our \nborders, and that should help stem some of the tide of illegal \nimmigration in this country. But if we think that putting up a few more \nmiles of fence is by any means the whole answer to our immigration \nproblems, then I believe we are seriously kidding ourselves.\n  This bill, from my perspective, is an election-year, political \nsolution to a real policy challenge that goes far beyond November. It \nis great for sound bites and ad campaigns, but as an answer to the \nproblem of illegal immigration, it is unfinished at best.\n  Yes, we need tougher border security and stronger enforcement \nmeasures. Yes, we need more resources for Customs and Border agents and \nmore detention beds. Democrats and Republicans in both the House and \nthe Senate agree on these points. But immigrants sneaking in through \nunguarded holes in our border are only part of the problem.\n  As a host of former Bush immigration officials and Members of \nCongress said in today's Washington Post, we must ``acknowledge that as \nmuch as half of the illegal-immigration problem is driven by the hiring \nof people who enter the United States through official border points \nbut use fraudulent documents or overstay visas.''\n  This serves as a reminder that for the last 15 years, our immigration \nstrategy has consisted of throwing more money at the border. We have \ntripled the size of the Border Patrol and we strengthened fences. But \neven as investments in border security grew, the size of the \nundocumented population grew as well. So we need to approach the \nimmigration challenge from a different perspective.\n  This is why for months Democrats and Republicans have been working \ntogether to pass a comprehensive immigration bill out of this Congress \nbecause we know that in addition to greater border security, we also \nneed greater sanctions on employers who illegally hire people in this \ncountry. We\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\nneed to make it easier for those employers to identify who is legally \neligible to work and who is not. And we need to figure out how we plan \nto deal with the 12 million undocumented immigrants who are already \nhere, many of whom have woven themselves into the fabric of our \ncommunities, many of whom have children who are U.S. citizens, many of \nwhom employers depend on. Until we do, no one should be able to look a \nvoter in the face and honestly tell them that we have solved our \nimmigration problem.\n  A model for compromise on this issue is in the Senate bill that was \npassed out of this Chamber. In the new electronic employment \nverification system section of that bill that I helped write with \nSenator Grassley and Senator Kennedy, we agreed to postpone the new \nguest worker program until 2 years of funding is made available for \nimproved workplace enforcement. We could extend that framework and work \ntogether to first ensure the money is in place to strengthen \nenforcement at the border and then allow the new guest worker program \nto kick in. We can do all of that in one bill, but we are not.\n  So while this bill will probably pass, it should be seen only as one \nstep in the much greater challenge of reforming our immigration system. \nMeeting that challenge will require passing measures to discourage \npeople from overstaying their visas in the country and to help \nemployers check the legal status of the workers applying for jobs.\n  It seems it was just yesterday that we were having celebratory press \nconferences and the President and the Senate leadership were promising \nto pass a bill that would secure our borders and take a tough but \nrealistic approach to the undocumented immigrants who are already here.\n  Today that promise looks empty and that cooperation seems like a \nthing of the past. But we owe it to the American people to finish the \njob we are starting today. And we owe it to all those immigrants who \nhave come to this country with nothing more than a willingness to work \nand a hope for a better life. Like so many of our own parents and \ngrandparents, they have shown the courage to leave their homes and seek \nout a new destiny of their own making. The least we can do is show the \ncourage to help them make that destiny a reality in a way that is safe, \nlegal, and achievable. So when we actually start debating this bill, I \nhope the majority leader will permit consideration of a wide range of \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending \nlegislation, the Secure Fence Act of 2006. I want to address this \nissue. I have worked on the immigration issue all this year. It has \nbeen a very difficult issue. It has been a very difficult discussion. \nIt has been one that has involved a great deal of the time of this \nbody.\n  I serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We worked a long time to \ntry to come up with some form of comprehensive legislation that we put \nforward. It was far from perfect, even as it was passed. Before it \npassed, people were questioning this provision and that provision. You \nlook back on it and say: Well, I think that is a good question, and I \nthink that is a good point, and it is something we need to deal with in \nconference to be able to address those concerns and topics.\n  I think we could have come out with a good conference bill, but the \nvolatility of the subject, the lateness in the session, the closeness \nto the elections really has just not made it possible for us to move \nforward on comprehensive immigration reform, as the President has \nrequested, as most people in the country look at it and believe in some \nform we need to deal with immigration in a broad fashion.\n  Yet almost everybody I have talked with on the immigration issue--a \nnumber of whom are passionately involved in the topic--virtually \neverybody who looks at it will say: OK, let's first get the border \nsecure. First, let's stop the flow of illegal immigration into the \nUnited States, and then let's talk about comprehensive reform or you \nget a number of people saying: I don't think you are serious at the \nGovernment level of dealing with securing the border. When you show me \nthat, then let's move forward with comprehensive reform because I do \nrecognize we have 11 to 12 million people here in an undocumented \nstatus. We do have a need for workers in a number of places across the \nUnited States, that there are legitimate concerns, and the best way for \nus to move forward is in some fashion dealing with all the problems \nthat are associated with this issue.\n  We have a history in the United States, in the last 20 years, of \ndealing with this problem on a piecemeal basis. In 1986, there was an \namnesty bill, but it did not deal with border enforcement at that point \nin time. That did not work. In 1996, we had an enforcement-only bill, \nbut it did not deal with the future flow or did not deal with the \npeople who were here in an undocumented status at that point in time. \nWe come, then, to 2006.\n  It is an interesting progression in the numbers as well. In 1986, we \nhad roughly 3 million here in an undocumented, illegal status. In 1996, \n10 years later, we had 7 million here in an illegal, undocumented \nstatus. We tried amnesty. We tried enforcement in 1996, and we had 7 \nmillion who were in an undocumented, illegal status in the United \nStates.\n  In 2006, we are at 11 million to 12 million. So we have tried this on \na piecemeal basis before, and it just has not worked. Whether you come \nfrom either side of the argument, it has not worked on a piecemeal \nbasis. What I am hopeful we can do in passing this legislation--in the \nsecure fence area; and I do support this legislation--is that we can \ndeal with the precursors that a number of people have identified, \nsaying, first, we really need to secure the border and show the country \nwe are serious about securing the border. Then let's move forward with \nthe comprehensive legislation.\n  What this, I hope, will be is the first step in dealing, in a \ncomprehensive, long-term fashion, with our failed immigration system \nand huge immigration problem. We need to do this, and we need to do \nthis first.\n  I was hopeful we could do this in one whole package and move it on \nforward and see the practicality of that whole package, that the first \nthing you would do is to secure the border--and the President has \nalready dispatched National Guard troops to the border. The border \nenforcement efforts have already stepped up and they are showing fruit \nfrom their efforts. We are stepping up and doing this now.\n  I was hopeful we could do this as a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation, recognizing the practicality that, first, the border would \nbe secure because that is the thing you could do first, and then you \ncould deal with a future flow guest worker program that would take you \nseveral years to implement. And you could deal with those who are here \nand in an undocumented status? That would take some period of time to \ndeal with as well.\n  We are not going to be able to, this legislative session, get that \nbroad piece of legislation through. Yet I think this shows to people in \nthe country deeply concerned about our border--as I am, as we all are \nin the Congress and in this country--is that we are serious about \ndealing with this issue. And I think there will still remain the \npolitical impetus to deal with this on a broad-scale basis, but first \nwe step up and do first things first and we secure the border and we \nshow to the country we are, indeed, serious about securing the border, \nand we are doing everything we can to secure the border.\n  It will not permanently seal the border. This effort, the Secure \nFence Act of 2006, will not achieve that. It is going to be very \ndifficult to completely secure the border, but this bill will take a \nstrong step forward for us.\n  I also say to my colleagues who believe we should just do enforcement \nor we should do enforcement first, that we then, in the future, need to \ntake the next steps necessary to deal with this in a comprehensive \nfashion.\n  I think it is going to be very important that, OK, yes, we do this, \nand we move this forward, but then we need to move forward with the \nrest of it. What do we do with those who are here in an\n\n[[Page S9881]]\n\nundocumented status? How do we do more on interior enforcement at work \nsites? What do we do on a guest worker future flow program? So that we \nwill deal with this in a totality, so that as to those who are \nconcerned we are just going to do this and not deal with the rest of \nthe system, we can say: No, part of what we are talking about and doing \nis securing the border first. We do that we are going to hold true to \nwhat we said. Yes, we do that. And, then, let's talk about how we can \nmove forward in the comprehensive fashion because that is the way--and \nthe only way--I think you actually deal in some sort of long-term \nfashion with the very real problems we are facing and that really a \nnumber of countries around the world are facing--certainly the \nEuropeans are facing--in a major fashion.\n  It seems to me that one of the things that happened after the fall of \nthe Berlin Wall, in particular--some time before but certainly after--\nwas people started moving to opportunity. They started moving to where \nthey felt they could have a better life for themselves and their \nfamilies. It is certainly an impetus I recognize, and it is hard to \nfault people for that. You want it to be conducted in a legal fashion \nand to see that national sovereignty rules are obeyed.\n  People in this country who talk about security first, when they talk \nwith me about that, they are not against immigration. They want it to \nbe legal. They want the system to be a legal system, and then we can \nwork with it. But they don't want an illegal system that has devolved \nor, as we have seen, broken down in this country.\n  I think this is an important first step forward for us in dealing \nwith this problem in a comprehensive fashion. It is not what a number \nof us had worked for in getting a comprehensive bill. I think it is the \nfirst step in us getting comprehensive legislation moving forward and \nconvincing the country that we are serious about securing the borders \nso that we can do comprehensive reform of an immigration system that is \nso desperately needed.\n  Mr. President, I have worked a long time and for a number of years on \nhuman rights issues and dignity of the individual, and I believe \nfundamentally in my bones about this. I believe it is important and it \nis a big statement, what a country does in taking care of the least of \nus, including the widows and orphans. In those statements, it also says \nthat the foreign are amongst you, citing those who are in a difficult \nsituation. They are in a hard situation. We need to help them and work \nwith them in any way we can. We need to be able to craft a legal \nsolution to do that. I think it is important. It is also a statement of \nthe nature of our society and our Nation that we do that. We need to \nreach out to those in the most difficult circumstances in this country. \nThis is a step forward, but it is not and cannot be the final step.\n  I remind the individuals who have pushed this route forward that we \nare taking you at your word as well, saying first secure the border and \nthen we go to comprehensive reform. We are going your path. This would \nbe the path that you said is the way to go. We cannot just stop here \nand say: OK, we have done that, and now we are not going to talk about \nthe rest of the issues. We need to see this on through to what people \nhad said was the right route to go--first securing the border and then \ndealing with the rest of it. We are going that path, your path, \nforward.\n  I hope we can move this through and then continue the discussion on \nhow we move forward with comprehensive immigration reform. I believe it \nis critical for us to do that for the future of the Republic.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n                    Army Staff Sergeant Sean Landrus\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fellow Ohioan, \na young man who lost his life in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Army SSG Sean \nLandrus died on January 29, 2004, of wounds he suffered when a roadside \nbomb exploded next to his convoy in Iraq. He was 31 years old.\n  Sean Landrus will be remembered for many things and in many ways. He \nwas an exceptional soldier who enjoyed and took pride in military life. \nMore than that, he was a loving son, brother, husband, and father, a \nman who was completely dedicated to his family.\n  Sean was born in January of 1973 in Painesville, OH, to loving \nparents Ken and Betty Landrus. The youngest of six children, Sean was \nvery close to his entire family and remained so throughout his life. \nSean attended Ledgemont High School where he excelled in football, \nbasketball, and track. A highly competitive athlete, Sean hated to be \ntaken out of any game, even if he was injured. According to his mother \nBetty:\n\n       One of the managers said that he just didn't play the same \n     without Sean because he was the spark plug.\n\n  Sean carried that dedication and competitive spirit with him \nthroughout all that he did. After graduating in 1991, Sean attended \nKent State University while working for C Industrial Service, an \nindustrial cleaning company in Cleveland. Although she didn't enjoy it \nat the time, Betty now fondly recalls how grubby her son would be when \nhe got home from work. Despite the dirt, she loved her ``iron teddy \nbear.''\n  On December 2, 1995, Sean married his high school sweetheart Chris, \nand they made their home in Thompson Township. Sean reported for boot \ncamp just 1 month later. He was assigned to Company B, First Engineer \nBattalion, First Brigade Combat Team, First Infantry Division. Sean \nspent 8 years in the Army, including deployments to Bosnia and Kuwait.\n  Sean was a devoted family man who found it difficult to leave his \nwife Chris, his son Kenneth, and daughters Khrista and Kennedy for his \noverseas tours. He was very sorry to be away from them for that period \nof time. His deployment to Iraq was particularly emotional. Kennedy was \nthen just a few weeks old. At the time, Sean and his family were living \nin Fort Riley in Kansas. Sean was offered a desk job at the base, but \nhe declined it in favor of going to a combat zone.\n  In the words of his mother Betty, ``Sean just hated being behind a \ndesk.''\n  In September 2003, Ken and Betty drove to Fort Riley both to meet \ntheir new granddaughter and to say good-bye to their son before he left \nfor Iraq. Because Sean was busy making preparations for deployment, \nthey weren't able to see him very often. But for Sean, it was important \nthat he made sure everything for which he was responsible was in the \nright order. That is simply the kind of man he was. Betty and Ken woke \nup very early and stayed up very late to spend as much time with him as \npossible. Sean found it difficult to leave his family again, and as he \nsaid in his own words, ``It is my job.''\n  Sean's deployment to Iraq would have been his last. Before going \noverseas, he told his family that it would be the final time he went \naway. He just didn't want to leave them anymore. Unfortunately, Sean's \nconvoy was ambushed after a roadside bomb exploded next to the truck he \nwas in. Two days later, he passed away from his injuries.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, that day our Nation lost a \ngreat soldier. The Landrus family lost a loving brother, son, husband, \nand father. Perhaps most heartbreaking, Sean was never able to hear his \nyoungest daughter's first words: ``Da Da.''\n  As Ohioans have done so often in the past, the members of Sean's \ncommunity rallied around the Landrus family to offer their support. \nDuring Sean's final trip home to the Cleveland area, color guards from \nthe area's veterans posts lined the processional route. Others wishing \nto pay their respects gathered in freezing temperatures to wave \nAmerican flags, and nearly 400 people crowded into St. Patrick Catholic \nChurch to celebrate Sean's life. County flags were flown at half-staff \nand a resolution honoring Sean was passed at the Thompson Township \ntrustee meeting. His death was a loss felt by the entire community.\n  SSG Sean Landrus was a great man. I know he will live on in the \nhearts and minds of all those who were privileged to have known him. My \nwife Fran and I continue to keep the Landrus family in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\n                      MARINE CORPORAL BRAD SQUIRES\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marine Cpl Brad \nSquires, a fellow Ohioan from Middleburg Heights, who lost his life on \nJune 9, 2005, as a result of an explosion that occurred during combat \noperations. He was assigned to Marine Forces Reserve's 3rd Battalion, \n25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, from Akron, OH. Brad was the \nson of Donna and Bruce Squires, husband of Julie, brother of Chad and \nJodie, and uncle of Chad, Cassidy, and Alexis. He was only 26 years old \nat the time of his death.\n  Brad graduated from Berea High School in 1997, where he played on the \nfootball team. He was studying to be a firefighter and was taking \nclasses at Lorain Community College. He was also an aspiring \nsupermodified driver who entered his first race in 2004 with the \nMidwest Supermodified Association. Brad joined the Marines in 1999, and \nin February 2005 he was sent to the Al Anbar province in Iraq, where he \nserved 4 months with his battalion before his death.\n  Brad Squires was loved by everyone who knew him. Again and again, I \nhave read about what a good friend he was. He was always looking for \nways to make his friends and family smile, and was constantly seeking \nnew adventures. Brad's aunt, Donna Dirk, described him as ``fun-loving, \nvery family-oriented, and really a nice kid.''\n  Katie Gorton remembers Brad's wonderful personality. She made the \nfollowing comments after attending his wake:\n\n       Brad certainly is a ``hometown hero,'' but more \n     importantly, an American Hero . . . all of us there that \n     night looked at pictures and remembered his mischievous grin, \n     his contagious laugh, and his charismatic personality. We \n     were able to remember Brad the friend, Brad the cousin, Brad \n     the funny guy from math class, Brad the guy the underclass \n     girls had a crush on, Brad the son, etc. . . . and for some \n     of us, it was the first chance we had to meet and remember \n     another side of him . . . Brad the Marine. I'd like to think \n     that he knows how many lives he's touched now, and is able to \n     be with us all now through miracles.\n\n  Brad had a strong sense of duty to family and friends from childhood, \nalways wanting to help protect others from harm. As a young boy, he \nknew the difference between right and wrong. Middleburg Heights' mayor \nrecalls what must have been a very special day for the young Brad. ``I \nprobably handed Brad Squires his safety town certificate when he was \nfive,'' he said. And Jessica Sutherland of Lakewood remembered a time \nwhen Brad rescued her from the bullying of a bigger boy. According to \nJessica, for years afterwards Brad would blush when she thanked him for \nthe day. She writes:\n\n       For that small good deed, he's always been a hero to me, so \n     I'm not surprised he died a hero . . . God bless Brad \n     Squires.\n\n  Kelli Kusky echoed these remarks about Brad's selfless nature. She \nsaid:\n\n       . . . He was always helping people; I remember the time \n     that his neighbor had a heart attack and Brad kicked in his \n     air conditioner and saved the man's life. He made no big deal \n     out of it, just said that he knew what he had to do. And I \n     know that Brad did what he knew he had to do in Iraq. I don't \n     think he would of had it any other way . . . He meant A LOT \n     to a lot of people and left long lasting impressions on \n     everyone that he met!\n\n  Clearly Brad was a hero to many throughout his life. And he did \nindeed love his Marine Corps. According to his wife, Julie, ``Brad \nloved his Marine Corps and would jump at a chance to tell everyone \nabout it.'' Nate Ickes of Akron also commented on Brad's military \nservice. He said:\n\n       My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone that knew and \n     loved Corporal Brad Squires. I am so proud to have served \n     with him and he will be missed very much. Brad had a way to \n     make everyone laugh, even if there was nothing to laugh \n     about. He was a fine Marine that any one of us from Weapons \n     Company would have been honored to work with. Brad was a man \n     who would never let you down, nor would he stop until the job \n     was done! Corporal Brad Squires will be forever missed but \n     never forgotten. Brad will always be a brother, friend and \n     Marine of Weapons Company 3/25. . . .\n\n  Brad deeply loved his family, and was deeply loved by them. He \nmarried his wife Julie in November 2004. They had to move up the \nwedding date when Brad learned that he would be deployed in January. \nSadly, their family and friends would return to the same church 7 \nmonths later for Brad's funeral. Brad was looking forward to starting a \nlife with his new bride and spending time with the rest of his family.\n  Brad's sister Jodie wrote these words to Brad:\n\n       My brother, my friend, my hero that will never be \n     forgotten. I love and miss you so much, Brad--26 years of \n     great memories is what I hold close to my heart. On behalf of \n     the family, I would like to thank everyone for their support.\n\n  Brad's brother Chad echoed these sentiments, saying:\n\n       My brother Brad is a hero, he died for what every American \n     enjoys in life--their freedom.\n\n  Brad will also be deeply missed by the numerous community members who \nknew and loved him. Numerous mourners attended his memorial service at \nSt. Mary's Catholic Church, where he and Julie had been married 7 \nmonths earlier. More than 120 motorcycles and 200 cars participated in \nthe procession to the cemetery, while hundreds of people with flags \nwatched them pass. Tim Ali, a family friend, aptly expressed a fitting \nsentiment: ``We have him home.''\n  In honor of their brother, Brad's siblings Chad and Jodie have \nstarted a memorial fund to carry on his legacy. Donations to the \nCorporal Brad Squires Memorial Fund will help build and preserve a \nmemorial on Old Oak Boulevard in Middleburg Heights, dedicated to all \nthe men and women in Ohio who have given their lives to protecting our \nfreedom. You can learn more about this memorial by accessing the Web \nsite at www.bradsquires.net.\n  I would like to end by including a message that Donna left for her \nson one year after his death:\n\n       Brad, not a day goes by that you're not in our thoughts and \n     prayers and how we wish you could be here and how we wish we \n     could see you again. When I think of you I think of your love \n     for life and your beautiful smile. You always had a mystical \n     way of brightening up someone's darkest day. We experienced \n     life together, through good and bad times. I know we will be \n     together in eternity and you are in a better place but we all \n     miss you deeply. I pray to God that He will comfort us and \n     give us all strength. Until we're together again, have a \n     great time in heaven. . . .\n\n  The overriding theme of Brad Squires' legacy is the number of lives \nhe touched while he was on this earth. So many people have remarked how \nBrad had positively impacted them. With his death, we have lost a great \nman. Brad loved his family, loved his country, and loved his commitment \nto the Marine Corps. He will never be forgotten. My wife Fran and I \ncontinue to keep the family and friends of Cpl Brad Squires in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as I have often reminded my colleagues, \nNew York State is an agricultural State. We are home to 36,000 farms, \nand our farmers are world-class producers of dairy products, apples, \ngrapes, honey, maple syrup, great wines, and other fruits and \nvegetables. New York is truly a land of milk and honey--and so much \nmore. Agriculture contributes almost $4 billion to New York's economy. \nMore than 1.2 million people work on farms or in farm-related jobs.\n  But farmers in New York who are contributing so much to our economy \nand way of life--in a plight shared by the agricultural industry across \nthe country--face an incredible challenge to maintain a workforce that \ndoes the difficult job of harvesting crops and bringing our State's \nbounty to the marketplace.\n  That is why I continue to fight for a solution. And as we consider \nthe Craig and Feinstein amendments, I hope we can keep these farmers--\nmany of whom I have met and worked closely with these past 6 years--in \nour focus and put the politics and partisanship aside. There are those \nin this Chamber who have strong disagreements over how to pursue \ncomprehensive immigration reform. But I hope that these proposals to \nstand by our family farmers and agricultural industry, both struggling \nto find labor, are not held hostage to the larger debate.\n  Our farmers have long desired a legal, stable workforce and have been \ncalling for reform. But now they face the prospect of crops dying in \nthe field or on the vine--or worse, their farms going out of business \nbecause of a shortage of workers. We have had the best apple crop in \nyears in New York, but the lack of labor has left apples unpicked on \nthe trees. We are in the midst of the harvest season in New York State, \nand the 36,000 farm families face the real risk--this year--of\n\n[[Page S9883]]\n\nlosing their livelihoods if we cannot ensure a legal, stable workforce \nfor them. In fact, according to the Farm Bureau, New York's \nagricultural industry stands to lose $289 million with fruit and \nvegetable growers estimated to lose more than $100 million without \nsolving this problem.\n  Farmers have shared with me their stories. Many feel abandoned to \nelection-year politics, partisan wrangling, and a Government that does \nnot recognize their hardship. Our farmers' crops are dying in the \nfields. We cannot allow a real solution to die on the vine.\n  In recent meetings with scores of New York farmers from across the \nState, it was stressed to me that the current worker program in place--\nthe H-2A legal guest worker program is antiquated, unworkable, and \nwoefully inadequate. Couple this with the recent increases in \nenforcement by the Social Security Administration and the Bureau of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, and the result has been major \ndisruptions to our farms.\n  I join with many of my colleagues in this Chamber who believe that \nworkplace enforcement is imperative. But as we all know, our current \nlaws are broken, and enforcement has been inadequate and haphazard at \nbest. We know this because we have been debating reforms for months, \nsome of us for years. These increases in enforcement have left our \nfarmers reeling. Day to day, they do not know whether their labor force \nwill show up for work, whether their workers have been apprehended by \nImmigration and Custom Enforcement or whether they have simply fled the \narea out of fear of apprehension. Whatever the cause, the result is our \nfarms are being paralyzed.\n  It is worth noting that the farmers I have spoken with are trying in \ngood faith to obey the law. They get labor referrals from the New York \nState Department of Labor. They inspect work documents to ensure that \nthey have a legal workforce. Our farmers are on the losing end of a \nbroken system, and it is up to us to fix it.\n  For several years, a broad, bipartisan coalition of Senators has \nadvocated for passage of the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, \nand Security Act, AgJOBS, and other legislative reforms that would \nprovide our farmers with the long overdue relief they need to maintain \na workforce.\n  The AgJOBS bill would not only expand the current H-2A program, it \nwould also modernize and streamline its procedures, making it easier \nfor our farmers to use. AgJOBS would also provide agricultural \nemployers with a stable labor supply by giving many undocumented \nagricultural workers the chance to earn the right to become legal \nimmigrants.\n  The AgJOBS compromise was reached after years of negotiations, and it \nrepresents a unique agreement between farmworker labor unions and \nagricultural employers. It has the support of a broad coalition of \norganizations, including major business trade associations, Latino \ncommunity leaders, civil rights organizations, and religious groups.\n  Moreover, AgJOBS will promote our security by helping our Government \nidentify persons inside the United States who are here without \nauthorization. By encouraging farm workers to come out of the shadows, \nwe can stand by family farms while refocusing our limited resources on \nreal threats to our security.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senators Craig, Kennedy, Feinstein, and \nBoxer on this issue. I support the Craig and Feinstein amendments to \nthis bill because we share a belief that we can tackle this crisis.\n  We are in this Chamber debating amendments that will serve our farm \neconomy and serve to make our immigration system fairer and more \nworkable. What I hope is that we can put politics aside and have a \nvote, up or down, yes or no. We owe it to our farmers, workers, and \nconsumers to pass a bill that will help save our farms and agricultural \nindustry.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with so many important questions facing \nthis Senate, and so little time left before we adjourn before the fall \nelections, I am dismayed that we are considering this so-called Secure \nFence Act.\n  I say this as a supporter of the bipartisan comprehensive immigration \nreform we passed in May.\n  I say this as one of many who followed the leadership of Senators \nFrist and Reid, Specter and Leahy, McCain and Kennedy, when 62 Senators \nvoted for true reform legislation.\n  And now look where we are. After a great success, the Senate is now \nconsidering abandoning that truly comprehensive and bipartisan solution \nto a festering national problem and replacing it with an incomplete, \nineffective response to our broken immigration system.\n  How did we come to such a low point this fall, after such promise \nthis spring? I will tell you how. The opponents of reform obstructed \nand delayed. They refused to enter into a conference--even to discuss \nthe possibility of reconciling House and Senate legislation.\n  Instead we watched the opponents of reform roll out a farcical road \nshow of hearings designed to distort the facts, confuse the issues and \nroil the waters to create a national anxiety that need not exist.\n  With that out of the way, these same obstructionists have now \nreintroduced large portions of the punitive and ineffective House \nlegislation the Senate already rejected earlier this year. Without \ndeliberation or debate they are attempting to add their measures onto \nappropriations legislation already in conference--contradicting the \nviews of a majority of Senators.\n  One of those measures sent from the House is this legislation to \nbuild fences across specific sections of our southern border. The cost \nof these fences is conservatively estimated at $2.2 billion but could \neasily double. And for this price America will be no more secure, its \nborders no more protected, and illegal immigration still out of \ncontrol.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I am more focused on protecting Americans from harm \nthan I am on any other issue. Effective border security is a vital \nnational priority--not just to stop the flow of illegal immigration \ninto this country, but also to keep terrorists and criminals from \nentering the U.S. through our airports and seaports, and across our \nland borders. We will continue to push for better border security, but \nthis is not the way to do it.\n  The money spent on this bill could be used in much more effective \nways to bolster our borders and strengthen our security. In fact, \nCongress has already significantly expanded funding for border \nsecurity--for Border Patrol officers, detention beds, and new equipment \nand technology.\n  This year the Senate already provided the Department with funds to \nbuild sections of fence where it makes a difference--in heavily \npopulated areas. But an additional few hundred miles of fence along \nsmall portions of our vast desert border will do virtually nothing to \nstop illegal immigration.\n  Building a few more sections of fence and saying we have solved the \nproblem of illegal immigration doesn't make sense.\n  The President said it himself in a speech days before the Senate \npassed its immigration bill in May.\n  He said:\n\n       An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive, \n     because all elements ofthis problem must be addressed \n     together, or none of them will be solved at all.\n\n  That is what the Senate did. And we are on the verge of losing this \nhistoric opportunity to address this border challenge the American \npeople expect us to fix.\n  Let's remind ourselves of what is contained in the Senate's \nimmigration bill--and let's be proud of our work.\n  The Senate legislation authorized extensive enhancements of border \nsecurity and immigration enforcement--many more Border Patrol officers, \nimmigration agents, detention beds, new technologies, and new legal \nauthorities.\n  The Senate bill cracks down on unscrupulous employers who would hire \nand exploit undocumented workers, by creating verification systems that \nwould leave those employers no excuse for hiring the undocumented and \npunish them if they do.\n  But what made the Senate bill so forward looking was our bipartisan \ndecision that an enforcement-only bill would not solve the problem of \nillegal immigration.\n  To control future immigration, we also created a guest worker program\n\n[[Page S9884]]\n\nthat will channel future immigrants into legal avenues, where they will \nbe screened to make sure they pose no threat to public safety and will \nnot take jobs from American workers.\n  And for immigration reform to work we had to squarely face the fact \nthat there are approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants already \nworking in the United States. Many have lived here for years and have \nchildren who were born in this country and are American citizens.\n  We wisely decided that criminalizing these 11 million people was not \ngoing to happen. We couldn't jail that many people. We couldn't deport \nthat many people.\n  We knew that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants living in \nthis country came here to work hard, support their families, pay their \ntaxes and obey the law.\n  Those are the kind of people we want here.\n  Yes, they are here illegally and that can't be treated lightly. And \nwe didn't. The Senate bill does not offer amnesty or a free pass to \nanyone. If you want to stay here, you have to earn it.\n  Under the comprehensive, bipartisan Senate bill, undocumented \nimmigrants who have been present in the U.S. for at least 5 years would \nbe able to apply for a work visa lasting 6 years. They would also pay \nthousands of dollars in fines, clear background checks, and must remain \ngainfully employed and lawabiding.\n  They would go to the back of the line behind those already waiting \nfor their applications to be judged.\n  After 6 years of working in the U.S. on a temporary visa, an \nimmigrant could apply for permanent residency--a process that takes 5 \nyears--provided he or she paid an additional fee, proved payment of \ntaxes and could show knowledge of English and United States civics.\n  Only after a combined period of 11 years could the immigrant apply \nfor U.S. citizenship.\n  Those who have been here betwee 2 to 5 years would have to apply \nthrough a stricter guest worker program, and would have to wait even \nlonger before they could win legal residency.\n  We should have rolled up our sleeves long ago to pass realistic and \ncompassionate immigration reform. And the Senate finally has. But the \nHouse has shirked its responsibilities with its enforcement-only focus.\n  Now, instead of doing our constitutional duty and hammering out our \ndifferences, cogressional leadership has declared that reform is dead \nfor this year and instead says the best we can do is build fences in \nthe desert and create a mirage of security.\n  This is not sensible or right. But we must not give up. We must \nfight--and I will continue to fight--for true reform.\n  We must do the job the American people sent us here to do--solve the \ntough problems without falling into divisive, partisan posturing.\n  That is why I hope and expect that we will be allowed to offer true \nimmigration reform amendments to this bill. If we are not allowed to \noffer immigration reform amendments, I will oppose cloture on this \nbill, and I hope all my colleagues who support reform will do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the pending bill \nbefore S. 6061, the Secure Fence Act of 2006. This bill, which was \napproved the House of Representatives last week, would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to build a 700-mile wall on the United \nStates-Mexican border.\n  The bill goes further. The bill also provides that we shall start a \nstudy as to whether to build a similar wall on our borders with Canada. \nThat, of course, is a much longer border and a challenge which has not \nreally been thought through. The northern border study is part of the \nbill, along with this new 700-mile wall, or fence, being discussed.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate spent the better part of 3 months \ndebating immigration. The process began in the Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I serve, in early May. We had a series of substantive debates in \nwhich we considered dozens of amendments, including several maritime \ncommittee meetings on very contentious issues. At the end of the \nprocess, we approved a tough, comprehensive bill with a strong \nbipartisan vote. There was a similar process on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We debated the immigration bill for 1 month. We had over 30 rollcall \nvotes on amendments. It is rare for Congress to devote that much time \nand energy to one bill. I think that was reflected in the bipartisan \nbill that we approved. It is far from perfect. It was a compromise. \nThere are sections in that bill I don't support. I voted for it because \nI thought it was the best effort we could make at that moment to move \nthis process forward.\n  The Senate bill takes a comprehensive approach that is tuff but fair.\n  First, we deal with enforcement by improving our border security by \nincreasing manpower and increasing new technology and devising new \nmeans to stop the flow of illegal immigrants into America. We would \ncrack down, as well, on employers.\n  Understand that the magnet which draws those who illegally immigrate \nto the United States is the opportunity for a better life through work. \nFor most of these people, they come here to take jobs all across our \ncountry. I have seen them in my home State of Illinois and Chicago. It \nis hard to visit a restaurant or hotel without seeing many people there \nwho are working very hard for long hours at low pay, and many of them \nare undocumented.\n  We believe that if you are really going to have enforcement work, it \nisn't just a matter of stopping them at the border; it is a matter of \ndrying up the magnet that draws them: the employment, those who would \nemploy undocumented people. Our bill speaks to that.\n  The President has said that he supports this concept. I agree with \nhim. We need a tamper-proof ID so that those presenting themselves for \nemployment are clearly identified. Currently, a person shows up with a \nname, a phony Social Security number, and goes to work. That day has to \nend.\n  If you are talking about enforcement, it is not just a matter of what \nhappens on that border--it is a matter of what happens in the workplace \nin New York, in Chicago, in Los Angeles, and all across America.\n  This bill which was sent to us by the House does not address the \nemployer sanctions. We know what has happened under the Bush \nadministration. It is rare if ever that an employer is held accountable \nfor hiring illegal aliens. Unless and until we can engage the \nemployment issue with the border security issue, we are going to have a \ndifficult time controlling the flow of illegal immigration.\n  This bill talks about a fence. It is not the first time it has been \nbrought up. In the comprehensive immigration bill which we passed, \nthere was a provision for constructing a 370-mile, triple-layered fence \nand 500 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border. I \nquestion whether this is going to work. I have my doubts.\n  Consider just the obvious. Our southern border is more than 2,000 \nmiles long, and we are building 700 miles of fencing or barriers. I \nhave to say that leaves a lot of area uncovered. I guess it is not a \nleap of imagination to believe that people will find a way to go around \nthis wall, around this fence, or under it. It is going to happen. I \nthink to place all of our confidence in this sort of basic barrier may \ngo too far.\n  But the provision was in our bill. It was an enforcement provision \nfor the border which included 370 miles of tripled-layered fence and \n500 miles of vehicle barriers.\n  Then, on August 2, the Senate appropriated the money to build it, \n$1.8 billion for fencing and barriers authorized by the Senate bill. \nThe measure was approved on a strong bipartisan vote of 94 to 3.\n  Despite my scepticism about the fence, my belief was that this moves \nus forward. If this fence moves us forward in the debate about \ncomprehensive immigration, I am going to join in that effort even \nthough I start with scepticism about whether this is really going to do \neverything we are told.\n\n[[Page S9885]]\n\n  So we are dealing with a fence and barrier that has already been \nauthorized and funds have been appropriated by the Senate. Instead of \ngoing to conference with the House and Senate and sitting down and \nworking out their differences between the two bills, the House of \nRepresentatives held hearings around the United States, hearings which \nwere designed, I am afraid, to move this issue to the public forefront \nin not a very positive way; in some respects, a very negative way. In \nthat effort, they came up with the inspiration for a new bill. In other \nwords, they walked away from their earlier bill which dealt with \nimmigration enforcement in very harsh terms, saying that those who were \nhere illegally would be deemed felons, aggravated felons under Federal \nlaw, and anyone who helped them would also been charged with the crime.\n  Now they are off on a new approach--this so-called 700-mile fence \napproach. It is hard to keep track of what is going on in the House of \nRepresentatives when it comes to immigration. It changes almost on \ndaily or weekly bases.\n  Before they will consider sitting down with the Senate and working \nout an agreement on a bill, they send us a new bill.\n  That is what has happened here. I wonder why at a time when we are \nfacing so many serious issues in this country we are engaged in such \npolitical posturing when it comes to an issue of this importance.\n  Wouldn't it have been better for us to spend this week, instead of \nwasting and burning off the hours on the secure fence bill--the second \nHouse immigration bill--focus on a national energy policy, talk about \nways that we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil so that Americans \ncan have some security knowing that this economy will grow with good, \nreliable energy sources, and that we would not be subsidizing those who \nsend oil to the United States and then turn around and use the hundreds \nof millions of dollars we send to finance our enemies and terrorism?\n  This is not really about immigration. It is about something else. \nThis is about an effort by the Republican leadership to find just the \nright issue for an election that is just a few weeks away.\n  This morning, the New York Times tells us that the American people, \nwhen asked, have a new low opinion of Congress. It has been 12 years or \nmore since so few people had a positive view of their Congress. This \nmorning, they reported that 25 percent of the American people have \npositive feelings about the Congress. When asked why, they said \nCongress is dominated by special interests; it is dominated by an \nagenda that has no importance to the lives of most American people; and \nit seems like all they are doing is political posturing for the next \ncampaign.\n  Many of those criticisms are sadly true.\n  This bill has been tied up for the last week and fits right into the \ncategory of political posturing.\n  The earlier immigration bill of the Republican-controlled House of \nRepresentatives, which would have made felons out of many hard-working \npeople and would also have made felons out of many nurses and social \nworkers and clergymen who were trying to help those who are here \nundocumented--that bill has been abandoned. Now they are trying to find \na new bill, a new wedge issue for the November 7 election.\n  I believe we need stronger enforcement, but we need to be smart in \nthe way we do it.\n  Let me give you some numbers which will give you an indication of \nwhat a smart approach might include.\n  In the last decade, we have doubled the number of Border Patrol \nagents that are at our southern border and other borders where people \nmight cross, and they have spent eight times as many hours patrolling \nthe border in the last 10 years and an 800-percent increase in the \nmanhours spent patrolling our borders.\n  During the same period of time that this dramatic increase in \nmanpower at the border has occurred, the number of undocumented \nimmigrants coming into the United States has doubled.\n  As Attorney General Gonzales recently noted, ``Some believe we should \nbe focusing solely on border security.'' He said, ``I don't think you \ncan have true security without taking into account the 11 to 12 million \nwho are already here.'' We need to know who they are . . . and take \nthem out of the shadows.\n\n  Our bill, our comprehensive bill, sought to deal with this \nimmigration issue in a sensible, smart, tough approach that will deal \nwith enforcement as well as dealing with the reality of those who are \nhere.\n  Now the House of Representatives, under the control of the \nPresident's party, has refused to sit down with the Senate and \nnegotiate in a conference committee. They apparently prefer tough talk \nto solutions.\n  Now we have a 700-mile wall that is now being proposed. It keeps \ngoing up in the bidding from 300 to 700. Who knows what the next bill \nwill be in preparation for this next election? That is what the bidding \nwar is all about--who can come up with the longest wall.\n  If we want to solve the problem of illegal immigration, we have to \nsecure our border, strengthen enforcement of our immigration laws, and \naddress the situation of approximately 12 million undocumented people \nin our country. That is a comprehensive approach.\n  I hope we will have a chance, though I am doubtful, to offer \namendments to this bill. It would be good to return to some of the \nelements of the earlier bill which had widespread support. Sixty-four \nSenators voted for the bill, the McCain-Kennedy comprehensive \nimmigration bill. I was one of them. We believe this was a good, \nbipartisan effort to deal with a very tough problem. We need that kind \nof comprehensive approach.\n  That bill included a provision which I will offer as an amendment to \nthis bill, if given an opportunity. It is called the DREAM Act. This is \na narrowly tailored, bipartisan measure I have introduced with Senators \nHagel and Lugar, both Republican colleagues, who have joined me and \nmany Democratic Senators in this bipartisan effort. This gives \nundocumented students the chance to become permanent residents if they \ncame here as children, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral \ncharacter, no criminal record, will attend college or enlist in the \nmilitary for at least 2 years.\n  Currently, our immigration laws prevent thousands of young people \nfrom pursuing their dreams and fully contributing to the Nation's \nfuture. They are honor roll students, star athletes, talented artists, \nvaledictorians, aspiring teachers, doctors, scientists, and engineers. \nThese young people have lived in this country for most of their lives. \nTheir parents brought them here. It is the only home they know. They \nare assimilated and acculturated into American society. They are \nAmerican in every sense of the word except for their technical legal \nstatus.\n  They have beaten the odds in their young lives. The high school \ndropout rate among undocumented immigrants is 50 percent, compared to \n21 percent for legal immigrants and 11 percent for native-born \nAmericans. So the odds are against these kids ever graduating from high \nschool. These children we are talking about in this bill, the DREAM \nAct, have demonstrated the kind of determination and commitment that \nmakes them successful students and points the way to the significant \ncontributions they can make in their lives. These students are \ntomorrow's teachers, nurses, doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs. They \nhave the opportunity to make America in the 21st century a success \nstory if their talents can be part of that success.\n  The DREAM Act would help them. It is not an amnesty. It does not say \nautomatically that they are going to be citizens. It is designed to \nassist only a select group of them, the very best of the best, young \npeople who have done nothing wrong in their lives, good moral \ncharacter, finished high school, who then enlist in our military for at \nleast 2 years or pursue a college education. That gives them the chance \nto earn their way toward citizenship. This offers no incentive for \nundocumented immigrants to enter the country and requires the \nbeneficiaries to have been in the country for at least 5 years when the \nbill is signed.\n  It would repeal a provision of Federal law that prevents individual \nStates from granting instate tuition rates to these students. It would \nnot create any new tuition breaks. It would not force\n\n[[Page S9886]]\n\nStates to offer instate tuition to these students. It is a State \ndecision. Each State decides. It would simply return to States the \nauthority to make that decision.\n  It is not just the right thing to do, it is a good thing for America. \nIt will allow a generation of immigrant students with great potential \nand ambition to contribute fully to America.\n  According to the Census Bureau, the average college graduate earns $1 \nmillion more in her or his lifetime than the average high school \ndropout. This translates into increased taxes and reduced social \nwelfare and criminal justice costs.\n  There is another way our country would benefit from these thousands \nof highly qualified, well-educated young people who are eager to be \npart of America. They want to serve, many of them, in our military. At \na time when our military is lowering its standards due to serious \nrecruiting shortfalls, we should not underestimate the significance of \nthese young people as a national security asset.\n  The Department of Defense has shown increased interest in this bill, \nunderstanding that there is a talent pool of these young people who are \ntechnically undocumented but want to live in the United States and \nserve our country. They need that talent. We need that talent as a \nnation.\n  On July 10, the Senate Committee on Armed Services held a hearing on \nthe contributions of immigrants to the military. David Chu, the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, said the following:\n\n       There are an estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented alien \n     young adults who enter the United States at an early age and \n     graduate from high school each year, many of whom are bright, \n     energetic and potentially interested in military service. \n     They include many who have participated in high school Junior \n     ROTC programs. Under current law, these people are not \n     eligible to enlist in the military. If their parents are \n     undocumented or in immigration limbo, most of these young \n     people have no mechanism to obtain legal residency even if \n     they have lived most of their lives here. Yet many of these \n     young people may wish to join the military, and have the \n     attributes needed--education, aptitude, fitness and moral \n     qualifications. In fact, many are High School Diploma \n     Graduates, and may have fluent language skills--both in \n     English and their native language . . . the DREAM Act would \n     provide these young people the opportunity of serving the \n     United States in uniform.\n\n  If we are talking about making America more secure safe, why would we \nturn our backs on the opportunity for these young people who came to \nAmerica at an early age, who have beaten the odds by graduating from \nhigh school, who have good moral character and want to be part of our \nfuture, why would we turn down their opportunity to serve in our \nmilitary?\n\n  The DREAM Act is supported by a broad coalition of the Senate, by \nreligious leaders, advocates across the country, and educators across \nthe political spectrum. Any real and comprehensive solution to the \nproblem of illegal immigration must include the DREAM Act.\n  The last point I make is this: We are asked regularly here to expand \nsomething called an H-1B visa. An H-1B visa is a special visa given to \nforeigners to come to the United States to work because we understand \nthat in many businesses and many places where people work--hospitals \nand schools and the like--there are specialties which we need more of.\n  I can recall Bill Gates coming to meet me in my office. Of course, \nhis success at Microsoft is legendary. He talked about the need for \ncomputer engineers and how we had to import these engineers from \nforeign countries to meet the need in the United States. He challenged \nme. He said: If you will not allow me to bring the computer engineers \nin, I may have to move my production offshore, and I don't want to do \nthat.\n  That is an interesting dilemma. Now put it in the context of this \nconversation. Why would we tell these young people, who have beaten the \nodds and shown such great potential, to leave America at this moment \nand then turn around in the next breath and say we are going to open \nthe gates of America for other foreigners to come in and make our \neconomy stronger? Why aren't we using these young people as a resource \nfor our future? They have been here. They have lived here for a long \nperiod of time. They understand America. They are acculturated to \nAmerica, and they want to make America better.\n  Instead of looking overseas at how we can lure more people in to \nstrengthen our economy, we need only look right here at home. As Mr. \nChu, from the Department of Defense, said there are 50,000 to 65,000 of \nthese students each year. Why would we give up on them when they can be \nnot only tomorrow's soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen, but they \ncan be tomorrow's doctors, scientists, and engineers?\n  If given the opportunity, and I certainly hope I will on this bill, I \nwill offer the DREAM Act. I want my colleagues to join me on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I walk around in the city of Chicago and other places in my State, \nand a number of young people who would be benefited by this bill come \nup to me. They tell me stories which are inspiring in one respect and \nheartbreaking in another--inspiring because some of them, with no help, \nno financial aid, have made it through college. One of them, a young \nman I continue to follow with great anticipation, is now working on a \nmaster's degree. He wants to go into medical research. He is good. He \nis a great scientist, a young scientist who wants to make this a better \nworld. He is one of these undocumented kids, now a young man. Why would \nwe give up on him?\n  These high school students who have worked so hard in neighborhoods \nand communities where it is very tough to succeed, they turn their \nbacks on crime, drugs, and all the temptations out there and are \ngraduating at the top of their class, they come to me and say: Senator, \nI want to be an American; I want to have a chance to make this a better \ncountry. This is my home. They ask me: When are you going to pass the \nDREAM Act? I come back here and think: What have I done lately to help \nthese young people?\n  We can do something. It is not for me; it is not for the Senate; it \nis for this country. Let's take this great resource and let's use it \nfor our benefit as a nation. We will be a stronger and better nation if \nwe do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed to H.R. 6061.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 6061, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6061) to establish operational control over \n     the international land and maritime borders of the United \n     States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5031\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, last week, hundreds of family, friends, and \nadmirers gathered in Houston, TX, to honor the life of a WWII veteran, \nlegal giant, and true American hero, U.S. district judge James DeAnda. \nJudge DeAnda died last Thursday, September 7, 2006, at the age of 81. \nThroughout his life, he quietly went about his work of ensuring that \nHispanic Americans were guaranteed the same protections and rights \nafforded them in our Constitution.\n  Today, we mourn his passing and pay tribute to his important \ncontributions to this Nation. I am joined by Senator Salazar, who is \nfamiliar with the importance of Judge DeAnda's legacy. Senator Salazar, \nwhat do you believe are Judge DeAnda's most important legal victories?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Thank you, Senator Reid, for your recognition of Judge \nDeAnda. One of his most significant cases came in 1954, when he worked \non and argued a little-known but enormously significant case before the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I should also mention that Judge DeAnda, together \nwith a legal team of three other Mexican-American attorneys, were the \nfirst Mexican-American attorneys to argue before the highest Court in \nour land.\n  In Hernandez v. Texas, Judge DeAnda believed that their client, Pete \nHernandez, could not receive a fair and impartial trial unless members \nof other races served on the jury. Through careful research, Judge \nDeAnda showed that Hispanics in Jackson County, TX, were essentially \nbarred from serving as jurors despite comprising a significant \nproportion of the population at the time. In fact, no Hispanic had \nserved on any jury in Jackson County for a quarter century. The Supreme \nCourt agreed and overturned the murder conviction. They unanimously \nruled that Mexican Americans and all other racial groups in the United \nStates had equal protection under the 14th amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  Despite this major legal victory, the Hernandez case was overshadowed \nby a companion case, Brown v. Board of Education, which was decided \njust a week later. But the results of this decision are evident in \nAmerican courtrooms everywhere. Because of this decision alone, Judge \nDeAnda holds a special place in our country's history and our quest to \nbecome a more inclusive America.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I agree with the Senator from Colorado. Judge DeAnda \nno doubt played a key role in our Nation's history. He was a key leader \nin the Latino civil rights movement who worked tirelessly to foster \nlegal equality for Latinos and all Americans. Like many great \nAmericans, Judge DeAnda rose from humble beginnings.\n  The son of Mexican immigrants, Judge DeAnda was born in Houston, TX. \nHe interrupted his college education at Texas A University to join \nthe Marines during World War II, serving in the Pacific and then later \nChina. When he returned from the war, he completed his studies and then \nenrolled in the University of Texas Law School in 1950, where he was \namong the first Hispanics admitted.\n  Beyond the Hernandez case, Judge DeAnda took on countless other cases \nin his fight to end segregation of Hispanics in Texas. In 1968, he went \nbefore the Supreme Court in the case of Cisneros v. Corpus Christi ISD, \na case that led to the desegregation and increased funding of schools \nin that city. It was also during that year that Judge DeAnda helped to \nestablish one of the most respected national Hispanic organizations, \nthe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, MALDEF. \nSenator Salazar, would you say that the founding of MALDEF has \nempowered the Hispanic community in our country?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. As a Hispanic who grew up in the Southwest, I can say \nthat the impact of MALDEF's establishment has been profound. As the \nHispanic community's legal advocate, MALDEF has taken on cases \nthroughout the country. In my own State, their work has helped improved \naccess to equal education for Hispanics.\n  Judge DeAnda was also actively involved with Hispanic organizations \nlike the League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC, and the \nAmerican G.I. Forum. By working with MALDEF, they ensured that Hispanic \nveterans, who gave the ultimate sacrifice on the battlefield, were not \ndenied burial in our veterans cemeteries. Judge DeAnda's leadership was \nvisionary and was recognized by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, who \nnominated him to serve as a Federal judge in the Southern District of \nTexas. At the time of his appointment, he was only the Nation's second \nMexican-American Federal district judge.\n  Despite all of his contributions to the Latino community, Judge \nDeAnda never sought the limelight. He only strove to ensure equal \nrights for all in this country through his thorough representation and \nfair consideration of those who came before his court. I find his own \nwords to be the most telling. He is said to have told a group of law \nschool students once, ``You will find law to be a most satisfying \ncareer because of the service you can give your fellow man. I know of \nno other endeavor in which you can bring about healthy change and make \na decent living. You can live well and do good.''\n  Judge DeAnda certainly did good and we are grateful to him for his \nservice.\n  Mr. REID. We are truly indebted to Judge DeAnda. Indeed, it is only \nfitting that as our Nation begins a month-long celebration of Hispanic \ncontributions to America during Hispanic Heritage Month, we take this \ntime to acknowledge Judge DeAnda. We are deeply saddened by his passing \nbut are also inspired by his example as we carry on the struggle to \nensure equity for all Americans. His life-long dedication to the \nprotection of Americans has made him an icon in the legal profession \nand a pioneer of the American civil rights movement.\n  Judge DeAnda will be missed by all, but certainly by his wife Joyce \nand their four children. They are in our thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9887-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On December 6, 2003, in Largo, FL, William McHenry was stabbed to \ndeath by Lucas McCauley. McCauley, a straight man, followed McHenry \nhome from Club Z109, a bar that caters to gay and transgendered people. \nAfter arriving at his home, McHenry was attacked and stabbed by \nMcCauley. According to police, the motivation for the attack was the \nvictim's sexual orientation.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9887-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9887-S9888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HATE CRIME\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Jewish New Year is a time for \ncelebration, prayer, and reflection. As friends and family commemorate \nthe high holy days which begin tomorrow evening, Jewish communities \nacross Washington State and around the world will come together, \nconsider the past, and look to the year ahead.\n  Rosh Hashanah brings new beginnings and new energy; Yom Kippur calls \nfor atonement and forgiveness. These ideals extend beyond religion or \nrace--they build common ground and inspire shared sacrifice. All of \nthis was threatened by an act of senseless violence and hate this \nsummer in Seattle. We cannot give in to that hate.\n  During these days of repentance and renewal, I share a commitment to \nending violence and to living with one another in peace both around the \nworld and here in our own communities.\n  Yet we are still shocked and saddened by the pain and loss of July \n28,\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\n2006, when a gunman driven by hate, forced his way into the offices of \nthe Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. He killed one woman and \nwounded five others before surrendering to police.\n  Our community tries to recover, but we are stunned. The King County \nProsecutor said: ``Make no mistake, this was a hate crime.''\n  I mourn the loss of Pamela Waechter, a beautiful woman and warm \nspirit who lost her own life while trying to improve the lives of \nothers. All across Washington State we have been asking the same \nquestions. How could such an event happen in our community? How could \nsuch violence be carried out in our city in the name of hate?\n  There is never any justification for a hate crime, anywhere. That \nthis horrific crime took a life so suddenly and so uselessly is a \ntragedy for all of Seattle. We must recommit ourselves to the goal laid \nout by Rabbi Mirel. He said: ``Hatred will not be our legacy.''\n  We must do more, both as a national community and as individuals, to \nrecognize the brutality of this crime and to respond to this terrible \nevent. And we must do more to demonstrate that the only kind of \nintolerance Americans will abide is an intolerance for short-term \nanswers and shortsighted conclusions.\n  Pamela Waechter, who was killed in July, set an example for us all \nthrough her involvement in the Seattle community. She moved to Seattle \nin 1979. After raising two children, Pamela became a student at the \nUniversity of Washington and graduated with a degree in nutrition.\n  Pamela worked at Jewish Family Service and later at the Jewish \nFederation, where she did outreach and fundraising. She rose from \nsecretary to two-term president at Temple B'nai Torah. Pamela stood out \nin her dedication, and brought the diverse people of this city together \nacross boundaries of ethnicity or religion.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families. We \nhonor their spirit during these Days of Awe by celebrating their deeds, \npursuing peace, and seeking renewal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9888-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9888-S9890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNVEILING OF THE BOB DOLE LEADERSHIP PORTRAIT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this summer the U.S. Capitol added a new \nportrait to its collection of Senate leaders. It is a face that is \nfamiliar to all of us since he once led this institution and spent 27 \nyears here as a Senator. I refer to Bob Dole, former Senator from \nKansas, chairman of the Finance Committee, majority leader, and \nPresidential candidate. His portrait was unveiled in the Old Senate \nChamber on July 25 and now hangs in the Senate Chamber lobby, along \nwith a painting of Senator George Mitchell, his Democratic counterpart. \nHe looks very much at home there.\n  Bob Dole's story is familiar to almost everyone in this Nation: Born \nand raised in Russell, KS, he went off to serve in the U.S. Army during \nthe Second World War. He was seriously injured in combat in Italy and \nunderwent arduous physical rehabilitation for more than 3 years. He \nreturned to Kansas, got his law degree, ran for the State legislature, \nand served as county attorney. He first ran for Congress in 1960 and \nserved in the House of Representatives for 8 years. Then, like many of \nus, he migrated from the House to the Senate.\n  The Senate suited Bob Dole. He is a man who speaks his mind, candidly \nand forthrightly. Right away he impressed Senator Barry Goldwater, who \nhailed the new Senator from Kansas as ``the first fellow we've had \naround here in a long time who can grab 'em by the hair and haul 'em \ndown the aisle.'' While that captures the combative side of the man, \nthere was also Bob Dole the legislative tactician, a statesman who \nsought common ground among 100 Senators to craft legislation that would \nbest serve the Nation. When President Ronald Reagan sought to shore up \nthe finances of Social Security, it was Bob Dole, as chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee, working with the ranking member of the \nminority, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who forged the bill that stabilized \nthe system for another generation.\n  As floor leader of his party, in both the majority and the minority, \nBob Dole stood front and center in the Chamber, shrewd, vigilant, and \nmasterful. But you could also find him off the floor, sitting in the \ncloakroom, a legal pad on his lap, surrounded by a knot of Senators, \ndrafting the language of an amendment to break a legislative impasse \nand get the Senate's business back on track.\n  He did this all with a ready quip and a limitless sense of humor that \ngot him and the Senate through many difficult moments. Bob Dole \npossesses a sure sense of the ironies of government and the foibles of \npoliticians. He has used this to great advantage in winning over his \naudiences, whether in small groups or vast arenas. He is smiling in his \nportrait, as if he had just delivered one of those lines that made his \nlisteners laugh.\n  It is a handsome portrait of a man who well deserves the honor of \nbeing included among the artwork of the U.S. Capitol. Future Senators \ncan gaze on it for inspiration, and it will remind visitors of his many \ncontributions to our Nation's history. Bob Dole will most likely glance \nat it himself when he visits the Capitol and probably make a few wry \nremarks when he does. Today he is proudly a Senate spouse, married to \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who \ncarries on his legislative tradition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe proceedings of the ceremony for unveiling the Bob Dole leadership \nportrait.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks transcribed From the Bob Dole Leadership Portrait Unveiling--\n                July 25, 2006 in the Old Senate Chamber\n\n       Mr. FRIST: Good afternoon. It's an honor to be here today, \n     and it's a special honor for me to welcome back a leader \n     whose title I share but whose service will never be rivaled.\n       Ten years ago, Bob Dole stepped down from the office I now \n     hold, and he left invaluable words to all who would follow. \n     He said, ``You do not lay claim to the office you hold. It \n     lays claim to you. Your obligation is to bring to it the \n     gifts you can of labor and honesty and then depart with \n     grace.''\n       To congress and to the office of Majority Leader, Bob Dole \n     brought the gifts of labor and honesty. But what he also \n     brought was an invaluable perspective. It was a perspective \n     of a fighter. It was the mind-set of the greatest \n     generation--the generation who fought on the battlefield, on \n     farm field, in factory--so America might rise.\n       From the humble plains of Kansas, Bob Dole learned the \n     value of fighting one's way up in the world through hard and \n     honest work. And from the battlefields of war, he learned \n     that the freedoms we enjoy--the very freedoms that enable a \n     boy from Kansas to dream big and succeed--were to be fought \n     for at any price.\n       To this day, Bob Dole has never stopped fighting for the \n     America he believed in. Ardently, he fought for a better life \n     for all Americans--for the disadvantaged, for Americans with \n     disabilities, for the hard-working farmer trying to raise a \n     family. And always he has stood tall for America's veterans. \n     For those who made the ultimate sacrifice, Bob Dole fought to \n     ensure their sacrifice was never forgotten.\n       And it was that passion that paved the way to the \n     construction of the World War II Memorial on the Mall. At the \n     dedication to that memorial in 2004, Bob Dole said to the \n     audience: ``what we learned in foreign fields of battle, we \n     applied in post-war America. As a result of our democracy, \n     though imperfect, is more nearly perfect than in the days of \n     Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt.''\n       Bob, today I say to you, our democracy is more nearly \n     perfect because of you. America is a better place because \n     you've been here fighting on our side. From the battlefield \n     to the Senate floor, thank you for fighting for America.\n       [applause]\n       Mr. MITCHELL: Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Senator Dole the \n     first, Senator Dole the current, friends and family of both \n     Senators Dole and colleagues, for six years I was privileged \n     to serve as Senate Majority Leader. Shortly after I was \n     elected to that position, I went to see Bob Dole. He was then \n     the Minority Leader, a position he continued to hold during \n     my tenure as Majority Leader.\n       Bob had been in the Senate much longer than I had, knew a \n     lot more, and so I understood that I could learn a lot from \n     him, as I'd learned from my immediate predecessor, Senator \n     Robert Byrd. I told Bob that I looked forward to working with \n     him, and we quickly agreed on a simple set of rules that \n     would guide our relationship. We would not surprise or \n     embarrass each other. We would try to work together in good \n     faith whenever possible. But when we couldn't, we would say \n     so candidly. And always we'd let the Senate decide.\n       For six years, we lived by those rules. There were many \n     difficult issues, some tense times, we disagreed often on \n     substance and on process, but we never let a harsh word pass \n     between us, in public or in private. And that is true to this \n     day. Never in our lifetimes has a harsh word passed betweert \n     us. We believed in and we trusted each other. All\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\n     of this was possible because of Bob Dole's essential \n     integrity and his love for the Senate.\n       Bob's word was his bond. Never, ever did he tell me \n     anything that was untrue. Never did he go back on his word. \n     He was more experienced, more knowledgeable, more savvy than \n     I was, so it would not have been unreasonable for him to \n     spurn my offer of cooperation. But he didn't. Not because of \n     me but because of who he was and is.\n       Born and raised in Russell, Kansas, he acquired early in \n     life the tone and the values of the American Midwest. So he's \n     always had intense loyalty to his faith, to his family, to \n     his country. His patriotism was tested and found not wanting \n     in the fire of the second World War. In the most direct and \n     unforgettable way, he learned firsthand the horror of war. \n     But he also learned why some Wars must be fought in the \n     defense of freedom.\n       A long and painful rehabilitation gave him time to try to \n     understand why he would forever bear the scars of war. I But \n     it also gave him time to think of how he could best serve the \n     country he was so proud to defend. The result was a \n     distinguished political career which is so well-known to \n     everyone here that I won't try to recite it except to say \n     that Bob Dole brought honor and integrity to every office he \n     ever held.\n       One of Bob's many strengths is his sense of humor, his \n     ability to defuse tension with a light comment, to find a \n     laugh in even the most dark and difficult times. I've been \n     the butt of many of his jokes.\n       [laughter]\n       And I can testify that he does it in such a nice way that \n     makes even the butt laugh.\n       [laughter]\n       Our relationship was forged in many long days and nights in \n     the Senate negotiating over the substance and the process of \n     legislation. We usually met in my office or his. As many \n     visitors to our offices noted at the time, his office was a \n     bit bigger than mine. So I often was asked: how come the \n     Minority Leader has a bigger office than the Majority Leader? \n     I always replied that he was entitled to it because he was a \n     leader before I was.\n       After I left the Senate, I joined a law firm. Two years \n     later, we were reunited when Bob joined the same firm. This \n     is our--today is our second reuniting in recent years. And \n     when I got there, I couldn't help notice that while I was \n     tucked away in a tiny office near the attic--[laughter]--he \n     had literally a whole floor for himself and his huge \n     entourage. And I was really bothered when I learned that he \n     had brought along to the law firm his little dog, Leader, and \n     the dog had a bigger office than I had.\n       [laughter]\n       So I asked him about it. And he laughed and he said, ``He's \n     entitled to it because he was leader before you were.''\n       [laughter]\n       Well, it's a real honor for me to be here today to join \n     Bob's wife and family and friends in paying tribute to a \n     great and a remarkable American. Bob Dole is to me a \n     colleague, a mentor, and most importantly a friend. \n     Congratulations, Bob. It's a pleasure to be reunited with you \n     again, as we both hang on the wall of this great \n     institution--hidden away in the lobby, where no one will be \n     able to see us--an institution which means so much to both of \n     us and to which you devoted so much of your life.\n       And speaking of colleagues and friends, it's now my \n     pleasure to introduce Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire. \n     Warren, Bob and I served together in the Senate and Warren \n     and I have worked together in several capacities since then. \n     We served on a committee, and after exposure to Senator \n     Rudman for a couple of months, one member of the committee \n     said that Senator Rudman pears to have reached the age at \n     which he's willing to say anything, regardless of the \n     consequences.\n       [laughter]\n       I replied that actually Senator Rudman reached that point \n     at the age of nine and the rest of us had been dealing with \n     the consequences ever since.\n       [laughter]\n       Senator Rudman?\n       [applause]\n       Mr. RUDMAN: Thank You, George. Bob, Elizabeth, and Robin, \n     colleagues, friends and family of Bob Dole, when I was \n     preparing for today, I thought about Bob Dole's extraordinary \n     record in the Senate and thought of speaking about his many \n     accomplishments. But they are a matter of record with which \n     all of you are very familiar.\n       For me, when I think of my years of friendship with Bob, \n     there are two endearing qualities that are always uppermost \n     in my mind. First, I will forever marvel at the self-\n     deprecating wit of this great American from the heartland. \n     Second, I have deeply admired his dedication to the \n     principles and values of this great country. What better way \n     to share with you my thoughts than to do so in Bob Dole's own \n     words?\n       Thus, let me read to you two excerpts from his wonderful \n     memoir, ``One Soldier's Story.'' First, his wonderful wit, in \n     this case, given at a most solemn occasion at one of our \n     country's most important places.\n       Here are Bob's words. ``Maintaining a healthy sense of \n     humor is a key to overcoming any setback in life, even when \n     your setbacks are extremely public. In my speech at the White \n     House after accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom from \n     President Clinton just a few months after I lost the election \n     to him, I began as though taking the oath of office. `I, \n     Robert J. Dole . . .' I paused as the august crowd of \n     political leaders and members of the press immediately caught \n     on and roared in laughter. `. . . do solemnly swear. . .' I \n     continued, without breaking a smile to gales of laughter. I \n     looked up as though surprised. `Sorry, wrong speech.' The \n     crowd roared again. `But I had a dream. . .' The audience \n     chuckled at my allusion to Martin Luther King Jr. `. . .that \n     I would be here this historic week receiving something from \n     the President. But I thought it would be the front door key \n     to the White House.' I looked over and the President himself \n     was doubled over with laughter.'' And for those of you that \n     missed that occasion, it truly was a remarkable display of \n     Bob Dole's humor.\n       Secondly, his devotion to the principles and values that \n     George Mitchell referred to that Bob Dole holds so dear. \n     Again, in Bob's own words. ``Nearly 60 years ago, after I \n     headed up Hill 913, I concluded my speech at the dedication \n     ceremony of the National World War II Memorial by saying: `It \n     is only fitting that when this memorial was opened to the \n     public, the very first visitors were schoolchildren. For \n     them, our war is ancient history and those who fought it are \n     slightly ancient themselves. Yet in the end, they are the \n     ones for whom we built this shrine and to whom we now hand \n     the baton in the unending relay of human possibility. \n     Certainly the heroes represented by the 4,000 gold stars of \n     the Freedom Wall need no monument to commemorate their \n     sacrifice. They are known to God and to their fellow \n     soldiers, who will mourn their passing until the day of \n     our own. In their name, we dedicate this place of \n     meditation, and it is in their memory that I ask you to \n     stand, if possible, and join me in a moment of silent \n     tribute to remind us all that sometime in our life we have \n     or may be called upon to make a sacrifice for our country \n     to preserve liberty and freedom.' ''\n       Bob, it was an extraordinary privilege to work with you in \n     the Senate and I'm deeply honored to have had this \n     opportunity to be with you and to speak in your behalf today.\n       [applause]\n       Now I'm pleased to introduce a longtime friend and senior \n     staff member of Bob Dole's, Rod DeArment.\n       [applause]\n       Mr. DeARMENT: Good afternoon. Shortly after I joined the \n     Senate Finance Committee staff, where I started working for \n     Senator Dole, he asked me to travel with him on a series of \n     speeches on the subject of the crude oil windfall profit tax. \n     My job was to explain the mechanics of the--of the tax. And \n     at the first event, as Senator Dole gave introductory remarks \n     and I launched into a review of the structure of the tax, \n     complete with charts and a pointer. Midway through my \n     presentation, Senator Dole slipped a note on to the podium, \n     and I glanced down as I was speaking and--and thought it \n     said, ``more detail.'' So I dug in and I gave a more thorough \n     explanation of the base prices, tertiary wells, stripper \n     well, et cetera. When I sat down and I looked more closely at \n     the note, I realized it said, ``move faster.''\n       [laughter]\n       Well, in time, I learned brevity and to read Senator Dole's \n     handwriting better.\n       As I contemplated this unveiling today, I thought about all \n     the qualities Senator Dole has that are nearly impossible for \n     an artist to fully capture, no matter how skillful the artist \n     is. For example, how can an artist truly reflect Senator \n     Dole's warm friendliness that was evident to all the staff \n     around this Capitol, from the guards at the door he greeted \n     each morning, to the cloakroom team, to the restaurant \n     workers, to the staffers--some of whom are here--that sat on \n     the back of the couches and were amused by Senator Dole's \n     comments as he passed by?\n       It's hard to capture his quick wit and his spontaneous \n     humor. Much of his humor was self-deprecating, as Senator \n     Rudman indicated. Hundreds of times he told the story of his \n     life about how he planned to study medicine. He went away to \n     the war, suffered a head injury and went into politics.\n       [laughter]\n       His humor was never mean, and I can tell you, his quick wit \n     rescued me more than once from fierce cross-examination \n     trying to defend things at the chair at the Senate Finance \n     Committee. It's also hard to capture his boundless energy. He \n     seemed to revel in early morning breakfasts and late-night \n     sessions. As we approach this August recess, I recall how \n     many august recesses Senator Dole threatened to cancel if we \n     didn't finish a particular bill. Nearly every august recess \n     there was that threat.\n       Finally, how can an artist capture Senator Dole's \n     perseverance, tenacity and spirit? He never seemed to give up \n     on bills he thought worthwhile. He just kept working. When a \n     bill got hung up, his instruction always was, ``work it \n     out.''\n       [laughter]\n       TEFRA in 1982 was a tribute to both Senator Dole's \n     legislative skill and his never-say-die tenacity. Now, before \n     I get another note from the Senator about moving faster, I \n     would like to introduce the subject today of this grand \n     portrait, Senator Dole.\n       [applause]\n       Mr. DOLE: Thank You.\n       [applause]\n       Mr. DOLE: Thank You.\n       [applause]\n       Mr. DOLE: Thank You. Well, first I want to thank everybody \n     for being here and particularly Senator Frist and Senator \n     Reid, Senator Rudman, Senator Mitchell, my good friend Rod. \n     And it's--you know, as Barbara Mikulski said as she walked \n     by, ``I wouldn't miss this hanging for the world.''\n       [laughter]\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\n       And some of my colleagues have been waiting for years to \n     nail me to the wall. So . . .\n       [laughter]\n       And I remind you of an old axiom: ``beware of what you wish \n     for.'' In fact, I understand, as Senator Mitchell has \n     indicated, that I'm to be hung in the Senate lobby--out of \n     sight from the public but not far from where distinguished \n     Members have been known to lie down and take a nap.\n       [laughter]\n       So if nothing else, I'll be there to disturb your sleep.\n       [laughter]\n       I also want to thank the artist for doing something that \n     eluded a host of high-priced campaign consultants and spin \n     doctors: making me look presidential.\n       [laughter]\n       Mr. Kinstler certainly made the most of what he had to work \n     with. It calls to mind the story of Abraham Lincoln, who was \n     running for the Senate from Illinois against Stephen A. \n     Douglas. At one point in the campaign, Douglas called his \n     opponent two-faced. ``I leave it to you,'' Lincoln told the \n     audience. ``If I had two faces, do you really think I would \n     use this one?''\n       [laughter]\n       I know that actually happened because I was in the \n     audience. So . . .\n       [laughter]\n       Coming back to this place is more than an exercise in \n     nostalgia. If it feels like a homecoming--and it does--it is \n     because of two families to whom I owe so much. Elizabeth, \n     Robin, Gloria, my sister Norma Jean, and Gladys, my sister \n     Gloria, of all the blessings bestowed on me, none can match \n     your love and support. I want to thank you for being here \n     today and for being there whenever in the past.\n       And then there is the Senate family. And like most \n     families, it sometimes appears dysfunctional to those outside \n     its ranks. So doubt could be a little--no doubt it could be a \n     little more efficient, maybe a little less verbose. But we \n     should never forget that all the talk and all those rules are \n     put in place to safeguard our liberties. How much better are \n     the raised voices of debate than the dull unanimity of the \n     cell or the grim silence of the Gulag?\n       Standing in this room where so much history has been made, \n     I can't help but reflect on lawmakers who not only made me a \n     better Senator but a better person. And some are here today. \n     Many are here today. In both parties. Others--too many \n     others--are present in memory only. I think of Everett \n     Dirksen and Hubert Humphrey and Barry Goldwater and Pat \n     Moynihan, for starters. Each of them a patriot before he was \n     a partisan.\n       But the Senate family is hardly limited to Senators. Rod, \n     who just spoke, and Sheila Burke and Bob Lighthizer and Joyce \n     McCluney, thank you for uncovering me today and for covering \n     for me over the years.\n       [laughter]\n       You serve as stand-ins for hundreds of other dedicated \n     staff members--many of whom are with us today--who made me \n     look better than any artist could. Some of you greeted \n     constituents or wrote press releases. Others crafted \n     legislation or chased down missing Social Security checks or \n     made certain that the voice of ordinary Kansans was heard in \n     this capital city. Whatever you did, each of you has a place \n     in the Senate's history and always a place in my heart.\n       When I left this building ten years ago, I said it was up \n     to the electorate to decide my future address. And in their \n     wisdom, they decided they'd rather see me in commercials than \n     in the Oval Office.\n       [laughter]\n       And I have discovered that there is, indeed, life after the \n     Senate.\n       If not like that other Senator.\n       So my final acknowledgment is to those to whom I owe my \n     greatest debt: to the people of Kansas who came to my aid \n     many, many times when I needed it and did it for many--more \n     than 35 years. You honored me with your confidence and you \n     entrusted me with your interests and ideals. And after today, \n     thanks to the kindness of my colleagues, part of me will \n     forever be joined in this--to this institution. But the \n     greater part will be at home on the Kansas prairie, from \n     which I draw whatever strengt of character I brought to these \n     halls.\n       So again, I thank you very much for being here. And may God \n     Bless the United States Senate, and God Bless America. Thank \n     you.\n       [applause]\n       Mr. REID: We've all heard people, including Senator Dole, \n     say funny things about him. But everyone in this room should \n     understand and acknowledge that we have a rare opportunity \n     today to stand in the presence of a great man, a man who has \n     changed the history of this country. Think about him.\n       He came from Kansas, went to fight in the war, was \n     grievously wounded in that war. Spent not days, not weeks, \n     not months, but years in a hospital with Senator Inouye--the \n     same hospital--trying to make a new life out of a life that \n     had been changed dramatically as a result of the physical \n     damage to their bodies as a result of that war. Fought \n     back. Decided he'd enter government and has done that to \n     the betterment of us all.\n       Bob Dole, candidate for President. Bob Dole, Member of the \n     United States Senate. Bob Dole, Majority Leader of the United \n     States Senate. And he's done it with such grace and humor.\n       I've learned a number of things from Senator Dole. I've \n     learned that you should try to be funny. But no one can be \n     humorous like Senator Dole. I asked my staff, I said, ``find \n     some things that he said were funny.'' And there were volumes \n     of stuff. But none of them seemed very funny reading them \n     because it's his delivery. It's his delivery.\n       He said, ``as long as there's only three or four senators \n     on the floor, the country's in good shape. It's only when you \n     have 50 or 60 of them on the floor you have to be \n     concerned.''\n       [laughter]\n       On seniority--he invented this. It's been used by many. ``I \n     used to think that seniority was a terrible thing when I \n     didn't have any.''\n       [laughter]\n       After his 1996 campaign: ``Elizabeth's back at the Red \n     Cross and I'm walking the dog.''\n       [laughter]\n       And again after that same campaign, he said, ``at least \n     Elizabeth is the president of something.''\n       [laughter]\n       Senator Dole has worked with Senator Byrd, Senator \n     Mitchell, Senator Daschle. And as Senator Mitchell said, \n     Senator Dole was a great advocate. I was there to witness his \n     advocacy. But the thing about Senator Dole working with these \n     three Senators that I've mentioned was that they all said \n     things in a civil fashion to each other. And I--if I had to \n     say in a sentence what Senator Dole has meant to me, it's \n     this. And this is a quote. ``Your political opponent does not \n     have to be your enemy.'' We should all remember that, those \n     of us who serve in public office. Just because you have \n     someone that you're opposed to, a particular piece of \n     legislation, that person's not an enemy.\n       So, Senator Dole, on behalf of the Reid Family, the Senate \n     Family and our country, thank you very much for your service.\n       [laughter]\n       I would ask that Senator Dole, Elizabeth Dole come forward; \n     Robin Dole, his daughter; Sheila Burke, who we all know; \n     Robert Lighthizer, former staff; Joyce McCluney, former \n     staff, please come forward.\n       [applause]\n       [inaudible conversation]\n       Mr. REID: There will be a reception in S-207.

Mr. President, analyses of gun trace data has consistently \nfound that a tiny percentage of our Nation's licensed gun dealers \ncontribute to the vast majority of our Nation's crime guns.\n  This finding was first revealed in a 1995 report produced for the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives--ATF--by a team of \nresearchers at Northeastern University. The report used trace data to \nidentify patterns of firearm trafficking. It found that less than one \npercent of licensed gun dealers account for almost half of the traced \ncrime guns.\n  Later analyses confirmed these findings. A report published by \nSenator Schumer used 1998 trace data to identify 137 dealers nationwide \nthat sold more than 50 guns traced to crime. The 13 worst dealers were \nthe source of 13,000 guns used in crimes that year.\n  In the ``Commerce in Firearms'' report released in February 2000, the \nATF reported that only 1.2 percent of dealers, or about a thousand \ndealers, accounted for 57 percent of the crime guns that year. A \nsmaller subset of only 330 dealers accounted for approximately 40 \npercent of the crime guns. Again, the trace data showed that a \nrelatively small number of gun dealers were responsible for the \ndiversion of a tremendous number of guns into the illegal market. The \nreport also recognized that trace data should be used by manufacturers \nof firearms to ensure retail sellers act responsibly to prevent the \ndiversion of guns into the illegal market.\n  In 2004, the Americans for Gun Safety Foundation released a report \nbased on trace data introduced into evidence in a lawsuit brought \nagainst the gun industry by the NAACP that named the gun dealers who \nsold the most guns traced to crime. Dealers that sold 200 or more crime \nguns from 1996 to 2000 were listed by name and location. The \npublication of the report not only allowed local communities to know \nwhere high trace gun dealers were operating, but also handed the gun \nindustry a specific list of dealers who were contributing the most guns \nto the illegal market.\n  In 2005 the ATF released a study that found that 97 rogue gun dealers \nhad 11,840 guns ``disappear'' from their shops. These dealers accounted \nfor 96 percent of the guns identified as missing from 3,083 Federal \nfirearm licensees that the ATF inspected.\n  Over the last few years, crime gun tracing has produced a great deal \nof valuable information on how the illegal gun market is supplied. A \nsmall number of rogue gun dealers are playing a tremendous role in \naiding gun\n\n[[Page S9891]]\n\ncrimes by supplying thousands of guns to the criminal market. We must \nuse this type of information to help point the way to policies that \nkeep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9891-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9891-S9893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             COST ESTIMATES\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for three cost \nestimates from the Congressional Budget Office to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  These estimates are for three important bills which the Committee on \nForeign Relations has already reported to the Senate. They are S. 2489, \nS. 3709, and S. 3722.\n  The Standing Rules of the Senate require that committee reports on \nbills or joint resolutions contain cost estimates for such legislation.\n  When the Committee on Foreign Relations reported these bills earlier \nthis year, the committee had not received the Congressional Budget \nOffice's cost estimates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n     S. 2489--U.S. Additional Protocol Implementation Act\n       Summary: S. 2489 would implement the obligations of the \n     United States under the Protocol Additional to the Agreement \n     between the United States of America and the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the Application of Safeguards \n     in the United States of America (hereafter called the \n     Additional Protocol). The Additional Protocol was signed by \n     the United States in 1998 and ratified by the Senate in 2004 \n     (Treaty Document 107-7). The bill would authorize government \n     agencies to conduct vulnerability assessments at government \n     and commercial facilities to protect national security \n     interests. The bill also would authorize the U.S. government \n     to seek search warrants when owners of commercial facilities \n     bar the government from entering the location in support of \n     the IAEA inspections and would establish guidelines for \n     conducting environmental sampling at both government and \n     commercial locations.\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 2489 would cost $17 \n     million in 2007 and $72 million over the 2007-2011 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Enacting the \n     bill would not affect direct spending or receipts.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) \n     excludes from the application of that act any legislative \n     provisions that are necessary for the ratification or \n     implementation of international treaty obligations. CBO has \n     determined that because this bill would implement the \n     Additional Protocol, it falls within that exclusion. CBO has \n     thus not reviewed the bill for intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 2489 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs would fall within budget functions 050 (national \n     defense), 270 (energy), and 370 (commerce and housing \n     credit). CBO assumes that the bill will be enacted near the \n     start of fiscal year 2007 and that the estimated amounts will \n     be appropriated each year.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      By fiscal year, in millions of\n                                                 dollars--\n                                 ---------------------------------------\n                                   2007    2008    2009    2010    2011\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated Authorization Level...      23      13      13      13      13\nEstimated Outlays...............      17      15      14      13      13\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of estimate: Enacting S. 2489 would enable government \n     agencies to implement the Additional Protocol. Specifically, \n     the bill would:\n       Authorize government agencies to conduct vulnerability \n     assessments at government and commercial facilities,\n       Designate government agencies to provide outreach programs \n     to the commercial facilities and to issue regulations in \n     order to implement the provisions of the Additional Protocol,\n       Authorize the federal government to seek search warrants \n     when the owner of a commercial facility refuses to give \n     consent for inspection by the IAEA, and\n       Set guidelines for the IAEA to conduct environmental \n     sampling at government and commercial facilities.\n       CBO expects that most of the assessments would be performed \n     by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of \n     Energy (DOE) at universities, fuel-fabrication plants, and \n     commercial manufacturing sites currently working on DoD \n     projects, as well as DOE labs. Although DoD and DOE already \n     have the authority to perform such assessments, CBO believes \n     that those agencies will not perform these assessments unless \n     S. 2489 is enacted. Based on information from those two \n     departments, CBO estimates that the Department of Defense \n     would conduct about 50 assessments a year, while the \n     Department of Energy would conduct about 50 assessments in \n     2007 and about 10 assessments each year thereafter, at an \n     average cost of about $200,000 per assessment. \n     Accordingly, CBO estimates that conducting vulnerability \n     assessments would cost $15 million in 2007 and $65 million \n     over the 2007-2011 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     estimated amounts.\n       CBO expects that most of the outreach efforts would be \n     performed by the Department of Commerce (DOC). DOC is \n     developing a new database to support the reporting \n     requirements of the Additional Protocol. The department also \n     would conduct outreach, training, and inspection support \n     programs at commercial facilities. CBO anticipates that the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) staff would revise \n     regulations to include the new requirements for implementing \n     the Additional Protocol and would prepare guidance documents \n     for its commercial licensees to prepare for the IAEA \n     inspections. Under current law, 90 percent of the additional \n     costs for the NRC would be covered by fees paid by operators \n     of nuclear power plants. Based on information provided by DOC \n     and NRC, CBO estimates that the net cost of these efforts \n     would be $2 million in 2007 and $7 million over the 2007-2011 \n     period.\n       CBO expects that most facilities would cooperate with the \n     inspections and that the costs to seek and execute warrants \n     required under the bill would be insignificant. Also, based \n     on information from the State Department, CBO believes that \n     the IAEA would not be able to conduct environmental sampling \n     at government or commercial facilities because the United \n     States, as a lawful nuclear weapons state, would forbid such \n     sampling under existing treaty rights. Thus, CBO estimates \n     that the U.S. government would incur no costs related to such \n     sampling.\n       Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact: Section 4 of \n     the UMRA excludes from the application of that act any \n     legislative provisions that are necessary for the \n     ratification or implementation of international treaty \n     obligations. CBO has determined that because this bill would \n     implement the Additional Protocol, it falls within that \n     exclusion. CBO has thus not reviewed the bill for \n     intergovernmental or private sector mandates.\n       Previous CBO Estimate: On August 10, 2006, CBO transmitted \n     an estimate for S. 3709, a bill to exempt from certain \n     requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 United States \n     exports of nuclear materials, equipment, and technology to \n     India, and to implement the United States Additional \n     Protocol, as ordered reported on July 20, 2006. Title II of \n     that bill is identical to S. 2489, and the estimated costs \n     are the same in both estimates.\n       At the request of the Senate Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, CBO prepared an analysis of the costs associated \n     with ratifying the Protocol Additional to the Agreement \n     Between the United States of America and the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency Regarding Safeguards in the United \n     States (Treaty Document 107-7). In that analysis, dated March \n     5, 2004, CBO estimated that one-time costs to the U.S. \n     government for implementing the Additional Protocol would \n     total between $20 million and $30 million, and recurring \n     costs would total between $10 million and $15 million a year, \n     assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts.

In \n     addition, S. 3709 would implement the obligations of the \n     United States under the Protocol Additional to the Agreement \n     between the United States of America and the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the Application of Safeguards \n     in the United States of America (hereafter called the \n     Additional Protocol).\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 3709 would cost $17 \n     million in 2007 and $72 million over the 2007-2011 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Enacting the \n     bill would not affect direct spending or receipts.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) \n     excludes from the application of that act any legislative \n     provisions that are necessary for the ratification or \n     implementation of international treaty obligations. CBO has \n     determined that because title II of this bill would implement \n     the Additional Protocol, it falls within that exclusion. \n     Other provisions of the bill contain no intergovernmental or \n     private-sector mandates and would not affect the budgets of \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       Estimated Cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 3709 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs would fall within budget functions 050 (national \n     defense), 270 (energy), and 370 (commerce and housing \n     credit).\n\n[[Page S9892]]\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     2007         2008         2009         2010         2011\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated Authorization Level..................           23           13           13           13           13\nEstimated Outlays..............................           17           15           14           13           13\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of Estimate: CBO assumes that the bill will be \n     enacted near the start of fiscal year 2007 and that the \n     estimated amounts will be appropriated each year.\n     U.S. Additional Protocol Implementation (title II)\n       Enacting title II of S. 3709 would enable government \n     agencies to implement the Additional Protocol. Specifically, \n     the bill would: Authorize government agencies to conduct \n     vulnerability assessments at government and commercial \n     facilities, Designate government agencies to provide outreach \n     programs to the commercial facilities and to issue \n     regulations in order to implement the provisions of the \n     Additional Protocol, Authorize the federal government to seek \n     search warrants when the owner of a commercial facility \n     refuses to give consent for inspection by the IAEA, and Set \n     guidelines for the IAEA to conduct environmental sampling at \n     government and commercial facilities.\n       CBO expects that most of the assessments would be performed \n     by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of \n     Energy (DOE) at universities, fuel-fabrication plants, and \n     commercial manufacturing sites currently working on DoD \n     projects, as well as DOE labs. Although DoD and DOE already \n     have the authority to perform such assessments, CBO believes \n     that those agencies will not perform these assessments unless \n     S. 2489 is enacted. Based on information from those two \n     departments, CBO estimates that the Department of Defense \n     would conduct about 50 assessments a year, while the \n     Department of Energy would conduct about 50 assessments in \n     2007 and about 10 assessments each year thereafter, at an \n     average cost of about $200,000 per assessment. Accordingly, \n     CBO estimates that conducting vulnerability assessments would \n     cost $15 million in 2007 and $65 million over the 2007-2011 \n     period, assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts.\n       CBO expects that most of the outreach efforts would be \n     performed by the Department of Commerce (DOC). DOC is \n     developing a new database to support the reporting \n     requirements of the Additional Protocol. The department also \n     would conduct outreach, training, and inspection support \n     programs at commercial facilities. CBO anticipates that the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) staff would revise \n     regulations to include the new requirements for implementing \n     the Additional Protocol and would prepare guidance documents \n     for its commercial licensees to prepare for the IAEA \n     inspections. Under current law, 90 percent of the additional \n     costs for the NRC would be covered by fees paid by operators \n     of nuclear power plants. Based on information provided by DOC \n     and NRC, CBO estimates that the net cost of these efforts \n     would be $2 million in 2007 and $7 million over the 2007-2011 \n     period.\n       CBO expects that most facilities would cooperate with the \n     inspections and that the costs to seek and execute warrants \n     required under the bill would be insignificant. Also, based \n     on information from the State Department, CBO believes that \n     the IAEA would not be able to conduct environmental sampling \n     at government or commercial facilities because the United \n     States, as a lawful nuclear weapons state, would forbid such \n     sampling under existing treaty rights. Thus, CBO estimates \n     that the U.S. government would incur no costs related to such \n     sampling.\n     United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation (title \n         I)\n       Under title I of this bill, the United States could \n     transfer nuclear material and technology to India, subject to \n     an agreement between the two countries, if the President \n     certifies that India meets certain conditions. Those \n     conditions would require India to: Provide a credible plan to \n     separate civilian and military nuclear facilities, \n     Conclude an agreement with the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, Work actively with the United States to conclude a \n     multilateral treaty to stop the production of fissile \n     materials for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear \n     explosive devices, Support efforts of the international \n     community to prevent proliferation of nuclear enrichment \n     and reprocessing technology, and Gain the consensus \n     support of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, an organization of \n     countries with nuclear capabilities, for trade in items \n     covered by its guidelines.\n       Additionally, in the event an agreement is reached for \n     nuclear cooperation between India and the United States, the \n     bill would require the President to submit a report detailing \n     the basis for determining that India meets all the necessary \n     requirements and to inform the appropriate committees of any \n     significant nuclear activities of India. The bill also would \n     require that the agreement be approved by a joint resolution \n     of the two Houses of Congress that has been enacted into law. \n     And finally, the bill would require that the exemption from \n     current-law prohibition would cease to be effective if India \n     detonates a nuclear explosive device after the date of the \n     enactment of this bill.\n       CBO estimates that implementing title I of this bill would \n     have no significant impact on the federal budget.\n       Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact: Section 4 of \n     UMRA excludes from the application of that act any \n     legislative provisions that are necessary for the \n     ratification or implementation of international treaty \n     obligations. CBO has determined that because title II of this \n     bill would implement the Additional Protocol, it falls within \n     that exclusion. Other provisions of the bill contain no \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates and would not \n     affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On August 10, 2006, CBO transmitted \n     a cost estimate for S. 2489, the U.S. Additional Protocol \n     Implementation Act. That bill contains provisions that are \n     identical to those in title II of S. 3709, and the estimated \n     costs are the same in both estimates.\n       On July 13, 2006, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. \n     5682, the United States and India Nuclear Cooperation \n     Promotion Act of 2006, as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on International Relations on June 27, 2006. That \n     bill contains provisions that are very similar to those in \n     title I of S. 3709, and the estimated costs are the same in \n     both estimates.\n       At the request of the Senate Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, CBO prepared an analysis of the costs associated \n     with ratifying the Protocol Additional to the Agreement \n     Between the United States of America and the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency Regarding Safeguards in the United \n     States (Treaty Document 107-7). In that analysis, dated March \n     5, 2004, CBO estimated that one-time costs to the U.S. \n     government for implementing the Additional Protocol would \n     total between $20 million and $30 million, and recurring \n     costs would total between $10 million and $15 million a year, \n     assuming appropriation of the estimated amounts. Those \n     estimated costs are similar to the costs described in this \n     estimate.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Raymond J.

The authority to \n     transfer those vessels would expire two years after \n     enactment.\n       CBO estimates the specified sales would increase offsetting \n     receipts by $60 million over the 2007-2008 period. (Asset \n     sale receipts are a credit against direct spending.)\n       S. 3722 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated Cost to the Federal Government: CBO's estimate of \n     the budgetary effects of S. 3722 are shown in the following \n     table.

Mr. President, this is a historic day. Last night we \npassed S. 1035, the Code Talkers Recognition Act.\n  As my fellow Senate colleagues may know, code talkers played a unique \nrole in our battlefield successes by transmitting commands and messages \nin their native language, which, of course, completely baffled the \nenemy. I was fortunate to meet one of these heroes during a visit to \nthe Meskwaki settlement a couple years ago. Frank Sanache was modest \nand soft spoken about his heroism. But history has recorded his deeds \nin battle. And his passing was a loss to all of us who knew and \nrespected him.\n  In January of 1941, Frank and seven other Meskwaki tribal members--\nEdward Benson, Dewey Roberts, Dewey Youngbear, Mike Twin, Jude Wayne \nWabaunasee, Mike Wayne Wabaunasee, and Willard Sanache--enlisted in the \nIowa National Guard. They were recruited for code talker training, and \nserved in the 168th Infantry, 34th Division.\n  In the Second World War, communication in Native American languages \nproved to be the perfect tool for frustrating enemy eavesdropping. \nIndian languages were used to develop military codes that were \ndifficult to intercept and impossible to break. This is ironic, because \nin the years prior to the war, the Meskwaki and other tribes had been \nunder constant pressure to abandon their traditional languages and \ncultures.\n  The use of these codes is credited with saving countless lives. Until \nrecently, however, only the Navajos and the Navajo code were given \nbroad recognition and credit. But, in fact, at least 17 other tribes, \nincluding Iowa's Meskwaki, served as code talkers during the Second \nWorld War.\n  Congress has already recognized the courageous service of Navajo code \ntalkers. And by passing S. 1035, the Code Talkers Recognition Act, last \nnight, we are recognizing the service and sacrifice of all the code \ntalkers and awarding congressional commemorative medals to these \nheroes.\n  I thank Senators Frist, Shelby, and Sarbanes for allowing this \nimportant and historic legislation to move forward and the bipartisan \neffort from Senators Inhofe, Johnson, Thune, and Grassley in gaining 79 \ncosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9893-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9893-S9894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN RIPLEY FORBES\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the memory \nof an extraordinary naturalist, conservationist, educator, father, and \nhusband who devoted his life to sharing his love of nature with \ncommunities across the country. John Ripley Forbes lived in Georgia for \nover 30 years, and Georgians of all ages have been blessed by his \ndelightful approach to nature, science, and learning.\n  Mr. Forbes was born in Massachusetts in 1913. From a very early age, \nhe was fascinated during nature walks with his father and knew that he \nwanted to study nature for the rest of his life. At the age of 14, he \nbecame the protege of his neighbor, famed naturalist William Temple \nHornaday. While still in his teens, John Ripley Forbes guided visitors \nthrough his personal nature collection at the Bruce Museum of Arts and \nSciences in Greenwich, CT. After studying zoology and ornithology for a \ntime at Iowa State University and Bowdoin College, he worked as an \nornithological collector on explorer Donald Baxter MacMillan's 1937 \nexpedition to Baffin Island. Fifty years later, in 1987, Bowdoin would \naward him an honorary doctorate degree.\n  Mr. Forbes continually combined his knowledge and experience as a \nnaturalist with his enthusiastic focus on children's education. After \nHornaday's death, John established and presided over the William T. \nHornaday Foundation to underwrite children's museums around the United \nStates. The organization became one of John's legacies, the Natural \nScience for Youth Foundation. He also worked to build museums from \nNaples, FL, to Sacramento, CA. In each one, he created fascinating \nopportunities for children to experience nature whether through habitat \ntrails, wildlife preserves, or even animal lending libraries, which \nallowed children to ``check out'' small animals for a few days at a \ntime. During his years of work through the foundation and whenever \nopportunities arose, Mr. Forbes helped found and build a national \nnetwork of over 200 children's museums and nature centers where, \nfrequently, exhibits interact with visitors as much as the visitors \ninteract with them.\n  John Ripley Forbes was known for his ability to charm donations from \neven the most intimidating people. His wife explained, ``He would meet \nsome of these people like the Rockefellers, and they were just \nenchanted with his enthusiasm to do the right thing.'' He used this \ncharisma for more than contributions. Mr. Forbes served at military \nbases in Alabama and Tennessee during World War II and supported \nreturned airmen through simple fishing trips or nature walks. In his \nspare time, he would work with established natural history museums to \nfill new children's museums with thousands of donated specimens.\n  He also used his boundless energy and charm to preserve nature in its \noriginal form. Shortly after moving to Georgia in 1971, he became \nfocused on the preservation of Atlanta's shrinking natural habitats. \nMr. Forbes founded the Southeast Land Preservation Trust to shield \ngreen space from a rapidly growing real estate market and was \ndetermined to reason with developers and work out solutions that were \nmutually beneficial.\n  John Ripley Forbes exercised his passion for education and \npreservation through these many projects, and our future generations \nwill reap and enjoy the results. I am grateful to people like him who, \nwith their enthusiasm and energy, make a difference in the community \nand in the lives of others. His legacy will live for many generations \nthrough the work and accomplishments he left behind.\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\n  John Ripley Forbes is survived by his wife Margaret, his son Ernest \nRipley Forbes of Alexandria, VA, his daughter Anne Forbes Spengler of \nAtlanta, and two grandchildren.\n  I join with them and all Georgians in mourning his passing and \nremembering and appreciating the contribution he made to our \ncommunities, our State, and to the lives of the many people he \ntouched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9894-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY C.

Stratton, founder of the Women's Reserve for the Coast Guard during \nWorld War II and a strong proponent of women's education throughout her \nlifetime.\n  Dr. Stratton became the first full-time Dean of Women at Purdue \nUniversity in 1933. During her tenure at Purdue, Dr. Stratton saw the \nenrollment of women students increase from 500 to over 1,400. In \naddition, a liberal science program for women in the School of Science \nwas inaugurated, three modern residence halls for women were \nconstructed, and an employment placement center for Purdue women was \ninstituted.\n  In 1942, she was commissioned a senior lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. \nLater in 1942, she transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard where she \ncreated and became the first director of the Women's Reserve of the \nU.S. Coast Guard in World War II. Upon being named director, she was \npromoted to lieutenant commander in 1942 and advanced to commander in \nJanuary 1944 and to the grade of captain 1 month later. She was awarded \nthe Legion of Merit medal for her contributions to women in the \nmilitary upon retirement in 1946.\n  Dr. Stratton then became the first director of personnel at the \nInternational Monetary Fund followed by service as executive director \nof the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that \ntoday I honor the past and recent success of a great agribusiness in my \nhome State of Georgia, Patten Seed Company. Patten Seed Company was \nrecently named the 2006 Agribusiness of the Year by South Georgia \nBusiness magazine for its continued success in the agribusiness \ncommunity.\n  The lasting success of Patten Seed Company was also recognized when \nthe company received the Cox Century Award. Representatives of the Cox \nFamily Enterprise Center at the Coles College of Business at Kennesaw \nState University present the Cox Century Award to Georgia businesses \nbased on their commitments to business and family, contributions to \ntheir industry and community, multigenerational family involvement, and \ninnovative business practices and strategies.\n  The history of the Patten Seed Company dates back to 1893 when R.L. \nPatten and his brother W.F. Patten opened a general store in Lakeland, \nGA. After much success with the general store, Lawson Patten, R.L's \nson, began to operate a seed cleaning business out of one of his \nfather's warehouses in 1947. In 1954, Patten Seed Company was \nincorporated and over the last 52 years has become a household name in \nthe turfgrass, sod, and seed industry.\n  Patten Seed Company's expansive operation covers 25 facilities across \nfour States and has over 15,000 acres of grass seed and sod farm land \nin the Southeast. Sod from Patten Seed Company can be found in many \nplaces, from small South Georgia lawns to the Atlantis Resort in the \nBahamas.\n  I am sincerely proud of the recognition that has been accorded to \nPatten Seed Company. Lakeland, GA, where Patten Seed Company \noriginated, is not too far from my hometown of Moultrie. I see signs \nfor one of Patten Seed Company's subsidiaries, SuperSod, whenever I \ndrive north or south on Interstate 75.\n  The success of agribusinesses like Patten Seed Company, which \noperates not only in Georgia but throughout the Southeast, is \nnewsworthy. I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to \nrecognize this great agribusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9894-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9894-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9894-5", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM THAT WAS \n   ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2006--PM 56\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to \ncommit, or support terrorism is to continue in effect beyond September \n23, 2006. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on September 22, 2005 (70 FR 55703).\n  The crisis constituted by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of \nterrorism committed by foreign terrorists, including the terrorist \nattacks in New York, in Pennsylvania, and against the Pentagon of \nSeptember 11, 2001, and the continuing and immediate threat of further \nattacks on United States nationals or the United States that led to the \ndeclaration of a national emergency on September 23, 2001, has not been \nresolved. These actions pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the \nUnited States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \npersons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism, and \nmaintain in force the comprehensive sanctions to respond to this \nthreat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to assist small business concerns in complying with \nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in order for the United States to continue \nto stand for the fairest, most transparent and efficient financial \nmarkets in the world, I believe we must provide assistance to America's \nsmall public companies in their efforts to comply with the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act.\n  Just a few years ago, the trust and confidence of the American people \nin their financial markets was dangerously eroded by the emergence of \nserious accounting irregularities by some companies and possible \nfraudulent actions by corporations like WorldCom, Inc., Enron, Arthur \nAndersen and others. The shocking malfeasance by these businesses and \naccounting firms put a strain on the growth of our economy. The \nmisconduct by a few senior executives has cost the jobs of thousands of \nhard-working Americans. The lack of faith in our financial markets \ncontributed to an overall decline in stock values and has caused grave \nlosses to individual investors and pension funds.\n  By all accounts, Sarbanes-Oxley has been effective in bringing \naccountability to corporate governance, auditing, and financial \nreporting for public companies. The dark days of the Enron scandal have \ngiven way to a new corporate culture that embraces responsibility and \ntransparency, and for this we have Sarbanes-Oxley to thank. Sarbanes-\nOxley has helped restore confidence in our capital markets and helped \nimprove our nation's future economic growth.\n  However, with compliance also comes cost. And while the cost of \ncomplying with the law is small enough to be absorbed by larger \ncorporations, smaller public companies, particularly small minority \npublic companies, have been disproportionately affected by these costs. \nSmall business is the engine of economic growth in our Nation. Almost \n60 percent of Americans are employed by small businesses. Small \nbusiness growth has been critical in developing the high wage jobs for \nAmerica's future.\n  Unfortunately, an April 2006 report to the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship by the United States Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) found that small public firms are incurring \nmuch higher audit fees and increased costs in complying with the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act.\n  The report finds that of the 2,263 public firms with market \ncapitalization of less than $75 million, just 66 have fully implemented \nSection 404 of the law that requires firms to construct formal internal \ncontrol frameworks and filed internal control reports. These 66 firms \nreported paying $1.14 in audit fees per $100 of revenue, compared to \njust $.13 per $100 for firms with greater than $1 billion in market \ncapitalization. I believe we must take action to help small\n\n[[Page S9899]]\n\ncompanies comply with the regulatory burdens of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n  In addition to the costs associated with internal controls, 81 \npercent of small firms responding to the GAO survey said they brought \nin outside consultants to comply with the Act. Nearly half of the small \nfirms reported ``opportunity costs'' related to complying with the \nregulatory burden placed on them by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act such as \ndeferring or canceling operational improvements, and more than one-\nthird of respondents were forced to defer or cancel information \ntechnology investments. Too many small firms simply do not have the \nresources and expertise necessary to implement the formal internal \ncontrol frameworks required by Section 404, and as a result, they are \ndisadvantaged compared to larger firms that are absorbing these costs.\n  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has provided a lengthy \ncompliance period for small businesses to comply with the Sarbanes-\nOxley regulations and is attempting to develop additional methods to \nease the regulatory burden. However, I believe additional efforts are \nneeded.\n  In order to assist these firms with the increased costs of \nimplementation and help our small businesses keep our economy moving \nforward, I am introducing the Small Business Sarbanes-Oxley Compliance \nAssistance Act of 2006. The bill would authorize the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration to award grants to small public companies and \nsmall business concerns to help lessen the burden of these costs. If \nCongress is asking these small firms to bear the burden of cost for \ncompliance with Sarbanes-Oxley, the least we can do is chip in and help \npay for it. My legislation authorizes $5 million to be awarded annually \nthrough 2011.\n  My legislation also creates a task force, assembled by the SBA Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy, and comprising of representatives from the SEC \nand other appropriate bank regulatory agencies, to report semi-annually \non how to assist small public companies in complying with Sarbanes-\nOxley. My hope is that this task force will continually find new ways \nto lift the regulatory burden on small businesses attempting to comply \nwith the law. Each report of the task force will be required to \nevaluate upgrades or alternatives to the SEC's Electronic Data \nGathering Analysis Retrieval System so that companies might submit \nfilings to the SEC without the need for third party intervention. The \ntask force will also report on the potential to reduce inefficiencies \nrelated to SEC filings; the feasibility of synchronizing filing \nrequirements for substantially similar small firms; whether the SEC and \nbank regulatory agencies should commit additional resources to aiding \nsmall public firms with filing requirements; whether the SEC needs to \npublish guidance on reporting and legal requirements aimed at assisting \nsmaller public firms; and the feasibility of extending incorporation by \nreference privileges to other Government filings containing equivalent \ninformation.\n  This legislation will help some but not all of the thousands of small \nfirms that are public or hope to become public. As more information \nbecomes available, I am hopeful that the task force will provide ideas \non how the SEC can help more of the small, non-accelerated filers \nimplement the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations. We must do all we can to \ninsure that small firms can demonstrate that transparency and \naccountability in the private sector is thriving without having to \nincur such a burdensome cost. This legislation is supported by the \nNational Black Chamber of Commerce as well as Small Business Majority. \nI ask all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 3920. A bill to amend part B of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to assure access to durable medical equipment under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nMedicare Durable Medical Equipment Access Act with my colleague Senator \nKent Conrad of North Dakota. This bill makes several modest changes to \nthe competitive acquisition process for this equipment.\n  In 2007, a competitive acquisition program will replace the current \nreimbursement policy for durable medical equipment in Medicare. This \nshift toward a market-based approach to payments for durable medical \nequipment was mandated through the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of \n2003.\n  Our bill was written with two key goals in mind. The Medicare Durable \nMedical Equipment Access Act would preserve access to home medical \nequipment in rural areas for older or disabled Americans who need this \nequipment. In addition, the bill will allow small businesses that \nprovide homecare equipment to continue to participate in the Medicare \nProgram if they qualify and meet the competitively bid price.\n  Our legislation is identical to H.R. 3559 which was introduced \nearlier this Congress by Congressmen David Hobson and John Tanner. That \nbill has broad, bipartisan support and 132 House cosponsors.\n  As background, section 302(b)(I) of the MMA requires Medicare to \nreplace the current durable medical equipment payment methodology for \ncertain items with a competitive acquisition process beginning in 2007 \nin 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).\n  The Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Access Act would require \nseveral modest changes to the competitive acquisition program.\n  First, the MMA requires the Secretary to include quality standards in \nthe competitive acquisition process and also allows the Secretary to \nwaive the application of quality standards if applying the standards \nwould delay implementation of the process. However, quality standards \nare essential to ensuring that beneficiaries are not forced to use the \nlowest-cost provider without consideration of the quality of the \nmedical equipment items provided. This bill would require the Secretary \nto include quality standards before implementing competitive \nacquisition.\n  Second, the MMA allows the Secretary to exempt rural areas and urban \nareas with low population density to ensure that competitive \nacquisition is not implemented in areas that lack the health care \ninfrastructure to support it. This bill would require the Secretary to \nexempt MSAs with fewer than 500,000 people.\n  Third, the MMA created a Program Advisory and Oversight Committee \ncomposed of stakeholders to advise the Secretary on the implementation \nof competitive acquisition. However, the MMA does not apply the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act (FACA) to it. The purpose of FACA is to ensure \nthat advice rendered to the executive branch by advisory committees be \nboth objective and accessible to the public. This bill would apply FACA \nto this oversight committee.\n  Fourth, the MMA allows the Secretary to contract with only as many \nproviders as the Secretary deems necessary to meet the demand of an \narea. Any provider not awarded a contract would be prohibited from \nparticipating in Medicare for up to 3 years. This bill would allow \napplicable small businesses that did not receive a contract to continue \nto provide durable medical equipment in Medicare at the competitive \nacquisition bid rate.\n  Fifth, the MMA explicitly prohibited administrative or judicial \nreview for competitive acquisition of DME. This means that providers do \nnot have legal recourse to appeal the bid amount or contracts. My bill \nwould restore appeal rights for competitive acquisition of DME. These \nrights exist elsewhere in the Medicare program.\n  Sixth, under the MMA, the Secretary can only competitively acquire an \nitem if the Secretary believes that doing so would result in \nsignificant savings to Medicare. It is important for the Secretary to \nshow that the savings from competitive acquisition justify constructing \na bureaucracy to implement the program. To that end, this bill would \nrequire the Secretary to show that competitive acquisition would result \nin savings of at least 10 percent.\n  Finally, under the MMA, the Secretary can use competitive acquisition \nbid rates in one MSA to set the reimbursement for another MSA. Our bill \nwould require that, before doing so, the Secretary conduct a \ncomparability analysis of the two MSAs. This will help prevent any \napplications of bid rates outside of an MSA that are inappropriate.\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\n  The new, market-based competitive acquisition program in Medicare is \ndesigned to save money and make Medicare more efficient. In order to \nachieve this goal, we need to preserve access to care and preserve the \ncost-effective health care infrastructure that homecare represents. \nThis bill will help ensure that the market reforms enacted by the MMA \naccomplish both cost savings and continued access to cost-effective \ncare.\n  Before I close, I would like to give a real life example from my home \nstate of Utah on why this legislation is needed and necessary. A small \nprovider of durable medical equipment in Utah approached me about how \ncurrent law will impact him. This company was established in 1997 with \njust one employee. It has grown over the years by providing its \ncustomers the products that they need to stay at home and out of the \nhospitals.\n  When competitive bidding hits the State of Utah in 2007, this small \ncompany will be forced to bid against large national companies. Much \nlarger companies compete with the smaller ones to provide medical \nequipment such as wheelchairs, in home hospital beds, and home oxygen. \nIf my Utah company loses the bid, it will go out of business, as will \nmany of its smaller competitors in Utah. This company prides itself on \nbeing able to provide customers with a high quality of service. The \nowner of the company has asked me how he can continue to provide great \nservice when his company has been forced to bid to the lowest price \npossible just to keep from going out of business.\n  Therefore, this legislation means a lot to small companies not just \nin Utah, but all over the country, by allowing them to continue to \nprovide medical equipment to those who need it.\n  I heard from several small medical equipment companies in my home \nState of Utah for several years on this issue and they made very \nconvincing arguments. That is why I am introducing the Medicare Durable \nMedical Equipment Access Act. I strongly urge my colleagues to talk to \ntheir constituents back home who own small durable medical equipment \ncompanies. I am certain that these companies are experiencing concerns \nsimilar to those shared with me.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation so that Medicare \nbeneficiaries will continue to receive quality care at affordable \nprices for their medical supplies.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Hatch, in introducing the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment \n(DME) Access Act. This bill responds to the concerns I heard from \nseniors and suppliers in North Dakota about the negative impact \ncompetitive bidding could have on the ability of DME suppliers in rural \nStates to remain viable. The bill we introduce today is designed to \npreserve access to DME in rural areas.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) required Medicare to replace the \ncurrent DME payment methodology for certain items with a competitive \nacquisition process beginning in 2007 in 10 of the largest metropolitan \nstatistical areas (MSAs). The Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Access \nAct would require several modest changes to the competitive acquisition \nprogram to help preserve access to medical equipment in rural areas.\n  First, our bill would build upon language in the MMA that allows the \nSecretary to exempt rural areas to prevent these beneficiaries from \nlosing access to needed medical equipment. Specifically, it would \nrequire the Secretary to exempt MSAs with fewer than 500,000 people.\n  Second, the MMA allows the Secretary to waive the application of \nquality standards in the competitive acquisition process if applying \nthe standards would delay implementation. Our bill would ensure that \nquality standards are included when determining the winning bid to \nensure that patients receive both high-quality and low-cost equipment.\n  Third, in creating the competitive acquisition program, the Secretary \nmay contract with only as many providers as deemed necessary to meet \ndemand in an area. Any provider not awarded a contract would be \nprohibited from participating in Medicare for up to three years. This \nbill would allow certain small businesses to continue providing DME in \nMedicare at the competitive acquisition bid rate, allowing them to \noffer in-person care to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Fourth, under the MMA, the Secretary can use competitive acquisition \nbid rates in one MSA to set the reimbursement for another MSA. Our bill \nwould require that the Secretary compare the two to ensure that the bid \nrates aren't inappropriately applied.\n  Finally, the Medicare Durable Medical Equipment Access Act would take \nadditional steps to ensure that competitive acquisition results in \nsavings, that providers have access to administrative and judicial \nreview, and that any meetings of the newly created CMS Program Advisory \nand Oversight Committee on competitive bidding be open to the public.\n  These provisions are small steps, but they will ensure that \nbeneficiaries in rural areas have access to the medical equipment they \nneed. While we should pursue options for making the Medicare program \nmore efficient, we must also protect access to care. I believe this \nbill achieves the appropriate balance between these two goals. I urge \nall of my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3921. A bill to modify the calculation of back pay for persons who \nwere approved for promotion as members of the Navy and Marine Corps \nwhile interned as prisoners of war during World War II to take into \naccount changes in the Consumer Price Index; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the World War II \nPOW Pay Equity Act of 2006. This legislation would ensure that former \nWorld War II Prisoners of War, or their surviving spouses, receive the \nappropriate back pay for their honorable service, adjusted for \ninflation.\n  Due to a technicality, Navy and Marine Corps POWs during World War II \nwere denied promotions while they were interned. The Fiscal Year 2001 \nNational Defense Authorization Act included provisions to correct this \ninjustice. Unfortunately, this legislation did not specify an \nadjustment for inflation. The result was that these heroes of our \n``greatest generation'' were paid in 1942 dollars which roughly equated \nto ten cents on the current dollar. It is well past time to properly \ncompensate them for their dedicated service.\n  When our great Nation called upon these brave individuals, they \nanswered the call. Now they need our help to fix a technicality that \nhas denied them the full amount of the back-pay they are due, pay that \nwas earned in the harshest of environments. Many of these WWII veterans \nsuffer from extreme financial distress. The total number of surviving \nWWII POWs is now less than 1,000, and there are approximately 400 \nsurviving spouses. We cannot abandon those who were truly responsible \nfor defending the liberties we hold so dear. It would be shameful for \nCongress and our Nation not to compensate fairly these veterans, as \nthis is a debt that our country incurred during their internment as \nPOWs.\n  The impact of this legislation goes well beyond those who have so \nbravely gone before us in defense of our Nation. This is a readiness \nissue as well. Today's service members are acutely aware of the manner \nin which our Nation honors its veterans. President George Washington \nreminded all of his fellow Americans of the keen relationship between \nour Nation's veterans and those on active duty when he said, ``The \nwillingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, \nno matter how justified, shall be directly proportional as to how they \nperceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by \ntheir country.'' That statement holds just as true today as it did over \n200 years ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 3922. A bill to clarify the status of the Young Woman's Christian \nAssociation Retirement Fund as a defined contribution plan for certain \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nclarify the legal status of the Young Women's Christian Association's \nRetirement Fund.\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\n  The YWCA Retirement Fund is one of the oldest pension plans serving \nthe retirement needs of women. This bill will help protect the \nretirement security of thousands of YWCA employees nationwide who serve \nwell over a million users.\n  Whether it is providing day care for working mothers, keeping a \nbattered women's shelter open, or meeting the other pressing needs of \nwomen in our communities, the YWCA has a long tradition of service. \nThose who work at our local YWCAs deserve to know that their retirement \nplan is secure.\n  Today, the YWCA Retirement Fund is a unique pension program. First, \napproximately 90 percent of its participants are women. Second, it is a \nmultiple employer pension plan--one that relies on 300 local YWCAs to \nmake funding contributions. And lastly, since it was established in \n1924, the pension plan's structure has remained generally unchanged--it \nis partially a defined benefit plan, and partially a defined \ncontribution plan.\n  Recently, some employers have transformed their traditional defined \nbenefit pension plans into various types of ``hybrid'' plans, and in \nthe process, some have reduced the rate at which benefits accrue for \ntheir older workers. Older workers have successfully challenged some of \nthese arrangements as age discriminatory. During its more than 80-year \nhistory, the YWCA Retirement Fund has never treated any worker \ndifferently based on age or longevity of employment. Most of the \ncontroversy surrounding these plans focuses on how employers treat \ncertain participants when they convert their pre-existing pension \nplans. But the YWCA pension program never converted--its basic \nstructure has remained the same since it was established 1924.\n  The success of some of these lawsuits has raised questions about \nwhether the YWCA pension plan could be found to be age discriminatory \nmerely on the basis of its design. This threat is particularly acute \ngiven the fact that the YWCA Retirement Fund is a multiple employer \npension plan--a plan that relies on contributions from each local YWCA. \nThis enormous potential liability would be shared jointly by all local \nYWCAs. Under current law, even the mere threat of lawsuit could cause \nlocal YWCAs to end their participation in this plan.\n  If enacted, this legislation would merely classify the YWCA \nretirement plan as a defined contribution plan only for the purpose of \ntesting for age discrimination--it would continue to protect \nparticipants from being treated differently on the basis of age while \neliminating the potential crippling legal threat.\n  Legislation was enacted in 2004--Public Law 108-476--to clarify the \nlegal status of the YMCA pension plan, a plan that is similar to the \nYWCA plan. Congress was right to protect the YMCA pension plan then and \nnow it is time to protect the pension plan serving our YWCAs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``YWCA Retirement Plan \n     Preservation Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF AGE DISCRIMINATION RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A pension plan described in subsection (b) \n     shall be treated as a defined contribution plan for purposes \n     of sections 204(b)(1)(H) and 204(b)(2) of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \n     1054(b)(1)(H) and 1054(b)(2)) and section 4(i)(1) of the Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. \n     623(i)(1)).\n       (b) Pension Plan Described.--A pension plan described in \n     this subsection is the plan subject to title IV of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 maintained by \n     the Young Women's Christian Association Retirement Fund, a \n     corporation created by an Act of the State of New York which \n     became law on April 12, 1924.\n       (c) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall apply in the case \n     of any civil action brought on or after September 21, 2006, \n     alleging a violation occurring before June 29, 2005, of \n     section 204(b)(1)(H) of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1054(b)(1)(H)), section \n     4(i)(1) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 \n     (29 U.S.C. 623(i)(1)), or both, with respect to the plan \n     described in subsection (b).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3923. A bill to establish a pilot program in certain United States \ndistrict courts to encourage enhancement of expertise in patent cases \namong district judges; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce with Senator \nFeinstein legislation to establish a pilot program that is intended to \nenhance the level of expertise in patent cases among United States \ndistrict court judges. In conversations with a number of constituents \nand both small and large companies in my home State of Utah, I have \nfound that one of the frequent complaints by those who had been \ninvolved in patent litigation was that many district court judges had \nrelatively little expertise in patent law, and--partially as a result--\nthe decisions of trial courts are often overturned on appeal due to \ntechnical errors in construing patent claims. Obviously, this is \nfrustrating for litigants, because it prolongs the uncertainty they \nexperience and makes an expensive appeal of the trial court's decision \nmuch more likely. This bill seeks to address that problem by providing \na way to increase the level of expertise among district court judges in \npatent cases.\n  The core provisions of this bill authorize a pilot project in at \nleast five judicial districts that have a significant patent litigation \ncaseload. Under the pilot program, judges in these districts will be \nallowed to form a smaller pool of judges who are willing to accept a \nlarger portion of the patent litigation docket in the district. The \nbill also authorizes additional resources to allow participating courts \nto hire law clerks with expertise in patent law and to provide for \neducational programs relating to patent law for the participating \njudges. It is our intention that this program will allow these judges \nto acquire greater experience in handling patent trials, decrease the \namount of time that patent cases take to resolve, and reduce reversals \non appeal by enhancing the level of experience and expertise of judges \nand law clerks handling these cases. The project is authorized for at \nleast five judicial districts, to be designated by the Administrative \nOffice of the United States Courts, and will last for a 10 year period.\n  The bill also requires Administrative Office of the United States \nCourts and the Federal Judicial Center to provide a report to Congress \non the results of the pilot program, along with additional information \nthat will allow Congress to determine whether this approach has had the \nbeneficial effects that we anticipate.\n  Those who are following the patent debates in Congress closely will \nnotice that this bill is very similar to a bill introduced in the House \nby Representatives Issa and Schiff, and I would like to acknowledge \ntheir work on this issue, as well as the work of other members of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, \nand Intellectual Property. I would also like to thank my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, for her interest in this issue and for \nher willingness to cosponsor this bill.\n  I should also note that further refinements to this language will \nlikely be necessary as it moves through the legislative process. In \nparticular, we need to include a provision which would preserve a \nsufficient element of random assignment among judges. I understand some \nof my Senate colleagues have reservations about including this \nprovision, but we will deal with that issue as the bill progresses.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join Senator Feinstein and me \nby supporting this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 3924. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nallow qualifying States to use all or any portion of their allotments \nunder the State Children's Health Insurance Program for certain \nMedicaid expenditures; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children's\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\nHealth Protection and Eligibility Act of 2006. I am delighted to have \nSenator Murray, Bingaman, and Mikulski introduce this bill with me \ntoday.\n  As health insurance costs continue to rise and the number of \nemployers that offer health coverage to their employees decline, our \nsafety net programs are all the more critical, especially for the \nhealth of our children. It is more important than ever to sustain \nexisting health care coverage for our children--and, in fact, to expand \nit. It's the best way to reduce costs and improve access. It's about \nkeeping children healthy.\n  New Census data released last month showed that the number of \nuninsured has grown from 41.2 million in 2001 to 46.6 million in 2005. \nThese are largely working families--the number of fulltime workers \nwithout any insurance increased to 17.7 percent in 2005 from 16.8 \npercent in 2002.\n  In Washington, our Medicaid program is currently providing coverage \nfor more than 500,000 children. Our State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram is providing coverage to another 11,000 children. But 100,000 \nof our kids in Washington State remain uninsured even though they are \neligible for one of the public programs.\n  One barrier to expanding kids' access to health care in Washington is \nthe funding rules that were put into place when SCHIP was enacted in \n1997. In short, our state has been punished for its early innovation \nfor doing the right thing.\n  When SCHIP was enacted at the Federal level in 1997, Washington was \none of only four States already providing health coverage for children \nat the level Federal lawmakers wanted SCHIP to reach. Under the \noriginal Federal rules, Washington was not allowed to use new funds to \npay for children who were covered prior to SCHIP's implementation.\n  As a result, we have been penalized and prevented from fully using \nour share of the funding. That is why in 2002 I worked to ensure a \ntemporary fix to the funding inequity and I have been fighting to make \nthis fix permanent ever since. And as a result of these temporary \nfixes, Washington has been able to extend coverage to an additional \n60,000 children and reinvest $47.3 million in children's health safety \nnet programs.\n  Despite this success, the State has still been forced to return over \npercent of its share of Federal funding. Over the first decade of the \nSCHIP program, Washington is expected to return $191 million in Federal \nfunds.\n  Let me say that again: we're returning millions of dollars to the \nFederal Government and we still have 100,000 uninsured children in our \nState--the majority of whom are eligible for these public programs.\n  It's unacceptable and it runs contrary to the central goal of the \nSCHIP program. We need a permanent solution once and for all so that \nWashington and the other States that expanded eligibility in their \nMedicaid programs before the enactment of SCHIP in 1997 are no longer \npenalized for their early innovation and their commitment to the health \nof children.\n  This is why we are introducing the Children's Health Protection and \nEligibility Act of 2006.\n  This legislation will give states the ability to use SCHIP funds more \nefficiently to prevent the loss of health care coverage for children. \nStates that have made a commitment to insuring children could use their \nentire SCHIP funds allotment to maintain access to health care coverage \nfor all low-income children in the state. The bill also ensures that \nall of the qualifying States that have demonstrated a commitment to \nproviding health care coverage to children can access SCHIP funds in \nthe same manner to support children's health care coverage. Finally, \nthis bill allows States that have expanded coverage to the highest \neligibility levels allowed under SCHIP, and meet certain requirements, \nto receive the enhanced SCHIP match rate for any kids that had \npreviously been covered above the mandatory level.\n  The requirements are best practices that have been tested and proven \nall across our Nation: a simplified application process, twelve-month \ncontinuous eligibility and easy access to enrollment staff are just a \nfew of the examples of actions that we have taken in Washington that \nare proven to work. They result in more children having coverage and \naccessing appropriate care. Many of our States are working to make the \nprogram easier for children and families to navigate and now Congress \nneeds to make it easier for all States to access their SCHIP allotment \nin order to expand and improve coverage to our youngest citizens.\n  Children are the leaders of tomorrow; they are the very future of our \ngreat Nation. We owe them nothing less than the sum of our energies, \nour talents, and our efforts in providing them a foundation on which to \nbuild happy, healthy and productive lives. With the rising number of \nuninsured and the ever-increasing healthcare costs, it is more \nimportant than ever to maintain existing health care coverage for \nchildren in order to hold down health care costs and to keep children \nhealthy. Removing barriers for innovative states and allowing them to \nfully access their SCHIP allocation is a major step in achieving this \ngoal. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3924\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide certain authorities for the Secretary of \nState and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and for other purposes; \nread the first time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today at the \nrequest of the executive branch and will be seeking unanimous consent \nto request its passage as soon as possible. The Foreign Affairs \nManagement Authorities Act of 2006 contains provisions requested by the \nState Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors that will \nenable the two agencies to carry out their work more efficiently and \neffectively.\n  Title I of this bill creates a new pay for performance system for \nForeign Service officers with the rank of 01 and below and creates a \nuniform worldwide pay scale. The American Foreign Service Association \nsupports these. I am including a letter from Anthony Holmes, the AFSA \nPresident.\n  The Senior Foreign Service already participates in a pay for \nperformance plan as mandated in previously enacted law, Section \n412(a)(2) PL108-447, Div. B. The legislation replaces ``within grade \nincreases'' with a requirement that, upon the introduction of the new \nForeign Service Schedule in April 2008, any further adjustments in pay \nare tied to individual performance rather than longevity of service. It \ndirects the Secretary of State to pay to each member of the Service an \nadjustment taking into account ``individual performance, contribution \nto the mission of the Department, or both, under a rigorous performance \nmanagement system that makes meaningful distinctions based on relative \nperformance and that clearly links individual pay and performance under \nprecepts prescribed by the Secretary.'' Each Secretary/head of agency \nutilizing the Foreign Service personnel system may implement this \nsection in a manner most suitable to the unique circumstances of his or \nher agency. Poor performers would get no increase in pay. As with the \nSenior Foreign Service, the pay for performance planned for the Foreign \nService would utilize multiple levels of performance distinctions. \nPerformance-based adjustments normally would be made only once in any \n12-month period.\n  Title I also provides a number of employee protections. It \nspecifically guarantees a minimum funding pool for performance-based \npay adjustments to ensure that, in the aggregate, employees are not \ndisadvantaged by conversion to the new pay system. It authorizes \nselection boards to rank order employees for the purpose of \nrecommending pay for performance salary adjustments, and requires \nagencies that use selection boards for pay for performance to follow \nthe selection board rankings in allocating salary increases, except in \nspecial circumstances. The legislation does not impact the negotiation \nof procedures and appropriate arrangements for adversely affected \nemployees with the employees' representative, the American Foreign \nService Association, AFSA.\n  Title I provides transitional authorities to the Secretary of State \nfor use during the interim period before April 2008 when the new \nForeign Service Schedule is established. It contains provisions that \ngovern the conversion of employees to the new schedule and it provides \nfor a one-year transition period from the current 14-step system. It \nalso gives the Secretary authority to establish transitional rules that \nprevent a reduction in a member's rate of pay by reason of conversion \nto the new system, among other measures that are to be applied to \nprovide for a smooth transition.\n  In a long needed reform, Title I also provides uniform compensation \nfor worldwide service by April 2008. It eliminates the disparity in pay \nbetween those serving in Washington, DC, and other domestic posts who \nreceive locality pay increases and those serving overseas who do not. \nThe discrepancy has skewed incentives to serve overseas and is \ninconsistent with mandatory worldwide and rotational assignment \nrequirements. The Department estimates the cost of its three-stage \ntransition to the new pay system to be $32 million in its 2007 budget, \n$64 million in 2008, and $32 million in 2009. The legislation provides \nfor pay conversion and establishes temporary rules for the period \nleading up to April 2008 as the transition takes place.\n  As Secretary Rice works to fill difficult posts around the world, \nincluding in Iraq and Afghanistan, and as our diplomats come \nincreasingly under fire in tough places, it is common sense to \nrestructure a pay system that, without reform, provides disincentives \nto serving overseas. The Foreign Service must know that our country \nstands behind them, appreciates their service, and is grateful for the \ncontributions they make to the security of our country and the well-\nbeing of our citizens.\n  Title II contains a number of provisions that are contained in S.600, \nstill being held on the Senate calendar. It also contains provisions \nthat were requested by the executive branch subsequent to the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee's passage of S. 600. The provisions in \nTitle II of this legislation are as follows:\n  Section 201. Education allowances modifies current law to: 1. permit \npayment of certain fees required by overseas schools for successful \ncompletion of a course or grade; 2. allow for travel to the United \nStates for children in kindergarten through 12th grade when schools at \npost are not adequate; 3. allow for education travel to a school \noutside the United States for children at the secondary and college \nlevel; 4. provide for educational travel at the graduate level for \nchildren who are still dependents (students older than 22 would be \nineligible for such travel); and 5. allow the option of storing a \nchild's personal effects near the school during their trip to post, \nrather than transporting the effects back and forth.\n  Section 202. Fraud Prevention and Detection Account broadens the \nSecretary of State's authority to use a portion of fees collected for \nH-1B, H-2B and L-1 visas to investigate fraud in other visa categories, \nincluding fraud in connection with terrorist activities. Allowing an \nexpanded use of the funds will assist the Department in developing a \nsystem that concentrates on H and L visa fraud, but will potentially \nreduce fraud among all visa classifications and increase the U.S. \nability to disrupt terrorist travel.\n  Section 203. Extension of Privileges and Immunities extends \ndiplomatic privileges and immunities to the African Union Mission to \nthe United States and to the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy \nSee, and to members of both of these missions.\n  Section 204. International Litigation Fund allows the Department to \nretain awards of costs and attorneys' fees when defending against \ninternational claims in addition to amounts currently allowed to be \nretained when it successfully prosecutes a claim.\n  Section 205. Personal Services Contracting; BBG, the legislation \nextends for one year a pilot program allowing the BBG to hire 60 U.S. \ncitizens or foreign nationals on contract rather than as full-time \ngovernment employees. Such authority gives the BBG the flexibility to \nhire, for the short or medium-term, broadcasters and on-air hosts in \ndifficult languages, some with many dialects. The BBG uses the \nauthority, for example, for surge capacity in Urdu and Arabic.\n  Inspector General, this section also establishes a limited authority \nfor the State Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) to \nhire personal service contractors (PSCs) to augment its ability to \nconduct oversight of programs and operations related to Afghanistan and \nIraq. No more than 20 PSCs may be hired at any one time and, absent \nexceptional circumstances, the contract length for each PSC may not \nexceed two years. The Inspector General anticipates a need for \nadditional staff once the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nReconstruction's (SIGIR's) portfolio is either partially or fully \ntransferred to the State Department. The OIG also expects an increase \nin short-term staffing needs to\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\ncarry out oversight responsibilities related to Afghanistan.\n  Section 206. Facilitating Service in Iraq and Afghanistan is a \ntechnical correction to an inadvertent drafting error in section \n1602(a) of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, \nthe Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006 (P.L. 109-234). \nThe intent behind section 1602(a) was to provide the Secretary of State \nwith additional authority to waive annuity limitations on reemployed \nForeign Service annuitants to support U.S. efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. As enacted, however, section 1602(a) has the unintended \neffect of cutting back significantly on the Secretary of State's pre-\nexisting authority to waive Foreign Service annuity limitations in an \nemergency involving a direct threat to life or property or other \nunusual circumstances, without regard to geographic location. This \ntechnical correction restores the Secretary's pre-existing authority \nand provides the intended additional authorities with respect to Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  Section 207. Discontinuance of Duplicative or Obsolete Reports \ndiscontinues a number of reports that have been overtaken by events or \ncontain material that is covered in other executive branch submissions \nto the Congress.\n  I ask my colleagues to give favorable and speedy consideration to \nthis measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  American Foreign\n\n\n                                          Service Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2006.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lugar: On behalf of the 14,000 members of the \n     American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), please accept \n     out sincere appreciation for your leadership during the 109th \n     Session on a number of fronts of vital importance to our \n     members and to the United States. In particular, AFSA is \n     grateful for your determination to address the existing pay \n     disparity between Washington-based Foreign Service personnel \n     and those on assignment overseas. As you know, this pay \n     equity issue has been our highest priority for many years.\n       I want you to know the great importance that AFSA attaches \n     to passing legislation this year that will make the changes \n     necessary to the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to permit a \n     unified worldwide pay schedule. We realize that there are \n     many issues that you and your colleagues are currently \n     grappling with and will try to get passed before the mid-term \n     election recess next week. Our great fear, one that we hope \n     you can help us avoid, is that our modest bill, so important \n     to our members, will be shunted aside with the \n     rationalization that it can always be taken up again later. \n     Mr. Chairman, we are afraid that your colleagues are in \n     danger of missing an exceptional, perhaps unique, opportunity \n     to resolve this pay equity issue and to guarantee a win/win \n     outcome for all concerned by creating a model pay-for-\n     performance personnel system for the Foreign Service that \n     will be a shining example for the rest of the federal \n     government.\n       The current inequity is profoundly unfair and undermines \n     the moral of our Country's diplomatic corps. The U.S. Foreign \n     Service must have all the tools it needs to implement our \n     diplomatic and national security priorities around the globe, \n     often under extremely challenging circumstances. One vital \n     tool our nation can provide the men and women of the Foreign \n     Service and their families is the validation of their \n     essential efforts abroad that ending this pay disparity would \n     provide. With the increasing difficulty of service overseas \n     and continuing threats against American officials abroad, \n     this measure would be the single most important morale \n     booster that the Congress could provide, Conversely, a lack \n     of immediate action on the proposed legislation would be a \n     profound disappointment to our members.\n       Mr, Chairman, I know that you fully understand that Foreign \n     Service members should not be penalized for serving abroad \n     with a 17.5 percent pay cut. That simply isn't right. It is \n     our sincere hope that you can persuade Congress to act on \n     this issue now or a crucial opportunity will be lost.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership. AFSA is most grateful \n     for your support and friendship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                J. Anthony Holmes,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 3926. A bill to provide for the energy, economic, and national \nsecurity of America, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I gave a speech a couple weeks ago about \nthe situation in the Middle East. I want to just do a reprise of that \nin brief to discuss the context of introducing today what we call the \nEmpower America: Securing America's Energy Future Act.\n  It comes from the basis that I believe we are facing in this \ncountry--a threat. We are, in my opinion, already in the very early \nstages of a world war. We can act now to make this threat--which I \nbelieve is a serious one but not yet fully actualized--less severe if \nwe do certain things. One of them, as you will hear at the conclusion \nof my remarks, will be focusing on our energy situation here at home.\n  One of the things I hear as a frustration of so many people I talk to \nin Pennsylvania is they look at the conflicts we are in in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and other places in the world, and they don't see an end or a \nstrategy of how we succeed. I suggest that part of that strategy is in \ncreating energy security and developing a whole host of energy \nresources in this country so that we are not dependent upon--or as \ndependent upon foreign sources of energy and that we develop the new \ntechnologies that will allow America to continue to grow and keep \nprices down, and not just because I want to keep them down for \nconsumers, which is great, but so we are not providing enormous riches \nfor people to develop nuclear weapons and turn around and harm the \nUnited States and our allies.\n  I believe the threat we face can be analyzed in a three-pronged \napproach. As I said on the floor last week or the week before, we face \na threat, an enemy most people refer to as terrorists. I do not refer \nto them as terrorists; I refer to them as who they are: radical Islamic \nfascists. They have an ideology. These are not people who kill for the \npurpose of killing. They don't kill because of hatred. They kill \nbecause they have a belief, an objective.\n  I know that for a year or two, the President, right after 9/11, \nreferred to these terrorists as ``cowards.'' I notice that he doesn't \ndo that anymore. I don't know of anybody who does that anymore. There \nis a reason: They are not cowards at all. These are people with great \nconviction. Some would even say that, in a demented way, they have \ngreat courage. But they are certainly not cowards. Calling them cowards \ngives the wrong impression to the American people that we are fighting \na foe who is afraid of us or afraid of something. The problem is they \nseem to be afraid of very little when it comes to this world. They are \nwilling to give up their lives. In fact, they want to give up their \nlives, and their objective, by the way, is to take as many other lives \nin the process. The object in this war is not territory; the object of \nthis war is submission and death.\n  So we are not dealing with a group of cowards. When we tell the \nAmerican public we are dealing with cowards, they don't think this is a \nserious enemy that can defeat us. America would never lose to a group \nof cowards. But we can lose to a group of fanatical, zealous Islamists, \nwho have a clear mission and a clear methodology by which to accomplish \nthat mission.\n  These are people who are very serious about what they want to do, \nwhether it is radical Sunnis or radical Shias. They have an objective \nand a common enemy--as does the radical left, represented so comically, \nin my opinion, so ridiculously, by the speech of Hugo Chavez yesterday \nat the United Nations. What do Mahmud Ahmadi-Nejad, President of Iran, \nand Hugo Chavez have in common? Nothing except their hatred of \neverything this country holds dear--freedom, democracy, and individual \nhuman rights. That is what they hate. I would suggest they have as much \nin common as Mussolini and Hitler and Tojo. They had very little in \ncommon ideologically. The Japanese believed in the superiority of the \nJapanese race and wanted to conquer and rule the world. Hitler didn't \nbelieve in that, but they formed an alliance because there was a common \nenemy.\n  That is the case here. We are seeing it. It is, hopefully, a \nfrightening sight put on display over the last couple of days at the \nUnited Nations, as this character of a President, this ridiculous \ndiatribe Hugo Chavez presented to the U.N. received applause from many \naround the world--most leaders around the world. This is a serious \nthreat. We can look at it and put it in political terms and say we went \nto war for the wrong reason and this or that wasn't true. But that is \nlooking in the rearview mirror when we have a huge\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\nthreat. So they have an ideology and a common enemy.\n  Secondly, they have a very effective methodology by which to conduct \nthis war. It is one that doesn't require the kind of coordination and \nresources a traditional military campaign would require. They don't \nneed to conquer land, to hold ground; they simply need to kill people \nevery day. And they do--every day. And we cover it in America every \nday. American people watch it every day. And every day, the resolve of \nthe American people is eroded. The resolve of the American people is \neroded because--I will use the words of Osama bin Laden--because we \nAmericans love life and the radical Islamists love death. That is how \nhe said he would defeat us, because of America's and the West's love \nfor life and respect for life, their attachment to this world, to the \nmodern world, and the radical Islamist's attachment not to this world \nat all but to death, which, in their minds, means life--a better life \nwith Allah. That is their objective, their methodology. Their \nmethodology is to prey upon what they believe is the weakness of \nAmerica, what they believe is the weakness of the West, which is the \nfact that we respect life, love life, we have human rights, and we \nbelieve in freedom. We believe it is our objective in this world to \nmake it a better world. They don't care about that at all. So terror is \na uniquely effective tactic that fits well into their culture of death \nand is particularly effective against our culture of life.\n  In addition, they are trying to develop a new weapon; that is, a \nnuclear weapon. Iran has made it very clear and Chavez has announced \nhis intention to develop a huge arsenal of weapons of mass destruction \nto use, in the words of Ahmadi-Nejad, ``to wipe Israel off the face of \nthe earth'' and use that weaponry to get the rest of the Western World \nto submit to their radical, fanatical brand of Islam.\n\n  This is their ultimate threat. This is the ultimate tactic of death \nand terror--to have a country that is committed publicly to using \nnuclear weapons not to defend itself, not to gain an earthly dominion \nover the world, but to cause mass chaos and destruction, in the case of \nIran, for a religious purpose, because what they seek to accomplish is \nthe return of the Hidden or 12th Imam. That is the 12th descendant of \nthe Prophet Muhammad who, in the late 800s, went into hiding, according \nto the Shia religion, and is destined to return as the messiah of the \nIslamic faith at the end of times--the end of times meaning Armageddon. \nThe interesting twist that the radical Shia project onto the world \nstage today is they believe it is their obligation to bring about the \nreturn of the Hidden or 12th Imam by causing a modern-day Armageddon. \nThat is what they believe. You may not have heard this before, but let \nme assure you, that is what they believe. That is what they say. That \nis what they talk about all the time, that this is their objective. It \nis a messianic vision; they are being compelled by their faith.\n  Some pass it off as a bunch of dictators who are just using religion \nto prop themselves up, to maintain control, or to try to dominate \nbigger areas of the world. Well, that would be bad enough. That would \nbe dangerous enough. But I think we underestimate them when we say \nthat. I think we underestimate President Ahmadi-Nejad and the ruling \nmullahs of Iran when we say that. I believe they are true believers, \nand I don't think we can afford the luxury of not believing that they \nbelieve this. I don't think we can dismiss them as another group of \ntwo-bit tyrants. These are two-bit tyrants who have billions upon \nbillions of dollars and have allies like North Korea, who have access \nto nuclear technology. They have scientists from Russia who left Russia \nbecause there is nothing for them to do, and they are in Tehran today \ndeveloping rocketry and the nuclear capability to project that power.\n  Some would say I am beating the drums of war. No. I am accurately \ndescribing the situation at hand. Some disagree with me, and they are \nwelcome to. Do you want to take that chance? Do you want to take the \nchance of having a nuclear weapon? They are clear about their intention \nof developing it. Do you want to take that chance? I don't.\n  How did this happen? Radical Islam has been present in the Middle \nEast for a long time. We have not heard much from them except when? In \nthe last 30, 40 years. Why? The price of oil. It is oil, to begin with, \nand now the high price of oil. It gives them the resources to not only \nfeed the people to keep them in power but to produce weapons to project \npower. The only reason, again, they have those resources is because of \nthis one three-letter word--oil--which brings me back to the beginning \nof this discussion.\n  If we are going to defeat radical fascist Islam, then we have to have \na strategy to take resources away from them so they cannot project the \npower they can today. The only way to do that is by developing a more \nsecure energy future for America and reducing our dependency on that \noil, which would reduce the price of energy around the world. We need \nto encourage not only alternative energy production in this country; we \nhave to do so around the world. We have to do so around the world by \nusing alternative technology such as, for example, as I talk about in \nthe bill, coal.\n  One of the greatest new energy consumers in the world is China. They \ndon't have a lot of oil, but they have a lot of coal. So it is an \nopportunity for us, with coal to gas and coal to liquid fuels \ntechnology, developing and commercializing that technology. And it is \nnot just going to be coal to liquid fuels, but if you talk to folks in \nthe business who are developing these plants right now--and one is \nbeing developed in Pennsylvania, which I have been involved with--they \nbelieve they can use all sorts of organic matter, such as waste \nproducts, to blend in with the coal to be able to produce liquid fuel.\n  We need to have that technology in America, and they need to have \nthat technology, and they are developing it, by the way, in China. We \nneed to create from the vast amount of energy opportunities that we \nhave in America and around the world new technologies so oil becomes \nless of a valuable commodity. This is one concrete way we can fight the \nwar on radical Islamic fascism.\n  I have put together a bill that talks about making--it does, if it \nwould be passed--a huge investment, a huge investment in alternative \ntechnologies, a huge investment in coal, a huge investment in \nrenewables to create a more secure energy future for America. We can no \nlonger talk about how we are going to do this or that we will do it at \nsome future date. We must act now, quickly. We need to provide support \nfor the commercialization of this technology. We are not going to see \nenergy produced at $20 a barrel, the equivalent of oil. We are not \ngoing to see it done at $30 or $40 a barrel. It may be more expensive. \nWe have to make sure we provide proper support in loan guarantees, \nincentives, and tax credits to make this a profitable venture and a \nsecure venture for people to invest in.\n  This is not something that normally I have come to the Chamber and \nsaid that this is the Government's job. This is national security. This \nis not about subsidizing big business. This is about producing energy \nhere for the security of our country. We either make the investment \nhere or we pay a horrible price, human as well as financial, in the \nfuture.\n  We need to think big, and we need to think now. That is why--when I \nspoke about the comments the Senator from Louisiana made before I came \nto the floor on opening up OCS--it is unconscionable for us to look at \nthe national security situation we look at today, to look at the \nsubsidies we are providing to our enemies and say: Oh, oh, we can't \nexplore for oil in Alaska or OCS. Oh, we are worried about the \nenvironment.\n  I am worried about the environment, too. In my State of Pennsylvania, \nin the western part of our State, we drill 3,000 gas wells a year--\n3,000--on farms, in neighborhoods, outside neighborhoods, in people's \nbackyards. At Oakmont Country Club, which is where the U.S. Open is \ngoing to be played, they are going to drill a gas well right next to \nOakmont Country Club. That is pretty much an environmental area. Nobody \nwants to pollute Oakmont Country Club. We are going to drill a gas well \nthere.\n  Yet there are people on this floor who won't drill those wells in \nAlaska where nobody goes, where nobody is. As a result, our country is \nat risk. We feed an enemy huge resources to combat us\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\nin their attempt to destroy us. It is unconscionable for us, a country \nthat produces oil and gas cleaner and more efficiently than any other \ncountry in the world, to allow our enemy to hold us, not just hostage, \nbut to gain resources to destroy us because we placate an interest \ngroup who funds, campaigns, and influences voters.\n  I know many in this Chamber and many in this country do not believe \nwe are at war or do not believe this war is serious. Time will tell. I \nthink, unfortunately, time will tell us in a relatively short period of \ntime how serious this is, and we will look back on this time as we \nstood year after year for the past 10 years twiddling our thumbs, not \ndoing what we can do to provide a more secure energy future for this \ncountry, and we will look back in horror of the blinders, of the scales \nwe had on our eyes that we could not see the threat before us.\n  We must do something. The bill I am introducing today is a \ncomprehensive package that does a lot to make America a safer country, \nfirst and foremost, from a national security perspective and, secondly, \nfrom an economic perspective.\n  I know we only have a week left. The Senator from Louisiana talked \nabout trying to get a bill done. Let's get something done. I plead for \nus to get something done to create some new sources of energy for this \ncountry, to put some downward pressure on world market prices. It is \nessential for us to do so.\n  We need to make this commitment for the future of our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER.\n  S. 3927. A bill to require the placement of blast-resistant cargo \ncontainers on all commercial passenger aircraft; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was pleased that the Senate leadership \nfinally agreed to consider a port security bill last week. It is high \ntime we did more about security at our ports.\n  Our ports are a soft target. We knew this before 9/11 and many \nexperts have warned us since that terrible day that our ports are \nvulnerable to attack.\n  Since the port security bill was signed into law at the end of 2002, \nwe have not moved forward on port security, and it remains dangerously \nunderfunded. Since the 9/11 attacks, we have spent only $816 million on \nport security grants, despite Coast Guard estimates that $5.4 billion \nis needed over 10 years.\n  Addressing port security is critical. However, security for other \ntransportation modes is important, but the Republican leadership wanted \nus to do port security and nothing else.\n  Through the efforts of many Senators, provisions for rail and transit \nsecurity were included. But, the final bill the Senate approved does \nnot contain any major provisions for aviation security. Yes, aviation \nsecurity has improved greatly in the last five years. But, as we \nrecently found out with the aviation terrorist plot uncovered by the \nBritish authorities, there are still holes in the system.\n  Transportation Security Administration, TSA, has implemented new \nsecurity procedures since we learned of the London terror plot to \ndetonate liquid explosives on flights from Great Britain to the United \nStates. While I support these new procedures, TSA is asking passengers \nto give up their lip gloss, yet we are not examining cargo loaded on \nboard our passenger planes.\n  I am pleased that the Department of Homeland Security will launch a \npilot program at San Francisco Airport, SFO, this October to check all \ncommercial cargo for explosives on passenger flights.\n  We should be doing this at every airport to ensure the security of \nthe flying public and the solvency of the airline industry. But until \nthat time, at the very least, we need to use at least one blast \nresistant cargo container on passenger planes that carry cargo. This \nwas one of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  For several years, I have been working to get these containers on \nplanes.\n  Currently, TSA is undertaking a pilot project using these containers, \nsome of which are made with Kevlar, for cargo. But we must move past \npilot programs.\n  We should use blast-resistant containers for cargo on all passenger \nplanes. That is why I an introducing a bill to do just that.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommended, TSA should require that every \npassenger aircraft carrying cargo deploy at least one hardened \ncontainer to carry any suspect cargo. Therefore, all passenger planes \nshould have at least one blast-resistant container for cargo.\n  To place one blast-resistant container on each plane, it would cost \nabout $75 million--this is equal to the cost of a little more than 5 \nhours in Iraq. Imagine the impact on the security of the country and \nthe financial outlook for the airline industry if a plane were to \nexplode during a flight.\n  We owe this to the American people. We cannot allow terrorists to \nexploit holes in our aviation security system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 3928. A bill to provide for the Office of Domestic Preparedness of \nthe Department of Homeland Security to provide grants to local \ngovernments for public awareness education relating to preparedness for \nnatural disasters, terrorist attacks, and influenza pandemic; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the last 5 years, Americans have faced \nboth devastating terrorist attacks and natural disasters. We have also \nbeen warned that an avian flu pandemic is a strong possibility.\n  In California, we have had fires, floods, mudslides, and \nearthquakes--thankfully not the big one.\n  We have learned that disasters are inevitable. Being prepared is \ncrucial--especially when the American people cannot rely on the Federal \nGovernment, which was demonstrated by the poor Federal response in \nHurricane Katrina. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael \nChertoff has even said, People should be prepared to sustain themselves \nfor up to 72 hours after a disaster.\n  Therefore, being prepared and knowing how to respond in the days \nfollowing a natural disaster is extremely important. However, people do \nnot know how to prepare, and, unfortunately, local governments may lack \nthe resources to educate their residents.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles County officials \ncould not afford to distribute pamphlets on earthquake preparedness for \nindividuals with special needs.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce legislation that will provide \ngrants, through the Department of Homeland Security's Office of \nDomestic Preparedness, to local governments to educate the public about \nhow to deal with natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and an influenza \npandemic.\n  It is important that we work to make sure that local communities are \nable to prepare their citizens to deal with future disasters.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9906-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9906-S9907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 578--RECOGNIZING THAT THE OCCURRENCE OF PROSTATE \n  CANCER IN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN HAS REACHED EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS AND \n URGING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THAT HEALTH CRISIS BY DESIGNATING \n  FUNDS FOR EDUCATION, AWARENESS OUTREACH, AND RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY \n        FOCUSED ON HOW THAT DISEASE AFFECTS AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN\n\n  Mr. KERRY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 578\n\n       Whereas the incidence of prostate cancer in African \n     American men is 60 percent higher than any other racial or \n     ethnic group in the United States;\n       Whereas African American men have the highest mortality \n     rate of any ethnic and racial group in the United States, \n     dying at a rate that is 140 percent higher than other ethnic \n     and racial groups;\n       Whereas that rate of mortality represents the largest \n     disparity of mortality rates in any of the major cancers;\n       Whereas prostate cancer can be cured with early detection \n     and the proper treatment, regardless of the ethnic or racial \n     group of the cancer patient;\n       Whereas African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed \n     earlier in age and at a\n\n[[Page S9907]]\n\n     later stage of cancer progression than for all other ethnic \n     and racial groups, thereby leading to lower cure rates and \n     lower chances of survival; and\n       Whereas, according to a recent paper published in the \n     Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers \n     from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical \n     School have discovered a variant of a small segment of the \n     human genome that accounts for the higher risk of prostate \n     cancer in African American men: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that prostate cancer has created a health \n     crisis for African American men; and\n       (2) declares the critical importance of the designation of \n     increased funding for--\n       (A) research to address and attempt to end the health \n     crisis created by prostate cancer; and\n       (B) efforts relating to education, awareness, and early \n     detection at the grassroots levels to end that health crisis.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, I am joining Congressman Greg Meeks \nto submit a Senate resolution aimed at raising awareness of the \nprostate cancer crisis among African-American men. This Resolution \nurges Congress to provide the funds necessary to prevent and fight the \ndisease, and to encourage African-American men to get screened.\n  Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death \nfor African-American men. They have the highest incidence and mortality \nrate due to prostate cancer of any ethnic or racial group. African-\nAmerican men are dying at a rate of 140 percent--almost 2\\1/2\\ times--\nhigher than other groups. That is the largest disparity for any major \ncancer.\n  No person of any race should have to suffer unnecessarily from a \ndisease we have the medical science and moral obligation to prevent, \ndetect, and treat. It should no longer rob sons, daughters, and wives \nof their fathers, husbands, and loved ones. Just as the doctrine of \n`separate but equal,' was wrong in education, it is wrong in health \ncare. We have to reform the system so that the quality of health care \nfor every American never depends on the color of any American's skin. \nWe need to fund more research and greater outreach efforts. For this \nreason, I urge every member of Congress to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S9907-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 579--DESIGNATING DECEMBER 13, 2006, AS A DAY OF \nREMEMBRANCE TO HONOR THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL \n               LAW BY THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT IN POLAND\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Santorum) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 152. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\n     secure the Nation's borders and prevent the flow of \n     undocumented persons and illegal drugs into the United \n     States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. 153.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) That a child, for the full and harmonious development \n     of his or her personality, should grow up in a family \n     environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and \n     understanding.\n       (2) That intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her country of origin.\n       (3) There has been a significant growth in intercountry \n     adoptions. In 1990, Americans adopted 7,093 children from \n     abroad. In 2004, they adopted 23,460 children from abroad.\n       (4) Americans increasingly seek to create or enlarge their \n     families through intercountry adoptions.\n       (5) There are many children worldwide that are without \n     permanent homes.\n       (6) In the interest of children without a permanent family \n     and the United States citizens who are waiting to bring them \n     into their families, reforms are needed in the intercountry \n     adoption process used by United States citizens.\n       (7) Before adoption, each child should have the benefit of \n     measures taken to ensure that intercountry adoption is in his \n     or her best interest and that prevents the abduction, \n     selling, or trafficking of children.\n       (8) In addition, Congress recognizes that foreign-born \n     adopted children do not make the decision whether to \n     immigrate to the United States. They are being chosen by \n     Americans to become part of their immediate families.\n       (9) As such these children should not be classified as \n     immigrants in the traditional sense. Once fully and finally \n     adopted, they should be treated as children of United States \n     citizens.\n       (10) Since a child who is fully and finally adopted is \n     entitled to the same rights, duties, and responsibilities as \n     a biological child, the law should reflect such equality.\n\n[[Page S9987]]\n\n       (11) Therefore, foreign-born adopted children of United \n     States citizens should be accorded the same procedural \n     treatment as biological children born abroad to a United \n     States citizen.\n       (12) If a United States citizen can confer citizenship to a \n     biological child born abroad, then the same citizen is \n     entitled to confer such citizenship to their legally and \n     fully adopted foreign-born child immediately upon final \n     adoption.\n       (13) If a United States citizen cannot confer citizenship \n     to a biological child born abroad, then such citizen cannot \n     confer citizenship to their legally and fully adopted \n     foreign-born child, except through the naturalization \n     process.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to ensure the any adoption of a foreign-born child by \n     parents in the United States is carried out in the manner \n     that is in the best interest of the child;\n       (2) to ensure that foreign-born children adopted by United \n     States citizens will be treated identically to a biological \n     child born abroad to the same citizen parent; and\n       (3) to improve the intercountry adoption process to make it \n     more citizen friendly and focused on the protection of the \n     child.\n\n     SEC. 803.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 23, 2004, Congress declared, ``the atrocities \n     unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide''.\n       (2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate, ``genocide has occurred and may still be \n     occurring in Darfur'', and ``the Government of Sudan and the \n     Janjaweed bear responsibility''.\n       (3) On September 21, 2004, in an address before the United \n     Nations General Assembly, President George W. Bush affirmed \n     the Secretary of State's finding and stated,``[a]t this hour, \n     the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible \n     crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government \n     has concluded are genocide''.\n       (4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1556 (2004), calling upon \n     the Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and \n     to apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their \n     associates who have incited and carried out violations of \n     human rights and international humanitarian law, and \n     establishing a ban on the sale or supply of arms and related \n     materiel of all types, including the provision of related \n     technical training or assistance, to all nongovernmental \n     entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed.\n       (5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564 (2004), \n     determining that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet \n     its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556 \n     (2004), calling for a military flight ban in and over the \n     Darfur region, demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen \n     disarmed and arrested for verification, establishing an \n     International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to investigate \n     violations of international humanitarian and human rights \n     laws, and threatening sanctions should the Government of \n     Sudan fail to fully comply with Security Council Resolutions \n     1556 (2004) and 1564 (2004), including such actions as to \n     affect Sudan's petroleum sector or individual members of the \n     Government of Sudan.\n       (6) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry \n     on Darfur, submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General \n     on January 25, 2005, established that the ``Government of the \n     Sudan and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious \n     violations of international human rights and humanitarian law \n     amounting to crimes under international law,'' that ``these \n     acts were conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and \n     therefore may amount to crimes against humanity,'' and that \n     officials of the Government of Sudan and other individuals \n     may have acted with ``genocidal intent''.\n       (7) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1590 (2005), establishing \n     the United Nations Mission in Sudan (referred to in this \n     section as the ``UNMIS''), consisting of up to 10,000 \n     military personnel and 715 civilian police tasked with \n     supporting the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \n     Agreement for Sudan and to ``closely and continuously liaise \n     and coordinate at all levels with the African Union Mission \n     in Sudan (AMIS)'', which had been established by the African \n     Union on May 24, 2004, to monitor the implementation of the \n     N'Djamena Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement, signed on April \n     8, 2004, ``with a view towards expeditiously reinforcing the \n     effort to foster peace in Darfur''.\n       (8) On March 29, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1591 (2005), extending the \n     military embargo established by Security Council Resolution \n     1556 (2004) to all the parties to the N'Djamena Ceasefire \n     Agreement of April 8, 2004, and any other belligerents in the \n     states of North Darfur, South Darfur, and West Darfur, \n     calling for an asset freeze and travel ban against those \n     individuals who impede the peace process, constitute a threat \n     to stability in Darfur and the region, commit violations of \n     international humanitarian or human rights law or other \n     atrocities, are responsible for offensive military \n     overflights, or violate the military embargo, and \n     establishing a Committee of the Security Council and a panel \n     of experts to assist in monitoring compliance with Security \n     Council Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005).\n       (9) On March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005), referring the \n     situation in Darfur since July 1, 2002, to the prosecutor of \n     the International Criminal Court and calling on the \n     Government of Sudan and all parties to the conflict to \n     cooperate fully with the Court.\n       (10) On July 30, 2005, Dr. John Garang de Mabior, the newly \n     appointed Vice President of Sudan and the leader of the SPLM/\n     A for the past 21 years, was killed in a tragic helicopter \n     crash in Southern Sudan, sparking riots in Khartoum and \n     challenging the commitment of all Sudanese to the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan.\n       (11) On January 12, 2006, the African Union Peace and \n     Security Council issued a communique endorsing, in principle, \n     a transition from AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping \n     operation and requested the Chairperson of the Council to \n     initiate consultations with the United Nations and other \n     stakeholders toward this end.\n       (12) On February 3, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council issued a Presidential Statement authorizing the \n     initiation of contingency planning for a transition from AMIS \n     to a United Nations peacekeeping operation.\n       (13) On March 10, 2006, the African Union Peace and \n     Security Council extended the mandate of AMIS, which had \n     reached a force size of 7,000, to September 30, 2006, while \n     simultaneously endorsing the transition of AMIS to a United \n     Nations peacekeeping operation and setting April 30, 2006 as \n     the deadline for reaching an agreement to resolve the crisis \n     in Darfur.\n       (14) On March 24, 2006, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1663 (2006), which--\n       (A) welcomes the African Peace and Security Council's March \n     10, 2006 communique; and\n       (B) requests that the United Nations Secretary-General, \n     jointly with the African Union and in consultation with the \n     parties to the Abuja Peace Talks, expedite planning for the \n     transition of AMIS to a United Nations peacekeeping \n     operation.\n       (15) On March 29, 2006, during a speech at Freedom House, \n     President Bush called for a transition to a United Nations \n     peacekeeping operation and ``additional forces with a NATO \n     overlay . . . to provide logistical and command-and-control \n     and airlift capacity, but also to send a clear signal to \n     parties involved that the west is determined to help effect a \n     settlement.''.\n       (16) On April 25, 2006, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Security Council Resolution 1672 (2006), unanimously \n     imposing targeted financial sanctions and travel restrictions \n     on 4 individuals who had been identified as those who, among \n     other acts, ``impede the peace process, constitute a threat \n     to stability in Darfur and the region, commit violations of \n     international humanitarian or human rights law or other \n     atrocities'', including the Commander of the Western Military \n     Region for the armed forces of Sudan, the Paramount Chief of \n     the Jalul Tribe in North Darfur, the Commander of the Sudan \n     Liberation Army, and the Field Commander of the National \n     Movement for Reform and Development.\n       (17) On May 5, 2006, under the auspices of African Union \n     mediation and the direct engagement of the international \n     community, including the United States, the Government of \n     Sudan and the largest rebel faction in Darfur, the Sudan \n     Liberation Movement, led by Minni Minnawi, signed the Darfur \n     Peace Agreement, which addresses security, power sharing, and \n     wealth sharing issues between the parties.\n       (18) In August 2006, the Sudanese government began to amass \n     military forces and equipment in the Darfur region in \n     contravention of the Darfur Peace Agreement to which they are \n     signatories in what appears to be preliminary to full scale \n     war.\n       (19) On August 30, 2006, the United Nations Security \n     Council passed Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), \n     without dissent and with abstentions by China, Russian \n     Federation, and Qatar, thereby asserting that the existing \n     United Nations Mission in Sudan ``shall take over from AMIS \n     responsibility for supporting the implementation of the \n     Darfur Peace Agreement upon the expiration of AMIS' mandate \n     but in any event no later than 31 December 2006'', and that \n     UNMIS ``shall be strengthened by up to 17,300 military \n     personnel . . . 3,300 civilian police personnel and up to 16 \n     Formed Police Units'', which ``shall begin to be deployed [to \n     Darfur] no later than 1 October 2006''.\n       (20) Between August 30 and September 3, 2006, President \n     Bashir and other senior members of his administration have \n     publicly rejected United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1706 (2006), calling it illegal and a western invasion of his \n     country, despite the current presence of 10,000 United \n     Nations peacekeepers under the UNMIS peacekeeping force.\n       (21) Since 1993, the Secretary of State has determined, \n     pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of \n     1979 (50 App. U.S.C. 2405(j)), that Sudan is a country, the \n     government of which has repeatedly provided support for acts \n     of international terrorism, thereby restricting United States \n     assistance, defense exports and sales, and financial and \n     other transactions with the Government of Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is \n     characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities directed \n     against civilians, including mass murder, rape, and sexual \n     violence committed by the Janjaweed and associated militias \n     with the complicity and support of the National Congress \n     Party-led faction of the Government of Sudan;\n       (2) all parties to the conflict in the Darfur region have \n     continued to violate the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement of \n     April 8, 2004, and the Abuja Protocols of November 9, 2004, \n     and violence against civilians, humanitarian aid workers, and \n     personnel of AMIS is increasing;\n       (3) the African Union should immediately make all necessary \n     preparations for an orderly transition to a United Nations \n     peacekeeping operation, which will maintain an appropriate \n     level of African participation,\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\n     with a mandate to protect civilians and humanitarian \n     operations, assist in the implementation of the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement, and deter violence in the Darfur region;\n       (4) the international community, including the United \n     States and the European Union, should immediately act to \n     mobilize sufficient political, military, and financial \n     resources through the United Nations and the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization, to support the transition of AMIS to a \n     United Nations peacekeeping operation with the size, \n     strength, and capacity necessary to protect civilians and \n     humanitarian operations, to assist with the implementation of \n     the Darfur Peace Agreement, and to end the continued violence \n     in the Darfur region;\n       (5) if an expanded and reinforced AMIS or subsequent United \n     Nations peacekeeping operation fails to stop genocide in the \n     Darfur region, the international community should take \n     additional measures to prevent and suppress acts of genocide \n     in the Darfur region;\n       (6) acting under article 5 of the Charter of the United \n     Nations, the United Nations Security Council should call for \n     suspension of the Government of Sudan's rights and privileges \n     of membership by the General Assembly until such time as the \n     Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease attacks upon \n     civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and \n     associated militias, and grant free and unfettered access for \n     deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region;\n       (7) the President should use all necessary and appropriate \n     diplomatic means to ensure the full discharge of the \n     responsibilities of the Committee of the United Nations \n     Security Council and the panel of experts established \n     pursuant to section 3(a) of Security Council Resolution 1591 \n     (2005);\n       (8) the President should direct the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, \n     and influence of the United States to urge the adoption of a \n     resolution by the United Nations Security Council that--\n       (A) extends the military embargo established by United \n     Nations Security Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005) to \n     include a total ban on the sale or supply of offensive \n     military equipment to the Government of Sudan, except for use \n     in an internationally recognized demobilization program or \n     for nonlethal assistance necessary to carry out elements of \n     the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan or the Darfur \n     Peace Agreement; and\n       (B) calls upon those member states of the United Nations \n     that continue to undermine efforts to foster peace in Sudan \n     by providing military assistance to the Government of Sudan, \n     government supported militias, or any rebel group operating \n     in Darfur in violation of the embargo on such assistance and \n     equipment, as called for in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 1556 (2004) and 1591 (2005), to immediately cease \n     and desist.\n       (9) the United States should not provide assistance to the \n     Government of Sudan, other than assistance necessary for the \n     implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan \n     and the Darfur Peace Agreement, the support of the regional \n     Government of Southern Sudan, the Transitional Darfur \n     Regional Authority, and marginalized areas in Northern Sudan \n     (including the Nuba Mountains, Southern Blue Nile, Abyei, \n     Eastern Sudan (Beja), Darfur, and Nubia), or for humanitarian \n     purposes in Sudan, until the Government of Sudan has honored \n     pledges to cease attacks upon civilians, demobilize and \n     demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated militias, grant \n     free and unfettered access for deliveries of humanitarian \n     assistance in the Darfur region, and allow for the safe and \n     voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced \n     persons;\n       (10) the President should seek to assist members of the \n     Sudanese diaspora in the United States by establishing a \n     student loan forgiveness program for those individuals who \n     commit to return to Southern Sudan for a period of not less \n     than 5 years for the purpose of contributing professional \n     skills needed for the reconstruction of Southern Sudan;\n       (11) the Presidential Special Envoy for Sudan should be \n     provided with appropriate resources and a clear mandate to--\n       (A) provide stewardship of efforts to implement the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement;\n       (B) seek ways to bring stability and peace to the Darfur \n     region;\n       (C) address instability elsewhere in Sudan, Chad, and \n     northern Uganda; and\n       (D) pursue a truly comprehensive peace throughout the \n     region;\n       (12) the international community should strongly condemn \n     attacks against humanitarian workers and African Union \n     personnel, and the forcible recruitment of refugees and \n     internally displaced persons from camps in Chad and Sudan, \n     and demand that all armed groups in the region, including the \n     forces of the Government of Sudan, the Janjaweed, associated \n     militias, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, the Justice and \n     Equality Movement, the National Movement for Reform and \n     Development (NMRD), and all other armed groups refrain from \n     such activities;\n       (13) the United States should fully support the \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and the Darfur Peace \n     Agreement and urge rapid implementation of their terms;\n       (14) the May 5, 2006 signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement \n     between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation \n     Movement was a positive development in a situation that has \n     seen little political progress in 2 years and should be \n     seized upon by all sides to begin the arduous process of \n     post-conflict reconstruction, restitution, justice, and \n     reconciliation; and\n       (15) the new leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation \n     Movement (referred to in this paragraph as ``SPLM'') should--\n       (A) seek to transform SPLM into an inclusive, transparent, \n     and democratic body;\n       (B) reaffirm the commitment of SPLM to--\n       (i) bring peace to Southern Sudan, the Darfur region, and \n     Eastern Sudan; and\n       (ii) eliminate safe haven for regional rebel movements, \n     such as the Lord's Resistance Army; and\n       (C) remain united in the face of efforts to undermine SPLM.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, today we consider a nominee for the new \nposition of Assistant Attorney General for the National Security \nDivision. All too often, in the Bush-Cheney administration, national \nsecurity has been cited as a justification for overriding the rule of \nlaw and for imposing unprecedented secrecy. With the acquiescence of \nthe Republican-controlled Congress, this administration may be the most \nunresponsive in history and the most unaccountable.\n\n[[Page S9998]]\n\n  Ken Wainstein is President Bush's selection to be the first Assistant \nAttorney General for National Security, a new position created by \nCongress. I will not oppose this nomination in the hope that Mr. \nWainstein will work with us and be responsive to the Senate.\n  I have concerns about this administration's unilateral approach to \nnational security issues. Four years ago, the Office of Legal Counsel \nat the Justice Department issued a secret legal opinion concluding that \nthe President of the United States had the power to override domestic \nand international laws outlawing torture. The memo sought to redefine \ntorture and asserted that the President enjoys ``complete authority \nover the conduct of war'' and asserted that application of the criminal \nlaw passed by Congress prohibiting torture ``in a manner that \ninterferes with the president's direction of such core war matters as \nthe detention and interrogation of enemy combatants would be \nunconstitutional.'' It seemed to assert that the President could \nimmunize people from prosecution for violations of U.S. criminal laws \nthat prohibit torture. This memo was withdrawn only after it became \npublic because it could not withstand public scrutiny.\n  We have learned through the media of warrantless wiretapping and \ndata-mining conducted by this administration. This, despite the Foreign \nSurveillance Intelligence Act and its express provisions, as well as \nthe actions of the Senate in voting to curtail the data-mining programs \nby Admiral Poindexter at the Defense Department. We have yet to be \nprovided with a convincing legal justification for these programs. We \nhave yet to be able to investigate or hold the administration \naccountable. Instead, every effort at oversight and accountability has \nbeen obstructed or curtailed by the administration. The administration \nrefuses to follow the law and submit matters to the FISA Court and \nclaims state secrets to force court challenges to be dismissed. The \nadministration tells the Senate when, what and how it may investigate. \nThe Department of Justice's own internal Office of Professional \nResponsibility's probe of whether lawyers at the Department violated \nethical rules in justifying these activities was shut down by the \nAttorney General and the White House.\n  I was disappointed 2 weeks ago when the Judiciary Committee reported \nout a bill on party lines that would rubberstamp the administration's \nwarrantless wiretapping. We were told that the administration would \nonly follow the law if we passed the legislation endorsed by Vice \nPresident Cheney. This is a bill that would expand governmental power \nand reduce governmental accountability in an area in which we have been \nunable to engage in effective oversight. As I have said many times and \nas I continue to believe, we should not legislate in this area until we \nknow more about the NSA's domestic spying activities and more about why \nthe administration chose to flout the law and bypass both the FISA \nCourt and the Congress.\n  I support Senator Feinstein's bipartisan bill, which we also reported \nout of committee, and I commend her for her hard work to get it done. \nWe should follow Senator Feinstein's thoughtful, cautious, and narrowly \ntailored approach. Her bill addresses the one concrete problem with \nFISA that the Attorney General identified, by making it easier for the \nGovernment to initiate electronic surveillance in emergency situations. \nIt also clarifies that FISA does not require the Government to obtain a \nwarrant in order to intercept foreign-to-foreign communications, \nregardless of where the interception occurs.\n  At the same time, we should continue to press the administration for \ninformation. We should not take ``no'' for an answer. As this \nadministration continues to expand its power, the Department of Justice \nshould be advising the President to obey the law and respect the \nCongress and the courts, not just helping to rationalize actions and \nforestall oversight.\n  In theory, the new position to which Mr. Wainstein has been nominated \nmight help Department of Justice attorneys to act responsibly on \nnational security issues, rather than just to do the White House's \nbidding. It should put national security issues into the hands of \nexperts, not political cronies. In fact, the WMD Commission recommended \nin March of last year that the different components of the Department's \ndealings with national security, terrorism, counterintelligence, and \nforeign intelligence surveillance be combined to eliminate deficiencies \nand inefficiencies in the Department's national security efforts. \nCongress acted to create the post. This new Assistant Attorney General \nposition can only serve a useful role if the person who occupies it is \nwilling to think independently. This administration has consistently \nprized loyalty over independence and expertise.\n  Mr. Wainstein has some experience as a prosecutor, but he has also \nbeen a loyal official of this administration for some time now. I hope \nthat he will be able to look at the crucial national security issues to \nbe handled by this new office with a critical eye and a view toward \nrespecting law and the Congress. If he does, he will be a breath of \nfresh air in the Bush-Cheney administration.\n  Recently, Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter and I received a \nletter from the Fraternal Order of Police. The FOP ``endorsed'' Mr. \nWainstein ``in order to facilitate his departure from the U.S. \nAttorney's Office.'' They criticized him for being ``unwilling to \nperform'' the function of investigating and prosecuting an alleged \nattack on a police officer. That is not what I would term high praise \nfor his judgment. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington. DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: I am writing \n     on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to \n     advise you of our position on the nomination of Kenneth L. \n     Wainstein, currently the U.S. Attorney for the District of \n     Columbia, to be the Assistant Attorney General for the \n     National Security Division at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n       The F.O.P. is very frustrated by the manner in which Mr. \n     Wainstein is handling the investigation into the attack on a \n     Federal law enforcement officer by U.S. Representative \n     Cynthia L. McKinney. The grand jury has held this case for \n     more than two months when the usual practice of a Federal \n     prosecutor is to immediately arrest and swiftly indict people \n     that attack police officers. It is clear to us that the \n     accused in this case is receiving special treatment from Mr. \n     Wainstein. This is unacceptable--had the officer's attacker \n     in this case been a visitor to the Capitol instead of a U.S. \n     Representative, it is likely that he or she would have \n     already stood trial. Instead, under the stewardship of Mr. \n     Wainstein, we have a seemingly endless grand jury proceeding \n     and rumored talks of a plea deal, despite the fact that there \n     has not even been an indictment.\n       Given that the basic function of a prosecutor is to \n     investigate and prosecute cases, and given that Mr. Wainstein \n     seems unwilling to perform this function in a simple assault \n     case, the F.O.P. was initially reluctant to support his \n     nomination to Assistant Attorney General. However, upon \n     further reflection, we have reconsidered. There is a genuine \n     need to have an effective and appropriately aggressive \n     Federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia and, because \n     the responsibilities of the position for which he has been \n     nominated are largely advisory in nature, we have decided to \n     advocate his swift and immediate confirmation in order to \n     facilitate his departure from the U.S. Attorney's office. In \n     so doing, we hope that his replacement will prove to be \n     better able to handle pending cases--particularly those \n     involving assaults on law enforcement officers.\n       Justice is something that must be vigorously pursued and \n     Mr. Wainstein is waffling. We feel that someone of his \n     temperament is better suited to a less operational position \n     and, for this reason, on behalf of the more than 324,000 \n     members of the Fraternal Order of Police, we urge his \n     expeditious confirmation. I thank you both in advance for \n     your consideration of our views on this matter. If I can be \n     of any further help, please feel free to contact me or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco at my Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Kenneth Wainstein is President Bush's \nnominee to be Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the \nDepartment of Justice. From July 2002 to March 2003, Mr. Wainstein was \nthe general counsel at the FBI and from March 2003 until May 2004 Mr. \nWainstein was the FBI Director's chief of staff.\n  FBI documents, released in response to a Freedom of Information Act \nrequest, show that during Mr.\n\n[[Page S9999]]\n\nWainstein's tenure at the Bureau, FBI agents at Guantanamo sent e-mails \nto FBI headquarters objecting to DOD interrogation techniques being \nused on detainees there. FBI agents described DOD's methods as \n``torture'' techniques and expressed alarm over military interrogation \nplans.\n  Over the past several months I have posed a number of questions to \nMr. Wainstein and Mr. Marion Bowman, who was his former deputy at the \nFBI General Counsel's office, regarding their knowledge of those \nconcerns and their actions in response to hearing about them. I also \nrequested from the Department of Justice a number of documents relevant \nto Mr. Wainstein's nomination.\n  Mr. Wainstein's June 19, 2006, answers confirm that he was aware and \n``there was wide awareness within the FBI--that FBI personnel stationed \nat Guantanamo disagreed with the aggressive techniques that were \nauthorized to be used there. . . .'' His July 14, 2006, letter to me \nindicated that the FBI's Office of General Counsel conveyed those \nconcerns to the Department of Defense's General Counsel and said that \nhis office expected that DOD would address the FBI concerns. Mr. \nWainstein also told me in his July 14 letter that he discussed detainee \ninterrogations with FBI Director Mueller and that the Director \n``maintained a bright line rule barring FBI personnel from involvement \nin interviews that employed techniques inconsistent with FBI \nguidelines.'' I will ask that copies of my letters to Mr. Wainstein and \nhis replies to me be printed in the Record.\n  In connection with Mr. Wainstein's nomination, I also posed a number \nof questions to Mr. Bowman, Mr. Wainstein's deputy in the FBI General \nCounsel's office. Over the August recess, I received a reply to my most \nrecent letter to Mr. Bowman. I will ask that copies of my letters to \nMr. Bowman and his responses to me be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. Bowman's answers to my earlier questions and his more recent \nresponse shed additional light on the concerns about detainee treatment \nat Guantanamo. Mr. Bowman wrote on June 27, 2006, that after he heard \nfrom FBI personnel in Guantanamo in late 2002, he believes that he \n``recommended--to Wainstein--that we notify DOD's general counsel that \nthere were concerns about the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo.'' \nMr Bowman also said in that reply that he learned of ``legal concerns \namong some DOD personnel about the DOD tactics.''\n  With regards to the directive issued by FBI Director Mueller that FBI \npersonnel ``stand clear'' of any interrogations that used techniques \nother than those approved by the FBI, Mr. Bowman wrote me on August 7, \n2006, that he does not recall when Director Mueller issued the policy. \nHowever, Mr. Bowman recalled a discussion that reflected the concerns \nthat FBI leaders had about what they were hearing from Guantanamo. Mr. \nBowman told me:\n\n       As soon as I heard [about concerns about interrogation \n     tactics] from BAU [the Behavioral Analysis Unit] [in late \n     2002] I talked with (now retired Executive Assistant Director \n     Pat D'Amuro who immediately said we (the FBI) would not be a \n     party to actions of any kind that were contrary to FBI policy \n     and that individuals should distance themselves from any such \n     actions. . . . He made it abundantly clear that FBI would \n     adhere to its standards and, to the extent possible, would \n     not put itself in a position that would create even the \n     appearance that those standards had been compromised by \n     physical association with activities inconsistent with the \n     tenets of the Bureau.\n\n  The responses of Mr. Wainstein and Mr. Bowman contrast with those of \nAlice Fisher, who the Senate confirmed earlier this week to be head of \nthe Criminal Division at the Department of Justice. Throughout her \nnomination process, Ms. Fisher maintained that she heard nothing about \nFBI concerns regarding DOD interrogation techniques other than vague \nconcerns about effectiveness. Mr. Wainstein has said that ``there was \nwide awareness within the FBI--that FBI personnel stationed at \nGuantanamo disagreed with the aggressive techniques that were \nauthorized to be used there. . . .'' While Ms. Fisher was in the \nCriminal Division at DOJ and not the FBI, her claim of no awareness \nstrikes me as somewhat incredible given the raging dispute going on \nbetween the FBI and DOD. As I urged in the debate on Ms. Fisher's \nconfirmation, I felt it essential that documents which might shed light \non whether she was aware of that dispute be made available to the \nSenate.\n  In Mr. Wainstein's case, I have been able to question officials who \nworked with Mr. Wainstein. Mr. Bowman answered my letters. In the case \nof Ms. Fisher, the Justice Department continues to block people who \nworked for her, namely David Nahmias and Bruce Swartz, from answering \nmy questions.\n  I continue to be troubled by the Department of Justice's stonewalling \nof my requests for documents relevant to events at Guantanamo. The \nDepartment's stonewalling is simply the latest example of the \nDepartment's pattern of secrecy and obstruction.\n  For years, this administration has run roughshod over a compliant \nRepublican-controlled Congress. Congressional oversight is desperately \nlacking. The Department's continuing denial to the Senate access to \ninformation we need to carry out our responsibilities violates \nfundamental constitutional principles. Every Senator should stand up \nfor the right of any individual Senator to review relevant documents.\n  That said, Mr. Wainstein and his deputy Mr. Bowman have been \nforthcoming. They do not control the documents I seek. The Department \nof Justice does. Either or both of those men might be willing to \nprovide them. Unfortunately, neither is in a position to do so. Mr. \nWainstein has answered to the best of his ability and I will support \nhis nomination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2006.\n     Mr. Kenneth Wainstein,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Wainstein: I have reviewed your answers to my \n     Questions for the Record and would appreciate you clarifying \n     a number of your responses and providing some additional \n     information which is relevant to them and the consideration \n     of your nomination.\n       1. Please provide an unredacted version of each of the \n     documents contained in the packet I provided.\n       2. Question 1D (ii) in my questions asked whether you or \n     anyone in your office raised concerns about Department of \n     Defense (DoD) interrogation techniques with the DoD, \n     including the DoD General Counsel. Your answer stated ``I \n     also understand that the FBI's Office of the General Counsel \n     conveyed those concerns to the DoD office of the General \n     Counsel.''\n       (A) When did the FBI Office of General Counsel convey those \n     concerns?\n       (B) Were those concerns conveyed orally or in writing? If \n     orally, please summarize the substance of the concerns that \n     were communicated. If in writing, please provide copies. In \n     addition, please provide the name(s) of the person(s) in the \n     FBI's Office of the General Counsel who communicated those \n     concerns, if they were conveyed orally, or who drafted the \n     communication, if they were conveyed in writing.\n       3. Question 2B asked about Document #2 in the packet I \n     provided. Your response stated, ``I am not aware that any \n     attorney from the FBI office of the General Counsel examined \n     the legal analysis in the document . . .'' I am attempting to \n     reconcile that response with several other documents in the \n     packet I provided:\n       Document #2A, an email dated December 2, 2002, requests \n     that the ``Legal Issues Doc'' be forwarded to ``Spike \n     Bowman,'' presumably referring to Marion Bowman, a senior \n     attorney in the FBI Office of General Counsel.\n       Document #2B, an email sent by Marion Bowman and dated \n     December 3, 2002, is entitled ``Fwd Re Legal Issues Re \n     GTMO.''\n       Document #2C, an email dated December 9, 2002, refers to a \n     legal review being undertaken by Mr. Bowman and states that \n     documents attached may be of interest to that review, \n     including ``a review of interrogation methods by a DoD \n     lawyer'' who ``worked hard to write a legal justification for \n     the type of interviews they (the Army) want to conduct \n     here.''\n       Document #2E, an email dated December 17, 2002, is a \n     response from Marion Bowman and is entitled ``Fwd Legal \n     Issues re Guantanamo Bay.''\n       Those emails clearly demonstrate that a senior attorney in \n     your office was aware of legal issues being raised by FBI \n     employees with regard to DoD interrogation techniques at \n     Guantanamo. Indeed, they indicate that a review of those \n     techniques was undertaken by that same senior attorney.\n       (A) Were you aware of FBI personnel at Guantanamo, or their \n     supervisors, contacting Mr. Marion Bowman or other attorneys \n     in the FBI Office of the General Counsel regarding legal \n     issues relating to Defense Department interrogation \n     techniques at Guantanamo in 2002 or 2003? If so, did you \n     discuss this with anyone in the FBI or take any other action?\n       (B) Were you aware of Mr. Bowman or other attorneys in the \n     FBI Office of General\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\n     Counsel ``reviewing legal aspects of interviews'' conducted \n     at Guantanamo in 2002 or 2003? If so, did you discuss this \n     with them or take any other action?\n       (C) Were you aware of Mr. Bowman or other attorneys in the \n     FBI Office of General Counsel being provided documents ``of \n     interest'' to a review of legal aspects of interviews at \n     Guantanamo in 2002 or 2003, including a review of \n     interrogation methods by a DoD lawyer? If so, did you review \n     any of these documents, discuss this issue with anyone in the \n     FBI, or take any other action?\n       (D) Were you aware of any comment that Mr. Bowman or other \n     attorneys in your office may have made to FBI personnel in \n     Guantanamo in 2002 or 2003 regarding DoD interrogation \n     techniques? If so, what was the substance of such comment?\n       (E) If you were not aware of email exchanges or other \n     communications between FBI personnel and Mr. Marion Bowman or \n     other attorneys in the office of the FBI General Counsel \n     regarding legal aspects relating to interrogation techniques \n     at Guantanamo during the period you were FBI General Counsel, \n     to what do you ascribe your lack of awareness?\n       (F) Please provide the name of the person who drafted the \n     legal analysis in Document #2.\n       4. Your answer to Question 3 states that ``Subsequent to \n     the May 20 hearing, the FBI surveyed its personnel who had \n     been in Guantanamo to determine whether any witnessed \n     mistreatment of detainees.'' Please provide the results of \n     that survey.\n       5. Your answer to Question 4 states that ``in the months \n     following 9/11, the FBI received numerous NSA tips . . .'' \n     Are you aware any instance following 9/11, where the FBI \n     raised a concern with the National Security Agency (NSA) \n     about the workload created by the number of leads being \n     provided to the FBI by the NSA?\n       6. Question 5 asked about concerns that Director Mueller \n     reportedly had regarding the legal rationale for warrantless \n     wiretaps. Your answer states that it would be ``inappropriate \n     for me to describe any discussions I may have witnessed or \n     had with Director Mueller on this topic.'' Please provide the \n     legal basis for your decision not to describe those \n     discussions.\n       I look forward to your prompt responses to my questions. \n     Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2006.\n     Mr. Marion Bowman,\n     Senior Counsel, Office of General Counsel,\n     FBI Headquarters,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Bowman: I am writing in connection with the \n     nomination of Kenneth Wainstein for the position of Assistant \n     Attorney General for the National Security Division of the \n     Department of Justice. Mr. Wainstein has indicated that you \n     worked for and reported to him during his tenure as FBI \n     General Counsel.\n       I asked Mr. Wainstein a series of questions concerning a \n     packet of FBI documents (attached) which refer to concerns of \n     FBI personnel at Guantanamo about aggressive interrogation \n     techniques used by the Department of Defense (DoD). In his \n     answers to my questions, Mr. Wainstein repeatedly stated that \n     he could not recall specific information or documents \n     contained in the packet. He also said that it was \n     ``possible'' that you were ``the source'' from which he \n     learned of FBI concerns with DoD interrogation techniques.\n       To assist me in filling in the gaps in Mr. Wainstein's \n     answers, please answer the following questions:\n       1. In the packet provided, Document #1C, dated May 30, 2003 \n     and addressed to your attention, summarizes FBI agents' \n     objections in 2002 and 2003 to DoD's use of aggressive \n     interrogation techniques which were ``of questionable \n     effectiveness and subject to uncertain interpretation based \n     on law and regulation.''\n       A. Do you remember Document # 1 C?\n       B. Were you aware, from Document # 1 C or otherwise, of FBI \n     agents' concerns regarding military interrogators' use of \n     aggressive interrogation tactics at Guantanamo? If so, when \n     were you first aware of these concerns? Did you bring \n     these concerns to the attention of Mr. Wainstein? If not, \n     why not? If so, what was Mr. Wainstein's response to those \n     concerns?\n       C. Were you aware of FBI agents' concerns that these \n     techniques were not only ``of questionable effectiveness'' \n     but also ``subject to uncertain interpretation based on law \n     and regulation''? Did you raise these concerns with Mr. \n     Wainstein? If not, why not? If so, are you aware of whether \n     he took any actions or directed you to take any actions as a \n     result?\n       2. In his answers to my questions, Mr. Wainstein stated \n     that the FBI's Office of General Counsel (FBI OGC) conveyed \n     FBI agents' concerns regarding DoD interrogation techniques \n     to the DoD Office of General Counsel (DoD OGC). Did you \n     participate in discussions with DoD officials, including from \n     the DoD OGC, about FBI agents' concerns regarding DoD \n     interrogation techniques? If so, did you inform Mr. Wainstein \n     about the outcome of these discussions? If not, why not?\n       3. Document #1C also states that on December 2, 2002, an \n     FBI employee sent several documents to the head of the \n     Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) in Quantico, who stated he \n     would forward these documents to you. According to Document \n     #1C, the forwarded documents included: (1) a letter to \n     Guantanamo Commanding General Major General Geoffrey Miller; \n     (2) an Army Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance \n     Strategies; and (3) a Legal Analysis of Interrogation \n     Techniques by an FBI agent whose name is redacted. In his \n     answers to my questions, Mr. Wainstein could not recall \n     seeing any of the documents specified in Document #1C, though \n     he said ``it is certainly possible'' that you raised the \n     documents with him.\n       A. Did you receive and examine documents related to \n     interrogation techniques at Guantanamo in late 2002, \n     including any of the three documents specified in Document \n     #1C? If so, when? Did you bring these documents to the \n     attention of Mr. Wainstein? If not, why not? If so, are you \n     aware of whether he took any actions or directed you to take \n     any actions as a result?\n       B. If you examined the document described in Document #1C \n     as an Army Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance \n     Strategies, did you discuss the legal analysis contained in \n     that document with Mr. Wainstein? If not, why not? If so, did \n     either Mr. Wainstein or you have any concerns about that \n     legal analysis?\n       4. Also contained in the packet I provided Mr. Wainstein \n     were a number of other documents in which you were also \n     named:\n       Document #2, entitled ``Legal Analysis of Interrogation \n     Techniques,'' indicates that it was forwarded to you on \n     November 27, 2002.\n       Document #2A, dated December 2,2002, entitled ``Legal \n     Issues,'' requests that a ``Legal Issues Doc'' be forwarded \n     to you or an appropriate person. Document #2B, dated December \n     3, 2002, is an email from you and is entitled ``Fwd Re Legal \n     Issues Re GTMO.''\n       Document #2C, dated December 9, 2002, states that it \n     includes a number of documents which may be ``of interest'' \n     to you and states that you are ``reviewing legal aspects of \n     interviews'' at Guantanamo. That same email describes one of \n     the attachments as a ``review of interrogation methods by a \n     DoD lawyer.''\n       Document #2E, another email from you, dated December 17, \n     2002, is entitled ``Fwd Legal Issues re Guantanamo Bay.''\n       A. Do you know the name of the author of the ``Legal \n     Analysis'' document (Document #2)? If so, please provide the \n     name.\n       B. Did you at any time discuss the analysis contained in \n     the ``Legal Analysis'' document (Document #2) with Mr. \n     Wainstein? If not, why not? If so, are you aware of whether \n     he took any actions or directed you to take any actions as a \n     result?\n       C. The ``Legal Analysis'' document (Document #2) describes \n     one ``Category IV'' interrogation technique as ``Detainee \n     will be sent off [Guantanamo], either temporarily or \n     permanently, to Jordan, Egypt, or another third country to \n     allow those countries to employ interrogation techniques that \n     will enable them to obtain the requisite information.'' This \n     would appear to suggest the use of rendition as an \n     interrogation technique. Did you at any time discuss the \n     issue of rendition with Mr. Wainstein? If not, why not? If \n     so, are you aware of whether he took any actions or directed \n     you to take any actions as a result?\n       Did you or any attorney in the FBI OGC conduct a review the \n     legal aspects of interrogation techniques at Guantanamo? If \n     not, why not? Did you or any other person in your presence \n     discuss this review with Mr. Wainstein? If so, are you aware \n     of whether he took any actions or directed you to take any \n     actions as a result?\n       In addition, please provide unredacted copies of the \n     documents in the attached packet for which you were the \n     sender, a recipient, or in which you were specifically named.\n       Thank you for your prompt responses to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2006.\n     Mr. Marion Bowman,\n     Senior Counsel, Office of General Counsel, FBI Headquarters, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Bowman: Thank you for your response to my letter \n     of June 9, 2006. On June 29, 2006, I provided your response \n     to Mr. Kenneth Wainstein and asked him some additional \n     questions regarding FBI personnel's concerns over DoD \n     interrogation techniques at Guantanamo. Mr. Wainstein \n     responded to me on July 14, 2006. A number of issues, \n     however, require further clarification.\n       Please provide answers to the following:\n       1. In Mr. Wainstein's responses of July 14, 2006, he states \n     that he discussed concerns about detainee interrogations with \n     Director Mueller ``at some point in 2002 or 2003.'' Further \n     he states that ``The Director had made a policy decision to \n     prohibit FBI personnel from participating in interrogation \n     sessions in which non-FBI personnel were employing techniques \n     that did not comport with FBI guidelines.''\n       A. In your response to my questions, you describe a \n     telephone call you received from Behavioral Analysis Unit \n     (BAU) personnel in late 2002 regarding their concerns about \n     interrogation practices at Guantanamo. Did you discuss these \n     concerns with Director Mueller in late 2002? If so, what was \n     the nature of those discussions? Was Mr. Wainstein aware of \n     those discussions?\n       B. When did Director Mueller issue the policy prohibiting \n     the participation of FBI personnel from interrogations \n     involving techniques that did not comport with FBI \n     guidelines? Please provide any documents relating to the \n     issuance of that policy.\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\n       2. In your response to Question #1B, you state that you \n     recommended to Mr. Wainstein that your office notify the \n     Department of Defense Office of General Counsel (DoD/OGC) \n     that ``there were concerns about the treatment of detainees \n     in Guantanamo.'' You add that Mr. Wainstein concurred in this \n     suggestion. When did you first contact the DoD/OGC regarding \n     FBI personnel's concerns about the treatment of detainees in \n     Guantanamo? Was it in late 2002? To whom did you communicate \n     these concerns?\n       3. In your response to Question #3A, you state that you \n     received the ``Legal Issues Doc'' in late 2002 and that, \n     ``Because at that time I was working under the assumption \n     that DoD General Counsel was taking appropriate action with \n     respect to this issue, I did not believe that any particular \n     action was necessary on the part of the FBI.''\n       A. Did you provide the ``Legal Issues Doc'' to the DoD/OGC? \n     If so, when?\n       B. Why did you assume at the time you received this \n     document that the DoD/OGC was taking appropriate action? Was \n     this based on your discussions with individuals in the DoD/\n     OGC? If so, what was the nature of those discussions?\n       4. In your response to Question #3B, you state that you \n     provided the attachments to Document #1C, including the Army \n     Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies, to the \n     Defense Humint Services Deputy General Counsel. Please \n     provide the name of the individual in that office to whom you \n     provided these documents. When did you do so?\n       5. In your response to Question #4A, you state that you \n     don't know who authored the document entitled ``Legal \n     Analysis of Interrogation Techniques,'' but that ``my \n     understanding is that the document was not drafted by an FBI \n     agent. Rather, an FBI agent copied it and forwarded it [to] \n     FBI Headquarters.''\n       A. What is the basis for your understanding that this \n     document was not authored by an FBI agent?\n       B. What is your understanding of the source from which the \n     agent copied the contents of the document?\n       In addition, I remind you that my June 9, 2006, letter \n     included a request for ``unredacted copies of the documents \n     in the attached packet for which you were the sender, \n     recipient, or in which you were specifically named.'' This \n     request is still outstanding.\n       Thank you for your prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 19, 2006.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This is in response to your letter \n     dated June 9, 2006, requesting additional information \n     regarding my nomination to be the first Assistant Attorney \n     General for National Security. Below are the answers to your \n     specific questions.\n       Answer to Question 1: I do not have unredacted copies of \n     any of the documents you provided me at our meeting on May \n     15, 2006. I am aware that you have made similar inquiry to \n     Director Mueller, and I have alerted the Department of \n     Justice, Office of Legislative Affairs, of your request.\n       Answer to Question 2: I understand that Marion ``Spike'' \n     Bowman conveyed concerns to the DoD General Counsel's Office \n     about DoD interrogation techniques at some point. I do not \n     know to whom Mr. Bowman spoke, how often, or the date of any \n     communications.\n       Answer to Questions 3 A), B), C), D) and E): As I have \n     previously indicated, I do not recall having seen the \n     document marked as #2, or the various emails marked #2A, #2B, \n     #2C, #2D or #2E; nor do I recall having specific \n     conversations about them with Mr. Bowman or any other FBI \n     Office of General Counsel (OGC) lawyer. I do not recall ever \n     hearing that Mr. Bowman or any other OGC lawyer was \n     undertaking any formal legal review or legal analysis of \n     interrogation techniques employed by another agency. I did \n     not produce any formal legal opinion or OGC legal memorandum \n     on this topic while I was General Counsel.\n       As I previously explained, I was aware--and there was wide \n     awareness within the FBI--that FBI personnel stationed at \n     Guantanamo disagreed with the aggressive techniques that were \n     authorized to be used there and believed they were not \n     effective at soliciting useful information that could be used \n     in subsequent prosecutions. As I saw In response to the first \n     set of questions (Question 1, subpart Fiii), it is certainly \n     possible that Mr. Bowman or other OGC attorneys were among \n     those from whom I heard about those concerns.\n       Answer to Question 3F): I do not know who authored the \n     document labeled #2.\n       Answer to Question 4: I do not have the results of the \n     survey conducted after the Director's May 20, 2004 hearing. I \n     left the FBI on May 29, 2004, to become the interim United \n     States Attorney for the District of Columbia. As I indicated \n     in my previous responses to your first set of post-hearing \n     questions, I do not know anything about the results of the \n     survey beyond the information publicly disclosed by Director \n     Mueller that I cited in my previous responses.\n       Answer to Question 5: I do not know whether the FBI raised \n     any such concern with the NSA.\n       Answer to Question 6: My view that it would be \n     inappropriate for me to comment about discussions with \n     Director Mueller is based upon the confidentiality interests \n     that are implicated by my role as his chief of staff and FBI \n     General Counsel. I have been advised that this is consistent \n     with long-standing executive branch concerns that disclosure \n     of such communications would chill the provision of candid, \n     frank advice to senior officials, such as Director Mueller, \n     which is important to their effective, fully-informed \n     decision-making.\n       I have made every effort, however, to respond to committee \n     requests for information relating to my fitness for the \n     position of Assistant Attorney General. I have met with \n     individual Senators and remain available for further meetings \n     with any Senator who would like to speak with me. I also have \n     responded to multiple rounds of pre- and post-hearing \n     questions, in addition to my appearances before the two \n     separate committees of the Senate relating to my nomination. \n     I have been happy to provide this information, and I remain \n     ready and willing to provide information relevant to the \n     Senate's consideration of my fitness and ability to fulfill \n     the responsibilities of the Assistant Attorney General for \n     National Security.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to provide this additional \n     information regarding my previous responses, and I look \n     forward to the Committee's consideration of my nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kenneth L. Wainstein.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for the questions in your \n     June 29, 2006, letter, and for your questioning throughout \n     this confirmation process. I have carefully reviewed your \n     questions, and I have drafted my responses based on my review \n     of the written responses from Mr. Bowman and the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation (FBI) e-mails and memos that you \n     provided me.\n\n\n           I. Concerns Regarding Interrogations at Guantanamo\n\n       The first of your two questions relates to concerns about \n     the interrogation techniques that Department of Defense (DOD) \n     personnel were using with detainees in Guantanamo. I \n     appreciate your concern about the treatment of detainees. As \n     a criminal prosecutor for most of the past seventeen years, I \n     have frequently been questioned about the treatment and \n     interrogation of suspects, defendants and prisoners in my \n     prosecutions. I have litigated suppression motions in \n     numerous homicide and other criminal cases where I had the \n     burden of demonstrating that a confession was procured under \n     conditions and circumstances that passed constitutional \n     muster. I have always considered this scrutiny to be a part \n     of my job, and I recognize the government's fundamental \n     obligations toward those it holds in custody.\n       As I explained in previous responses, it was fairly well \n     known during my tenure at the FBI that some FBI personnel \n     were concerned about the DOD's use of aggressive \n     interrogation techniques in Guantanamo. There was a sentiment \n     that DOD's techniques were not effective in eliciting useful \n     information and that DOD should instead use the rapport-\n     building approach that is routinely practiced by the FBI and \n     law enforcement in general. There also was a concern that \n     DOD's techniques could complicate the introduction of \n     subsequent admissions by detainees in any potential future \n     criminal prosecutions.\n       Your letter inquires about the concerns regarding DOD \n     interrogations that were communicated to former Deputy \n     General Counsel Marion Bowman in late 2002 an early 2003. \n     During this time period, I recall hearing about the concerns \n     described in the previous paragraph. However, as I have \n     previously explained, I do not recall hearing any reports of \n     torture or illegal conduct, and it was my understanding at \n     that time--and remains my understanding today--that the \n     techniques of concern to FBI personnel had been authorized by \n     the Department of Defense.\n       Although I heard concerns about the DOD interrogation \n     techniques during that time period, I do not recall hearing \n     them specifically from Mr. Bowman. As I indicated in previous \n     responses, it is entirely possible that he and I discussed \n     the issue, but there is nothing about any such \n     conversation(s) that sets it apart in my memory. Similarly, \n     while Mr. Bowman believes he would have spoken to me about \n     some of the concerns he was hearing, his written responses \n     indicate that he also cannot recall any specific \n     conversations. Moreover, he makes clear that any \n     conversations we might have had on this topic would have been \n     simply advisory in nature in that he believed the concerns \n     were being addressed by DOD and that they required no FBI \n     action beyond his contacting the DOD General Counsel's \n     Office.\n       Your letter asks whether I informed Department of Justice \n     officials or Director Mueller regarding any concerns I heard \n     about Guantanamo interrogations or directed others to so \n     inform them. While I do not recall discussing concerns about \n     detainee interrogations with an one in Main Justice--or \n     directing anyone else to do so--I do recall orally discussing \n     detainee interrogations with Director Mueller at some point \n     in 2002 or 2003. The Director had made a policy decision to \n     prohibit FBI personnel from participating in interrogation \n     sessions in which non-FBI personnel were employing techniques \n     that did not comport with FBI guidelines. The Director--\n     described his reasons for\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\n     this policy in his response to Questions for the Record after \n     his April 5, 2005, testimony before the Judiciary Committee \n     (which are summarized in my June 5, 2006, responses to your \n     questions for the record on pages 2-3). When this issue came \n     up from time to time during my service at the FBI, the \n     Director and I discussed FBI concerns about aggressive \n     interrogation techniques and he maintained a bright-line rule \n     barring FBI personnel from involvement in interviews that \n     employed techniques inconsistent with FBI guidelines.\n\n\n      II. Conversations about the Terrorist Surveillance Program I\n\n       Your second question asks whether I am asserting any \n     privilege in declining to describe any conversations I had \n     with Director Mueller regarding the legal rationale for the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program. The short answer is that I am \n     not invoking a privilege; rather, my response comports with \n     the long-standing Executive Branch practice of protections \n     the dentiality of internal advice and other deliberatlons. It \n     is my understanding that this practice is based largely on \n     the importance of ensuring that policy makers receive the \n     complete, sometimes differing, views of subordinates as they \n     consider significant issues. If employees have to worry that \n     their deliberations will be disclosed outside of the agency; \n     then they will become reluctant to provide their candid input \n     and the decision making process will suffer.\n\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n       I trust that this letter responds to your questions. It has \n     been my objective throughout this process to be as candid and \n     forthcoming as possible, and to assure you that I am worthy \n     of your confidence to handle the important national security \n     responsibilities of the position for which I have been \n     nominated. With the establishment of the National Security \n     Division awaiting my confirmation, I am anxious for you to \n     allow my nomination to proceed to a vote before the United \n     States Senate. There is much work to be done to stand up the \n     new Division.\n       Please let me know if you have any further questions, as I \n     would be happy to meet with you at your convenience to \n     respond to them. Thank you once again for your consideration \n     throughout this process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kenneth L.

In \n     addition, Mr. Bowman's response states that, approximately \n     one month after BAU personnel contacted him with their \n     concerns, he was informed about ``legal concerns'' that DoD \n     personnel had with the tactics. Mr. Bowman states that he \n     believes that he would have discussed these legal concerns \n     with you. Mr. Bowman also states that he believes that he \n     showed you or discussced with you the ``Legal Analysis of \n     Interrogation Techniques'' document referenced in document #1 \n     C. That document refers to examples of coercive interrogation \n     tchniques which may violate 18 U.S.C. s. 2340 (Torture \n     Statute).''\n       Please advise whether, at any time, you informed or \n     directed others to inform Director Mueller and/or any \n     Department of Justice (DOJ) official, including but not \n     limietd to officials in the Attorney General's office, DOJ's \n     Office of Legal Counsel, or DOJ Criminal Division of concerns \n     about DoD interrogation tactics that had been brought to your \n     office, regardless of the source of those concerns. If so, \n     please provide the name of the official(s) you contacted or \n     who were contacted at your direction. If concerns were \n     communicated in writing, please provide a copy; if orally, \n     please describe the substance of the conversation. If you did \n     not contact any such official(s) or direct others to do so, \n     please advise me as to why you did not.\n       You also state in your letter that ``the confidentiality \n     interests that are implicated by my role as his chief of \n     staff and FBI General Counsel'' preclude you from answering \n     my questions regarding your conversations with Director \n     Mueller on the legal rationale for warrantless wiretaps.\n       Please advise as to whether you are asserting any privilege \n     in declining to describe those discussions and provide the \n     legal basis for that privilege and your assertion of it.\n       Finally, following my staffs discussion with the Department \n     of Justice, I will provide the Department with a list of \n     documents from the previously provided packet that I request \n     be provided in unredacted form.\n       I look forward to your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   August 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Levin: You sent me a second set of questions with \n     respect to Mr. Kenneth Wainstein, which I received on Friday, \n     August 4, 2006. Your focus, once again, is ``detainee'' \n     issues. Let me preface my reply by informing you that I no \n     longer work for the Department of Justice. In consequence, I \n     have no access to any of the documents that you reference \n     and, because of a computer change in recent years, did not \n     have personal access to them when I last replied. \n     Additionally, because I no longer work for the Department of \n     Justice, my answers to your questions should not imply \n     concurrence by the Department of Justice or the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation in any of my responses.\n       You asked:\n       1. In Mr. Wainstein's responses of July 14, 2006, he states \n     that he discussed concerns about detainee interrogations with \n     Director Mueller ``at some point in 2002 or 2003.'' Further \n     he states that ``The Director had made a policy decision to \n     prohibit FBI personnel from participating in interrogation \n     sessions in which non-FBI personnel were employing techniques \n     that did not comport with FBI guidelines.''\n       A. In your response to my questions, you describe a \n     telephone call you received from Behavioral Analysis Unit \n     (BAU) personnel in late 2002 regarding their concerns about \n     interrogation practices at Guantanamo. Did you discuss these \n     concerns with Director Mueller in late 2002? If so, what was \n     the nature of those discussions? Was Mr. Wainstein aware of \n     those discussions?\n       Answer: To the best of my recollection, I never discussed \n     detainee issues with Director Mueller.\n       B. When did Director Mueller issue the policy prohibiting \n     the participation of FBI personnel from interrogations \n     involving techniques that did not comport with FBI \n     guidelines? Please provide any documents relating to the \n     issuance of that policy.\n       Answer: I do not recall when Director Mueller issued that \n     policy. However, I can tell you that the operational \n     prohibition came earlier. As soon as I heard from BAU I \n     talked with (now retired) Executive Assistant Director Pat \n     D'Amuro who immediately said we (the FBI) would not be a \n     party to actions of any kind that were contrary to FBI policy \n     and that individuals should distance themselves from any such \n     actions. That conversation was longer than indicated so I \n     want to be sure the ``sound bite'' is not misinterpreted. EAD \n     D'Amuro was not saying that FBI would ignore anything \n     unlawful. He made it abundantly clear that FBI would adhere \n     to its standards and, to the extent possible, would not put \n     itself in a position that would create even the appearance \n     that those standards had been compromised by physical \n     association with activities inconsistent with the tenets of \n     the Bureau.\n       Answer: You will have to seek any documents from the \n     Department of Justice as I no longer have access to any of \n     them.\n       2. In your response to Question #1B, you state that you \n     recommended to Mr. Wainstein that your office notify the \n     Department of Defense Office of General Counsel (DoD/OGC) \n     that ``there were concerns about the treatment of detainees \n     in Guantanamo.'' You add that Mr. Wainstein concurred in this \n     suggestion. When did you first contact the DoD/OGC regarding \n     FBI personnel's concerns about the treatment of detainees in \n     Guantanamo? Was it in late 2002? To whom did you communicate \n     these concerns?\n       Answer: I cannot be precise. My best guess, which is \n     probably pretty accurate, is that it was mid- to late \n     November of 2002. I first called the acting Deputy General \n     Counsel for Intelligence. Subsequently I talked with the \n     Principal Deputy General Counsel and the General Counsel. My \n     best recollection is that I talked briefly with the Principal \n     Deputy shortly thereafter and with both Principal Deputy \n     General Counsel and the General Counsel several months later. \n     I'm sorry; I can't be more precise than that.\n       3. In your response to question #3A, you state that you \n     received the ``Legal Issues Doc'' in late 2002 and that, \n     ``Because at that time I was working under the assumption \n     that DoD General Counsel was taking appropriate action with \n     respect to this issue, I did not believe that any particular \n     action was necessary on the part of the FBI.''\n       A. Did you provide the ``Legal Issues Doc'' to the DoD/OGC? \n     If so when?\n       Answer: I offered the documents to the General Counsel's \n     office and described generally the contents of the documents \n     included in the bundle that was forwarded to me by BAU, but \n     was told that they believed they already had all the \n     documents I possessed.\n       C. Why did you assume at the time you received this \n     document that the DoD/OGC was taking appropriate action? Was \n     this based on your discussions with individuals in the DoD/\n     OGC? If so, what was the nature of those discussions?\n       Answer: This could be a very lengthy response, but the \n     short version is that, based on my experiences as a 27-year \n     veteran of military service, a substantial portion of which \n     dealt both with issues of the Law of Armed Conflict and, for \n     a variety of reasons, directly with the DoD General Counsel's \n     office (through multiple General Counsels), I believed \n     bringing the issue to the attention of appropriate authority \n     would result in any remedial action deemed necessary or \n     appropriate. When I talked with the acting Deputy General \n     Counsel for Intelligence, a person whom I knew well, I was \n     told that the matter was not in his purview, but that it was \n     being handled by the Principal Deputy. That made perfect \n     sense to me, as the acting Deputy General Counsel for \n     Intelligence had no military experience, while the Principal \n     Deputy was retired military.\n\n[[Page S10003]]\n\n       4. In your response to Question #3B, you state that you \n     provided the attachments to Document #1C, including the Army \n     Legal Brief on Proposed Counter-Resistance Strategies, to the \n     Defense Humint Service's Deputy General Counsel. Please \n     provide the name of the individual in that office to whom you \n     provided these documents. When did you do so?\n       Answer: The Deputy General Counsel for Defense Humint \n     Services is retired Colonel James Schmidli. My best guess on \n     timing was in the mid-December 2002 to mid-January 2003 time \n     frame. I did not give copies to Mr. Schmidli, but he did read \n     them in my office.\n       5. In your response to Question #4A, you state that you \n     don't know who authored the document entitled ``Legal \n     Analysis of Interrogation Techniques'' but that ``my \n     understanding is that the document was not drafted by an FBI \n     agent. Rather, an FBI agent copied it and forwarded it [to] \n     FBI Headquarters.\n       A. What is the basis for your understanding that this \n     document was not authored by an FBI agent?\n       Answer: To the best of my recollection, this is what I was \n     told when the documents were forwarded to me.\n       B. What is your understanding of the source from which the \n     agent copied the contents of the document?\n       Answer: I have no present recollection of that.\n       In closing, I will remind you that any documents you desire \n     will have to be requested from the Department of Justice. I \n     hope this is helpful to your understanding that this period \n     was one in which facts were still uncertain but reasonably \n     believed to be in the hands of the Department of Defense for \n     any actions necessary. In that respect, it is my firm belief \n     that Mr. Wainstein acted with complete propriety throughout.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      M.E.

Res. 579\n\n       Whereas, on May 9, 1945, Europe declared victory over the \n     oppression of the Nazi regime;\n       Whereas Poland and other countries in Central, Eastern, and \n     Southern Europe soon fell under the oppressive control of the \n     Soviet Union;\n       Whereas for decades the people of Poland struggled heroicly \n     for freedom and democracy against that oppression, paying at \n     times the ultimate sacrifice;\n       Whereas, in 1980, the Solidarity Trade Union was formed in \n     Poland;\n       Whereas membership in the Solidarity Trade Union grew \n     rapidly in size to 10,000,000 members, and the Union obtained \n     unprecedented moral power that soon threatened the Communist \n     government in Poland;\n       Whereas, on December 13, 1981, the Communist government in \n     Poland crushed the Solidarity Trade Union, imprisoned the \n     leaders of the Union, and imposed martial law on Poland;\n       Whereas, through his profound influence, Pope John Paul II \n     gave the people of Poland the hope and strength to bear the \n     torch of freedom that eventually lit up all of Europe;\n       Whereas the support of the Polish-American community while \n     martial law was imposed on Poland was essential in \n     encouraging the people of Poland to continue to struggle for \n     liberty;\n       Whereas the people of the United States were greatly \n     supportive of the efforts of the people of Poland to rid \n     themselves of an oppressive government;\n       Whereas the people of the United States expressed their \n     support on Christmas Eve 1981 by lighting candles in their \n     homes to show solidarity with the people of Poland who were \n     suffering under martial law;\n       Whereas, in 1989, the people of Poland finally won the \n     right to hold free parliamentary elections, which led to the \n     election of Poland's first Prime Minister during the post-war \n     era who was not a member of the Communist party, Mr. Tadeusz \n     Mazowiecki; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, Poland is an important member of the \n     European Union, one of the closest allies of the United \n     States, a contributing partner in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organisation, and a reliable partner in the war on terrorism \n     that maintains an active and crucial presence in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 13, 2006, the 25th anniversary of \n     the imposition of martial law by the Communist government in \n     Poland, as a Day of Remembrance honoring the sacrifices paid \n     by the people of Poland during the struggle against Communist \n     rule;\n       (2) honors the people of Poland who risked their lives to \n     restore liberty in Poland and to return Poland to the \n     democratic community of nations; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to remember \n     that the struggle of the people of Poland greatly contributed \n     to the fall of\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\n     Communism and the ultimate end of the Cold War.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S10004-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL POLLINATOR WEEK\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, Today, I ask my colleagues to recognize \nthe 7th Annual Lights on Afterschool events taking place across the \ncountry on October 12, 2006. ``Lights on Afterschool is a national \ncelebration in which more than 1 million Americans will gather in their \ncommunities to recognize the important role that afterschool programs \nprovide for the children in this country.\n  Afterschool providers throughout California and across the country \nhave demonstrated that afterschool programs keep children safe, improve \nlearning, and reduce crime and drug use. According to the FBI, youth \nare most at risk for being victims of violent crimes and committing \nviolent acts between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.--after school is out and before \nparents arrive home. Afterschool programs keep children safe, reduce \ncrime and drug use, and improve academic performance.\n  As we take this occasion to recognize the afterschool program \nproviders, we also must honor the communities that also contribute to \nthe enrichment of these afterschool activities that provide safe and \nsupervised afterschool educational, enrichment, and recreational \nprograms. The partnerships you have forged with the afterschool program \nproviders are instrumental in their success. There is no responsibility \ngreater than ensuring that our children can learn and grow in a safe \nenvironment.\n  Afterschool programs are critical to the success of American \nfamilies. These programs make it easier for parents to go to work \nbecause they know that their children are in a safe and nourishing \nenvironment. According to the Afterschool Alliance, 14.3 million \nchildren go home to an empty house every day. We must work to ensure \nthese children have access to these programs that are vital to \ndeveloping cultural and social skills, as well as the academic \nenrichment that the programs provide.\n  Afterschool is a wise investment in our children's future. That is \nwhy I will continue to work to make after school a national priority--\nso that we can bring Federal resources to support great local programs \nto keep the lights on and the doors open.\n  I send my sincere thanks to everyone working in programs and schools \ninvolved with Lights on Afterschool and for all of the work you have \ndone and continue to do in creating partnerships that promote and \nenhance afterschool programs.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 116) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 116\n\n       Whereas high quality after school programs provide safe, \n     challenging, engaging, and fun learning experiences to help \n     children and youth develop their social, emotional, physical, \n     cultural, and academic skills;\n       Whereas high quality after school programs support working \n     families by ensuring that the children in such families are \n     safe and productive after the regular school day ends;\n       Whereas high quality after school programs build stronger \n     communities by involving the Nation's students, parents, \n     business leaders, and adult volunteers in the lives of the \n     Nation's youth, thereby promoting positive relationships \n     among children, youth, families, and adults;\n       Whereas high quality after school programs engage families, \n     schools, and diverse community partners in advancing the \n     well-being of the Nation's children;\n       Whereas ``Lights On Afterschool!'', a national celebration \n     of after school programs held on October 12, 2006, promotes \n     the critical importance of high quality after school programs \n     in the lives of children, their families, and their \n     communities;\n       Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States \n     have parents who work outside the home and 14,300,000 \n     children in the United States have no place to go after \n     school; and\n       Whereas many after school programs across the United States \n     are struggling to keep their doors open and their lights on: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress supports the goals and ideals of \n     ``Lights On Afterschool!'' a national celebration of after \n     school programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S10005-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10005-S10006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      VETERANS' COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 539, S. 2562.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2562) to increase, effective as of December 1, \n     2006, the rates of compensation for veterans with service-\n     connected disabilities and the rates of dependency and \n     indemnity compensation for the survivors of certain disabled \n     veterans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statment was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I am extremely pleased with Senate passage of \nlegislation that will authorize a cost-of-living adjustment for \nveterans' compensation.\n  The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2006, S. \n2562, directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, as of \nDecember 1, 2006, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, \ndependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and \nchildren, and certain related benefits.\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\n  The COLA will be the same as the increase provided to Social Security \nrecipients, which is projected to be approximately 2.9 percent.\n  It is vital that veterans' disability compensation rates keep pace \nwith the increasing cost of living. Without an increase to offset the \neffects of inflation, veterans and their families would lose the value \nof this important benefit.\n  Passage of the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act \nof 2006 is the least that Congress can do to help disabled veterans \nprovide adequately for their families. Many times, VA disability \ncompensation is a major, and in some cases the sole, source of income \nfor a veteran and his or her family. For those who gave so much to this \nnation, we owe them this sign of gratitude.\n  In closing, I thank all of my colleagues for their support for our \nNation's veterans. I anticipate swift passage of this important \nlegislation by the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Those \nare, in essence, the court system, the commissions, the way we deal \nwith enemy combatants or terrorists.\n  The issue before the Senate is legislation that we must pass this \ncoming week just as soon as possible for a number of reasons, but \nprimarily we have detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who cannot be \ntried. Among these terrorists are people such as the lead Shaikh \nMohammed, the mastermind, or alleged mastermind, behind the events of \nSeptember 11.\n  In addition, what we all now understand is the Hamdan decision made \nit again incumbent upon the Senate to act in order to be able to \ncontinue a very important program of interrogation so we can get \ninformation so our Government will be equipped with the tools we need \nto obtain information from terrorists that can be lifesaving, that can \nprevent another attack, a terrorist attack.\n  What has been challenging over the last several months is coming to \nan agreement which we reached today among colleagues who had devoted a \nlot of time in this Senate on this issue, an issue which is tough from \na legal standpoint, but an agreement within this Senate, working hand \nin hand with the administration. I was pleased to join my colleagues, \nalong with the National Security Adviser, Steve Hadley, along with a \nMember from the House of Representatives, as well as Mitch McConnell, \nour whip, as well as John Warner, chairman of the Committee on Armed \nServices, Senator John McCain, and Senator Graham, to announce an \nagreement that meets the key test of our conference.\n  The first priority, as I have spoken again and again over the last \nseveral days, was the importance of meeting these goals. And they were \nmet.\n  No. 1, protect America by ensuring our highly valuable CIA program \nwill be preserved, a program of interrogation which has delivered \ninformation that has allowed the United States to stop terrorist \nactivity. That will be preserved.\n  The second goal, a criterion that I have set out and the President \nhas set out as well, is whatever we develop in this Senate must \nguarantee that classified sources and methods, classified information--\nall sources and methods will not be disclosed to the terrorist \ndetainees. It seems obvious to the American people, obvious to me, that \nwe do not want to be giving classified information to a terrorist or \nhis attorney, who will turn around and share that with the larger \nterrorist world that is out there.\n  A third criteria or a third result of the fact that this legislation \nhas been addressed in the way it has is an agreement that has the \nimpact of ensuring that the military will be able to begin to try the \nterrorists, the enemy combatants, the detainees in our custody today.\n  So it protects a program which we know is important, No. 1. No. 2, it \nprevents classified information from being given to terrorists. No. 3, \nit ensures that the military can begin to try these terrorists once \nthis legislation is signed by the President.\n  I congratulate my colleagues. We have a long way to go, though, \nbecause\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\nthat is the first major step of a product of about 2 months of work. \nWith that work and the time they have spent, the dedication and focus, \nit means that once that information can be shared with Democrats and \nRepublicans throughout the Senate and they take a look at it, the fact \nthat it has been so carefully vetted, we should be able to address it \nin the course of next week.\n  I had a brief conversation with the Democratic leader, who has begun \nto look at that legislation. He, too, is confident we can address this \nissue next week. The House of Representatives has to address it, as \nwell, go to conference--if we don't pass the same bill--and then get it \nto the President as soon as we possibly can. So it is very good news. \nThat agreement was reached today.\n  There are a number of other items that have to be addressed, but \nthere were three major items that were the real gist, the substance of \nthat agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S10007-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DARFUR PEACE AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I have several other issues to deal with, \nbut that particular issue on Sudan and sanctions surrounding Sudan \nleads me to comment on the great tragedy that is occurring in the \nDarfur region in western Sudan.\n  I have had the opportunity to be in that region in a number of the \nrefugee camps along that western border of Sudan and Chad, the country \njust west of Sudan, a country to which many of these refugees are \nfleeing.\n  Things are getting worse in Darfur. We have heard a lot about it in \nthe last 2\\1/2\\ years. On this floor, a little over 2 years ago, we \ncalled it a genocide. Shortly thereafter, the administration also \nagreed it is genocide. And that is exactly what it is. We do not know \nexactly how many people have been killed, but around 200,000 people \nhave been killed in this genocide and probably 2 million people \ndisplaced from their homes. Things are getting worse. It deserves the \nattention of this body. We focused on it at a very early time. We \ncontinue to focus on it, but again, I think we are going to have to \nfocus on it more and more.\n  An envoy was appointed by the President maybe yesterday or the day \nbefore. I think that is a very positive move in that regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/21/senate-section/article/S10007-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NORTH CAROLINA FARM BUREAU \n                               FEDERATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
