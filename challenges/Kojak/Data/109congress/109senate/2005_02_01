Today's prayer will be offered by former \nSenate Chaplain Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie from Los Angeles, CA.\n  Almighty God, Sovereign of this Nation and Lord of our lives, thank \nYou for the gifts of life, intellect, good memories, and daring \nvisions. We don't ask for challenges equal to our talents and training, \neducation and experience; rather, we ask for opportunities equal to \nYour power and vision. Forgive us when we pare life down to what we \ncould do on our own without Your power. Make us adventuresome, \nundaunted leaders who seek to know what You want done and attempt it \nbecause You will provide exactly what is needed to accomplish it. We \nthank You that tough times are nothing more than possibilities wrapped \nin negative attitudes.\n  Lord of the unfolding drama of history, we praise You for the triumph \nof the first free election in half a century in Iraq. We honor the \ncourage of the millions of Iraqis who defied danger and reprisal to \nexercise their new liberty from tyranny.\n  We know that freedom is not free; it is the legacy of liberators of \nour Armed Forces, some of whom paid the supreme price to assure freedom \nfor the people of Iraq. Help us to cherish our freedoms in America and \nnever take for granted the privileges we enjoy.\n  Now bless the women and men of this Senate. Help them experience the \npalpable presence of Your Spirit and receive the incredible resilience \nYou provide. You are our Lord and Saviour.

Madam President, as the distinguished majority leader and I \nstood in the aisle, as soon as Reverend Ogilvie finished his prayer, \nthe Republican leader leaned over to me and said, how about that voice, \nor words to that effect. Those were the exact memories I have of Dr. \nOgilvie. I spent 5 years listening to his prayers every morning. As a \nresult of that, I felt it was a good way to start the day. It brought \nback so many memories of our time together.\n\n  It seems that one of the requirements, at least with the last two \nchaplains we have had, is the voice. Dr.\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\nBlack and Dr. Ogilvie have two of the finest voices I have ever heard \nand each time I hear them say something I become so envious that I have \nmy voice and they have theirs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, the Democratic leader is exactly right. \nThat was our first comment. What is even more embarrassing is when you \nare side by side with either Lloyd Ogilvie or Chaplain Black and you \nhave to sing, because their voices are so powerful, which does mean so \nmuch to us in terms of expressing feelings, emotion, and values. When \nit is applied to the beautiful voice of singing, it is especially \nembarrassing to me as they are next to me because the contrast is so \ndramatic.\n  It is a great pleasure for all of us to welcome Lloyd Ogilvie back \nwith us this morning to open today with a prayer that struck at what we \nhave seen the last couple of days, but also the real responsibility and \nobligations we have as Members of the Senate. We have been blessed with \nchaplains such as Chaplain Black and Chaplain Ogilvie to serve us and \nthe American people so selflessly and unselfishly during our tenure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S682-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TSUNAMI: LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will comment on Judge Alberto Gonzales \nand his confirmation. Over the period for morning business, others will \nbe coming by and speaking on the confirmation, although we do not \nofficially begin until 10:45. Before doing that, I want to mention that \ntomorrow I will have the opportunity to testify before the Senate \nCommerce Committee. I was invited by Chairman Stevens to speak on the \nlong-term public health needs of the victims following the December 26 \ntsunami.\n  Early in January, Senator Mary Landrieu and I had the opportunity \nfairly early on in the recovery period to go to Sri Lanka where the \nobservations were stark in many ways but in many ways inspiring, as we \nflew over the coastline in Sri Lanka and witnessed the unending \ndevastation. We also saw on the ground the great outpouring of support, \ncaring, and compassion, the best of humanity internationally but very \nspecifically by Americans on the ground.\n  We all know from the tsunami we have the 5 million people who lost \ntheir homes and 150,000 people who lost their lives. The scars will be \nthere for a long period of time. Senator Stevens will have a hearing \ntomorrow to look at some appropriate initial responses in terms of \nprevention of that sort of catastrophe in the future. Tomorrow, I will \nbe talking about a broad picture looking at public health issues such \nas cleaning of water and sanitation, and the role curing disease and \npublic health can play as an expression of compassion and caring but \nalso as a wonderful currency of peace in its manifestation.\n  I will also be introducing legislation shortly addressing this whole \nchallenge of water and the global issues surrounding water, the fact \nthat 1.2 billion people in the world today do not have a clean glass of \nwater. Unfortunately, these waterborne illnesses are the No. 1 killer \nof children in the world today because 1.2 billion people do not have \naccess to that water.\n\n  We will be introducing legislation to address the global water \nsupply, quality and quantity, that will address some of the basic \nissues, humanitarian in part but public health in large part as well. \nWe can do a lot through our foreign assistance, where we have \nmisdirected our foreign assistance or we have not even focused on \nwater, which I believe it deserves. I will also mention the importance \nof having a global health corps that can respond to disaster in a way \nthat we saw so many wonderful volunteers coming from around the world \nto respond to this tsunami. In the aftermath of a terrible tragedy such \nas this, medicine heals not only the body but also the hearts and \nminds. As the tsunami tragedy underscores so powerfully, medicine can \nact as a currency of peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S682-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S682-S683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ALBERTO GONZALES\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, today the debate and discussion \nthroughout will be on the nomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales to be \nAttorney General, and I am proud to be the first of many today to speak \non this nomination and the strong support I have for this nominee. \nJudge Gonzales is a man of keen intellect, a man of high standing and \nachievement, and unwavering respect for the law. As our first Hispanic-\nAmerican Attorney General, Judge Gonzales will stand as an inspiration \nto all Americans. He captures it in his life story. He is an \noutstanding choice to become our Nation's top law enforcement officer.\n\n  He has lived the American dream. We talk so much about the American \ndream. We point to people, parts of whose lives manifest the American \ndream. He lived it growing up in the town of Humble, TX, in a two-\nbedroom house shared by seven siblings and his mother and father. His \nparents, Pablo and Maria, were Mexican-American immigrants. They have \nlittle formal education. His dad completed second grade and that was \nit.\n  Inspired by his parents--as he tells it, their hard work--and spurred \non by their encouragement, Judge Gonzales set his aspirations high and \nhe was on the way. He has fulfilled them at every level. He played \nfootball and baseball in high school. On graduation, he joined the Air \nForce, from there enrolled in the Air Force Academy, and later \ntransferred to Rice University. He became the first person in his \nfamily to go to college.\n  He didn't stop there. He was accepted at Harvard Law School, and with \nhis Harvard law degree in hand he returned to Texas to join one of \nHouston's most respected law firms, and he was their first minority \npartner. At the firm, Judge Gonzales committed himself to the education \nof minority kids. He even helped create minority scholarships which to \nthis day are awarded to those in need.\n  It didn't take long for people to recognize the tremendous talents of \nJudge Gonzales. He answered the call to public service. Newly elected \nGovernor George Bush tapped Alberto Gonzales to join his administration \nas general counsel. He went on to become Texas's 100th secretary of \nstate and then later a justice of the Texas Supreme Court.\n  Every step of the way he has worked hard. He has won the respect of \nhis peers. His integrity and talent have allowed him to receive \nnumerous awards. Those sterling qualities have also garnered the trust \nand loyalty of the President of the United States. As counsel to the \nPresident for the last 4 years, he has been one of the President's \nclosest advisers. President Bush credits Judge Gonzales for his candor \nand for his ability to remain steady in times of crisis--qualities that \nare essential in an Attorney General. As we all know, it has been noted \nthat when President John F. Kennedy nominated his brother Robert to \nlead the Justice Department, the relationship worked so well because \nthe President could count on his unflinching candor in times of crisis.\n  The biography of Judge Gonzales speaks for itself. I do think it is \nimportant to, up front, address some of the criticisms that have been \nleveled against him. More than a few facts have been lost in the \ndebate. These issues will be talked about, I know, over the course of \nthe morning.\n  First, President Bush does not have nor has his administration ever \nhad an official Government policy condoning or authorizing torture or \nprisoner abuse. Let me restate for the record what the policy has been \nand continues to be from a Presidential memo dated February 7, 2002:\n\n       Our values as a Nation, values that we share with many \n     nations in the world, call for us to treat detainees \n     humanely, including those who are not legally entitled to \n     such treatment. . . . As a matter of policy, the United \n     States Armed Forces shall continue to treat detainees \n     humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with \n     military necessity, in a manner consistent with the \n     principles of the Geneva Conventions [governing the laws \n     of war.]\n  Second, neither Judge Gonzales nor the President have condoned nor \nadvocated nor authorized the torture of prisoners. In fact, on numerous \noccasions both have explicitly condemned torture as an abhorrent \ninterrogation technique.\n  Third, Judge Gonzales was not the author but he was the recipient of\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\nmemos focusing on methods of interrogation of captured terrorists. The \nresearch memos that have been the focus of so much attention and \ncriticism were written, not by the judge, but by the Office of Legal \nCounsel of the Department of Justice to Judge Gonzales as White House \ncounsel. Those memos explored the legal interpretation of Federal law. \nThey did not set administration policy. Indeed, the Department of \nJustice has since categorically withdrawn this legal analysis that has \nbeen interpreted by some as authorizing torture of terrorist detainees, \nstating unequivocally:\n\n       Torture is abhorrent both to American law and to \n     international norms.\n\n  Unfortunately, these facts have not gotten in the way of a barrage of \nattacks on Judge Gonzales. I am disappointed but not discouraged. I am \nconfident Judge Gonzales will be confirmed with bipartisan support. I \nam confident that as Attorney General, Judge Gonzales will continue to \nbuild on the successes of the last 4 years that we have seen in \nreducing crime and fighting corporate fraud and upholding our civil \nrights laws.\n  The judge has worked hard over the past 4 years to help America \ndefend herself from terrorist attack while respecting our \nconstitutional principles. In these uncertain times, we are fortunate \nto have a man with such high regard for the law serving our country and \nprotecting our interests.\n  In closing, former Clinton Cabinet member Henry Cisneros just this \nmonth praised Judge Gonzales as ``better qualified than many recent \nAttorneys General,'' and one who can rely on memories of humble \nbeginnings, using his words, ``to understand the realities many \nAmericans still confront in their lives.''\n  Mr. Cisneros's sentiments are widely shared. Judge Gonzales is highly \nqualified to be America's next Attorney General. He will make America \nsafer, more secure. He will lead the pursuit of justice. I urge my \ncolleagues to offer their full support to the first Hispanic-American \nAttorney General, Alberto Gonzales, the man from Humble.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S683-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we had not originally said 30 minutes \neither side, but if you need 30 minutes this morning in morning \nbusiness, that will be fine. We would like to start at 10:45, if \npossible, if that will give you adequate time.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, this past weekend we witnessed a very \nimportant step forward in Iraq, as citizens around the country turned \nout to vote for a new National Assembly. Many Iraqis appear to have \nembraced the election and I, as so many others, was encouraged to see \nmillions of them exercise their right to vote. But this past weekend's \nvote also really pushes to the forefront an important question back \nhere, right here at home, about what we are doing to take care of the \nthousands of American soldiers who are serving us so honorably in this \nstill very dangerous country.\n  Just before the elections, several news outlets reported that the \nArmy had decided to keep our troops at their current level in Iraq for \nat least another 2 years. I have one of those stories here from the \nTuesday, January 25, edition of the Washington Post. It is headlined, \n``Army plans to keep Iraq troop level through '06.''\n  I want to read a portion of that story. It says:\n\n       With the Pentagon having relied heavily on reservists to \n     fill out deployments to Iraq, military officers have warned \n     recently that the pool of available part-time soldiers is \n     dwindling. By later this year, when the Army is scheduled to \n     begin its fourth rotation of troops since the invasion in \n     March 2003, all 15 of the National Guard's most readily \n     deployable brigades will have been mobilized.\n       Although other Guard troops remain and could be tapped for \n     Iraq duty, they belong to units that historically have not \n     received the same priority in equipping and training as the \n     brigades chosen to go in the rotations so far.\n       ``It doesn't mean that the cupboard is bare,'' Lovelace \n     said. ``It just becomes a challenge then for the National \n     Guard.''\n       As the Army reaches farther down in the reserve force, \n     Lovelace said, the amount of ``pre-mobilization'' time \n     necessary to get the troops ready to send to Iraq is likely \n     to increase.\n       ``We're not going to send anybody into combat who is not \n     trained and ready'' the three-star general said. But he noted \n     that already in each rotation, the amount of pre-mobilization \n     time required has increased.\n       To continue to be able to draw on the better trained \n     reservists, Army officials have said they are considering \n     petitioning Rumsfeld to extend the 24-month limit on the \n     total time a reservist could be caned to active duty.\n\n  Madam President, I ask that the full text of the story be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 25, 2005]\n\nArmy Plans To Keep Iraq Troop Level Through '06--Year-Long Active-Duty \n                       Stints Likely To Continue\n\n                          (By Bradley Graham)\n\n       The U.S. Army expects to keep its troop strength in Iraq at \n     the current level of about 120,000 for at least two more \n     years, according to the Army's top operations officer.\n       While allowing for the possibility that the levels could \n     decrease or increase depending on security conditions and \n     other factors, Lt. Gen. James J. Lovelace Jr. told reporters \n     yesterday that the assumption of little change through 2006 \n     represents ``the most probable case.''\n       Recent disclosures that the Pentagon plans to beef up \n     training of Iraqi security forces and press them into action \n     more quickly has fueled speculation that the Bush \n     administration could be preparing to reduce the number of \n     U.S. troops significantly this year. As more Iraqi troops \n     join the fight, the thinking goes, U.S. troops could begin to \n     withdraw.\n       But Lovelace's remarks indicated that the Army is not yet \n     counting on any such reduction. Indeed, the general said, the \n     Army expects to continue rotating active-duty units in and \n     out of Iraq in year-long deployments and is looking for ways \n     to dip even deeper into reserve forces--even as leaders ofthe \n     reserves have warned that the Pentagon could be running out \n     of such units.\n       ``We're making the assumption that the level of effort is \n     going to continue,'' Lovelace said.\n       In a related development, Senate and House aides said \n     yesterday that the White House will announce today plans to \n     request an additional $80 billion to finance the wars in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan. That would come on top of $25 billion \n     already appropriated for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. \n     White House budget spokesman Chad Kolton declined to comment.\n       White House budget director Joshua B. Bolten is to describe \n     the package to lawmakers today, but the budget request will \n     come later, the aides said. Administration\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\n     officials have said privately for several weeks that they \n     will seek the additional funding, the result of continuing \n     high costs incurred battling an unexpectedly strong \n     insurgency in Iraq.\n       Lovelace, who assumed his post of deputy chief of staff for \n     operations in October, spoke to a small group of Pentagon \n     reporters in what had been billed as an informal ``meet and \n     greet'' session. The conversation quickly focused on the \n     Army's planning for Iraq.\n       The number of U.S. Army and other forces in Iraq rose to \n     150,000 last month in what Pentagon officials described as an \n     effort to bolster security ahead of Iraqi elections this \n     weekend.\n       Lovelace made it clear that the Army's assumption about \n     future U.S. force levels was not meant to prejudge likely \n     trends in either Iraq's security situation or development of \n     its security services. He said the planning is intended to \n     ensure that enough units would be ready if needed and to give \n     U.S. troops a basis on which to organize their own lives.\n       ``It's really about us providing the predictability to our \n     own soldiers,'' he said. ``It has nothing to do with the \n     Iraqi army; it has everything to do with our own \n     institutional agility.''\n       Asked about the Army's assumption, Lawrence T. Di Rita, the \n     Pentagon's main spokesman, said he was ``not surprised'' to \n     hear that the Army has chosen such a number, noting the need \n     for service leaders to do such planning. ``But it's not going \n     to be the Army's determination,'' he said. ``Ultimately, the \n     determination will be made by the commanders'' in the field.\n       Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's belief, Di Rita \n     added, ``is that we will continue to see Iraqi security \n     forces grow in capability. We will continue to see the need \n     for the foreseeable period ahead to have a significant \n     commitment of U.S. assistance as that capability develops. \n     But there isn't anybody who has made any determination about \n     timing or numbers.''\n       Rumsfeld and other senior officials are reviewing \n     recommendations from Army Gen. Gary Luck about measures to \n     accelerate the training and boost the performance of the \n     Iraqi security forces. Luck, who has returned to Washington \n     after visiting Iraq last week, has endorsed plans by field \n     commanders to increase the number of trainers substantially. \n     But this increase is to come by shifting the missions of U.S. \n     troops already assigned to Iraq rather than by deploying more \n     forces, officials said.\n       ``I don't think anyone has a notion that we're talking \n     about forces in addition to what's already out there,'' Di \n     Rita said. ``It's a question of how to use those forces in a \n     different way.''\n       With the Pentagon having relied heavily on reservists to \n     fill out deployments to Iraq, military officers have warned \n     recently that the pool of available part-time soldiers is \n     dwindling. By later this year, when the Army is scheduled to \n     begin its fourth rotation of troops since the invasion in \n     March 2003, all 15 of the National Guard's most readily \n     deployable brigades will have been mobilized.\n       Although other Guard troops remain and could be tapped for \n     Iraq duty, they belong to units that historically have not \n     received the same priority in equipping and training as the \n     brigades chosen to go in the rotations so far.\n       ``It doesn't mean that the cupboard is bare,'' Lovelace \n     said. ``It just becomes a challenge then for the National \n     Guard.''\n       As the Army reaches farther down in the reserve force, \n     Lovelace said, the amount of ``pre-mobilization'' time \n     necessary to get the troops ready to send to Iraq is likely \n     to increase.\n       ``We're not going to send anybody into combat who is not \n     trained and ready,'' the three-star general said. But he \n     noted that already in each rotation, the amount of pre-\n     mobilization time required has increased.\n       To continue to be able to draw on the better trained \n     reservists, Army officials have said they are considering \n     petitioning Rumsfeld to extend the 24-month limit on the \n     total time a reservist could be called to active duty.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the effect of that policy is very \nclear. It means longer deployments, more time away from home, and a \nfurther strain on our entire military.\n  It is no secret that some of our soldiers are hit especially hard by \nthis news. I am talking, of course, about our Guard and Reserve \nsoldiers who have already faced extended deployments and long stretches \naway from their jobs, away from their homes, away from their families. \nWe honor all of our troops serving overseas, but I am very concerned \nthat these Guard and Reserve soldiers are not receiving some basic \nservices and help that they have earned--basic services and help they \nmost certainly deserve.\n  Last week I reintroduced legislation to increase services and \nbenefits to members of the National Guard and Reserves when they are \ncalled to active duty. I offered this Guard and Reserve Enhancement \nBenefits Act last year to expand health care, education, financial \nbenefits, and family assistance to help ease the burden on our Guard \nmembers and their families.\n  We made some progress in the Senate last year, but those important \nprovisions were never signed into law. Now, in this new Congress, we \nhave another opportunity to provide for our Guard men and women, our \nreservists, and all their families. This coincides with the \nintroduction of S. 11, the first Democratic bill for this Congress. It \nis the first Democratic bill of this Congress to help increase \nprotections for our troops and Reserve members.\n  Thousands of citizen soldiers from across my home State of Washington \nhave been called to active duty over the past 2 years. These very brave \nmen and women and their families deserve the same support that other \nmilitary units receive when they sacrifice to serve our country. My \nbill tells Guard and Reserve members across America that we are \ncommitted to providing them and their families with the health, \nfinancial, and social support services necessary to get through this \ndifficult time.\n  According to the Pentagon, 239,000 National Guard members have been \ncalled to active duty. Currently, 192,500 Guard and Reserve members are \nserving on active duty as part of Operation Enduring Freedom and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Thousands of Washington State Guard members \nhave been activated over the past 2 years. This is the largest \nactivation since World War II.\n  Hundreds of Washington State reservists have also been activated, and \n150 local Marine Corps reservists will soon be deployed to Iraq as part \nof the Yakima-based Bravo Company 4th Tank Battalion. That is why this \nlegislation is so important at this time.\n  As many other Members, I have sat and talked to our reservists as \nthey have been called up, and I have talked with their families who \nhave been left behind. It is critical that we provide the support and \nservices they need so they can do this important job that this country \nhas asked them to do.\n  My legislation would begin by extending the current Family and \nMedical Leave Act protections to the spouses of guardsmen and \nreservists called to extended active duty. This is really important. \nThe families who are left behind are struggling as single parents to \ntry to raise their family. They should not have to worry about losing \ntheir jobs and their income when their loved one is sent overseas. So \nthe first part of our bill simply extends the Family and Medical Leave \nAct protections so these spouses who are left behind can take care of \nthe issues they need to take care of as their spouse is called \noverseas.\n  Second, it provides childcare assistance grants to parents or \nguardians of dependents of guardsmen and Reservists called to active \nduty. This is really important. Most of these Guard and Reserve members \nare not on a base, so they don't have access to childcare facilities \nthat Regular Army and other people have on the base. They are out in \nour communities, across my State and across this country.\n  So child care is especially important to them when their spouses are \nsent overseas and they are left with how to deal with child care--an \nissue that is always critical to families.\n  It becomes extremely critical when you lose half of your family, when \nthey go to a place that can't help with child care. Childcare \nassistance grants are an important part of our package.\n  My bill also expands the GI bill for members of the Guard and \nReserves who are called to active duty for 12 consecutive months or 24 \nmonths out of a 60-month period.\n  This is something that is really important. When we send these men \nand women overseas to serve, they should have access to the GI bill \nwhen they return so they can enhance their own lives and get a job and \nbe productive members of our society.\n  Next, our bill provides relief from interest and defers payments of \nunsubsidized student loans.\n  I met with Reserve members before they left. Many of them were \nstudents or were just finishing college, and they were extremely \nworried about how they were going to pay their student loans while they \nwere deployed, or when they returned before they would be able to get \nback into the job market and have a steady income. We put special help \nin our bill for these men and women who serve us by providing relief \nfrom interest and defer payments of unsubsidized student loans so they \ncan\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\nget their lives back together when they return before they start to pay \nback their obligation.\n  Next, our bill requires any college receiving Federal funds to offer \nstudents returning from active-duty service readmission without penalty \nor additional fees.\n  You can imagine, if you are in college attending classes and you are \ncalled up to serve your country as a member of the Guard and Reserve, \nyou are concerned that when you return you will not be able to get back \ninto that school and finish the college degree that you started. Our \nbill provides assurance to these students who have been called up that \nthey will be readmitted into any college that receives Federal funds, \nso they will know when they return that they can continue their lives.\n  Next, we reduce the age for members of the Guard and Reserve to \nreceive retirement pay. This is a critical issue for many of our Guard \nand Reserve families who face extreme hardship as their family member \nserves overseas. We want to make sure they can receive retirement pay \nat an age that benefits them.\n  Next, our bill requires the Federal Government to cover the pay \ndifferential for Federal employees who are called to active duty. When \nI talked to these Guard and Reserve family members, they were worried \nabout how they were going to make sure their families would be able to \npay the mortgage on their home, or how they were going to pay their \nschool costs and put food on the table because of the reduced pay from \nthe Government.\n  This bill will make sure the Federal Government that is calling these \nmembers up to serve pays the differential for our Federal employees so \nthey do not lose income while they serve this country overseas.\n  Next, our bill allows employers to claim up to $15,000 in tax credits \nfor the pay deferential of Guard and Reserve members. Across this \ncountry and in my home State, we have many businesses that have \nemployees who have been called up to go overseas and serve their \ncountry. It is especially difficult for small businesses that lose \ntheir employees for 6 months, for 12 months, or longer. And this bill \nprovides a tax credit to help them make up the pay of those employees \nwhen they go overseas.\n\n  Finally, our bill makes access to TRICARE permanent for all members \nof the Guard and Reserve and their families, regardless of employment \nor insurance status. This is an extremely important provision of this \nbill.\n  I think probably the No. 1 issue I heard from these families as I \ntalked to them was, What do I need to do about our health care? We had \nour health care under a member who has been called to serve overseas. \nWhen we lose that, how do we transition? What do we do about a sick \nchild with ongoing illnesses and family members with health care \nchallenges? How do we get through this?\n  I think it is important that this year we enact into legislation \nassurance for the family members of those who serve overseas that their \nfamily left behind will have access to TRICARE and health care.\n  Tours of duty are being extended and new units are being deployed. I \nbelieve we have an obligation to ease the burden for these Guard and \nReserve families.\n  Supporting our troops means more than just passing multibillion-\ndollar supplemental appropriations bills whenever the President asks. \nSupporting our troops must also mean that we look after the soldier and \nhis family's well-being back at home. It means ensuring they get \nquality education, it means ensuring they get good health care, and it \nmeans access to a job, and childcare for their families.\n  I have spoken many times on this floor and in every corner of my \nState about the need to take care of our troops. Oftentimes, that means \nsupplementing our floundering veterans care system. I talked about it \non the floor extensively last week.\n  But with this legislation I am talking about today, we have an \nopportunity to provide help where it is needed now--help for the \nthousands of heroes and their families who are dedicating their lives \nto all of us by serving us around the globe.\n  I hope my colleagues will support our efforts. I look forward to \nworking with anyone who will help move this legislation this year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we were encouraged to learn yesterday that \nthe administration has announced that it will support an increase in \ndeath benefits for our troops and their families. This has been a \npriority for the Democrats in Congress as well as many Republican \nSenators who have suggested it.\n  I have cosponsored legislation with Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio \nproposing increases in death benefits as well as health insurance and \neducational assistance for the families of those soldiers who lose \ntheir lives in service to our country.\n  In fact, one of the highest priorities on the Democratic side is a \nsecond bill standing with our troops which embodies that particular \nproposal that the President endorsed yesterday. But there is a lot more \nthat needs to be done.\n  In the bill on the Democratic side, we proposed that there be \nadditional provisions for our troops, and Guard and Reserve forces and \ntheir military families and American veterans. Unfortunately, we have \nnot heard from the administration that they support these other \nproposals.\n  Let me tell you, though it is incredible to believe, if a soldier \ngives his life in service to his country today in combat, that \nsoldier's family is entitled under the law to $12,000 in death annuity \nbenefits--tax-free death benefits. Twelve thousand dollars is hardly \nenough to give to a spouse and her children when a soldier dies in \ncombat. We have proposed that be increased at least to $100,000. I \nsupport a proposal that it also be increased by $25,000 for each \ndependent; that life insurance, if you can acknowledge that, is \nvirtually the same thing--that this death benefit is going to be \nadequate to help that family through some extraordinarily challenging \nfinancial circumstances.\n  The bill that the Senate Democrats have proposed, S. 11, would also \ninclude systemic improvements to the Pentagon's ability to manufacture \nand distribute the best equipment to our troops, including $7 billion \nfor the Army and Marine Corps to replace equipment destroyed in Iraq.\n  This provision will ensure that we pay death gratuities to fewer \nfamilies in the future. Keeping our troops safe is the best thing to do \nto bring those soldiers home with their mission accomplished, and being \nattentive to the issue raised by the Tennessee Guardsman who stood up \njust a few weeks ago and asked Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Why do I have \nto rummage through a dump to find pieces of metal to put on the side of \nmy Humvee to protect myself? It was an embarrassing moment for the \nSecretary and for our country to think we spent billions of dollars and \nsent 251,000 of our best and bravest into harm's way in Iraq and have \nthis circumstance.\n  We believe we must, in the first instance, let our troops have the \ntraining and the equipment they need to be safe. In addition, Democrats \nbelieve they should have full access to military TRICARE benefits, all \nreservists and their families. TRICARE is the health insurance for the \nmilitary. There is a limitation. For example, if a combat soldier dies \nin the line of duty, the TRICARE benefits or health care benefits are \nextended to his dependents only for a 3-year period. That is \nunrealistic. If you have a young child in a family who lost a soldier \noverseas, we believe the TRICARE benefits should be extended until that \nyoung person reaches the age of 21. I believe it should be age 23 if \nthey are going to college. That is a reasonable proposal. It was not in \nthe suggestion of the administration yesterday, but we believe it \nshould be included.\n\n  We also believe there should be tax incentives for private companies \nto make up the difference between civilian and active military pay when \nthe reservists and guardsmen are called to duty, and a requirement that \nthe Federal Government do the same.\n  This is a project that is near and dear to my heart. Twice on the \nfloor of the Senate I had an amendment passed that said the Federal \nGovernment should make up the difference in pay for Federal employees \nwho are activated as guardsmen or reservists to\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nserve in Iraq and other places around the world. We salute all the \nprivate companies that do that. Sears & Roebuck is a good example, and \nmany others in my State--and many units of State and local government. \nBut it is shameful to know and acknowledge that the Federal Government \ndoes not make up the difference in pay.\n  How can we say that all of these other companies did the right thing \nby standing by their employees who are risking their lives for America \nand the Federal Government does not do the same thing?\n  If someone has a pay check for $60,000 a year working for the Federal \nGovernment, and they are a member of the Illinois National Guard and \nactivated for service and their military pay is only $40,000 a year, I \nbelieve the Federal Government should make up the difference of $20,000 \na year. Private companies do it; State governments do it; local units \nof government do it. Why doesn't the Federal Government do it?\n  Twice we passed an amendment on the floor only to see it die in \nconference committee. I think it is important that this finally pass.\n  In addition, we want to repeal the prohibition against receipt of \nboth the Survivor Benefit Plan and the Dependent and Indemnity \nCompensation so the soldiers can receive the full amount of the \nsurvivor benefit owed to them. We want to have full concurrent receipt \nfor all disabled military retirees of both disability compensation and \nretirement provisions. We also want to guarantee funding for veterans \nhealth care.\n  We made a promise to the veterans of America--those who will be \nveterans and who are serving today, and those who served in the past. \nWe promised that we will stand by them for their health care in the \nfuture. We have to put the money in our budget to make that promise \ngood.\n  Finally, we want to expand the mental health services. This provision \nwhich we support will improve resources available to the estimated one \nout of every six military personnel in Iraq who are at risk of dealing \nwith posttraumatic stress disorder.\n  It is a sad fact of life that many of these soldiers who witnessed \nhorrendous events come back trying to resolve in their own minds the \nhorror they have witnessed. We need to stand with them and give them a \nhelping hand. I think that should be part of this administration's \nproposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S686-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S686-S687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, another issue that is, of course, timely \nand is brought up on a regular basis is the future of Social Security.\n  I believe there is a problem with Social Security. The President has \nsaid the same. However, I don't believe President Bush's plan to \nprivatize Social Security is going to help. I think it is going to make \nthe problem even worse.\n  Social Security should be strengthened, not weakened. Why isn't \nPresident Bush's plan the right way to save Social Security?\n  First, President Bush's plan would make deep cuts in the benefit paid \nunder Social Security and in the process dramatically increase the \ndeficit. The President's privatization plan for Social Security diverts \nmoney from the Social Security trust fund and creates an immediate \ncash-flow problem affecting seniors and those who are retiring right \nnow.\n  We know that untouched the Social Security Program will pay every \nbenefit promised with the cost-of-living adjustment until the year \n2042, at a minimum. Some estimate 2052. For 37 to 47 years, Social \nSecurity is sound and solvent.\n  In comes President Bush who says we need to change Social Security. \nWe need to take money out of the Social Security trust fund and allow \npeople to create private accounts.\n  Private accounts may have some value. But what about the money the \nPresident just took out of Social Security? Unfortunately, the \nPresident has not suggested how we would pay back that money to Social \nSecurity. As a result of the President's proposal, if the Social \nSecurity trust fund is diminished in size and weakened, unfortunately, \nit will run out of money even sooner than the projection of 2042.\n\n  President Bush's plan to privatize Social Security does not make it \nstronger, it makes it weaker. The President cannot explain how he will \nmake up for the money that he takes out of the Social Security trust \nfund. The President's privatization plan will cost up to $2 trillion in \nthe first 10 years, and then up to $5 trillion in the second 10 years. \nIt is an extremely expensive proposal.\n  Where would we come up with the money to make up the difference, $2 \nto $5 trillion? The President suggested we add it to the national debt, \na national debt which has already reached a record level. How do we \ntake care of our national debt? Who comes in and loans money to make up \nfor a national debt? Mainly foreign governments; No. 1, Japan, China, \nand Korea. The President's proposal to privatize Social Security not \nonly weakens Social Security, it creates a greater debt for Americans \nand forces us to be more dependent on foreign governments to loan us \nmoney. That is the only way we sustain our national debt today. That, \nof course, is a challenge. If those foreign governments, for whatever \nreason, decide not to buy America's debt, we are in a perilous \nposition. We will have ourselves a debt and a situation where our \ninterest rates will have to go up substantially to attract others to \nbuy our debt.\n  That is not where America should be. That $2 trillion deficit will \nnot bring us any closer to Social Security solvency. In fact, it makes \nthe Social Security system that much weaker.\n  The President has said over and over his plan to privatize Social \nSecurity is voluntary. If you do not want to create a private account \nwith the President's plan, he says you do not have to. That may be, \nbut, understand, when the President takes money out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund leading to benefit cuts, those benefit cuts are \ngoing to affect people whether or not they choose to have a private \naccount. To say it is voluntary is to overlook the obvious. The cost of \nthis privatization plan will affect every Social Security retiree \nwhether or not they want to sign up for President Bush's privatization \nplan.\n  The President argues Americans will do better in the stock market \nthan they would if they wait for Social Security benefits. That is \npossible, but there are risks attached to investment. Every ad on \ntelevision for a mutual fund or investment says the same thing: Past \nperformance is no indication of future return. What they are saying is, \nthere is risk involved. If you put your life savings, your retirement \nsavings, into a private account under President Bush's plan, you may \ncome out ahead, but then again you may not.\n  Relying on Wall Street is like playing retirement roulette. You may \nguess right, you may come out ahead, but those who are invested in \nmutual funds in the stock market over the last 4 or 5 years know there \nhave been probably more losers than winners.\n  Keep in mind that under the President's plan, part of all of your \nretirement savings invested are going to be paid to Wall Street \nstockbrokers for so-called administrative fees that can reduce your \nbenefits by 25 percent--a windfall for Wall Street at the expense of \nretirees across America.\n\n  Democrats want to encourage and support retirement accounts not at \nthe expense of Social Security but in addition to Social Security. We \nshould change the Tax Code to encourage people to save, encourage \npeople to create individual retirement accounts, 401(k) plans. We can \ndo that but not at the expense of Social Security--in addition to \nSocial Security.\n  Some say private accounts would be more efficient. Keep in mind the \nPresident's Commission on Social Security came up with the only plan we \nhave for private accounts so far, and they would call for a massive new \nGovernment agency to administer these Social Security private accounts. \nThis Government board will control the investment accounts of some 47 \nmillion Americans and administer the program. The private accounts will \ncost the average senior $134,000 in lost Social Security benefits over \na 20-year period. This is not the great positive thing that has been \nportrayed.\n  Young people like to invest money. That is a good thing. Savings and \ninvestment ought to be encouraged, particularly by young people. We \nneed to make certain we do not have savings and investment at the \nexpense of retirement benefits that workers have\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\npaid for over their lifetime. People following this debate every day \npay into Social Security with the understanding when they retire, this \nis going to be something they can count on. They may not be able to \nlive in luxury with Social Security, but it is the nest egg, the \ncornerstone of your retirement income. The idea behind Social Security \nis still a sound idea. We should keep Social Security strong, we should \nstrengthen it and do it on a bipartisan basis, but not at the expense \nof cutting benefits. That is what President Bush's privatization plan \nwill do in addition to creating $2 trillion in additional debt. That \ndoes not help Social Security; in fact, it weakens Social Security. \nThat should not be our goal.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S687-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    staff sergeant Brian Bland, USMC\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I today to express our Nation's deepest \nthanks and gratitude to a special young man and his family. I recently \nreceived word that on January 26, 2005, Marine SSgt Brian Bland of \nNewcastle, WY died in the line of duty while serving his country in the \nwar on terrorism. SSgt Bland was killed, along with 30 of his brothers \nin arms when the CH 53E Super Stallion helicopter they were riding in \ncrashed in western Iraq. The Marines were on their way to provide \nsecurity operations for the recent Iraqi elections.\n  SSgt Bland was member of 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment out of \nHawaii. He grew up in Newcastle and joined the Marine Corps after \ngraduating from high school there in 1995. he had re-enlisted twice. He \nheld a profound sense of duty and knew he was doing the right thing, \ntelling family members shortly before the crash that he felt good about \nwhat he was doing in Iraq. He was very proud of being a Marine and had \nplanned to stay in the service until he retired. He is remembered as \none who enjoyed motorcycles and was friendly to everyone, and he took \nevery opportunity to return to visit family and friends in Wyoming and \nSouth Dakota.\n  Because of people like Brian Bland we continue to live safe and free. \nAmerica's men and women who answer the call of service and wear our \nNation's uniform deserve respect and recognition for the enormous \nburden that they willingly bear. Our people put everything on the line \neveryday, and because of these folks, our Nation remains free and \nstrong in the face of danger.\n  The motto of the Marine Corps is ``Semper Fidelis.'' It means \n``Always Faithful.'' Through his selfless and courageous sacrifice, \nStaff Sergeant Brian Bland lived up to those words with great honor in \nthat he willingly gave the last full measure so that others could live \nin freedom and liberty.\n  SSgt Bland is survived by his wife Stacey, his mother Beverly and \nstepfather Mark, his brother Jeremy, his grandmother Emma Lee, and his \nbrothers of the United States Marine Corps. We say goodbye to a \nhusband, a son, a brother, a Marine, and an American. Our Nation pays \nits deepest respect to SSgt Brian Bland for his courage, his love of \ncountry and his sacrifice, so that we may remain free. He was a hero in \nlife and he remains a hero in death. All of Wyoming, and indeed the \nentire Nation, is proud of him.\n   So from one Marine to another, SSgt Bland, Semper Fi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S687-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORPORAL NATHAN SCHUBERT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nAlberto Gonzales to be our next Attorney General. Certainly his life \nstory embodies the American dream: Son of immigrant farmers, the first \nin his family to go to college, attended Rice University, Harvard Law \nSchool, now nominee to be our Nation's first Hispanic top law \nenforcement officer.\n  I am troubled by some remarks unfairly distorting his honorable \nrecord. I am concerned, as well, that the Senate is losing some of its \ncivility, which is what makes our Chamber unique.\n  I cannot think of anyone who would do a better job than this man as \nU.S. Attorney General. I support him.\n  I yield to my friend from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Could the Senator arrange some more snow to Montana?\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are not ready yet.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am in support of the nomination of Judge \nAlberto Gonzales for Attorney General of the United States. We have all \nheard his life story. I can relate to that somewhat because he grew up \nin Texas. I grew up in Missouri, starting out on 160 acres consisting \nof two rocks and dirt. He comes to this job with a different \nperspective.\n  When we look down the line of the nominees the President has sent to \nthe Senate for confirmation, we can see there are a lot of calluses, a \nlot of dirt under their fingernails. That is what he brings to this \njob.\n  We congratulate the former Attorney General. John Ashcroft has done a \nwonderful job on the heels of September 11. As the primary law \nenforcement officer, he was not only in charge of law enforcement on \nthe domestic side but had a lot to do around the world with the \ncollection of intelligence, coordinating, protecting.\n  We are in a time where we do not get smacked and then just simply \npick up the pieces and continue. We are in the business of preempting \nactivities. When these nominees come with a different perspective, a \nground-level perspective, everything they do touches American lives.\n  I commend Judge Gonzales for accepting the President's call to \nservice. It is a thankless job if you look at the dollars. Yet it \ncarries with it great responsibilities.\n  We are quickly learning how to adapt to the threat of terrorism. In \nan attempt to make all Americans safe, we have changed policy and \ngovernment structure dramatically. In a free society, a mobile society \nthis makes our job even more difficult.\n  The groundwork we have laid and will continue to build upon is what \nmakes us a great nation. The United States is a world model for picking \nup the pieces, adapting to new challenges.\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\nI am hopeful and confident Judge Gonzales will continue that legacy in \nhis new position. He is a man of great integrity. I encourage all my \ncolleagues to entrust him with the honor and responsibility of being \nour next Attorney General.\n  I also take a few moments to formally thank Attorney General John \nAshcroft for his tremendous service the past 4 years. I have a personal \nrelationship with the Ashcroft family and understand what he went \nthrough in the last 4 years. He has done his job with great dedication \nand integrity. He is a man who put the right people in the right places \nat the right time.\n  He has served us well. He reorganized the Department of Justice with \nnew directives, new directors. I thank him. His friendship, his service \nto the country, should not go unnoticed and unappreciated. He has done \na tremendous job in very stressful times. I venture to say for an \nAttorney General, no time has been more stressful than the time John \nAshcroft has hung his hat as Attorney General downtown.\n  We welcome the nominee. We have the highest hopes for him. We wish \nhim not only good luck but good hunting. We also thank the outgoing \nAttorney General.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GONZALES TO BE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 10:45 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session for \nthe consideration of Executive Calendar No. 8, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Alberto R. \nGonzales, of Texas, to be Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are proceeding at the moment to the \nnomination of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States of America. He had served as a judge on \nthe Supreme Court of Texas and has been commonly referred to as Judge \nGonzales, which I shall do during the course of my presentation.\n  Judge Gonzales, 49, comes to this nomination to be the chief law \nenforcement officer of the United States with an extraordinary record.\n  He was one of eight children, sharing a two-room living quarters with \ntheir parents. They had no hot water, no telephone. He pursued an \nacademic career, first at the military academy; then at Rice \nUniversity, where he graduated; and then at the Harvard Law School.\n  He went into the private practice of law and then was asked by then-\nGovernor George Bush to work with him in the Governor's office.\n  Judge Gonzales then, as noted, was a justice of the Supreme Court of \nTexas. With the election of Governor Bush to the White House, Judge \nGonzales has been White House Counsel for the last 4 years.\n  It is not irrelevant to note that Judge Gonzales would be the first \nHispanic to be Attorney General of the United States. That is quite a \ndramatic rise in the legal community.\n  When I was elected district attorney of Philadelphia some time ago, \nin 1965, there was not a single Hispanic lawyer in Philadelphia. At \nthat time, I made an effort of outreach to bring minority \nrepresentation into the district attorney's office as assistants and \ncould not find a single Hispanic. So there has been a great deal of \nprogress. Now there are Hispanic Federal judges in Philadelphia, State \ncourt judges, city solicitors, prominent attorneys, but Judge Gonzales \nwould be the first Hispanic to be Attorney General of the United \nStates, if confirmed.\n  He will bring, I think, a unique perspective because of his minority \nstatus. I think he would have a broader view, a different view on civil \nrights. We have an issue which is subject to some congressional \noversight where some 762 alien detainees were rounded up after\n\n9/11, and according to a report by the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Defense, there was never any showing of connection to \nterrorism or to al-Qaida or to any reason for their detention.\n  While we know we live in a very dangerous world, there has to be some \nreason--it may not be as strong as probable cause for an arrest, or \nprobable cause for search and seizure, or even sufficiency for stop and \nfrisk--but there has to be a reason for detention. That is something of \nwhich I think Judge Gonzales might have some greater perspective.\n  Judge Gonzales, I think, also would be expected to have a broader \nview on the immigration laws, being Hispanic, being from Texas, seeing \nthe kinds of problems which are present both from the point of view of \nstopping illegal immigrants and also from the point of view of \nimmigrants who come to this country who seek a better way of life.\n  Similarly, I think he might have some greater insights into voting \nrights. He took a position broadly viewed as divergent from the \nadministration on affirmative action in the controversial cases \ninvolving the University of Michigan. Affirmative action, always a \ncomplicated, controversial subject, but one where differing views and a \nbroader perspective is a quality that would be well served in the \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  He also took a broader view on the issue of what was required on \nparental notification under the Texas statute, drawing opposition from \nsome on the so-called right of the party. There again, a little \ndifferent view and a little broader view reflective of his background \nand his own attitudes.\n  A great deal of the hearing process on Judge Gonzales has been \ninvolved on the issue of compliance with the Geneva Convention, on \ncompliance with the statutes of the United States which prohibit \ntorture. A great deal has been made of a statement made by Judge \nGonzales with respect to the Geneva Conventions. He has been broadly \nquoted on a statement that some of the Geneva Convention's limitations \nare obsolete or quaint. In an opinion which he circulated, he said \nthis:\n\n       In my judgment, this new paradigm--\n\n  referring to what has happened after 9/11--\n\n     renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning \n     of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions.\n\n  That part of the statement is the one always quoted, and the comment \non ``quaint'' and the comment on ``obsolete'' have drawn a lot of \ncriticism. But almost nowhere has there been a followup on what he was \nreferring to. But what he said, continuing:\n\n     . . . renders quaint some of its provisions requiring that \n     captured enemy be afforded such things as commissary \n     privileges, scrip--i.e., advances of monthly pay--athletic \n     uniforms and scientific instruments.\n\n  Well, when you see the reference here to ``items like commissary \nprivileges,'' I don't know that that would be exactly something to be \nconcerned about on a prisoner, or scrip or advances of monthly pay or \nathletic uniforms or scientific instruments. So in that context, to say \nit is ``quaint'' or ``obsolete'' is not to challenge the underlying \nprovisions of the Geneva Convention on its important substantive \nprovisions.\n  In Judge Gonzales's statements and testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee, he has been very emphatic about his personal opposition to \ntorture and about the opposition of the administration to torture. He \nhas been emphatic on his opposition to transporting detainees to other \ncountries which permit torture to enable detainees to be tortured in \nother countries where they could not be under the auspices of the \nUnited States. He has been explicit in articulating the view that the \nCIA is bound by the same rules prohibiting torture as anyone else.\n  He has come under considerable criticism for the so-called Bybee \nmemorandum which was issued in August of 2002, signed by Jay Bybee, \nthen Assistant Attorney General of the United States, where the \nmemorandum was requested so that there would be a full\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nstatement and an understanding of what the law required to comply with \nthe statutes prohibiting torture in the United States.\n  That memorandum was erroneous in its legal conclusions, as has been \ngenerally agreed to, and has been withdrawn by the Department of \nJustice. The interpretation of what constituted torture was very \nextreme, referring to the kind of excruciating pain and loss of bodily \nfunction, certainly not a realistic or an adequate or a definition of \ntorture which would withstand legal analysis or legal scrutiny.\n  The memorandum was extreme and excessive in a statement, an \narticulation of executive power. One example was the statement that the \nPresident of the United States had as much authority on questioning of \ndetainees as the President had on battlefield decisions, which \nobviously makes no sense. When you talk about a battlefield decision, \nthat is a prerogative of the Commander in Chief, as it is delegated \ndown through field commanders. But that kind of authority does not \nreside in the President on an issue such as the questioning of \ndetainees.\n\n  The memo went quite far in suggesting that the President had \nauthority to ignore statutes if he felt they were unconstitutional. \nThere has been some question raised, although it is not explicit in the \nBybee memo, about the authority of the President to immunize those who \nviolate the law. That certainly is not lawful. When you talk about \nimmunizing, you talk about judicial action in the context where there \nis a statute by the Congress of the United States authorizing immunity \nin a given context, immunity from criminal prosecution to disclose some \ninformation, but there is no suggestion anywhere that the President has \nthe authority to immunize executive branch officials from noncompliance \nwith the law.\n  We find Judge Gonzales essentially working as White House counsel, \nworking for the President in a role which he was very emphatic in \ndistinguishing from the role of the Attorney General of the United \nStates. As Attorney General he has a responsibility to represent all of \nthe people. As counsel to the President, as White House counsel, his \nresponsibility is limited only to the President.\n  The memorandum by the Department of Justice was requested in order to \nhave the legal interpretation as to what the appropriate line of \nquestioning could be in order to be in compliance with the law. That \nwas the role of the Department of Justice. It was not the role of Judge \nGonzales. Then the decision as to what the questions would be, what the \ninterrogation would be is the role of the Department of Defense, again, \nnot the role of Judge Gonzales.\n  Judge Gonzales has been very forthcoming, being available and meeting \nwith some 27 Senators, which is said to be a record in being available \nto everyone on the Judiciary Committee and beyond, submitting to up to \nfour rounds of questioning, 10 rounds each, and then in some cases the \nthird round of 15, and in one case the fourth round of 22 minutes, and \nthen responding to very broad questions, with the New York Times \ncommenting that the responses of more than 200 pages of answers to \nquestions was the most expansive view by the administration of its \ntechniques and procedures on the questioning of detainees. So there is \nno doubt that Judge Gonzales has responded very broadly to the \ninquiries made of him.\n  There has been a challenge that he has not answered all the questions \nbecause he could not recall specific conversations which were held \nyears before, but that is entirely understandable.\n  There were questions about discussions where representatives of the \nexecutive branch got together to discuss the specifics of the \nDepartment of Justice memorandum and the interrogation techniques to be \nemployed by the Department of Defense. One of his answers to one of the \nwritten questions propounded gives a fair summary in a fairly \nabbreviated form as to Judge Gonzales's role. These are his words:\n\n       Shortly after September 11, 2001, until the present, the \n     administration has been involved in conducting the war on \n     terror by gathering as much information from terrorists as we \n     possibly can within the bounds of law. During that time, I \n     have participated in several meetings at which possible uses \n     of methods of questioning were discussed. These meetings may \n     have included from time to time representatives from the \n     National Security Council, the Department of State, the \n     Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, and others. In the meetings I attended, \n     agencies' representatives raised concerns that certain \n     terrorists had information that might save American lives. \n     The participants shared a desire to explore whether there \n     existed methods of questioning these terrorists that might \n     elicit that information. It was always very clear that we \n     would implement such methods only within the bounds of the \n     law.\n\n  That would bear repeating, ``always very clear that we would \nimplement such methods only within the bounds of the law.'' Judge \nGonzales continues:\n\n       As counsel to the President, my constant emphasis and \n     interest was on the last factor, ensuring compliance with the \n     law. It would not have been appropriate for me to comment on \n     issues such as whether a particular individual may have \n     information that would be helpful to the effort to save \n     American lives or to defeat terrorists or whether a certain \n     procedure for questioning that individual would be effective \n     in eliciting that information. Others with more relevant \n     experience, expertise, and information were responsible for \n     making those judgments. Instead it was my responsibility to \n     ensure that any method they deemed appropriate and effective \n     from an operational point of view was considered lawful by \n     the Department of Justice. To the extent I was involved in \n     recommendations, results, and assignments arising out of such \n     meetings, my activities were directed toward ensuring that \n     those with operational responsibilities would act only after \n     receiving the judgment of the Department of Defense that a \n     proposed course of action was lawful.\n\n  That is the end of Judge Gonzales's statement on that. His role was \nreasonably, clearly delineated. He represented the President. He was \nresponsible for saying what were the outlines of the law, or what was \nlawful. Those practices were defined by the Department of Justice \nOffice of Legal Counsel, which has the responsibility to do that. And \nthen anything beyond the legal techniques of the questions would lie \nwith those who have the expertise, as he described it, and the \nexperience, and the responsibility from the Department of Justice or \nfrom the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  There was one other statement by Judge Gonzales in response to a \nquestion by Senator Kennedy, which I think is a summary, which \ndelineates his own role. When asked about a specific newspaper article \nand about events that occurred several years before, Judge Gonzales \nreplied:\n  Sir, I don't have any specific recollection. I read the same article. \nI don't know whether or not it was the CIA [that was in reference as to \nwhether it was a CIA request]. What I can say is that after this war \nbegan against this new kind of threat, this new kind of enemy, we \nrealized that there was a premium on receiving information. In many \nways, this war on terror is a war about information. If we have \ninformation, we can defeat the enemy. We had captured some really bad \npeople who we were concerned had information that might prevent the \nloss of American lives in the future. It was important to receive that \ninformation, and people at the agencies wanted to be sure that they \nwould not do anything that would violate our legal obligations, so they \ndid the right thing; they asked questions--what is lawful conduct, \nbecause we don't do anything that violates the law.\n  So here again is a capsule statement of Judge Gonzales's role. He is \nrepresenting the President. He is not looking to determine what the \nappropriate scope of conduct is. That is a matter to be determined by \nthose who are involved in questioning the detainees.\n  That is the essence of what I believe--to be succinct and to the \npoint of the issue. There are a great many other responses that could \nbe read, a great many other arguments that could be advanced. I will \nreserve further responses on this matter as the course of the argument \ndevelops.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Hatch, for coming early in the \nproceedings to make a cogent argument.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to state my support \nfor the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  First, I would like to describe Judge Gonzales's personal background. \nHe has had an extraordinary life and career. His personal story is one \nof dedication and courage--the sort of story\n\n[[Page S690]]\n\nthat is possible only in America, where the dreams of even the most \nhumble citizens can be achieved through hard work and discipline.\n  Judge Gonzales was born in San Antonio, Texas, and raised in the \nsmall town of Humble, just outside of Houston. Although he and his \nseven siblings shared a two-room house that lacked either a telephone \nor hot running water, Judge Gonzales refused to be deterred by his \ndifficult circumstances. He journeyed through Texas public schools, \ngraduating from a Texas high school. Judge Gonzales then chose to serve \nhis country by joining the Air Force and serving for approximately 2 \nyears before entering the United States Air Force Academy for a 2-year \nstint. Shortly thereafter, he accomplished his childhood dream of \ngraduating from Rice University. Following his graduation from Rice, \nJudge Gonzales went on to graduate from the Harvard Law School.\n  In June of 1982, he joined the law firm of Vinson & Elkins in \nHouston, TX, where he later became a partner. Not content merely to \npractice law without giving back to the profession, Judge Gonzales also \ntaught law as an adjunct professor at the University of Houston Law \nCenter.\n  The opportunity for service arose again when then-Governor Bush asked \nJudge Gonzales to leave his law firm to become the Governor's General \nCounsel. Thereafter, Judge Gonzales embarked upon a distinguished \ncareer in public service, including service as Texas's 100th Secretary \nof State from December 2, 1997 to January 10, 1999.\n  In what would be a capstone for many lawyers' careers, in 1999 Judge \nGonzales was appointed a Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas--a job \nhe loved, and the reason he is still today known as Judge. Although he \nenjoyed his job on the Texas Supreme Court, the President called upon \nhim to serve his country as the White House Counsel, a position he \nfilled throughout the administration's first term.\n  Mr. President, no one in the Senate could take issue with Judge \nGonzales's remarkable rise to prominence, and the obvious talent and \nability that fueled it. Indeed, I think we are all in agreement about \nthat. Nevertheless, Judge Gonzales finds himself confronting \nsubstantial opposition from my colleagues across the aisle. The \npurported reasons do not justify the opposition.\n  First, the opponents of Judge Gonzales have succeeded in confusing \nthe public about his views on torture. To listen to Judge Gonzales's \ncritics, one would think that the policy of the United States was to \npromote or sanction torture, and that Judge Gonzales somehow \nestablished such a policy. Last week, for example, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts stood on the Senate floor and accused Judge Gonzales \nof being a participant ``in the shameful decision by the administration \nto authorize the torture of detainees at Guantanamo and in Iraq.'' That \ncharge is simply false. In fact, the White House has made very clear \nthat the United States policy and law prohibit torture, and the \nPresident himself has insisted upon humane treatment for detainees. \nJudge Gonzales has been emphatic in his agreement with this position. \nWhen asked, point blank, by the senior Senator from Illinois whether \nU.S. personnel can legally engage in torture under any circumstances, \nJudge Gonzales answered: ``Absolutely no. Our policy is we do not \nengage in torture.'' To which my colleague replied: ``Good. I am glad \nthat you have stated that for the record.''\n  Despite that exchange, and others like it, some critics, including \nthe editors of the Washington Post and New York Times, have \nmischaracterized Judge Gonzales's answers to the committee's questions. \nIn its editorial of January 26th, the Post claimed that Judge Gonzales \nhad asserted the administration's right to, among other things, \n``transport [foreigners] to countries where torture is practiced.'' In \nresponse to a question on this topic posed by my colleague from \nMassachusetts, however, Judge Gonzales wrote: ``The policy of the \nUnited States is not to transfer individuals to countries where we \nbelieve they likely will be tortured, whether those individuals are \nbeing transferred from inside or outside the United States.'' He added, \n``I am not aware of anyone in the Executive Branch authorizing any \ntransfer of a detainee in violation of that policy.''\n\n  In case this was not clear enough, Judge Gonzales reiterated to the \nSenator from Massachusetts: ``United States policy is clear--the \nPresident has directed that the United States is not to engage in \ntorture anywhere in the world and is not to transfer detainees from \nanywhere in the world to other countries where they likely will be \ntortured.''\n  In the New York Times editorial, also dated January 26th, it is \nargued that the ``biggest strike against Mr. Gonzales'' is the fact \nthat a ``now repudiated'' Justice Department memorandum giving a \n``narrow definition of torture'' was addressed to him. This ignores \nseveral facts: First, Congress--not the Administration--enacted the \ndefinition of ``torture.'' In 1994, Congress defined torture as ``an \nact committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically \nintended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other \nthan pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another \nperson within his custody or physical control.''\n  The now repudiated Justice Department memorandum suggested that \n``severe physical pain,'' as used in the torture statute, should be \nconstrued narrowly to mean the type of pain ordinarily ``associated \nwith a sufficiently serious physical condition or injury such as death, \norgan failure, or serious impairment of body functions--in order to \nconstitute torture.'' But, Judge Gonzales was not the author of this \noffending language, and--as I will discuss at greater length later--he \nhas rejected this narrow view of what constitutes torture.\n  Moreover, while the memo has now been repudiated and replaced by one \nwidely acknowledged to be more appropriate, neither memo altered the \nPresident's policy that detainees are to be treated humanely.\n  The Times editorial also cites a leaked draft memorandum from Judge \nGonzales to the President. Some on the Judiciary Committee, including \nthe Ranking Minority Leader from Vermont and the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, have mischaracterized this draft memo as a disavowal of \nthe Conventions. Again, this ignores what Judge Gonzales has written \nand said. The language from the leaked memorandum is often taken out of \ncontext. The relevant passage reads as follows:\n\n       The nature of the new war [against terrorism] places a high \n     premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly \n     obtain information from captured terrorists and their \n     sponsors in order to avoid further atrocities against \n     American civilians, and the need to try terrorists for war \n     crimes such as wantonly killing civilians. In my judgment, \n     this new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva's strict \n     limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders \n     quaint some of its provisions requiring that captured enemy \n     be afforded such things as commissary privileges, scrip \n     (i.e., advances of monthly pay), athletic uniforms, and \n     scientific instruments.\n\n  At his hearing, Judge Gonzales reasserted his commitment to the \nGeneva Conventions as a whole. He told the Judiciary Committee in no \nuncertain terms: ``I consider the Geneva Conventions neither quaint nor \nobsolete.'' And he stressed that, ``[t]he President has repeatedly \ncondemned torture and made clear that the United States will not \ncondone torture.'' When asked about potential changes to the \nConventions, he noted: ``I'm not suggesting that the principles of \nGeneva regarding basic treatment, basic decent treatment of human \nbeings, should be revisited. That should always be our polestar.'' \nFurther, in response to another Democratic Judiciary Committee Member, \nJudge Gonzales reiterated, ``Yes, I do denounce torture, and if \nconfirmed as Attorney General, I will prosecute those who engage in \ntorture.''\n  Finally, none of those standing in opposition to Judge Gonzales has \ncome close to articulating a viable case for linking the actions of \nJudge Gonzales to the so-called ``migration'' of a flawed interrogation \npolicy to the atrocities committed at Abu Ghraib, and perhaps \nelsewhere. Despite multiple investigations, including several discussed \nat our hearing, no one has established a link--even an attenuated one--\nbetween Judge Gonzales and improper interrogation techniques in the \nfield; I have yet to see anything other than supposition and \nconjecture.\n  So, Mr. President, I think that Judge Gonzales has been clear about \nthe United States' policy and his own views against torture, leaving no\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\nmeaningful basis to oppose his nomination on such grounds.\n  As I have already indicated, another issue that has been \nmisrepresented by Judge Gonzales' opponents is his stance with respect \nto the Office of Legal Counsel's memorandum on the anti-torture \nstatute, the so-called Bybee memo.\n  At the Judiciary Committee's last Executive Meeting, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts suggested that Judge Gonzales had failed to \nreject the memorandum. The record established the contrary. For \nexample, Judge Gonzales has rejected the Bybee Memorandum's overbroad \nstatement of Executive authority. In response to the Committee's \nquestions about the memorandum, Judge Gonzales said:\n\n       It has been rejected, including that section regarding the \n     Commander-in-Chief's authority to ignore the criminal \n     statutes. So it has been rejected by the Executive Branch. I, \n     categorically, reject it. And, in addition to that, as I have \n     said repeatedly today, this administration does not engage in \n     torture and will not condone torture.\n\n  During his hearing, I asked Judge Gonzales: ``Do you agree with the \nstatement in the memo, `Congress may no more regulate the President's \nability to detain and interrogate enemy combatants than it may regulate \nhis ability to direct troop movements on the battlefield'?'' Judge \nGonzales answered: ``I reject that statement, Senator.'' This is a \nclear and unequivocal answer.\n  Moreover, Judge Gonzales has explicitly recognized that Presidential \nauthority in this area is indeed limited. Among other things, he has \nnoted:\n\n       We in the executive branch, of course, understand that \n     there are limits on Presidential power. We are very, very \n     mindful of Justice O'Connor's statement in the Hamdi decision \n     that a state of war is not a blank check for the President of \n     the United States with respect to the rights of American \n     citizens. I understand that and I agree with that.\n\n  In addition, at his confirmation hearing, Judge Gonzales testified \nthat he did not agree with the portion of the Bybee Memorandum stating \nthat severe physical pain, as used in the torture statute, was limited \nto pain equivalent to organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or \neven death. In response to a question from the Committee's Ranking \nMember, for example, Judge Gonzales agreed that horrific conduct, such \nas cutting off someone's finger, would be considered torture. \nNevertheless, at the Executive Meeting, the Senator from Massachusetts \ncontinued to suggest that Judge Gonzales might somehow condone conduct \nsuch as, ``[b]eating you, suffocating you, ripping out your \nfingernails, burning you with hot irons, suspending you from hooks, \nputting lighted cigarettes in your ear.''\n  Such hyperbole, Mr. President, serves to highlight the fact that \narguments against Judge Gonzales have ignored significant statements by \nthis nominee. Judge Gonzales has taken important steps towards \naccommodating the legislative branch of government through his \nrejection of the Bybee dicta and his concessions on the limits of \npresidential power. Ignoring such efforts is the wrong way to approach \nsuch an important nomination and the wrong way to assess such a fine \nand worthy nominee.\n  On a related note, my colleague from Massachusetts and other critics, \nincluding the New York Times, have seized upon the fact that the \nPresident's February 2002 directive regarding the humane treatment of \nprisoners is addressed to the Nation's Armed Forces to suggest that \nsomehow the CIA has been operating without legal constraints. The \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, for example, has alleged that Judge \nGonzales ``evaded answers to questions about whether the CIA can abuse \nprisoners, even if the military is prohibited from doing so.'' This is \ndirectly contradicted by Judge Gonzales's responses to the Judiciary \nCommittee's written questions. For example, Judge Gonzales has written:\n\n       The CIA and other intelligence agencies are fully bound by \n     the prohibition on torture contained in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340 \n     and Sec. 2340A and, depending on the circumstances, by other \n     criminal statutes such as those defining crimes in the \n     special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United \n     States. Those statutes prohibit, for example, assault (18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 113) and maiming (18 U.S.C. Sec. 114). These \n     criminal prohibitions prevent abuse of detainees by \n     intelligence officers. In fact, the Department of Justice is \n     currently prosecuting a CIA contract employee for various \n     charges of assault under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 113.\n\n  Despite such answers, my colleague from Massachusetts continues to \naccuse the administration of sending ``the message that anything goes \nto our troops and intelligence officers in the field.'' To the \ncontrary, Judge Gonzales has stressed that the ``CIA and other \nintelligence agencies are fully bound'' by the laws against torture. \nAnd, as further noted by Judge Gonzales, the CIA and other agencies \nhave sought Department of Justice guidance concerning the boundaries \nemanating from U.S. obligations under, for example, Article 16 of the \nConvention Against Torture.\n  In fact, let me take a moment to address Article 16 directly. Some \nhave suggested that the administration's interpretation of Article 16 \nhas been used to justify or facilitate the cruel, inhumane or degrading \ntreatment of aliens overseas. Just last week, for example, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts accused Judge Gonzales of saying ``that the \nCIA is not bound by the prohibition on cruel, inhumane and degrading \ntreatment in Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture.'' Again, \nthis ignores the testimony of Judge Gonzales. At our hearing, Judge \nGonzales noted that, when the Senate ratified the Convention Against \nTorture, it took a reservation equating the requirements under Article \n16 with the requirements under the Fifth, Eighth, and 14th Amendments. \nJudge Gonzales further acknowledged that, when interpreting these \nrequirements, the Administration has looked to Supreme Court precedents \nholding that aliens interrogated by U.S. personnel outside the United \nStates enjoy no substantive rights under the Fifth, Eighth, and 14th \nAmendment. Nevertheless, regardless of the debate about the strict \nlegal requirements of Article 16, Judge Gonzales testified that the \nadministration has sought ``to be in compliance as a substantive matter \nunder the Fifth, Eighth, and 14th Amendment.'' He also testified that, \nto the best of his knowledge, the United States has met its substantive \nobligations under the Fifth, Eighth, and 14th Amendments. This \ncommitment has often been overlooked by the Judge's opponents.\n\n  Contrary to the claims of his critics, Judge Gonzales also \nacknowledged that, based on his review of the relevant investigations, \nthe responsibility for what happened at places like Abu Ghraib extends \nfurther up the chain than the culpable guards. The Senator from \nMassachusetts accuses Judge Gonzales and others in the administration \nof a ``continuing effort to pin the blame for the torture scandal on a \nfew bad apples among our solders.'' In reality, however, Judge Gonzales \ntestified:\n\n       The reports [by Schlesinger, Faye, Kearns and others] seem \n     to indicate that there was a failure, there was a failure of \n     discipline amongst the supervisors of the guards there at Abu \n     Ghraib, and also they found that there was a failure in \n     training and oversight at multiple layers of Command Joint \n     Task Force 7. And so I think there was clearly a failure well \n     above the actions of the individuals who actually were in the \n     prison. At least that's what the reports seem to indicate, as \n     I review them.\n\n  At the same time, he rejected the notion that inhumane treatment was \ntolerated or encouraged as a matter of course. He pointed out, for \nexample, that, even within Abu Ghraib, the gross misconduct of the \nnight shift was aberrant:\n\n       The findings in these eight reports universally were that a \n     great majority, an overwhelming majority of our detention \n     operations have been conducted consistent with American \n     values and consistent with our legal obligations. What we saw \n     happen on that cell block in the night shift was limited to \n     the night shift on that cell block with respect to that first \n     category, the more offensive, the intentional severe physical \n     and the sexual abuse, the subject of those pictures. And this \n     isn't just Al Gonzales speaking. This is what, if you look at \n     it, the Schlesinger report concludes. And so what you see is \n     that you have got this kind of conduct occurring at the night \n     shift, but the day shift, they don't engage in that kind of \n     conduct because they understand what the rules were. And so I \n     respectfully disagree with the characterization there was \n     some sort of permissive environment.\n\n  Once again, on this point as with others, the Judge's own words \nrefute the accusations of his critics.\n  Some of my colleagues have also seized upon Judge Gonzales's \ninability to recall certain details of meetings that occurred more than \n2\\1/2\\ years ago\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\nto suggest that we lack sufficient information to make an informed \ndecision about his nomination or that Judge Gonzales is being less than \nforthcoming when he asserts he cannot recall a matter. Last week, for \nexample, the senior Senator from Massachusetts told the Judiciary \nCommittee that Judge Gonzales ``refuses to tell us anything about those \nmeetings.''\n  In fact, the Senator from Massachusetts had several exchanges with \nJudge Gonzales on this topic at our confirmation hearing. The Senator \nqueried, for example: ``I just want to point out, if it is true, as the \nPost reported, that you held several meetings at which the legality of \ninterrogation techniques, such as threat of live burial and water-\nboarding were discussed; do you remember that?'' Judge Gonzales \nresponded:\n\n       Senator, I have a recollection that we had some discussions \n     in my office, but let me be very clear with the Committee. It \n     is not my job to decide which type of methods of obtaining \n     information from terrorists would be most effective. That job \n     responsibility falls to folks within the agencies. It is also \n     not my job to make the ultimate decision about whether or not \n     those methods would, in fact, meet the requirements of the \n     anti-torture statute. That would be a job for the Department \n     of Justice. And I never influenced or pressured the \n     Department to bless any of these techniques. I viewed it as \n     their responsibility to make the decision as to whether or \n     not a procedure or method of questioning of these terrorists \n     that an agency wanted, would it, in fact, be lawful.\n\n  Given the passage of time, his inability to recall precise details is \nunderstandable. Moreover, it must be viewed in the context of what he \nhas recalled and provided to the committee. Among other things, he has: \nacknowledged his participation in meetings where the questioning of \ndetainees was discussed; explained the genesis and purpose of such \nmeetings; described the limited nature of his role; and explained the \nresult of these meetings. In one lengthy written answer to a question \nposed by my colleague from Massachusetts, for instance, he explained:\n\n       Since shortly after September 11, 2001 until the present, \n     the Administration has been involved in conducting the War on \n     Terror by gathering as much information from terrorists as we \n     possibly can within the bounds of law. During that time, I \n     have participated in several meetings at which the possible \n     use of methods of questioning were discussed. These meetings \n     may have included, from time to time, representatives from \n     the National Security Council, the Department of State, the \n     Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, and others. In the meetings I attended, \n     agencies' representatives raised concerns that certain \n     terrorists had information that might save American lives; \n     the participants shared a desire to explore whether there \n     existed methods of questioning these terrorists that might \n     elicit that information; and it was always very clear that we \n     would implement such methods only within the bounds of the \n     law. As Counsel to the President, my constant emphasis and \n     interest was on the last factor--ensuring compliance with the \n     law. It would not have been appropriate for me to comment on \n     issues such as whether a particular individual may have \n     information that would be helpful to the effort to save \n     American lives or defeat terrorists, or whether a certain \n     procedure for questioning that individual would be effective \n     in eliciting that information. Others with more relevant \n     experience, expertise, and information were responsible for \n     making those judgments. Instead, it was my responsibility to \n     ensure that any method they deemed appropriate and effective \n     from an operational point of view was considered lawful by \n     the Department of Justice. To the extent I was involved in \n     recommendations, results, and assignments arising out of such \n     meetings, my activities were directed toward ensuring that \n     those with operational responsibility would act only after \n     receiving the judgment of the Department of Justice that a \n     proposed course of action was lawful.\n\n  That answer provides a good deal of information. The fact that he \ncannot recall details of those meetings is understandable. It is \ncommonplace to forget details of meetings, particularly when years have \npassed. It is certainly not, given the responses that have been made, a \nreason to oppose someone who is universally praised for his ability and \nintegrity.\n  Since his nomination, the White House has offered every Committee \nmember a personal, private meeting with Judge Gonzales. To date, the \nJudge has met personally with 14 members of the Judiciary Committee, \nand more than a dozen other Senators.\n  At his hearing, Judge Gonzales testified for nearly 6 hours, \nanswering multiple rounds of questions. There were three rounds of \nquestions, and I encouraged Senators to participate in each round. \nAfter a complete and lengthy first round, 9 Senators participated in a \nsecond round of questions. After that, 4 Senators including myself took \nadvantage of the third round. I made sure every Senator had ample \nopportunity to question Judge Gonzales. Indeed, one Senator was \nultimately granted a fourth round of questions.\n  Contrary to the assertion by the Senator from Massachusetts that \nJudge Gonzales was unresponsive and he made ``a mockery of the notion \nof congressional oversight and accountability,'' Judge Gonzales's \nanswers to the committee's written questions, contained in 221 single-\nspaced pages, provided nearly 450, often detailed, responses on issues \nranging from the war on terrorism to intellectual property. So thorough \nwas Judge Gonzales's response that the New York Times (January 19, \n2005) stated that Judge Gonzales's answers to the committee's written \nquestions comprised ``one of the administration's most expansive \nstatements of its positions on a variety of issues, particularly \nregarding laws and policies governing C.I.A. interrogation of terror \nsuspects.''\n  The questions kept pouring in even after the committee's hearing \nrecord closed on Thursday, January 13th, with 4 Senators submitting \nmore than 40 additional questions for the nominee. Judge Gonzales has \nnow responded to all of those supplemental questions. In 27 additional \npages of questions and answers, Judge Gonzales has further clarified \nhis position on several issues. He also furnished a remarkable 93-page \nmemorandum on the Geneva Conventions prepared by the State Department \nas well as a letter reiterating his role in a court appearance for \nthen-Governor Bush.\n  These facts refute the claims that Judge Gonzales has failed to \nprovide us with sufficient information to evaluate his nomination.\n  Nevertheless, the Judge's opponents continue to clamor for more. At \nthe executive meeting, for example, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts complained that Judge Gonzales had ``not conducted a \nsearch for . . . requested documents.'' In fact, my colleague said it \nwould be ``hard to imagine a more arrogant insult to this Committee's \noversight responsibility.''\n  I requested that a search be conducted for any draft or final \nmemoranda or other documents written by Judge Gonzales and relevant to \nthe subject of interrogation techniques or torture. The White House \nresponded by conducting a search.\n  On January 19, 2005, at the direction of the White House Chief of \nStaff, David Leitch, Deputy Counsel to the President, supervised a \nsearch of certain electronic records available in the Office of Counsel \nto the President. Specifically, he searched for word processing \ndocuments containing the words ``torture'' or ``interrogation'' that \nwere located on (1) the shared Counsel's Office directory, (2) the \npersonal and network directories used by Judge Gonzales and his \nassistants, or (3) the hard drive of Judge Gonzales's computer.\n  According to the White House, based on the practices concerning \ndocuments created by Judge Gonzales, there is a very high probability \nthat any document of the sort described would have been identified as a \nresult of this search. I have been advised, however, that no such \ndocuments were identified by the administration.\n  Moreover, the White House has represented, and Judge Gonzales \nconfirmed, that he has no notes reflecting discussions at any meetings \nconcerning these topics, nor does the White House believe there are any \nnotes taken by Judge Gonzales in the files of the office.\n  Finally, I have been advised that, during Judge Gonzales's tenure as \ncounsel to the President, there have never been any audio recordings or \ntranscriptions of any meetings in the White House Counsel offices \nconcerning these topics, or any others, so far as the White House is \naware.\n  Judge Gonzales and the White House have undertaken appropriate \nefforts to accommodate the Senate by providing relevant information. \nBetween his written answers and his testimony, Judge Gonzales has \naddressed his role in the solicitation and provision of legal advice, \nas well as his personal views on the contested issues--such as\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\nthe treatment of detainees. There is an ample record to evaluate his \nnomination. I urge Senators to review the voluminous materials that \nhave been produced before coming to any conclusion.\n  Mr. President, another argument used by the Gonzales critics is that \nhe refused to answer certain hypothetical questions during his hearing. \nUsing the rejected language of the Bybee memo about a postulated \nCommander-in-Chief override of the torture statute, certain Judiciary \nCommittee members repeatedly asked Judge Gonzales whether he believed \nthe President could authorize torture in extreme and hypothetical \ncircumstances. Judge Gonzales refused to engage in scenarios about \nwhen, if ever, torture might be sanctioned, because the President has \nrejected torture under any circumstances.\n  So, when the ranking minority member asked, ``Now, as Attorney \nGeneral, would you believe the President has authority to exercise a \nCommander in Chief override and immunize acts of torture?'' Judge \nGonzales answered:\n\n       [T]he President has said we are not going to engage in \n     torture under any circumstances. And so you're asking me to \n     answer a hypothetical that is never going to occur. This \n     President has said we're not going to engage in torture under \n     any circumstances, and therefore, that portion of the opinion \n     was unnecessary and was the reason that we asked that that \n     portion be withdrawn.\n\n  Given the administration's clear policy, this response is \nappropriate. Judge Gonzales has explained that the Bush administration \nwill not engage in torture under any circumstance, so his reluctance to \ncontradict the President's policy is perfectly understandable.\n\n  In fact, even the distinguished witnesses on the second panel of our \nconfirmation hearing, including two law school deans and an advocate \nfor victims of torture, were unwilling to engage in hypothetical \ndebates about what set of circumstances--if any--might justify a \npresidential decision to approve torture. One witness even \ncharacterized the hypothetical about a ticking time bomb as ``fantasy'' \nand part of the ``mythology'' of torture. Such reticence is \nunderstandable, especially for someone, like Judge Gonzales, who serves \na President who has rejected the use of torture under any \ncircumstances.\n  Another of the anti-Gonzales shibboleths is that he is too close to \nthe President to be independent. This argument ignores what Judge \nGonzales, an honorable and credible man, told the Judiciary Committee. \nDuring his opening statement, and several times thereafter, Judge \nGonzales acknowledged the difference between his role as White House \nCounsel and the job of Attorney General. At the outset of our hearing, \nhe noted:\n\n       With the consent of the Senate, I will no longer represent \n     only the White House; I will represent the United States of \n     America and its people. I understand the differences between \n     the two roles. In the former I have been privileged to advise \n     the President and his staff. In the latter I would have a far \n     broader responsibility: to pursue justice for all the people \n     of our great Nation, to see that the laws are enforced in a \n     fair and impartial manner for all Americans.\n\n  That is a clear statement that he recognizes the difference between \nhis current job and the job of Attorney General. Judge Gonzales has \nbeen the lawyer for one person--the President--and is now going to \nserve as a lawyer for all Americans. Judge Gonzales knows the \ndifference and will serve honorably as the next Attorney General.\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I want to emphasize a few of the \npositive comments my Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \nhave made about this nominee. At his confirmation hearing, the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin told Judge Gonzales: ``As you know, we have had \nan opportunity to work together on several different issues over the \nyears, and I have come to respect you also. And I believe if you are \nconfirmed that you will do a good job as Attorney General of the United \nStates.'' At our Executive Meeting, the senior senator from Delaware \nnoted: ``My vote, to state the obvious, is not about his character or \nhis compelling personal story, which is compelling. He has overcome \ngreat adversity in his life, and I believe he is an intelligent, decent \nand honorable man.'' The senior senator from New York said, ``I like \nJudge Gonzales. I respect him. I think he is a gentleman and I think he \nis a genuinely good man.'' Such comments do not surprise anyone who has \ngotten to know Judge Gonzales.\n  As I have noted, Judge Gonzales has taken a strong stand against \ntorture, rejected suggestions that the President is above the law, and \nrecognized the important distinctions between the position of White \nHouse Counsel and Attorney General. So, what is behind the votes \nagainst him? Not his personal story. Not his character. Not his \nwillingness to work with Congress. There may well be a large overhang \nof politics clouding this nomination. Politics, however, is a poor \nreason for denying the President his choice to be Attorney General. I \nurge my colleagues to consider this nomination based on the facts. \nRegardless of what administration is in power, that is a standard we \nshould all honor.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that Judge Gonzales is a remarkable \nAmerican, well-suited for the position of Attorney General, who has \nbeen forthcoming with the Senate and the American people about his role \nin some very difficult decisions during a very important time. He is a \ngood man. Even his opponents acknowledge that. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Judge Gonzales to be Attorney General.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not at this point speak quite as \nlong. Because I will not use the same amount of time now, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, be \nallowed to follow my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a number of recent editorials regarding the nomination of \nAlberto Gonzales.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 6, 2005]\n\n   A Window on a Man's Morality; Alberto R. Gonzales' Record Raises \n        Questions About His Fitness To Serve as Attorney General\n\n       The Republicans' comfortable majority in the Senate means \n     that Alberto R. Gonzales will almost certainly be confirmed \n     as the next attorney general. With hearings on his nomination \n     set to start today, many Democrats think the best they can do \n     is wound Gonzales enough with questions about his notorious \n     torture memos to disqualify him for any future Supreme Court \n     seat. In the end, however, they will feel pressure to support \n     him or face retaliation from Republicans.\n       They should resist.\n       The eight Democrats and a smattering of moderate \n     Republicans who voted for John Ashcroft four years ago \n     probably felt the same pressure.\n       No one now can doubt the enormous power the attorney \n     general wields or the lasting harm the person who holds that \n     office can do. Gonzales may not share his predecessor's zeal \n     in hounding X-rated moviemakers or cancer patients who smoke \n     marijuana, but as the president's chief lawyer, he has been \n     every bit as reckless.\n       As a leading architect of Bush's ends-justifies-means war \n     on terror, Gonzales pushed to justify torturing terror \n     suspects in violation of international law, promoted military \n     tribunals that echo Stalin's show trials, helped write the \n     Patriot Act (which, among other powers, gives government \n     agents vast new snooping authority) and excused the limitless \n     imprisonment of American citizens whom the president merely \n     suspects of terror activity.\n       Three years into that war, much of Gonzales' handiwork has \n     been rejected by courts, damned by the world community and \n     disavowed by the administration--as in the Justice Department \n     memo quietly released last week declaring that ``torture is \n     abhorrent to both American law and values and to \n     international norms.''\n       Gonzales' defenders argue that, as White House counsel, he \n     was simply a passionate advocate for his client. But the most \n     devoted counselor knows that, even in wartime, there are \n     legal and moral lines this nation crosses at peril to its own \n     citizens and those of other countries. Gonzales' \n     justifications opened the door to the abuse at Abu Ghraib \n     prison and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The \n     mistreatment and prisoner deaths that occurred have raised \n     fears of retaliation against captured Americans. Those \n     concerns prompted a dozen retired generals and admirals, \n     along with civil rights groups, to oppose Gonzales' \n     nomination.\n       Our justice system relies on an attorney general willing to \n     defend civil liberties as ardently as he pursues criminals \n     and terrorists. That person must be someone who respects both \n     the power and the limits of law.\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\n       Gonzales' record as White House counsel is not just a \n     series of unfortunate missteps; rather, it is a troubling \n     window into the man's morality and his fitness to be the \n     nation's chief lawyer. Democratic senators will surely ask \n     Gonzales sharp and embarrassing questions about the \n     principles that guided his tenure in the Office of Legal \n     Counsel. These lawmakers then ought to demonstrate that they \n     understand the principles at stake by actually voting no.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Arizona Daily Star, Jan. 8, 2005]\n\n                           Wrong for the Job\n\n       George W. Bush understandably wants a trusted adviser to be \n     his next attorney general. White House Counsel Alberto \n     Gonzales enjoys that trust, but the President's nominee is \n     the wrong man for the job.\n       With Republicans outnumbering Democrats by 55-45 in the \n     Senate, Gonzales is likely to win approval for the position. \n     Yet, the man who advocated the use of torture as an \n     interrogation tool is not only unqualified, he is a threat to \n     the rights of Americans.\n       Before Thursday's Senate hearing on his nomination, \n     Gonzales was merely a legal adviser who was unqualified. But \n     during the hearing he showed himself to be a man of \n     questionable morality and ethics.\n       For example, his 2002 memo to the president stated that the \n     war on terror ``renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations \n     on questions of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of \n     its provisions.'' The Geneva Conventions outline how \n     prisoners of war should be treated.\n       But when questioned by the Senate on Thursday, Gonzales \n     said this: ``Contrary to reports, I consider the Geneva \n     Conventions neither obsolete nor quaint.'' He said his early \n     interpretation applies only to organizations like al-Qaida \n     that have no national affiliation and do not ``fight \n     according to the laws of war.'' And he said the Geneva \n     Conventions' protections for terrorists would ``honor and \n     reward bad conduct.'' And he pledged to prosecute those who \n     tortured terrorism suspects.\n       However, he noted that the White House is looking to change \n     some of the Geneva Conventions' guidelines. There again, one \n     has to question whether Gonzales is saying the right things \n     in order to win the job.\n       His statements now and in the past are inconsistent at \n     best. But more important, the legal opinion he forwarded to \n     the president and this administration cannot be separated \n     from the scandals of torture and death at Abu Ghraib prison \n     in Iraq.\n       It is significant that among his Senate supporters, \n     Gonzales' legal abilities and his leadership skills are \n     hardly mentioned as top qualifications. Supportive senators \n     instead promote the nominee's rags-to-riches story. Second \n     among his qualifications is that he would become the nation's \n     first Hispanic attorney general.\n       This administration has an affinity for those kinds of \n     stories. But it should have learned from the Bernard Kerik \n     nomination that they don't always make for good national \n     leadership. Kerik withdrew his nomination as head of Homeland \n     Security after questions arose about the immigration status \n     of a housekeeper and nanny he employed.\n       Gonzales' ethnicity, his accomplishments and his role as \n     adviser to the president for nine years are admirable but \n     irrelevant. His background makes for great political theater \n     but does not qualify him to be attorney general. And one \n     would hope that Hispanics would not rush to blindly support a \n     man who is clearly wrong for the job.\n       Alberto Gonzales has a history of bending the law to fit \n     policy and the wishes of the president. Eagerness to please \n     makes him a great adviser and confidant.\n       But as head of the Justice Department, the attorney general \n     should answer only to the law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Jan. 8, 2005]\n\n                   Editorial: Don't Confirm Gonzales\n\n       Thursday's Senate confirmation hearing provided Alberto R. \n     Gonzales with an opportunity to confront some of the nagging \n     questions that have been raised about his nomination to be \n     attorney general. So important is the office to which \n     Gonzales aspires that the Senate and the American people \n     needed to hear convincing answers to these questions. They \n     deserved assurances that Gonzales had the judgment, the \n     temperament and the integrity necessary for this cabinet \n     position.\n       Far from supplying this reassurance, Gonzales proved to be \n     consistently weak and evasive. So intellectually sterile was \n     his testimony that it showed Gonzales to be unfit for the \n     important office he seeks, and for this reason the Senate \n     should reject his nomination.\n       Realistically, of course, this will almost certainly not \n     happen; Democrats on the Judiciary Committee signaled \n     Thursday that, despite reservations about Gonzales, they will \n     support the nomination. Indeed, they make a respectable case, \n     which is that presidents are entitled to broad leeway in the \n     selection of their cabinet members. But there are limits to \n     the discretion to which presidents are entitled; otherwise, \n     the entire confirmation process becomes meaningless.\n       Unfortunately, Gonzales's views put him beyond even these \n     broad limits. As White House counsel, he was largely \n     responsible for, or at least acquiesced in, a repudiation of \n     some of this country's most precious ideals, such as the \n     notion that human beings should not be tortured.\n       In January 2002, Gonzales told President Bush that the war \n     on terror ``renders obsolete'' some of the strict limitations \n     imposed by the Geneva Conventions as applied to al-Qaida and, \n     in some cases, Taliban fighters. Arguably, one can make that \n     legal case but elsewhere in that letter, and more disturbing, \n     was the tone Gonzales adopted when he dismissed as merely \n     ``quaint'' some of the convention's human rights provisions. \n     In August 2002, Gonzales received a Justice Department \n     memorandum that a president could suspend Geneva Convention \n     protections at will and that some forms of torture ``may be \n     justified.''\n       On Thursday, Gonzales disavowed the use of torture. A week \n     earlier, the Justice Department had repudiated its August \n     2002 memo. But why did this reversal take this long? In light \n     of Gonzales's four-year record, his disavowal of terrorism \n     seemed merely rhetorical and tactical. Efforts to elicit \n     Gonzales's views were met with vagueness and equivocation. \n     Gonzales said he couldn't remember key details of his \n     involvement with the August 2002 memo. He wasn't even sure \n     whether Americans could legally engage in torture under any \n     circumstances.\n       Ordinarily, even these gross deficiencies might be \n     tolerable. But these are not ordinary times. The threat to \n     civil liberties posed by the fight on terror requires an \n     attorney general with a demonstrated record of sound \n     judgment, independent temperament and unquestioned integrity.\n       Gonzales's rags-to-riches personal story is an inspiration \n     to all Americans. But his story is not the issue. He has not \n     demonstrated the judgment and integrity to be the nation's \n     chief law enforcement officer at this pivotal time in our \n     history.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN), Jan. 8, 2005]\n\n                 Gonzales; Democrats Should Reject Him\n\n       Democrats in the U.S. Senate have many well-founded reasons \n     to oppose with all their might President Bush's nomination of \n     Alberto Gonzales to be attorney general. But one reason \n     stands out above all others, and Democrats should pound it \n     home: Gonzales believes the president of the United States \n     has the power, as commander in chief, to permit the use of \n     torture by American forces by immunizing from prosecution \n     anyone who does it.\n       This reasoning was put forward in an August 2002 memo, \n     called the Bybee memo, from the Department of Justice to the \n     White House. Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee Thursday that he, as the president's lawyer, simply \n     passed the memo along. It wasn't his job, he said, to warn \n     the president of the memo's implications or to disagree with \n     it. Gonzales has a peculiar notion of his role as the \n     president's attorney; others quite rightly characterize his \n     behavior as a dereliction of duty. In fact, there's good \n     reason to believe Gonzales was an active participant in the \n     memo's construction.\n       But whatever his role, Gonzales clearly agreed with the \n     memo, and does to this day.\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on the \n     committee, tried every way he could to get Gonzales to answer \n     ``yes'' or ``no'' to a simple question: ``Now, as attorney \n     general, would you believe the president has the authority to \n     exercise a commander-in-chief override and immunize acts of \n     torture?'' Gonzales tried all kinds of tacks to avoid \n     answering: The question is hypothetical because Bush opposes \n     the use of torture, etc. Leahy persisted, and finally \n     Gonzales said, ``Senator, I do believe there may come an \n     occasion when the Congress might pass a statute that the \n     president may view as unconstitutional,'' and therefore he \n     can ignore it. The answer was disingenuous because the issue \n     isn't laws Congress might pass, but established U.S. and \n     international laws that prohibit the use of torture. Thus, \n     the only reasonable way to interpret Gonzales' answer in the \n     context it was asked is that, indeed, the president has the \n     power to permit torture by immunizing those who do it.\n       The White House has done its darnedest to frustrate \n     Judiciary Committee inquiries into Gonzales' role in the \n     torture scandal. Leahy Thursday held aloft a hefty file of \n     unanswered questions and letters he had sent to the White \n     House seeking information on Gonzales' views about torture \n     and his role in framing policies that led to the Abu Ghraib \n     scandal and the abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. Despite \n     that, Leahy and his colleagues got Gonzales on the record \n     saying that he does believe the president has the power to \n     override U.S. laws.\n       That's all the Democrats need to oppose Gonzales' \n     confirmation en masse, and they should. Torture is always out \n     of bounds, no matter the circumstance; it is immoral, \n     ineffective and puts captured American forces at risk. \n     Previous congresses and presidents have enacted laws and \n     ratified international treaties to that effect.\n       The United States does not need an attorney general who \n     believes that this president has the right to override those \n     laws and treaties at his whim. Even if Gonzales is eventually \n     confirmed, as it appears he will be, Senate Democrats must be \n     on the record upholding the powerful principle that the \n     United States unequivocally rejects torture.\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         [From the Slate (South Carolina), Sat. Jan. 15, 2005]\n\n            Torture Taint Should Disqualify Nominee Gonzales\n\n       After last week's confirmation hearing for Alberto \n     Gonzales, even senators who disliked the nomination said he \n     would be confirmed, for no other reason than he is the one \n     President Bush asked for. ``There's a lower standard, \n     frankly, for attorney general than for judge, because you \n     give the president who he wants,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, \n     D-N.Y.\n       There's a sad symmetry in this. Mr. Gonzales's work as \n     legal counsel to the president on the issue of torture has \n     been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court and disowned by the \n     White House--only after it backfired politically and legally. \n     His principal qualification is unambiguous loyalty to the \n     president. In short, his selection reflects what sadly seems \n     to be the overriding attribute this president wants in his \n     subordinates. That might be good enough for the president, \n     but it does not make him the right choice to be the nation's \n     top lawyer; in fact, in this case it should mean just the \n     opposite.\n       Mr. Gonzales has helped this administration pursue the \n     human equivalent of the hiddenball trick. Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba, was chosen as the U.S. detention facility for ``enemy \n     combatants'' under the assumption that it could be defined as \n     a legal no-man's-land, a place where the laws of the United \n     States do not apply. It would be years before the U.S. \n     Supreme Court ruled, as Sen. Lindsey Graham put it, that \n     ``Gitmo is not Mars.'' The administration took other actions, \n     including denying legal counsel to detainees, that it thought \n     were unlikely to withstand court scrutiny, so it endeavored \n     instead to stall definitive rulings as long as it could.\n       Few of these actions can rise to the appropriately high \n     standard delineated by Sen. Graham during the confirmation \n     hearing: ``I do believe we have lost our way, and my \n     challenge to you as a leader of this nation is to help us \n     find our way without giving up our obligation and right to \n     fight our enemy.''\n       But will Mr. Gonzales lead the Justice Department to meet \n     that standard?\n       His answers during the confirmation hearing showed less of \n     the firm moral base the position requires, and more of a \n     tendency to look at things in a lawyerly way, in the \n     Clintonian sense of the term. He said his new zeal to keep to \n     the legal straight-and-narrow on torture stems from a new \n     understanding that he would represent not just the president \n     anymore, but the whole United States. But shouldn't advising \n     the president have been enough of a guide for Mr. Gonzales to \n     strive to uphold bedrock American principles? He treats the \n     now-discredited legal opinions as if they have been \n     vaporized. But they had, and are still having, real-world \n     effects, some of them disastrous to the U.S. cause (such as \n     Abu Ghraib). And which represents the real Alberto Gonzales: \n     the man who appeared before the Senate or the one who advised \n     President Bush?\n       This administration, and far more importantly this nation, \n     must make a clean break from the policies identified with Mr. \n     Gonzales. Making him attorney general of the United States \n     accomplishes the opposite.\n       This nomination tells the world that no minds have been \n     changed in this country about the use of torture; it says \n     America sees no conflict between detaining suspects without \n     legal counsel and trying to hold our constitutional democracy \n     aloft as an example to the world.\n       Sen. Graham seems to understand that Alberto Gonzales is \n     not the best choice. Both he and Sen. Jim DeMint have a duty, \n     if they truly see the problems with this nomination, to vote \n     against it, as loyal Republicans and as Americans. Only when \n     they and others do so might this president finally see the \n     need for change in key elements of his war strategy, and \n     start making top personnel decisions based on that new \n     understanding. This must happen, for the sake of the nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Jan. 18, 2005]\n\n                       Unfit as Attorney General\n\n       Two memos on the US treatment of detainees from Afghanistan \n     and Iraq stand in the way of Alberto Gonzales becoming the \n     next attorney general of the United States. At his \n     confirmation hearing earlier this month, he neither disavowed \n     the memos nor showed an understanding of how their denial of \n     international protections to detainess could lead to the many \n     cases of prisoner abuse reported by both the FBI and the \n     International Red Cross. The Senate should reject his \n     nomination.\n       In his testimony, Gonzales made frequent reference to the \n     much-photographed instances of prisoner humiliation and abuse \n     at Abu Ghraib, as though the naked-body pyramid and other \n     abuses that Specialist Charles Graner was justifiably \n     convicted of Friday were the worst of what has occurred. But \n     the FBI and Red Cross reports as well as the military's own \n     investigations of killings of prisoners make clear that some \n     interrogators and guards crossed the line into torture or \n     homicide. It is disingenuous of Gonzales not to acknowledge \n     the link between permissive torture policies from Washington \n     and acts of abuse that occurred not just at Abu Ghraib but in \n     Afghanistan and Guantanamo as well.\n       In 2002 as White House counsel, Gonzales wrote a memo in \n     which he called provisions of the Geneva Conventions \n     regarding prisoners of war ``obsolete'' and ``quaint'' and \n     said the United States could operate as though the \n     conventions did not apply to the Afghan war. Indeed, some of \n     the fighters captured during the 2001 war against the Taliban \n     and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan might not have deserved the \n     status of POWs.\n       But the Geneva Conventions--and American law--make clear \n     that any battlefield detainee has that status until a \n     ``competent tribunal'' puts him in the less protected \n     category of ``enemy combatant.'' As US Judge James Robertson \n     noted in a ruling last November, the Geneva Conventions do \n     not give any individual, including the president, the \n     authority to say who deserves POW status. The White House \n     counsel certainly lacks that authority.\n       The second memo that has damaged the US reputation \n     worldwide was written in 2002 by a Justice Department \n     official as a guide to interrogation techniques. The memo, \n     which Gonzales discussed with administration officials, said \n     a president has the power to authorize torture despite a 1994 \n     US law banning it. At the confirmation hearing, Gonzales \n     declined chances to repudiate that view.\n       The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks thrust the United States into a \n     new kind of conflict in which useful intelligence from \n     detainees is crucial. But Gonzales has been at the center of \n     administration policy-making that set aside tried and true US \n     and international rules governing the collection of this \n     information. His blindness to the consequences of those \n     policies makes him a poor choice for chief law enforcement \n     officer of the nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      [From the Republican (Western Massachusetts), Jan. 23, 2005]\n\n               Gonzales Nomination Leaves Many Questions\n\n       When Alberto Gonzales appeared before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee earlier this month, some of his answers to \n     questions about the treatment of prisoners in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan and elsewhere left some Democratic committee \n     members wanting more. So they asked a series of follow-up \n     questions to be answered in writing. And when Gonzales \n     provided his answers, those same senators still found \n     themselves wanting more.\n       So they decided to delay--for at least one week--a \n     committee vote on his nomination to succeed John Ashcroft as \n     attorney general. It was the right move.\n       There are real questions about Gonzales's fitness to serve \n     as attorney general. His nomination should not move forward \n     until those questions are answered.\n       He has written that certain provisions of the Geneva \n     Conventions--which provide for the treatment of enemy \n     prisoners--are ``quaint'' or ``obsolete.'' Gonzales approved \n     a memorandum saying that the president ``wasn't bound by laws \n     prohibiting torture and that government agents who might \n     torture prisoners at his direction couldn't be prosecuted by \n     the Justice Department.''\n       Gonzales has said he believes that the president of the \n     United States has the authority to order the detention of \n     enemy combatants indefinitely during wartime. He has \n     repeatedly backed the provisions in the USA Patriot Act that \n     infringe most broadly on civil liberties and the fundamental \n     right of the citizens to be left alone.\n       When he was attorney general of Texas--while George W. Bush \n     was governor--he wrote a memo directly contradicting a \n     federal law that grants foreign nationals access to American \n     courts when they are accused of a crime.\n       And the list goes on and on.\n       The president has nominated Alberto Gonzales to be the \n     chief law enforcement officer in the United States. The \n     attorney general sits at the very top of the U.S. Department \n     of Justice. The person in that position must possess a \n     scrupulousness that is beyond question.\n       Gonzales has not, to date, demonstrated that he has the \n     qualities that an individual needs to be elevated to one of \n     the most significant positions in this nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 2005]\n\n                       The Wrong Attorney General\n\n       Alberto Gonzales's nomination as attorney general goes \n     before the Senate at a time when the Republican majority is \n     eager to provide newly elected President Bush with the \n     cabinet of his choice, and the Democrats are leery of \n     exposing their weakened status by taking fruitless stands \n     against the inevitable. None of that is an excuse for giving \n     Mr. Gonzales a pass. The attorney general does not merely \n     head up the Justice Department. He is responsible for \n     ensuring that America is a nation in which justice prevails. \n     Mr. Gonzales's record makes him unqualified to take on this \n     role or to represent the American justice system to the rest \n     of the world. The Senate should reject his nomination.\n       The biggest strike against Mr. Gonzales is the now \n     repudiated memo that gave a disturbingly narrow definition of \n     torture, limiting it to physical abuse that produced pain of \n     the kind associated with organ failure or death. Mr. \n     Gonzales's attempts to distance himself from the memo have \n     been unconvincing, especially since it turns out he was the \n     one who requested that it be written. Earlier the same year, \n     Mr. Gonzales himself sent President Bush a letter telling him \n     that the war on terror made the Geneva Conventions' strict \n     limitations on the questioning of enemy prisoners \n     ``obsolete.''\n       These actions created the legal climate that made possible \n     the horrific mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners being held in \n     Abu\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\n     Ghraib prison. The Bush administration often talks about its \n     desire to mend fences with the rest of the world, \n     particularly the Muslim world. Making Mr. Gonzales the \n     nation's chief law enforcement officer would set this effort \n     back substantially.\n       Other parts of Mr. Gonzales's record are also troubling. As \n     counsel to George Bush when he was governor of Texas, Mr. \n     Gonzales did a shockingly poor job of laying out the legal \n     issues raised by the clemency petitions from prisoners on \n     death row. And questions have been raised about Mr. \n     Gonzales's account of how he got his boss out of jury duty in \n     1996, which allowed Mr. Bush to avoid stating publicly that \n     he had been convicted of drunken driving.\n       Senate Democrats, who are trying to define their role after \n     the setbacks of the 2004 election, should stand on principle \n     and hold out for a more suitable attorney general. \n     Republicans also have reason to oppose this nomination. At \n     the confirmation hearings, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican \n     of South Carolina, warned that the administration's flawed \n     legal policies and mistreatment of detainees had hurt the \n     country's standing and ``dramatically undermined'' the war on \n     terror. Given the stakes in that war, senators of both \n     parties should want an attorney general who does not come \n     with this nominee's substantial shortcomings.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 26, 2005]\n\n                           A Degrading Policy\n\n       Alberto R. Gonzales was vague, unresponsive and misleading \n     in his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the \n     Bush administration's detention of foreign prisoners. In his \n     written answers to questions from the committee, prepared in \n     anticipation of today's vote on his nomination as attorney \n     general, Mr. Gonzales was clearer--disturbingly so, as it \n     turns out. According to President Bush's closest legal \n     adviser, this administration continues to assert its right to \n     indefinitely hold foreigners in secret locations without any \n     legal process; to deny them access to the International Red \n     Cross; to transport them to countries where torture is \n     practiced; and to subject them to treatment that is ``cruel, \n     inhumane or degrading,'' even though such abuse is banned by \n     an international treaty that the United States has ratified. \n     In effect, Mr. Gonzales has confirmed that the Bush \n     administration is violating human rights as a matter of \n     policy.\n       Mr. Gonzales stated at his hearing that he and Mr. Bush \n     oppose ``torture and abuse.'' But his written testimony to \n     the committee makes clear that ``abuse'' is, in fact, \n     permissible--provided that it is practiced by the Central \n     Intelligence Agency on foreigners held outside the United \n     States. The Convention Against Torture, which the United \n     States ratified in 1994, prohibits not only torture but \n     ``cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.'' The Senate \n     defined such treatment as abuse that would violate the Fifth, \n     Eighth or 14th amendments to the Constitution--a standard \n     that the Bush administration formally accepted in 2003.\n       But Mr. Gonzales revealed that during his tenure as White \n     House counsel, the administration twisted this \n     straightforward standard to make it possible for the CIA to \n     subject detainees to such practices as sensory deprivation, \n     mock execution and simulated drowning. The constitutional \n     amendments, he told the committee, technically do not apply \n     to foreigners held abroad; therefore, in the administration's \n     view the torture treaty does not bind intelligence \n     interrogators operating on foreign soil. ``The Department of \n     Justice has concluded,'' he wrote, that ``there is no legal \n     prohibition under the Convention Against Torture on cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment with respect to aliens \n     overseas.''\n       According to most legal experts, this is a gross distortion \n     of the law. The Senate cited the constitutional amendments in \n     ratifying the treaty precisely to set a clear standard that \n     could be applied to foreigners. Nevertheless, Mr. Gonzales \n     uses this false loophole to justify practices that contravene \n     fundamental American standards. He was asked if there were \n     any legal prohibition against U.S. personnel using simulated \n     drowning and mock executions as well as sleep deprivation, \n     dogs to inspire fear, hooding, forced nudity, the forced \n     injection of mood-altering drugs and the threat of sending a \n     detainee to another country for torture, among other abuses. \n     He answered: ``Some might. . . be permissible in certain \n     circumstances. ``\n       This is not a theoretical matter. The CIA today is holding \n     an undetermined number of prisoners, believed to be in the \n     dozens, in secret facilities in foreign countries. It has \n     provided no account of them or their treatment to any outside \n     body, and it has allowed no visits by the Red Cross. \n     According to numerous media reports, it has subjected the \n     prisoners to many of the abuses Mr. Gonzales said ``might be \n     permissible.'' It has practiced such mistreatment in Iraq, \n     even though detainees there are covered by the Geneva \n     Conventions; according to official investigations by the \n     Pentagon, CIA treatment of prisoners there and in Afghanistan \n     contributed to the adoption of illegal methods by military \n     interrogators.\n       In an attempt to close the loophole, Sen. Richard J. Durbin \n     (D-Ill.), Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Joseph I. \n     Lieberman (D-Conn.) sought to attach an amendment to the \n     intelligence reform legislation last fall specifying that \n     ``no prisoner shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhumane \n     or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by \n     the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.'' \n     The Senate adopted the provision unanimously. Later, however, \n     it was stripped from the bill at the request of the White \n     House. In his written testimony, Mr. Gonzales affirmed that \n     the provision would have ``provided legal protections to \n     foreign prisoners to which they are not now entitled.'' \n     Senators who supported the amendment consequently face a \n     critical question: If they vote to confirm Mr. Gonzales as \n     the government's chief legal authority, will they not be \n     endorsing the systematic use of ``cruel, inhumane and \n     degrading'' practices by the United States?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we are beginning the debate on the \nnomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  When I first heard of this nomination last November, I was hopeful. I \nsaw this nomination as a chance for some long missing accountability on \nsome of the most pressing issues facing our Nation. I noted at the time \nthat I like and respect Judge Gonzales. I met with him soon after his \ndesignation and wrote to him, following up on that meeting, to inform \nhim in advance of his confirmation hearing about issues that would be \nraised about several key issues. I listened carefully to him during our \nconfirmation hearing.\n  The road he has traveled from being a 12-year-old boy selling soft \ndrinks at football games, all the way to the State House in Texas and \nto the White House, is a tribute to him and to his family. In spite of \nour disagreements on issues, I have sought to maintain a cordial \npersonal working relationship with Judge Gonzales during his years as \nPresident Bush's counsel. As Senator Kennedy has said, I dearly wish \nthat we could vote for that compelling story, and not for the nominee \nwhose record is before us. In my case, I will vote based on the record.\n  It saddened me to call Judge Gonzales last week and tell him that I \ncould not in good conscience vote to confirm his nomination to be \nAttorney General, the chief law enforcement officer of the Nation. He \nis not the person for this job.\n  My reasons for voting against Judge Gonzales arise from the need for \naccountability and derive from the nominee's involvement in the \nformulation of a number of policies that have tarnished our country's \nmoral leadership in the world and put American soldiers and American \ncitizens at greater risk.\n  When President Bush announced this nomination he said that he chose \nJudge Gonzales because of his ``sound judgment'' and role in shaping \nthe Administration's policies in the war on terrorism. Based on the \nglimpses of secret policy formulations and legal rationales that have \ncome to light, I believe his judgments not to have been sound. On the \ncontrary, several of this Administration's legal policies have been \nexceedingly harmful to our national interests.\n  As Attorney General, the nominee's judgment about our laws would be \nof enormous consequence.\n  This is a different type of Cabinet position than many others. In \nmany Cabinet positions, such as the Secretary of State, the Secretary \nof Treasury, and others, the Cabinet member states the President's \nposition. They state the President's position and carry out the \nPresident's policies. The Attorney General is different. The Attorney \nGeneral is not the Attorney General of the President; he is the \nAttorney General of the United States. This is a position where the \ncabinet member has enormous flexibility to carry out decisions--to \nbring prosecution or withhold it, to begin an investigation or to \nwithhold an investigation, to determine to go into a place where he \nbelieves there may have been a voting rights violation or to say there \nis none. This individual must be independent of the President.\n  Judge Gonzales has championed policies that are in fundamental \nconflict with decades of laws, sound military practice, international \nlaw, and human rights. He remained silent for almost 2 years about a \ndeeply flawed and legalistic interpretation of our Nation's torture \nstatute. He also accepted a patently erroneous interpretation of the \ntorture convention and apparently believes that the President, when \nacting as Commander in Chief, is above the law.\n  When I asked Judge Gonzales if he agreed with the Bybee memo's very \nnarrow reading of the law, he replied: ``I don't recall today whether \nor not I was in agreement with all of the analysis, but I don't have a \ndisagreement\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\nwith the conclusions then reached by the Department.'' This is the memo \nwhich concludes that ``physical pain amounting to torture must be \nequivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical \ninjury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even \ndeath.'' Even the Justice Department repudiated this legal memorandum, \nonce it became public.\n  Under his restrictive redefinition such practices as threatening a \nprisoner with a firearm in a mock execution, ``waterboarding'' a person \nto make him experience the suffocating effects of drowning, and, as \nSenator Kennedy noted, perhaps even cutting off a person's fingers one \njoint at a time would not amount to ``torture.'' But surely we consider \nthese practices torture when done to a member of the U.S. military or \nto an American citizen.\n  How can we, the greatest Nation on Earth, stand up and say such acts \nare not torture if committed against foreign detainees?\n  Perhaps most disturbing of all as a legal matter is the nominee's \npositing of the President as above the law. Nothing is more fundamental \nabout our constitutional democracy than our basic notion that no one is \nabove the law. Yet at his June 2004 news conference and again in his \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee he indicated that he views the \nPresident to have the power to override our law and, apparently, to \nimmunize others to perform what would otherwise be unlawful acts. This \nis about as extreme a view of executive power as I have ever heard. I \nbelieve it is not only dead wrong as a constitutional matter but \nextremely dangerous. The rule of law applies to the President, even \nthis President.\n  From the time of George Washington to George W. Bush, we have always \nmaintained that in our Nation no one is above the law--not the \nPresident, not a Senator, not a judge, not anyone in our country.\n  Ironically, it was the administration of this President's father that \nurged the Senate to ratify the torture convention. It did so to make \nclear that the United States condemns torture and to protect Americans \nfrom this barbaric practice. But if the U.S. President does not feel \nbound by the torture convention, then neither will other foreign \nleaders.\n  Ultimately, the Attorney General's duty is to uphold the Constitution \nand the rule of law--not to work to circumvent it. Both the President \nand the nation are best served by an Attorney General who gives sound \nlegal advice and takes responsible action, without regard to political \nconsiderations--not one who develops legalistic loopholes to serve the \nends of a particular administration.\n  The Attorney General appointed by the President's father remarked: \n``Nothing would be so destructive to the rule of law as to permit \npurely political considerations to overrun sound legal judgment.'' \nJudge Gonzales demonstrates a lack of independence from the President, \nsomething that we cannot have in the chief law enforcement officer in \nthe nation. He cannot interpret our laws to mean whatever the President \nwants them to mean. To do so would deny us the constitutional \nprotections upon which this nation was founded. The Attorney General is \nsupposed to represent all of the American people, not just one of them.\n  We have seen what happens when the rule of law plays second fiddle to \nthe President's political agenda. This Administration has taken one \nuntenable legal position after another regarding the rule of law in the \nwar against terror. It will not admit to making mistakes. It takes \naction only after mistakes are made public and become politically \nindefensible.\n  Given the Republican Party's leadership in Congress, the Federal \ncourts have provided what little check there has been on this \nPresident's claim of unfettered Executive power. The Congress has \nfailed to do any real oversight of that use of power.\n  Judge Gonzales's nomination initially seemed like a breath of fresh \nair. I have noted how much I personally like him. I think most people \ndo. But as I told the nominee when we met within days of the \nannouncement of his nomination, these confirmation proceedings matter. \nThe proceedings matter because it is the responsibility of this Senate \nto explore Judge Gonzales's judgment and actions in connection with the \ntragic legal and policy changes formulated in secret by this \nadministration and still cloaked from congressional oversight and \npublic scrutiny. Part of it is the fault of the Congress which has not \nconducted vigorous oversight, but a large part of this problem is due \nto an administration that has not answered the questions asked by both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  America's troops and citizens are at greater risk because of those \nactions and their terrible repercussions throughout so much of the \nworld. America's moral standing and leadership have been undercut. The \nsearing photographs of Abu Ghraib have made it harder to create and \nmaintain the alliances we need to prevail against the vicious \nterrorists who threaten us, including those who struck America 9 months \ninto this President's first term.\n  Those abuses at Abu Ghraib have served as recruiting posters for the \nterrorists. That is why this process matters. The confirmation process \nshows that on the question of judgment, Judge Gonzales is the wrong man \nfor this job.\n  After his recent inaugural address, I praised President Bush for the \neloquent words he said about the United States' historic support for \nfreedom. But to be true to that vision, we need a government that leads \nthe way in upholding human rights, not one that secretly develops \nlegalistic rationalizations for circumventing human rights.\n  To reclaim our moral leadership in the world, and to become a true \nmessenger of hope instead of a source of resentment, we need to \nacknowledge wrongdoing and show accountability for mistakes that have \nbeen made.\n  We have seen departures from our country's honorable traditions, \npractices, and established law in the use of torture, originating at \nthe top ranks of authority and emerging at the bottom. At the bottom of \nthe chain of command, we have seen a few courts martial. But at the \ntop, we have seen medal ceremonies, pats on the backs, and promotions.\n  Between these two dissonant images, there is a growing accountability \ngap. The administration's handling of this confirmation process, which \ncould have helped to narrow the gap, has served to widen it.\n  I believe in redemption in public life, as in spiritual life, but to \nget to redemption, first there has to be accountability. This \nadministration has a large and growing accountability deficit. Judge \nGonzales, who could have become a part of the solution, remains a part \nof the problem.\n  Now more than ever we need an Attorney General to serve all \nAmericans. There is much that has gone wrong that this administration \nhas stubbornly refused to admit or correct. For this democratic \nRepublic to work, we need greater openness and accountability. It is \nwith those critical considerations in mind that I must vote against \nthis nomination.\n  I believe under the earlier order, the Senator from California is now \ngoing to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent has already been agreed \nto.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand. I ask unanimous consent that I immediately \nfollow the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing Senator Hatch, Senator Schumer be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand we are coming back at 2:15 \np.m. after the caucuses?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that we lock in 10 minutes at 2:15 \np.m. for the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That will be agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member.\n  I rise today to explain why I deeply regret I cannot vote to confirm \nAlberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General.\n  I believe as a general rule the President is entitled to the Cabinet \nof his choice. But one Department, the Department of Justice, always \ndeserves special attention from Congress because it does not exist \nsolely to extend the President's policies.\n  Though the Attorney General serves under the President, he must \nindependently interpret the laws as written by Congress and be truly \nthe country's chief law enforcement officer.\n  I cannot emphasize this enough. The Department of Justice must be \nindependent from the White House. The FBI must be independent. The U.S. \nattorneys must be independent. The Criminal Law Division, the \nEnvironmental Law Division, the Civil Law Division must all be \nindependent. The Solicitor General's Office, which argues before the \nSupreme Court, must be independent. The Office of Legal Counsel, which \nis charged with interpreting the law of the executive branch, must be \nindependent. The Civil Rights Division must be independent.\n  These departments are charged with nothing less than following, \ninterpreting, and implementing the law of the United States of America. \nThe Department of Justice is in charge of defending the Nation in \ncourt. It is in charge of advising the rest of the Government about \nwhat the law means. It is in charge of overseeing the investigations of \nthe FBI, and it is in charge of deciding when to prosecute criminals \nand send them to prison. This is obviously a big portfolio.\n  The head of the Department of Justice is the chief law enforcement \nofficer of the United States. As such, the Attorney General is in \ncharge of 59 separate divisions within the Department of Justice, which \ncover more than 110,000 employees. In my view, before we vote to \nconfirm to put someone in charge of all this awesome power--and it \ntruly is awesome--it is important for us to know what that individual \nthinks about the major policies the Department will be implementing. \nAnd that is where I have been disappointed by the confirmation process \nfor Judge Gonzales.\n  When President Bush nominated Judge Gonzales, I think many of us were \nprepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. But the hearings \ncrystallized how little we knew about his own policy views, how little \nwe knew about his qualities for leadership, his policy views, his \nmanagement style, his strength of character, and his personal beliefs \nin those areas where he sets the tone and the policy. I think this was \na great missed opportunity.\n\n  John Ashcroft served 6 years in the Senate. We knew his service on \nthe Judiciary Committee. We knew about his views. One could decide \nabout his personal views, yes or no. Judge Gonzales has spent so many \nyears serving President George Bush. If confirmed, this will be the \nfifth job George Bush appointed Judge Gonzales to over the past decade. \nThe hearings were his first real opportunity to show his own views. I \nthink this is why the hearing process became so important in many of \nour views.\n  This was a crucial opportunity for Judge Gonzales. Many of us were \nprepared to vote for him. If there is a single issue that defines this \nconfirmation process, it is what Judge Gonzales thinks about torture \nand brutal interrogation practices.\n  He reminded us again and again that both he and the President condemn \ntorture. But as we know from the Bybee memo of August 2002, for at \nleast 2 years, the Federal Government followed a definition of torture \nthat was excessively narrow. In fact, it was considered so incorrect \nthat the Department of Justice revoked it on the eve of Judge Gonzales' \nhearing.\n  That memo defined torture as:\n\n       Equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious \n     physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily \n     function, or even death.\n\n  For me, in addition to its clear legal and moral importance, the \nissue of torture became the main way for assessing this next Attorney \nGeneral. And it was very important for him to state in unambiguous \nterms what he thought. It was as important a way for us to assess how \nhe approaches a problem as any.\n  In his opening statement, Judge Gonzales offered a clear, absolute \ncondemnation of torture. He said flatly:\n\n       Torture and abuse will not be tolerated by this \n     administration.\n\n  At this point, at the beginning of his testimony, there were no ifs, \nands, or buts. But after that, his testimony, both verbal and in \nwriting, was full of ambiguities. It seemed intended not to make his \nviews clear, but to shield his views, and it seemed to narrow the \ndefinition of what counts as torture.\n  For instance, at the hearing, at one point, Judge Gonzales told \nSenator Leahy, our ranking member, ``I reject that opinion,'' referring \nto the Bybee opinion. But at another point in the hearing, he told the \nsame Senator, Senator Leahy:\n\n       I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then \n     reached by the department.\n\n  Those statements are clearly in conflict, and leave me with no idea \nwhat he thinks about the Bybee memo.\n  I also note that Judge Gonzales clearly did not do everything he \nmight have done to try to answer the questions put to him.\n  In his written testimony, especially to Senator Kennedy, Judge \nGonzales refused to provide the answers or the documents requested. He \neven refused to conduct a search that would have refreshed his memory.\n  Let me quote the multiple times Judge Gonzales refused to answer \nSenator Kennedy's questions, and these are all quotes:\n\n       I do not know what notes, memoranda, e-mails or other \n     documents others may have about these meetings, nor have I \n     conducted a search.\n\n  Point 2:\n\n       I have no such notes, and I have no present knowledge of \n     such notes, memoranda, e-mail, or other documents and I have \n     not conducted a search.\n\n  Point 3:\n\n       I have no present knowledge of any non-public documents \n     that meet that description. However, I have conducted no \n     search.\n\n  Point 4:\n\n       I have no present knowledge that there are any documents of \n     the sort requested in the question, although I have not \n     conducted an independent search for such documents.\n\n  Point 5:\n\n       I have no present knowledge of any such documents or \n     materials, although I have not conducted a search.\n\n  Point 6:\n\n       I have no present knowledge of any such records, although I \n     have not conducted a search.\n\n  The last formulation he repeated in two additional instances.\n  These are not adequate answers to satisfy the nomination process for \nthe confirmation of a person to be the next Attorney General, nor do \nthey bode well for the Judiciary Committee's and this Congress's \noversight responsibilities for the Department of Justice.\n  Judge Gonzales also refused to provide many documents that we \nrequested. In specific, I asked him to provide me with a copy of the \nfinal version of his January 2002 memo to the President. That is very \nimportant because earlier memos that he had written were different. It \nwas important, if this was his final opinion, that we have an \nopportunity to look at it, because that opinion was definitive and \ndispositive.\n  The January memo is a well known one, where he wrote that the war on \nterror ``renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of \nenemy prisoners.'' If that was only a draft, as he said, as he had \nemphasized, then I believe it is imperative for us to see the final \nversion, and he refused me that opportunity. He wouldn't provide the \nmemo, saying the White House had declined to allow it.\n\n  To tell you the truth, because of the prior history, that simply is \nnot good enough for me.\n  Also of importance in the questions that he did answer, he seemed to \ncontinually narrow, again, the definition of torture. I saw this as a \nretreat from his original condemnation of torture and abuse and I \nthought it showed that he was trying more to defend the President's \npolicies than to demonstrate his own views.\n  That, in my view, is the nub of the problem. Here he was no longer \nthe President's man, he was going to be the\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nchief law enforcement officer, independent, head of 110,000 people, \nwith all kinds of major departmental responsibilities--environmental \nlaw, civil rights law, the Solicitor General, as I stated earlier in my \nremarks. I saw this narrowing as a retreat from his original \ncondemnation of torture and abuse, and I thought it showed that he was \ntrying, again, more to defend the President than to talk for himself. \nLet me give an example.\n  At the hearing he told Senator Durbin that even under the laws \nimplementing the Convention Against Torture:\n\n     aliens interrogated by the United States outside the United \n     States enjoy no substantive rights under the 5th, 8th, and \n     14th Amendments.\n\n  If this is Judge Gonzales's view, it is a significant gap in the \nprohibition against abuse.\n  I gave him the opportunity to clarify this issue. In written \ntestimony he confirmed the thrust of the answer, stating to me:\n\n       There is no legal prohibition under the Convention Against \n     Torture on cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with respect \n     to aliens overseas.\n\n  In another written question, I asked Judge Gonzales to specify his \nown views again on specific harsh interrogation methods. I wrote to \nhim:\n\n       Putting aside legal interpretations, in your own personal \n     opinion, should the United States use forced nudity, the \n     threatening of detainees with dogs, or ``water-boarding'' \n     when interrogating detainees?\n\n  That was my question in writing. He began his answer by stating:\n\n       I feel that the United States should avoid the use of such \n     harsh methods of questioning if possible.\n\n  I was asking for a statement by the man. ``If possible'' is a major \nloophole, and I truthfully don't know what it means. I don't know how \nbig that loophole is intended to be.\n  As I was reviewing the correspondence, I was struck, in particular, \nby a letter that the committee received from a group of 12 esteemed \nformer military leaders--generals, admirals, even a former chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  This letter was signed by Brigadier General David M. Brahms, Retired, \nU.S. Marine Corps; Brigadier General James Cullen, Retired, U.S. Army; \nBrigadier General Evelyn P. Foote, Retired, U.S. Army; Lieutenant \nGeneral Robert Gard, Retired, U.S. Army; Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn, \nRetired, U.S. Navy; Rear Admiral, Retired, U.S. Navy; General Joseph \nHoar, Retired, U.S. Marine Corps; Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, Retired, \nU.S. Navy; Lieutenant Claudia Kennedy, Retired, U.S. Army; General \nMerrill McPeak, Retired, U.S. Air Force; Major General Melvyn Montano, \nRetired, U.S. Air Force National Guard; and General John Shalikashvili, \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  Let me paraphrase the letter. They write as retired military \nprofessionals in the U.S. Armed Forces to express their deep concern \nabout the nomination of Alberto Gonzales and they urge us in the \nhearing to detail his views concerning the role of the Geneva \nConventions in U.S. detention and interrogation policy and practice. \nThey go on to say:\n\n       Mr. Gonzales appears to have played a significant role in \n     shaping U.S. detention operations. . . . It is clear that \n     these operations have fostered greater animosity toward the \n     United States, undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, \n     and added to the risks facing our troops around the world.\n\n  They then talk about the memo Judge Gonzales wrote to the President \non January 25, 2002, advising him the Geneva Conventions don't apply to \nthe conflict then underway in Afghanistan. They say more broadly that \nhe wrote the war on terrorism presents a new paradigm that renders \nobsolete the Geneva protections.\n  Then they go on to say, and I think this is important:\n\n       The reasoning Mr. Gonzales advanced in this memo was \n     rejected by many military leaders at the time, including \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell who argued that abandoning \n     the Geneva Conventions would put our soldiers at greater \n     risk, would ``reverse over a century of U.S. policy and \n     practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions,'' and would \n     ``undermine the protections of the rule of law for our \n     troops, both in this specific conflict [Afghanistan] and in \n     general.''\n\n  That is a huge problem out there because at best, these hearings and \nthe written questions and answers which are voluminous are really \nunable to clarify any of the positions of Alberto Gonzales, the man, \nAlberto Gonzales, head of one of the largest and most powerful agencies \nof the American Government, the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  We look at the Department of Justice one way, but most Americans look \nat it as being a major citadel of power in the United States. And on \noccasion, we have seen that power exercised. If you are going to set \nthe policy, if you are going to set the tone, if you are going to be \nthe head of this Department, I want to know what you as a man, or as a \nwoman, think, and particularly at this time.\n  Yes, it is clear that the problems we will face in the future are \nmost likely to be with respect to non-state actors, and with respect to \ntorture, which I am speaking about now. Therefore, it is \nextraordinarily important to know what this man thinks. If you ask me \ntoday, despite the hearings, despite 200 pages of questions and \nanswers, I cannot really tell you. I cannot really be sure that if the \nWhite House says one thing, the head of the Department of Justice would \nbe willing to stand up and say another. I just do not know, based on \nthe past jobs he has had and his past performance, if he is prepared to \nbe independent.\n  I have to say to this body that is important. Every one of us knows \nthat Janet Reno was an independent Attorney General. I do not know that \nAlberto Gonzales will be. I don't know his management style. I don't \nknow the vision he has for this Department. I don't know the goals he \nwould set.\n  I know he is an extension of the President. I know that he can \nlegally enable the President. I know he gives the President advice, and \nI think much of that advice has brought us into a terrible place where \nour military could well in the future be jeopardized.\n  I am one, frankly, who believes the Military Code of Justice has \nstood the U.S. military in good stead. I am one who believes the Geneva \nConvention--the Convention Against Torture--is the right thing. I am \none who believes we should follow those, even in this non-state war.\n  I want to comment on one other issue, and then I will yield the \nfloor.\n  I think Judge Gonzales is going to be confirmed. He is a talented \nlawyer and has a compelling life story. I certainly want to work with \nhim.\n  I want to say one thing about some who may say this is a qualified \nHispanic, and indeed he is. Nobody should think that the Hispanic \ncommunity is unified on this nomination. I will put into the Record, if \nI may, letters from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, certain \neditorials from newspapers, the statement of the Mexican-American Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, a statement of the Mexican-American \nPolitical Association, a letter from Major General Melvyn Montano, and \nother letters.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Albuquerque, MN,\n\n                                                 January 25, 2005.\n     Hon. Members of the Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I am writing to urge that you reject the \n     nomination of Alberto Gonzales for Attorney General. I \n     understand that some Hispanic groups support Judge Gonzales' \n     nomination and have urged you to confirm him. I write, as a \n     Hispanic and as a military officer and veteran, to offer a \n     different perspective.\n       I know what it feels like to be the first Hispanic named to \n     an important leadership position in this country. I was the \n     first Hispanic Air National Guard officer appointed as an \n     adjutant general in the United States. I am a Vietnam veteran \n     and served 45 years in the military, including 18 years in a \n     command position. I welcome the prospect of more Hispanics \n     serving in leadership positions in the government, and I \n     respect Judge Gonzales' inspiring personal story. But I \n     reject the notion that Hispanics should loyally support the \n     nomination of a man who sat quietly by while administration \n     officials discussed using torture against people in American \n     custody, simply because he is one of our own.\n       I was among 12 retired Admirals and Generals, including \n     former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John \n     Shalikashvili (Ret. USA). who wrote to you urging that you \n     closely examine Judge Gonzales' role in setting U.S. policy \n     on torture during his confirmation hearing.\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\n       At that hearing, Judge Gonzales did not allay concerns \n     about his record. To the contrary, his evasiveness and memory \n     lapses raised even more concerns. Judge Gonzales continues to \n     maintain he can't remember how the infamous torture memo was \n     generated. He has refused to explain the language in his own \n     memo which implied that rejecting the applicability of the \n     Geneva Conventions would insulate U.S. personnel from \n     prosecution for war crimes they might ``need'' to commit. And \n     he asserts that the Convention Against Torture's prohibition \n     on cruel and inhuman treatment doesn't apply to aliens \n     overseas.\n       In my view, these positions put our service men and women--\n     already facing enormous danger--at even greater risk. In my \n     capacity as Major General of the National Guard, I oversaw \n     4,800 National Guard personnel. When I think about how many \n     of our troops fighting in Iraq today are drawn from the \n     National Guard, it angers me that the danger they face has \n     been increased as a result of the policies Judge Gonzales has \n     endorsed. I wonder, if Judge Gonzales' children grow up to \n     serve in the military, would he be so cavalier in dismissing \n     the Geneva Conventions as obsolete?\n       Some have cynically suggested that Americans who question \n     Judge Gonzales' record on these issues do so because they are \n     anti-Hispanic. I reject this view. My own concerns about \n     Judge Gonzales' fitness to serve as Attorney General grow \n     from a deep respect for American values and the rule of law. \n     Judge Gonzales should be evaluated on his record, not his \n     ethnicity. On the basis of that record, I urge you to reject \n     his nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Melvyn Montano,\n\n                                             Major General (Ret.),\n     Air National Guard.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            An Open Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\n     Hon. Members of the Senate Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned, are retired professional \n     military leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces. We write to \n     express our deep concern about the nomination of Alberto R. \n     Gonzales to be Attorney General, and to urge you to explore \n     in detail his views concerning the role of the Geneva \n     Conventions in U.S. detention and interrogation policy and \n     practice.\n       During his tenure as White House Counsel, Mr. Gonzales \n     appears to have played a significant role in shaping U.S. \n     detention and interrogation operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, \n     Guantanamo Bay, and elsewhere. Today, it is clear that these \n     operations have fostered greater animosity toward the United \n     States, undermined our intelligence gathering efforts, and \n     added to the risks facing our troops serving around the \n     world. Before Mr. Gonzales assumes the position of Attorney \n     General, it is critical to understand whether he intends to \n     adhere to the positions he adopted as White House Counsel, or \n     chart a revised course more consistent with fulfilling our \n     nation's complex security interests, and maintaining a \n     military that operates within the rule of law.\n       Among his past actions that concern us most, Mr. Gonzales \n     wrote to the President on January 25, 2002, advising him that \n     the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the conflict then \n     underway in Afghanistan. More broadly, he wrote that the \n     ``war on terrorism'' presents a ``new paradigm [that] renders \n     obsolete Geneva's'' protections.\n       The reasoning Mr. Gonzales advanced in this memo was \n     rejected by many military leaders at the time, including \n     Secretary of State Colin Powell who argued that abandoning \n     the Geneva Conventions would put our soldiers at greater \n     risk, would ``reverse over a century of U.S. policy and \n     practice in supporting the Geneva Conventions,'' and would \n     ``undermine the protections of the rule of law for our \n     troops, both in this specific conflict [Afghanistan] and in \n     general.'' State Department adviser William H. Taft IV agreed \n     that this decision ``deprives our troops [in Afghanistan] of \n     any claim to the protection of the Conventions in the event \n     they are captured and weakens the protections afforded by the \n     Conventions to our troops in future conflicts.'' Mr. \n     Gonzales's recommendation also ran counter to the wisdom of \n     former U.S. prisoners of war. As Senator John McCain has \n     observed: ``I am certain we all would have been a lot worse \n     off if there had not been the Geneva Conventions around which \n     an international consensus formed about some very basic \n     standards of decency that should apply even amid the cruel \n     excesses of war.''\n       Mr. Gonzales's reasoning was also on the wrong side of \n     history. Repeatedly in our past, the United States has \n     confronted foes that, at the time they emerged, posed threats \n     of a scope or nature unlike any we had previously faced. But \n     we have been far more steadfast in the past in keeping faith \n     with our national commitment to the rule of law. During the \n     Second World War, General Dwight D. Eisenhower explained that \n     the allies adhered to the law of war in their treatment of \n     prisoners because ``the Germans had some thousands of \n     American and British prisoners and I did not want to give \n     Hitler the excuse or justification for treating our prisoners \n     more harshly than he already was doing.'' In Vietnam, U.S. \n     policy required that the Geneva Conventions be observed for \n     all enemy prisoners of war--both North Vietnamese regulars \n     and Viet Cong--even though the Viet Cong denied our own \n     prisoners of war the same protections. And in the 1991 \n     Persian Gulf War, the United States afforded Geneva \n     Convention protections to more than 86,000 Iraqi prisoners of \n     war held in U.S. custody. The threats we face today--while \n     grave and complex--no more warrant abandoning these basic \n     principles than did the threats of enemies past.\n       Perhaps most troubling of all, the White House decision to \n     depart from the Geneva Conventions in Afghanistan went hand \n     in hand with the decision to relax the definition of torture \n     and to alter interrogation doctrine accordingIy. Mr. \n     Gonzales's January 2002 memo itself warned that the decision \n     not to apply Geneva Convention standards ``could undermine \n     U.S. military culture which emphasizes maintaining the \n     highest standards of conduct in combat, and could introduce \n     an element of uncertainty in the status of adversaries.'' Yet \n     Mr. Gonzales then made that very recommendation with \n     reference to Afghanistan, a policy later extended piece by \n     piece to Iraq. Sadly, the uncertainty Mr. Gonzales warned \n     about came to fruition. As James R. Schlesinger's panel \n     reviewing Defense Department detention operations concluded \n     earlier this year, these changes in doctrine have led to \n     uncertainty and confusion in the field, contributing to the \n     abuses of detainees at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, and \n     undermining the mission and morale of our troops.\n       The full extent of Mr. Gonzales's role in endorsing or \n     implementing the interrogation practices the world has now \n     seen remains unclear. A series of memos that were prepared at \n     his direction in 2002 recommended official authorization of \n     harsh interrogation methods, including waterboarding, feigned \n     suffocation, and sleep deprivation. As with the \n     recommendations on the Geneva Conventions, these memos \n     ignored established U.S. military policy, including doctrine \n     prohibiting ``threats, insults, or exposure to inhumane \n     treatment as a means of or aid to interrogation.'' Indeed, \n     the August 1, 2002 Justice Department memo analyzing the law \n     on interrogation references health care administration law \n     more than five times, but never once cites the U.S. Army \n     Field Manual on interrogation. The Army Field Manual was the \n     product of decades of experience--experience that had shown, \n     among other things that such interrogation methods produce \n     unreliable results and often impede further intelligence \n     collection. Discounting the Manual's wisdom on this central \n     point shows a disturbing disregard for the decades of hard-\n     won knowledge of the professional American military.\n       The United States' commitment to the Geneva Conventions--\n     the laws of war--flows not only from field experience, but \n     also from the moral principles on which this country was \n     founded, and by which we all continue to be guided. We have \n     learned first hand the value of adhering to the Geneva \n     Conventions and practicing what we preach on the \n     international stage. With this in mind, we urge you to ask of \n     Mr. Gonzales the following:\n       (1) Do you believe the Geneva Conventions apply to all \n     those captured by U.S. authorities in Afghanistan and Iraq?\n       (2) Do you support affording the International Committee of \n     the Red Cross access to all detainees in U.S. custody?\n       (3) What rights under U.S. or international law do \n     suspected members of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or members of \n     similar organizations have when brought into the care or \n     custody of U.S. military, law enforcement, or intelligence \n     forces?\n       (4) Do you believe that torture or other forms of cruel, \n     inhuman and degrading treatment--such as dietary \n     manipulation, forced nudity, prolonged solitary confinement, \n     or threats of harm--may lawfully be used by U.S. authorities \n     so long as the detainee is an ``unlawful combatant'' as you \n     have defined it?\n       (5) Do you believe that CIA and other government \n     intelligence agencies are bound by the same laws and \n     restrictions that constrain the operations of the U.S. Armed \n     Forces engaged in detention and interrogation operations \n     abroad?\n           Signed,\n       Brigadier General David M. Brahms (Ret. USMC).\n       Brigadier General James Cullen (Ret. USA).\n       Brigadier General Evelyn P. Foote (Ret. USA).\n       Lieutenant General Robert Gard (Ret. USA).\n       Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn (Ret. USN).\n       Admiral Don Guter (Ret. USN).\n       General Joseph Hoar (Ret. USMC).\n       Rear Admiral John D. Hutson (Ret. USN).\n       Lieutenant General Claudia Kennedy (Ret. USA).\n       General Merrill McPeak (Ret. USAF).\n       Major General Melvyn Montano (Ret. USAF Nat. Guard).\n       General John Shalikashvili (Ret. USA).\n\nResolution Opposing The Appointment of Alberto Gonzales To Be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States by the Mexican American Bar Association of \n                             Ventura County\n\n       Whereas, the Mexican American Bar Association of Ventura \n     County was formed in 1980 and is composed of attorney members \n     and auxiliary members who for the past 25 years have promoted \n     access to justice for all, respect for the rule of law, equal \n     protection and due process of law.\n       Whereas, under other circumstances, the Mexican American \n     Bar Association of Ventura County would have been proud to \n     endorse and applaud the nomination of a fellow\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\n     Mexican American attorney to the highest law enforcement \n     position in our country; and so it is with sadness and \n     regret, that our organization finds itself in strong \n     opposition to the nomination of Mr. Alberto Gonzales, White \n     House Counsel for United States Attorney General.\n       Whereas, Alberto Gonzales, has rendered opinions proposing \n     that the United States of America and our sitting president \n     George W. Bush, can disregard the Geneva Convention; to wit, \n     Mr. Gonzales advised the President in a January 2002 \n     memorandum that the Geneva Convention did not apply to \n     detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This opinion has been \n     roundly criticized and been condemned in our country and \n     around the world, including by members of the State and \n     Defense Departments, as well as U.S. Military lawyers, \n     fearing that this policy would undermine respect for U.S. Law \n     and International law, exposing the United States' own \n     military service members to torture and abuse.\n       Whereas, it is now well known that at various military \n     detention centers at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in Afghanistan, in \n     Iraq, including Abu Ghraib prison, detainees were subjected \n     to cruel, humiliating, degrading treatment and torture, \n     leading to the injury and even death of detainees, by U.S. \n     Military officers and civilian contractors operating under \n     the auspices of the United States Department of Defense.\n       Whereas, Mr. Gonzales authored memos that condoned the Use \n     of Torture, by relaxing the definition of torture, describing \n     the prohibition contained in the Geneva Convention as \n     ``quaint'' and ``obsolete'', permitting and thereby causing \n     our nation to be shamed and disrespected, and these \n     ``opinions'' have contributed to the our country's loss of \n     the good will and the respect of a significant segment of the \n     people and countries of the world.\n       Whereas, Mr. Gonzales, advised the President that he was \n     empowered to order the detention of anyone, citizen or non-\n     citizen for indefinite periods of time, without charges being \n     presented, without access to counsel or to an impartial \n     tribunal, thus violating the most sacred requirements of due \n     process of law enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. This \n     position was later rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in the \n     case of Rasul vs. Bush, in July of 2004, upholding the \n     principle that no one is beyond the reach of the law and \n     judicial scrutiny.\n       Whereas, it is documented that Mr. Alberto Gonzales, as \n     Counsel to Governor George W. Bush of Texas, also failed to \n     provide Governor Bush with adequate information to properly \n     review clemency requests by prisoners on death row, that \n     might have compelled commutation of the death penalty or \n     further judicial review, and thus failed in his duty to act \n     as competent counsel to his client and to the People of the \n     State of Texas.\n       Whereas, Mr. Alberto Gonzales by his actions and legal \n     opinions rendered throughout his career in public positions \n     and in his current position as White House Counsel, has \n     violated his obligation to support the stated mission of \n     lawyers in the United States and specifically the mission of \n     the State Bar of Texas, his home state, which is to ``support \n     the administration of the legal system, assure to all the \n     equal access to justice, foster high standards of ethical \n     conduct for lawyers, ``and educate the public about the rule \n     of law,'' be it therefore\n       Resolved, That the Mexican American Bar Association of \n     Ventura County strongly opposes the confirmation of Alberto \n     Gonzales to the position of United States Attorney General, \n     and furthermore, strongly urges California's Senators Diane \n     Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, as well as all other members of \n     the United States Senate to vote against the confirmation of \n     Mr. Gonzales based upon his demonstrated poor judgment in \n     legal matters and his lack of commitment to the rule of law \n     and the Constitution of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  MALDEF Statement on the Likely Confirmation of White House Counsel \n   Alberto Gonzales to the Position of United States Attorney General\n\n       MALDEF, the nation's premier Latino civil rights \n     organization, released a statement today regarding the likely \n     confirmation of White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales to the \n     Cabinet post of Attorney General. Below is the statement \n     released today by Ann Marie Tallman, MALDEF President and \n     General Counsel.\n       ``The United States Attorney General upholds the laws that \n     define the very democracy of our Nation. The Attorney General \n     enforces all federal criminal and civil laws. The office \n     holder has the responsibility to determine how to use Federal \n     resources to prosecute violations of individual civil \n     liberties and civil rights--such protective laws have \n     profound impact on the daily lives of American citizens and \n     those living in the United States. Finally, the Attorney \n     General has the authority to appoint a special counsel to \n     investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute matters when the \n     Attorney General concludes that extraordinary circumstances \n     exist such that the public interest would be best served by \n     removing the matter from the Justice Department.\n       MALDEF acknowledges that Judge Alberto Gonzales can fulfill \n     his duties as Attorney General as defined by the United \n     States Constitution, the U.S. Code and various federal \n     Statutes. Judge Gonzales' personal history is compelling. He \n     has overcome significant obstacles to achieve his success. \n     His past professional experience speaks to his capabilities. \n     MALDEF remains encouraged that President Bush would make an \n     historic appointment of such a diligent individual.\n       MALDEF acknowledges Judge Gonzales' adherence to precedent \n     in the area of individual privacy rights as defined by the \n     constitutional right to privacy. We also recognize his \n     perspectives on diversity and equal opportunity in higher \n     education and employment.\n       MALDEF is America's premier Latino civil rights \n     Organization, and from this unique position, we have serious \n     questions and concerns about Judge Gonzales' record in three \n     important areas of the law. First, Judge Gonzales' public \n     statements and past record demonstrate support and deference \n     to our Federal Government's Executive branch. It will be \n     imperative for the Attorney General to question and challenge \n     unilateral exercise of executive authority when matters of \n     constitutional concern and violations of our federal laws \n     demand that the Attorney General protect individual civil \n     liberties or civil rights. In addition, there remains a \n     concern about Judge Gonzales' unique position and \n     transition--from Counsel to the President of the United \n     States to the United States Attorney General--and his ability \n     to determine when to appoint a special counsel. There is a \n     question whether Judge Gonzales can fairly and independently \n     determine in a matter he previously gave advice to the \n     President as the President's attorney, if a special counsel \n     should be appointed. A possible inherent conflict of interest \n     based upon his on-going attorney-client duties to the \n     President may impede his ability to be independent.\n       Second, due process under the law is an important \n     Constitutional protection. Judge Gonzales's past record in \n     the Texas Death Penalty cases and his association with \n     memoranda setting aside the application of international war \n     conventions as applied to enemy combatants raises concerns \n     about whether he may set aside constitutionally guaranteed \n     due process protections in various domestic circumstances.\n       Third, the federal government has sole authority and \n     responsibility to uphold our nation's immigration policies \n     while working to keep our homeland safe and secure. MALDEF is \n     concerned that Judge Gonzales, as Attorney General, may \n     delegate such important federal civil and criminal \n     immigration authority to state and local law enforcement \n     already overburdened with responsibilities to protect and \n     serve at the local level without the appropriate due process \n     protections that must remain guaranteed at the federal level.\n       We acknowledge that Judge Gonzales is likely to be \n     Confirmed as the next Attorney General of the United States \n     and the first Latino to hold this important post. MALDEF \n     stands ready to work with Judge Gonzales as he carries out \n     his duties and continues his public service. However, because \n     of our specific concerns regarding apparent primacy of \n     executive authority; a potential conflict of interest in the \n     transition from Counsel to the President to Attorney General \n     in enforcing the special counsel law; setting aside due \n     process protections; and, uncertainty about whether inherent \n     authority exists at the state and local level to enforce \n     federal immigration policy, MALDEF cannot support his \n     confirmation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2005.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy, As the Senate considers the nomination \n     of Alberto Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the \n     United States, we, on behalf of the Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus (CHC), wish to inform you that the CHC has not \n     endorsed Mr. Gonzales.\n       Since its inception almost three decades ago, the CHC has \n     served to advance the interests of the Hispanic community, \n     which includes promoting the advancement of Latinos into high \n     levels of public office. We have taken this responsibility \n     seriously, and have accordingly developed a process to \n     evaluate candidates for positions in the executive branch of \n     the federal government. Such a process is critical to \n     determining which candidates seek to hold office to serve the \n     public interest rather than to promote their own personal \n     interest. Our process has enabled us to endorse many \n     exceptional Hispanic candidates. During the past four years, \n     the CHC has proudly endorsed many judicial and executive \n     branch nominees selected by President George W. Bush.\n       One simple step in our process is a meeting with the \n     nominee. Upon hearing of Mr. Gonzales' nomination for \n     Attorney General, we invited him to meet with the CHC to \n     provide him with the opportunity to meet our Members, discuss \n     issues important to the Latino community, and to seek our \n     endorsement. We were informed that he wanted our support and \n     for the past two months, we made every attempt to accommodate \n     his schedule. However, Mr. Gonzales ultimately chose not to \n     avail himself of the courtesies we extended to him. We were \n     last advised that Mr. Gonzales was simply too occupied with \n     responding to written questions from the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee and that we would instead have to wait to until \n     after he was confirmed as Attorney General before being \n     granted a meeting.\n       Let us be clear, our concern is not about whether the CHC \n     is granted a meeting--it is\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\n     about Mr. Gonzales' unwillingness to discuss important issues \n     facing the Latino community. His answers to these questions \n     would give our community the information needed to form an \n     informed opinion of his nomination. With so little time left \n     before a Senate vote on Mr. Gonzales' nomination, the Latino \n     community continues to lack clear information about how the \n     nominee, as Attorney General, would influence policies on \n     such important topics as the Voting Rights Act, affirmative \n     action, protections for persons with limited English \n     proficiency, due process rights of immigrants, and the role \n     of local police in enforcing federal immigration laws.\n       We are disappointed and surprised that Mr. Gonzales has \n     refused to meet with the CHC during the confirmation process. \n     Much has been said about the historic nature of Mr. Gonzales' \n     nomination, as the first Hispanic to serve as U.S. Attorney \n     General. However, the historic nature of this nomination is \n     rendered meaningless for the Hispanic community when the \n     nominee declines an opportunity to meet with the group of \n     Hispanic Members of Congress who have worked for so many \n     years to open the door of opportunity to fellow Hispanics. If \n     he is not willing to meet with the CHC, how responsive can we \n     expect him to be to the needs of the Hispanic community?\n       We provide you this information as the reason for our lack \n     of endorsement of Mr. Gonzales.\n           Sincerely,\n     Grace Flores Napolitano,\n       Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n     Robert Menendez,\n       Chair, CHC Nominations Task Force.\n     Charles A. Gonzalez,\n       Chair, CHC Civil Rights Task Force.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in summary, I very much regret this, \nbut I think the U.S. Department of Justice is a unique Department. I \nthink whoever is the head of it has to stand on his own two feet, has \nto be totally independent of Congress, of the White House, and has to \nbe willing to submit to rigorous oversight by the Senate, by the \nJudiciary Committee, and has to set a tone which enables the Department \nof Justice to function as a fair and independent voice of the American \npeople, as its chief law enforcement officer.\n  I very much regret that I will vote no on this nomination.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have heard the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleagues, and I want to say I have some grave \ndisagreements with some of the things that have been said.\n  I rise in support of the President's nomination of Alberto Gonzales \nto be the next Attorney General of the United States.\n  We all know who Judge Gonzales is. Today is a remarkable day in our \ncountry's history and a momentous day for the American Hispanic \ncommunity.\n  Today, we are considering the nomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales \nwho, when confirmed, will become the first Hispanic-American Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. That is very significant. He will be \neighth in line of succession to the Presidency.\n  In 1988, President Ronald Reagan appointed the first Hispanic Cabinet \nmember, Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos. Two years later, \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush continued to make history by \nappointing the first woman and first Hispanic Surgeon General of the \nUnited States, Antonia C. Novello. Dr. Novello used to work with me as \na fellow before she succeeded Dr. Koop as Surgeon General of the United \nStates.\n  Just last week, the Senate confirmed President Bush's nomination of \nCarlos Gutierrez as Secretary of Commerce. And today, President George \nW. Bush sets yet another first. As Chairman of the Republican \nSenatorial Hispanic Task Force, I am well aware of the significance of \nthis appointment and this moment in our Nation's history. Every \nHispanic American in this country is watching how this man is being \ntreated today and throughout this debate as we discuss the nomination. \nThis nomination is just that important.\n\n  I know Judge Gonzales's life story. It has been laid out many times \nin the media and was described during the confirmation hearing. This is \na story that bears repeating in the Senate. He is an American success \nstory. He shows that no matter where anyone comes from, in America, \nthere is no limit on how far they can go.\n  As many Americans know, Judge Gonzales was the second of eight \nchildren. His father and two uncles built a small two-bedroom home with \nno running hot water in Humble, TX, where all 10 members of this family \nlived, a truly humble family. His parents had no more than a few years \nof elementary school education, and his father was a migrant worker. \nGrowing up in a working poor household, his family never even had a \ntelephone.\n  In a story familiar to many whose parents and grandparents were \nimmigrants, his parents knew the importance of an education for their \nson. After serving honorably in the U.S. Air Force, Judge Gonzales \nbecame the first person in his family to go to college. He attended the \nAir Force Academy and graduated from Rice University and Harvard Law \nSchool. Since then, Judge Gonzales has worked at one of the finest law \nfirms in Texas and this country, Vincent & Elkins, he served for 3 \nyears as the general counsel for the Governor of Texas, served as \nsecretary of state for the State of Texas, served as a justice on the \nTexas Supreme Court, and became as we all know, White House Counsel for \nPresident Bush.\n  Yet his resume tells only part of the story. His accomplishments \ninclude many professional and civic honors. He was voted the Latino \nLawyer of the Year by the Hispanic National Bar Association. He was \ninducted into the Hispanic Scholarship Fund Alumni Hall of Fame. He has \nreceived various awards from Harvard and Rice Universities, the United \nWay, the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, the League of United \nLatin American citizens, just to name a few. He has been a pillar of \nevery community in which he has lived.\n  Despite these incredible personal achievements, Judge Gonzales \nremains one of the most unassuming, humble, and decent individuals I \nhave ever had the privilege of meeting, let alone work with in \ngovernment. I know firsthand that he is well qualified to be Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, and I commend the President of the United \nStates on his choice of such an outstanding individual.\n  I am not the only person to think this. Judge Gonzales has the \nsupport of the National Council of La Raza, one of the largest Hispanic \norganizations in the country. He has the support of the Hispanic \nNational Bar Association, the Latino Coalition, the League of United \nLatin American Citizens, the National Association of Latino Leaders, \nCongressional Hispanic Conference, the United States Hispanic Chamber \nof Commerce, the Hispanic Alliance for Progress Institute, the National \nAssociation of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, the National \nAssociation of Hispanic Publishers, Minority Business Roundtable, the \nTexas Association of Mexican American Chamber of Commerce, the Congress \nof Racial Equality, the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys \nAssociation, the FBI Agents Association, the Recording Industry \nAssociation of America--just to mention a few. Anyone who says he does \nnot have the vast majority support of all Hispanics in this country and \nmost all other people who understand decency and honor just do not know \nwhat they are talking about.\n  He has garnered support from both Democrats and Republicans. The \nformer Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, under President \nClinton, Henry Cisneros, wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal in \nJanuary praising Judge Gonzales, and Senator Ken Salazar, the newly \nelected Democrat from Colorado, testified in favor of Judge Gonzales in \nour Judiciary Committee. I commend Senator Salazar for sharing his \nopinion of the nominee.\n\n  Judge Gonzales is also supported by the former Solicitor General of \nthe United States of America, Ted Olson, as well as members of the \nHeritage Foundation, the conservative institution in Washington. The \nphilosophical, religious, and ethnic diversity of this support speaks \nvolumes of his qualifications.\n  Let me take a few minutes to read from some of these letters. Janet \nMurguia, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, the \nlargest constituency-based Hispanic organization, has given a strong \nrecommendation of Judge Gonzales.\n\n       Not only is Judge Gonzales a compelling American success \n     story, it is also clear that\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n     few candidates for this post have been as well qualified. He \n     has served as Texas' secretary of state, as a member of the \n     Texas Supreme Court, and as White House counsel, and has been \n     deeply involved in his community throughout his life.\n       We are encouraged that in response to questioning, Judge \n     Gonzales agreed to review the Administration's positions on \n     sentencing reform and articulated some reservations about the \n     practice of ``deputizing'' local police to enforce \n     immigration laws.\n       If confirmed, Gonzales would be the first Hispanic attorney \n     general and the first Latino to serve in one of the four \n     major cabinet posts--Secretary of State, Treasury, Defense, \n     and Attorney General.\n       While we have had our policy differences with the Bush \n     Administration, we are confident that Judge Gonzales is \n     someone who will serve his country with distinction and who \n     will also be accessible and responsive to the concerns of the \n     Hispanic community. We urge the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     and the U.S. Senate to confirm him as soon as possible.\n\n  She speaks for the vast majority of Hispanics in America.\n  Similarly, the Latino Coalition strongly supports Judge Gonzales. In \na press release dated November 11, 2004, it states:\n\n       Judge Gonzales is the perfect choice for the next U.S. \n     Attorney General. The Judge has been an instrumental part of \n     the legal efforts to boost the war on terrorism and keep \n     America safe and secure, while upholding the highest \n     standards in government ethics. Judge Gonzales brings to the \n     Office of the U.S. Attorney General a distinguished legal \n     record based on his many years of work in the public and \n     private sector. He also brings a unique perspective and human \n     experience understood only by those whose families have \n     migrated to a foreign land with little resources and not \n     knowing the language. It is for this cultural depth and his \n     unique legal qualifications that we urge the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee and all members of the U.S. Senate to put partisan \n     politics aside so that Hispanics are no longer denied \n     representation in this important post. . . . We have been \n     honored to work with the Judge for many years now, and have \n     personally witnessed his ability to unite people of all \n     different backgrounds to get things done. He is an extremely \n     qualified and intelligent attorney who will serve with \n     distinction and make every Latino proud. We endorse his \n     nomination without any reservations.\n\n  He will make every Latino proud. He has up to this time everywhere he \nhas been. He has set a good example and has done what is right in his \ngovernment work.\n  The FBI Agents Association wrote to the committee last December:\n\n       We write to express the support of the FBI Agents \n     Association for the nomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales for \n     Attorney General of the United States. . . . We believe \n     Judge Gonzales' practical life experiences, his legal \n     training and education, his judicial expertise and his \n     close proximity to and involvement with many of the most \n     difficult jurisprudence issues associated with the ongoing \n     war against terror make him a nominee fully worthy of \n     confirmation by the U.S. Senate. We are also confident \n     that Judge Gonzales' experience in and firm appreciation \n     of the issues in today's national criminal justice system \n     will serve him and the nation well as the next Attorney \n     General.\n\n  I can guarantee the FBI Agents Association does not send \nrecommendations like that in the case of people who are not worthy.\n  The National District Attorneys Association also expressed strong \nsupport for Judge Gonzales in a letter dated December 17, 2004. This is \na bipartisan association of all the national district attorneys of the \ncountry:\n\n       During Judge Gonzales' tenure as Counsel to the President \n     our leaders have had frequent opportunities to meet with him \n     and to discuss with him issues challenging our public safety. \n     Through these meetings we have come to recognize both his \n     commitment to protecting the American public and to ensuring \n     closer working relationship between federal, state and local \n     law enforcement organizations.\n       With the increasingly complex challenges facing us in our \n     fights against both organized gangs and terrorists he brings \n     the skills and legal acumen necessary for this position of \n     responsibility. We are confident that his confirmation will \n     enhance the safety of our citizens from threats, domestic and \n     international, while safeguarding those liberties that we all \n     treasure.\n       As leaders for the only national organization representing \n     the local prosecutors of this nation we have the utmost \n     confidence in his ability to master this most challenging \n     position and pledge to do everything within our ability to \n     ensure that the working relationship between the Department \n     of Justice and America's prosecutors grows even stronger.\n\n  Finally, let me read excerpts from a Wall Street Journal article \nwritten by Henry Cisneros, who was the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment in the Clinton administration and was the mayor of San \nAntonio for 8 years. This is what Mr. Cisneros had to say:\n\n       The last four years have posed harrowingly difficult \n     dilemmas, especially those related to the 9/11 terrorist \n     attack on our nation and the military and security actions \n     that resulted from it. There have been successes and \n     failures, there have been good judgments and misjudgments--\n     all in the context of war, that is, a context of military \n     organizations under stress, of imperfect information, of \n     life-and-death concerns. The American people decided in \n     November, for better or for worse, to see this conflict \n     through. It would be unseemly at this juncture to use the \n     forum of a Senate confirmation process to try to find a \n     scapegoat for a war that is at a very difficult stage. In any \n     event, Alberto Gonzales has done nothing to alter the basic \n     facts that he is a seasoned legal professional, is needed by \n     the president, and is a person of sterling character.\n\n  Mr. Cisneros goes on to say:\n\n       As an American of Latino heritage, I also want to convey \n     the immense sense of pride that Latinos across the nation \n     feel because of Judge Gonzales's nomination. I had the high \n     honor of serving in a president's cabinet, as have five other \n     American Hispanics, but we all served in what might be called \n     ``outer circle departments.'' The historic character of this \n     nomination is that Judge Gonzales has been nominated to one \n     of the big four--State, Defense, Treasury, and Justice. This \n     is a major breakthrough for Latinos, especially since it is \n     so important to have a person who understands the framework \n     of legal rights for all Americans as attorney general.\n       Judge Gonzales has demonstrated a nuanced understanding of \n     the struggles people face as they try to build a life for \n     their families in our country. Perhaps that appreciation \n     comes from remembrances of his own family's struggle. In the \n     Commencement Address at his alma mater, Rice University, \n     earlier this year, he recalled: ``During my years in high \n     school, I never once asked my friends over to our home. You \n     see, even though my father poured his heart into that house, \n     I was embarrassed that 10 of us lived in a cramped space with \n     no hot running water or telephone.''\n\n  As an aside, I understand that. We had a humble home like that. We \ndid not have indoor facilities at first. I knew what it was like to not \nbe ashamed of my home but not wanting to bring people there. I \nunderstand Judge Gonzales. I was there, too.\n  I will continue on with Henry Cisneros's comment. Remember, he was a \nCabinet member in the Clinton administration, and he strongly supports \nJudge Gonzales. This is what Mr. Cisneros said:\n\n       On another occasion, [Judge Gonzales] said: `` . . . my \n     father did not have many opportunities because he had only \n     two years of formal schooling, and so my memories are of a \n     man who had to work six days a week to support his family. . \n     . .He worked harder than any person I have ever known.''\n\n  That is what Judge Gonzales said.\n  Mr. President, this is the person who my Democratic colleagues are \ntrying to defeat--a man who has bipartisan support throughout the \ncountry, and big-time support; a man who represents the American dream \nto so many of us; the man who deserves to be the next Attorney General. \nBut to listen to these comments by our colleagues--and I think over the \nnext couple days to listen to them--they act as if somebody has to be \nperfect to be a Cabinet member in any administration. But certainly in \nthe Bush administration, they must be perfect. Not only do they say \nthat, but you will find there are many distortions of his record. They \ntake things out of context and blow them out of proportion.\n\n  I worked closely with Judge Gonzales during President Bush's first \nterm, and I have found him to be a man of his word. Unfortunately, in a \nmisguided attempt to bring this fine individual down, some people, \nsomehow, blame Judge Gonzales for the abuses that have occurred at Abu \nGhraib. As many Americans, I, too, am concerned about the alleged \nabuses of detainees apprehended in the war on terror. When I saw the \npictures in the media of detainees at Abu Ghraib, I was simply \ndisgusted. I think all decent Americans were disgusted. They understand \nthe abuses that occurred there were repugnant and inconsistent with our \nrenewed commitment to promoting liberty and democracy. There is \nabsolutely no debate about that.\n  In addition, there are more allegations in the media recently about \nindividuals being subjected to water-boarding, or suffering from \ncigarette burns, and other acts of physical intimidation that must be \ntaken seriously as well. I take these allegations very seriously--very \nseriously. Regardless of what the precise legal definition of \n``torture'' is,\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\nwhen you see or hear about acts of physical abuse of prisoners, even in \na time of war, it is very disturbing.\n  It should be obvious enough that it does not need to be said, but I \ncondemn the torturous acts that occurred at Abu Ghraib. The President \ncondemns torture. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle condemn \ntorture. Make no mistake about it, Judge Gonzales condemns torture. \nJudge Gonzales must have said that dozens of times before and after his \nhearing, both orally and in writing. He opposes torture, period. He \ncould not have been clearer on this issue. To have his record distorted \nis hitting below the belt.\n  There are many Americans who believe someone in the Government should \nbe held responsible for these abuses. I agree. All of the individuals \nresponsible for those atrocious acts should be punished. And they are \nbeing punished. The military immediately investigated. They have \nimmediately prosecuted. Some of them have been sentenced, and the \nothers will be. There is no question about it; they should be punished. \nHowever, these convictions do not get as much attention from the press \nas the photos themselves.\n  The fact is, the convictions do not provide the political ammunition \nfor those who oppose the President and this administration.\n  Nonetheless, just earlier this month, Charles Graner was convicted \nfor his role in detainee abuse. He was sentenced to 10 years of \nimprisonment. He also received a military demotion and was dishonorably \ndischarged, as he should have been.\n  He is not the only person who has been convicted. The military has \ndisciplined four members of a special operations unit for abusing \ndetainees in Iraq, including at least one case of the use of a Taser \nstun gun. It has also subjected two individuals to administrative \npunishments and four others to nonjudicial punishments. The Department \nof Defense has completed eight investigations and has three additional \nongoing investigations.\n  Lest we forget, the scandal of Abu Ghraib was the subject of an \ninternal Government investigation well before the media broke the \nstory. I am sure that as time goes on, there will be more \ninvestigations and more prosecutions of these people who acted as non-\nAmericans, as far as I am concerned. In the global war against \nterrorism, American soldiers and employees must conduct themselves \nhonorably, and we will insist they do so--and so has Judge Gonzales \ninsisted that they do so.\n  Congress takes this oversight role very seriously. I was a cosponsor \nto S. Res. 356, which we passed last May, condemning the abuse of Iraqi \nprisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, urging a full and complete \ninvestigation to ensure justice is served, and expressing support for \nall Americans serving nobly in Iraq.\n  In August, the Defense Department Appropriations Act became law. It \nreaffirmed Congress's view that torture of prisoners of war and \ndetainees is illegal and does not reflect the policies of the U.S. \nGovernment or the values of the people of the United States.\n  In December, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005 \nbecame law. This law includes a prohibition on the use of funds by the \nJustice Department to ``be used in any way to support or justify the \nuse of torture by any official or contract employee of the United \nStates Government.''\n  In addition, at least five committees have held hearings on Abu \nGhraib in the 108th Congress. Since May, the Armed Services Committees \nof both Houses took testimony from numerous Defense Department \nofficials. Secretary Rumsfeld himself testified four times. Other \nwitnesses include GEN Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff; Acting Secretary of the Army, Les Brownlee; U.S. Army Chief of \nStaff, GEN Peter Schoomaker; and Central Command Deputy Commander, LTG \nLance Smith.\n  The committees Interviewed General Taguba, the author of the Taguba \nReport, which investigated the photos of abuse at Abu Ghraib. They held \nhearings and heard testimony from general officers who conducted a \nformal investigation into the allegations of abuse, known as the Fay \ninvestigation and from James Schlesinger and Harold Brown, who were \nappointed by the Secretary of Defense to head the Independent Panel to \nReview DOD Detention Operations--otherwise known as the Schlesinger \nReport. The Senate also interviewed the Army Inspector General about \nhis investigation, and interviewed Stephen Cambone, Undersecretary of \nDefense for Intelligence. The Senate Armed Services Committee took \ntestimony from Central Command Commander General John Abizaid, \nLieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, who commanded the Multi-national \nForce-Iraq; Major General Geoffrey Miller, Deputy Commander for \nDetainee Operations in Iraq, and Colonel Marc Warren, Army Judge \nAdvocate General.\n  Despite all this, there are some people who believe that not enough \nhas been done. And I respect their views. But it seems that now, a \nsmall but vocal group of those individuals have attempted to create an \nalmost mob mentality--looking for any high level official in the Bush \nadministration to take the blame. And Judge Gonzales has become the \nfavorite scapegoat for some. People who cannot even bring themselves to \nspeak optimistically about our prospects in Iraq in the days before and \nnow after the day of the historic election itself, surely have no \nqualms about creating a scapegoat out of Judge Gonzales. This man--a \ncommitted public servant, a veteran of our Armed Forces--deserves \nbetter.\n  Let us not lose focus here. Judge Gonzales has been nominated to be \nthe Attorney General--not the Secretary of Defense.\n  And when these abuses occurred, Judge Gonzales was not the Secretary \nof Defense. It was not his responsibility to tell soldiers which \nspecific interrogation tactics to use.\n  In fact, it was not even his responsibility to provide legal advice \nto the Secretary of Defense on torture or any other subject. Providing \nlegal advice to executive branch departments and agencies is the role \nof the Department of Justice. His primary role was to provide legal \nadvice to the President of the United States and other White House \nofficials.\n  Now if Judge Gonzales is confirmed, it will become his responsibility \nto become the Nation's principal law enforcement official and help see \nthat each American receives equal justice under the law.\n  But it is inappropriate and unfair to blame Judge Gonzales for legal \nadvice given by somebody else in the Department of Justice years before \nhe was even nominated to work in the White House.\n  For example, some opponents of Judge Gonzales have gone on at length \nabout the so-called Bybee memo. Before I get into the specifics of this \nmemo, let me bring you back to the months following September 11, 2001. \nAll of us here remember exactly where we were when the planes crashed \ninto the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania \nthat morning. None of us will forget the feelings of vulnerability we \nall felt in the days, weeks and months following the attack.\n  President Bush has rightly made preventing another terrorist attack \non U.S. soil his No. 1 priority. I know that my fellow citizens in Utah \nshare the President's priorities when it comes to fighting terrorism. \nIn fact, the first major international event that took place after 9/11 \nwas held in Salt Lake City when my community hosted the winter Olympic \ngames.\n  Here in the Senate, a mere month after the attack, we were terrorized \nby a letter sent to Senator Daschle's office containing anthrax. The \ndistinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee was mistreated \nand threatened. Staffers, workmen, and visitors stood in line all day \nto be screened for anthrax, and hundreds of individuals took strong \nantibiotics as a preventative measure. I recall that time period where \nevery day you would wake up wondering whether something terrible was \ngoing to happen that day.\n  The Bush administration, too, was facing difficult questions. We all \nthought that another terrorist attack could come at any moment, and it \nwould be incredibly difficult to predict when or where such an attack \nwould occur because our enemy acted in a clandestine manner. They \ndressed as civilians, not as soldiers. They did not attack our military \nbut tens of thousands of innocent civilians, urban centers, and \ngovernment buildings. These\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\nindividuals did not come from one specific country. They were a \nfanatic, ideological enemy with international reach. They could be \nanywhere. And they had the money to finance their terrorist activities.\n  It was during these early months that the administration explored \nwhat its options were and how they should act in confronting this \nunique enemy, one that fought not in uniforms on battlefields, not for \na particular nation but in blue jeans and American civies.\n  Some are claiming that the President relied on the Bybee memo in \nformulating his policy with respect to interrogation techniques at Abu \nGhraib. Let's take a look at these documents. First, the so-called \nBybee memorandum was not written by Judge Gonzales, in spite of the \nimplications by some. It was written by Jay Bybee who, at that time, \nwas the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel at \nthe Department of Justice, and is now a distinguished judge on the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. That is why some people \ncall it the Bybee memo. They could not call it the Gonzales memo. It is \nnot the Gonzales memo, has never been the Gonzales memo.\n  The memo is dated August 1, 2002. Remember that date. The memo \naddresses the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and \nDegrading Treatment or Punishment. It does not analyze the Geneva \nConvention. Let me just mention that this is a scholarly piece of \nanalysis. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with its legal \nconclusion, there can be little doubt that this 50-page, single-spaced \ndocument with 26 footnotes is a thoughtful and thorough analysis.\n  Let me also say that this memo does not tell the President to use \ntorture in Iraq. Rather it tries to define what torture is from a \npurely legal perspective.\n  Let's compare the Bybee memo with the President's actual memorandum \non the treatment of detainees. The subject of this memo is the humane \ntreatment of al-Qaida and Taliban detainees. The President's memo was \nwritten on February 7, 2002. This is 6 months before the Bybee \nmemorandum. So there is absolutely no way the President could have \nrelied on the August 1, 2002, Bybee memo because it did not exist at \nthe time he issued his definitive February 7 directive, the one that he \nand others followed.\n  Let me be clear: I am not saying the Justice Department never \nconsidered the Convention Against Torture prior to August 1, 2002. In \nfact, given the voluminous length of the analysis, it probably took \nsome time to write. But to suggest this Bybee memo, which addresses a \ndifferent statute, a statute that is nowhere mentioned in the \nPresident's memorandum, was indispensable in crafting the President's \ndecision is simply false for the simple reason it did not exist at the \ntime.\n\n  What some of my Democratic colleagues are trying to do is hold Judge \nGonzales responsible for a memorandum he did not write and that came \nfrom the Justice Department which he did not direct.\n  The Bybee memo asks an important question: What is torture? This is a \ncritical question to ask in the middle of a war on terror in which our \nenemies have made it clear that they will not observe the Geneva \nConventions or any other rule of civilized conduct. Judge Gonzales \nreceived the Bybee memo, but some of my friends across the aisle are \nalmost suggesting that he actually wrote it. He did not. He had nothing \nto do with it. In fact, they criticize him because they believe he did \nnot object to the memo at the time he received it. But the fact is, we \ndo not know what his private legal advice was to the President on the \nBybee memo because that advice is privileged advice. And Presidents do \nnot want their counsel divulging privileged advice.\n  In fact, we should think twice before we ever proceed down the path \nof attempting to require the White House Counsel to divulge to the \nCongress in an open hearing precisely what legal advice he gave to the \nPresident on an inherently sensitive matter such as those that directly \nrelate to national security.\n  When all is said and done, Judge Gonzales did not supervise Jay \nBybee. He did not supervise Attorney General Ashcroft. It was not his \njob as White House Counsel to approve of memos written by the Justice \nDepartment. And that memo of February 7 said the detainees should be \ntreated humanely. That was the President's position.\n  I have a lot more I want to say about this, but I notice the \ndistinguished Senator from New York is here and wanted to say a few \nwords before we break for lunch. I will interrupt my remarks. I \ncouldn't interrupt a few minutes earlier. I will come back to this \nsubject.\n  I hope the Chair will allow the senior Senator from New York to have \na few extra minutes. I would be happy to sit in the chair, if needed. \nBut I will relinquish the floor and ask unanimous consent if I can \nfinish my remarks after the luncheon; is that possible?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have consent following the lunch. I \nthink the Senator from----\n  Mr. HATCH. Immediately after the consent order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is entitled to finish.\n  Mr. HATCH. Especially being interrupted and accommodating colleagues \non the other side. I would like to finish.\n  Mr. SPECTER. There had been a request for Senator Mikulski for 10 \nminutes right after lunch.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, at 2:15. We don't have to break at 12:30. We could \ncontinue on. I was off the floor. What was the request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a minute?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't have the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah be willing to \nawait the completion of the remarks of Senator Mikulski for 10 minutes \nat 2:15 and Senator Schumer at 2:15 and then he will resume his \nremarks?\n  Mr. HATCH. Following Senator Mikulski?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will withhold, how much longer does the \nSenator from Utah have?\n  Mr. HATCH. I have a little bit more. It could be as long as a half \nhour.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My unanimous consent request is that at 2:15, when we \nresume, Senator Mikulski be recognized for 10 minutes and Senator \nSchumer be recognized for 10 minutes and then Senator Hatch be \nrecognized to conclude his remarks, then Senator Cornyn be recognized, \nand then Senator Kennedy be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, it would be Senators \nSchumer, Hatch, Cornyn, and Kennedy?\n  Mr. SPECTER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to exercise my constitutional \nresponsibility pertaining to the nomination of Mr. Alberto Gonzales to \nbe Attorney General of the United States.\n  Over the weekend, all of us were heartened to see the enormous \nturnout of the Iraqi people seeking democracy and participating in the \nprocesses of democracy, even risking life and limb to vote in an act of \nself-determination over the future of Iraq. I was particularly filled \nwith joy when I saw that women were free to participate in a democratic \nprocess in Iraq. But as we look to Iraq's move toward a democratic \nframework, the United States of America must continue to lead the way, \nbut also lead by example--how our own country, through its processes \nand the people who govern, stand up for the principles that have been \nthe hallmark of the United States of America.\n  It is because of these principles of truth, justice, dignity, civil \nrights, human rights, and the enforcement of the rule of law that when \nit comes to the nomination of Judge Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney \nGeneral, I must reluctantly say that I cannot support this nomination.\n  When you meet Mr. Gonzales, you find him to be a warm, engaging \nperson, a person of civility and courtesy who has an incredibly \ncompelling personal story.\n  But we are not here to vote for a personal story; we are here to vote \nfor the Attorney General of the United States, whose job is to enforce \nthe law. Sure, we hear what a great background Mr. Gonzales has: the \nson of migrant workers, the first in his family to go to college and to \nlaw school, to work at a prestigious law firm, to go on to the Supreme \nCourt of Texas, and be a Counsel to the President of the United States. \nBut this is a man who, in his very act as Counsel to the President, \ncreated a whole new framework that created a permissive atmosphere for \nthe United States of America to engage in torture. That is \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. Gonzales attended the U.S. Air Force Academy--wow, what a great \naccomplishment. If anyone would understand the risk to troops should \nthey fall and be taken prisoners of war, why they should be held under \nthe Geneva Convention which protects the rights of a prisoner, it \nshould be someone who attended the U.S. Air Force Academy, which has a \nhigh rate of graduates taken POW.\n  Certainly the story is inspiring, but we are not voting on a personal \nstory. The Attorney General must be committed to core constitutional \nvalues and to the rule of law. He must have a record of independence \nand good judgment. Mr. Gonzales has not demonstrated that commitment. \nIn his zealous attempt to be the protector of the President, he has \nadopted legal reasoning at odds with core constitutional values. He has \nrejected long-established legal principles and compromised our Nation's \nmoral leadership. He failed in the most important job, telling the \nPresident no, and speaking truth to power.\n  After a careful review of his record, I do not believe that Judge \nGonzales can fulfill the principles we want at the Department of \nJustice.\n  This issue of torture is a very troubling one. Mr. Gonzales's advice \nto the President on this issue as well as detention and interrogation \nare very disturbing. Under his watch the administration changed the \ndefinition of torture, limiting it to physical pain equivalent in \nintensity to pain accompanying serious physical injury or even death. \nHis advice provided the pathway to the President to exempt U.S. \nofficials from international law governing torture.\n  What did that mean? It meant that if the United States of America \nengaged in torture, he wanted to have legal arguments to show we would \nnot be tried as war criminals. In his 2002 memo to President Bush, he \nprovided a legal analysis that allowed the President to sidestep \ninternational principles governing humane treatment. He said that the \nnew form of war ``renders quaint'' the Geneva Conventions. That \nstatement is outrageous. Quaint means outdated or old fashioned. It \nmeans it is an Edsel. Quaint is a hoola hoop. It is not a treaty. You \ndon't call the Geneva Convention that. Though it's often not enforced \nas vigorously as we would want, it is the one tool that has protected \nour own troops. It sets guidelines for humane treatment of prisoners. \nIf America flaunts these laws--what will happen to our soldiers if they \nare captured. That is why the military's judge advocate general corps \nand former Secretary of State Powell urged the President to stand \nbehind the Geneva Conventions.\n  Since 9/11 we know that America has been fighting a different kind of \nwar. We do know that we have to get information from terrorists who \nhave predatory intents toward our country. We do need to look at new \napproaches, and maybe even reforming the Geneva Convention. But we \nshould not do it by flouting international law.\n  The memorandums that Gonzales oversaw allowed a framework and an \nattitude for torture to take place.\n  Now where are we? We have troops under court-martial, and what we \nhave is punishment at the bottom and condoning at the top.\n  We can't have an Attorney General like that. We need to have an \nAttorney General who seeks the truth, who wants to help protect the \nUnited States of America and protect the United States of America for \nwhat it stands for. This is one of the reasons I cannot support him.\n\n  But let's say 9/11 had never taken place and he had never written \nthat memo and we had never gone to war in Iraq--wouldn't we all love \nit? I still would have flashing yellow lights about Mr. Gonzales. One \nof his main jobs is to recommend Federal judicial nominations. The way \nhe has gone about nominations for the appellate court has been \ntroubling. The White House Counsel's Office has pushed some of the most \nideological and extreme judicial nominees we have ever seen, nominees \nwith hostility to civil rights, to women's rights, to environmental \nrights, and to disability rights. This is even more troubling as we \nface a possible Supreme Court vacancy.\n  Let me talk as the Senator from Maryland. I know it firsthand. We \nhave a vacancy on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and its \nMaryland's seat that is vacant. Who did Gonzales pick? First of all, he \nwanted a nominee who was not even a member of the Maryland bar. That \nwas pretty sloppy or pretty ideological. Then they picked someone with \nminimal qualifications. There are over 30,000 lawyers in Maryland and \nthey couldn't find somebody who was a member of the Maryland bar? Why \nnot? They found three for the Federal district court. Instead they \nwanted to play politics, and the way he wanted to play politics was to \ntake away the Fourth Circuit seat from Maryland and give it to \nVirginia.\n  We should not play politics with judicial nominations. Do we want an \nAttorney General who will play politics with the law, play politics \nwith the court, and just play politics with international conventions \ndesigned to protect our troops? I do not want to play that kind of \npolitics. I am going to vote against Alberto Gonzales.\n  Let me say this: The position of Attorney General is unique in \nAmerican Government. As leader of the Department of Justice, the AG \nmust have a deep respect for the Constitution. That person has to be \nstrong and willing to do what is right, regardless of politics, of \npressure, or what is popular. The Attorney General is America's most \nimportant lawyer but also the people's lawyer, to protect the American \npeople and important institutions.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Gonzales has spent the last 4 years as a single-\nminded advocate for Presidential policies, which he himself should have \ncautioned the President against undertaking. He could have advised the \nPresident and shown respect for the law. But that is not his record. If \nhe cannot value America's constitutional principles and give \nindependent advice to the President, I can't vote for him for Attorney \nGeneral.\n  When we look at all the others things he has done--he skirted \nquestions about the President's authority on torture; he didn't want to \nanswer questions for the committee. He said he couldn't remember, then \nhe couldn't find this and he couldn't find that--I can't find it in me \nto vote for him.\n  There are those who say the President has a right to his nominations. \nThe President does have a right to a nomination, but that doesn't mean \nhe has the right to get his nominee. The Founders of this country, the \npeople\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\nwho invented America and wrote the Constitution of the United States, \ngave the Senate an advice and consent function. That means, to advise \nthe President on best policies and best possible people, before we give \nour consent to the President.\n  I cannot be a rubberstamp. I have to vote my conscience and to cast \nmy vote, reluctantly, against Alberto Gonzales.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this has been one of the most difficult \nvotes on a nominee I have had to make since coming to the Senate, and \nthat is because I like Judge Gonzales. I respect him. I think he is a \ngentleman, and I think he is genuinely a good man. We have worked well \ntogether, especially when it comes to filling the vacancies on New \nYork's Federal bench. He has been straightforward with me, he has been \nopen to compromise, and the bench is filled with good people.\n  Our interactions have not just been cordial, they have been pleasant. \nI have enjoyed the give and take in which we have engaged. Therefore, \nwhen President Bush nominated Judge Gonzales to be Attorney General, my \nfirst reaction was positive. Unlike with judicial nominees which are \nlife appointments from a separate branch of Government, Cabinet \nofficers serve the President, and I generally believe we should show \ndeference to the President's choices. That is why I was inclined to \nsupport Judge Gonzales. I believed, and I said publicly, that Judge \nGonzales was a much less polarizing figure than Senator Ashcroft had \nbeen.\n  But less polarizing than John Ashcroft is not enough alone to get my \nvote. Even if you are, as Judge Gonzales is, a good person with top-\nnotch legal qualifications, you still must have the independence \nnecessary to be the Nation's chief law enforcement officer. The \nAttorney General is unlike any other Cabinet officer. For all those \nother Cabinet officers, simply carrying out the President's agenda is \nenough. But to be a good Attorney General, unqualified deference to the \nPresident is not enough. Unlike all the other Cabinet positions, where \nyour role is to implement and advance the President's policies as \nAttorney General, as the Nation's chief law enforcement officer, your \njob is to enforce the law, all the laws, whether they hurt or help the \nadministration's objectives.\n  This position requires a greater degree of independence than, for \nexample, the Secretary of State, whose obligation is to advance the \nPresident's interests abroad. When the White House asks the Justice \nDepartment, Can we do x? Can we wiretap this group of people? The \nJustice Department is charged with giving an objective answer, not one \ntailored to achieve the President's goals. That is the chief law \nenforcement officer of the land--separate from the President's right-\nhand person. As I have said before, it is hard to be a straight shooter \nif you are a blind loyalist.\n  There are two models for an Attorney General: loyalist and \nindependent, and we all know there were Attorneys General over the \nyears who have been close to the President. Robert Kennedy is a great \nexample. He served his own brother. But that said, no one ever doubted, \nin the confines of the Oval Office, Bobby Kennedy would oppose his \nbrother if he thought he was wrong. Judge Gonzales is more of a \nloyalist than an independent, but that alone does not disqualify him. \nIt raises concerns, but after extensive review of the record, \nunfortunately and sadly, and despite my great personal affection for \nJudge Gonzales, his testimony before the committee turned me around and \nchanged my vote from yes to no. He was so circumspect in his answers, \nso unwilling to leave even a micron of space between his views and the \nPresident's, that I now have real doubts whether he can perform the job \nof Attorney General.\n  In short, Judge Gonzales still seems to see himself as Counsel to the \nPresident, not as Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer \nof the land.\n  I would like to give a little bit of history. Judge Gonzales came and \nsaw me back in December. We had a good conversation on a range of \ntopics. I respected and appreciated his commitment to recuse himself \nfrom the investigation into the felony disclosure of then-covert CIA \nagent Valerie Plane's identity.\n  I told him that I understood 9/11 created a brave new world; that the \nwar on terror required reassessment of the rules of law; and I told him \nthat given the enemies we now face, we couldn't afford to be \ndoctrinaire.\n  I told him I supported the administration when it comes to \naggressively reexamining the way we do business and interrogating \nwitnesses.\n  I agree we have to make sure we are doing everything we can do to \nprotect American families from those who would do us harm to prevent \nanother 9/11, but I also told Judge Gonzales that I was troubled that \nthe administration had undertaken its reworking or reinterpretation of \nthe rules of war behind closed doors rather than engaging the Congress \nand the American public and the international community in an open and \ndirect fashion.\n  Time and time again the administration has gotten itself into trouble \nby trying to go at it alone rather than doing business in the open, \nparticularly in the Justice Department. Whether it was the total \ninformation awareness project, the TIPS Program, or torture, they have \nbeen burned by their peculiar penchant for complete secrecy.\n  I encouraged Judge Gonzales to be candid with the committee when \ndiscussing these issues. I encouraged him to give us some hope that he \nwould run a different department, a more open department, one more \nwilling to listen to the oral arguments than John Ashcroft.\n  Unfortunately, even a cursory review of his answers reveal strict \nadherence to the White House line and barely a drop of independence.\n  A set of answers very important to me came in response to my \nquestions on the nuclear option--whether to rule from the chair that \nSenators were not allowed to filibuster judicial nominees.\n  When we met in private, I asked Judge Gonzales his opinion about the \nconstitutionality of the nuclear option. He said he had not reviewed \nthe applicable constitutional clauses, and that in any event it was a \nmatter reserved for the Senate. I asked him at that private meeting \nbefore the hearing.\n  It wasn't taking him by surprise in any way to look at the \nConstitution. I told him I would ask the question again at the hearing. \nI informed him that his answer on this question would weigh heavily on \nmy decision whether to support his confirmation.\n  At the hearing, when I asked Judge Gonzales about the nuclear option, \nrather than being candid, he completely avoided the question, ducking, \ndodging, and weaving.\n  I asked him three times to give his opinion, and each time he \nrefused. I asked him twice more in writing, and again he refused to \nanswer. In one of those questions, I simply asked him to imagine he was \ncounsel to a U.S. Senator who was seeking his opinion on the \nconstitutionality of the nuclear option, and no interference in serving \nthe President. Again, he refused to answer.\n\n  This is a crucial issue for me for two reasons. First, the importance \nof the nuclear option; and second, the importance of Judge Gonzales's \nindependence as Attorney General.\n  I believe the nuclear option would be so deeply destructive it would \nturn the U.S. Senate into a legislative wasteland and turn the \nConstitution inside out. Madison's ``cooling saucer'' would be \nshattered into shards.\n  Judge Gonzales in his refusal to answer such vital questions and even \ngiving opinions so that we might see the way he thinks weighs a lot \nwith me, at least in terms of my vote, not in terms of him as a person.\n  The matter repeated itself on question after question. On torture and \nnearly everything else, it seemed as if Judge Gonzales was going out of \nhis way to avoid answering. He demonstrated a lack of \nstraightforwardness and independence on just about every single \nquestion he was asked--again, no glimmer of light between how he might \nsee things and how the President might see things.\n  When you are the chief law enforcement officer of the land, when you \nare asked to rule on sensitive questions that balance liberty and \nsecurity, you can't just do what the President wants all the time or \nyou are not serving your country or serving the job. It is different \nfrom other Cabinet positions.\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n  I concluded that Judge Gonzales still sees himself as a White House \nCounsel rather than the nominee to be Attorney General, the chief law \nenforcement officer of the land.\n  I have great respect for the judge. The Horatio Alger story that he \nhad makes all of us proud to be Americans. It makes us glad about the \nfuture of new communities as they rise in America. It is truly an \namazing country when a man can rise from such humble beginnings to be \nnominated Attorney General.\n  I am mindful of the fact that if he is confirmed, as I anticipate he \nwill be, Judge Gonzales will be the Nation's first Hispanic Attorney \nGeneral. It is a tremendous success story that makes this vote even \nmore difficult, although I am also mindful of the fact that the \nHispanic Caucus voted against his nomination.\n  When I called Judge Gonzales last week to tell him how I would be \nvoting, he was understandably disappointed but he was, as always, a \ngentleman. He assured me we would continue working together to solve \nour Nation's problems. He assured me he would prove me wrong, and I \nhope he does.\n  It was one of the most difficult conversations I have had in a long \ntime. But it is too significant a job and too important a time to have \nan Attorney General about whom we have such severe doubts.\n  I have no choice but, with sadness, to vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I received a letter this morning \naddressed to Senator Collins and myself, Senator Leahy and Senator \nLieberman, from Senator Kennedy and Senator Durbin concerning the \ncertain second report from the Department of Justice. Immediately on \nreceiving the letter, I contacted the Department of Justice to obtain a \ncopy of the report. This is a report that did not go to Judge Gonzales \nbut went to another client agency by the Department of Justice advising \nthem as to the legal parameters for interrogation techniques, and that \nthe identity of the memoranda that previously had been disclosed to \nSenator Leahy, although the memo had not been transmitted. And the \nmatter had been briefed to the chairman of the oversight committee \nwhich has jurisdiction over the client committee. I am not very happy \nabout all this circumlocution, but that is the information I have.\n\n  Since Senator Kennedy was scheduled to speak in a few minutes when I \ngot this at 2:20, I am advising my colleagues one of them is a \nrecipient of the letter, Senator Leahy; another is the writer of the \nletter, Senator Kennedy.\n  I ask unanimous consent these documents be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nfortunately getting a letter like that is sort of like getting a big \npackage addressed to you--and it is true, it was addressed to me--and \nyou open the package and of course there is nothing in there and it \nstill does not answer the question.\n  I will not object. I also appreciate the courtesy of the chairman \nmaking sure that everyone knew the letter had arrived.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I received the letter this morning, I took steps to \ntry to identify the memoranda and obtain it, if possible. These are the \nresults. They ought to be made part of the record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2005.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         SOB, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You have inquired about a memorandum \n     from the Office of Legal Counsel, described in recent press \n     reports as being signed by Jay Bybee, then Assistant Attorney \n     General for the Office of Legal Counsel, and addressed to \n     another agency, signed on or about the same date as the \n     August 1, 2002, memorandum which has been made public, \n     addressing the legality of specific interrogation practices \n     under 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2340 and 2340A.\n       As the Department of Justice made clear in a letter to \n     Senator Leahy dated July 1, 2004, (enclosed) ``[t]he \n     Department of Justice has given specific advice concerning \n     specific interrogation practices, concluding that they are \n     lawful.'' As the Department also made clear at that time, \n     that advice is classified and the Department will not discuss \n     it further publicly. Thus, the existence of a classified \n     opinion from the Department of Justice on the subject of \n     specific interrogation practices has been publicly \n     acknowledged for more than six months. As the Department \n     noted in the July 1, 2004 letter, that advice has been \n     appropriately provided by the client agency in a classified \n     setting to the relevant oversight committee.\n       Finally, the Office of Legal Counsel in its recent \n     memorandum of December 30, 2004, stated ``we have reviewed \n     this Office's prior opinions addressing issues involving \n     [interrogation] of detainees and do not believe that any of \n     their conclusions would be different under the standards set \n     forth in this memorandum.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                             William E. Moschella,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n       Enclosure.\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 1, 2004.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This responds to your letter, dated \n     June 15, 2004, which enclosed written questions for the \n     record of the Committee's oversight hearing on June 8, 2004, \n     regarding terrorism, with particular reference to the \n     interrogation of detainees.\n     Questions 1 through 4: Administration documents\n       In response to the requests for documents contained in your \n     first four questions, enclosed are six Department of Justice \n     documents that have been released publicly. They are: (1) a \n     memorandum from the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) to the \n     Counsel to the President and the General Counsel of the \n     Department of Defense on the ``Application of Treaties and \n     Laws to al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees,'' dated January 22, \n     2002; (2) a letter from the Attorney General to the President \n     on the status of Taliban detainees, dated February 1, 2002; \n     (3) a memorandum from OLC to the Counsel to the President on \n     the ``Status of Taliban Forces Under Article 4 of the Third \n     Geneva Convention of 1949,'' dated February 7, 2002; (4) a \n     memorandum from OLC to the General Counsel of the Department \n     of Defense on the ``Potential Legal Constraints Applicable to \n     Interrogations of Persons Captured by U.S. Armed Forces in \n     Afghanistan,'' dated February 26, 2002; (5) a letter from OLC \n     to the Counsel to the President on the legality, under \n     international law, of interrogation methods to be used during \n     the war on terrorism, dated August 1, 2002; and (6) a \n     memorandum from OLC to the Counsel to the President on \n     ``Standards of Conduct for Interrogation under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2340-2340A,'' dated August 1, 2002.\n       While these are documents that would not usually be \n     disclosed to anyone outside the Executive Branch, the \n     Administration decided to release a number of documents, \n     including these and including many from the Department of \n     Defense, to provide a fuller picture of the issues the \n     Administration had considered and the narrower policies the \n     Administration actually adopted in this important area. While \n     we appreciate your interest in the additional documents set \n     forth in the attachment to your letter, the Executive Brand \n     has substantial confidentiality interests in those documents. \n     OLC opinions consist of confidential legal advice, analysis, \n     conclusions, and recommendations for the consideration of \n     senior Administration decisionmakers. The disclosure of OLC \n     opinions that have not been determined to be appropriate \n     for public dissemination would harm the deliberative \n     processes of the Executive Branch and disrupt the \n     attorney-client relationship between OLC and \n     Administration officials. We are not prepared to identify \n     these documents specifically or reveal which documents may \n     be classified, but we can assure you that no portions of \n     any of these documents have been classified since the \n     Attorney General's testimony on June 8, 2004.\n       We also can state that included in the memoranda that have \n     been released are all unclassified, final written opinions \n     from the Department of Justice addressing the legality of \n     interrogation techniques used in interrogations conducted by \n     the United States of al Qaeda and Taliban enemy combatants. \n     While the Department has not issued written opinions \n     addressing interrogation practices in Iraq, it has been the \n     consistent understanding within the Executive Branch that the \n     conflict with Iraq is covered by the Geneva Conventions, and \n     the Department has concurred in that understanding.\n       Lastly, we note that some of the documents requested \n     originated with other agencies such as the Departments of \n     State and Defense. Consistent with established third-agency \n     practice, we suggest that you contact those agencies directly \n     if you wish to obtain copies of their documents.\n       5. Do you agree with the conclusions articulated in an \n     August 1, 2002, memorandum from Jay Bybee, then AAG for the \n     Office of Legal Counsel, to Alberto Gonzales, Counsel to the \n     President, that: (A) for conduct to rise to the level of \n     ``torture'' it must include conduct that a prudent lay person \n     could reasonably expect would rise to the level of ``death, \n     organ failure, or the permanent impairment of a significant \n     bodily function,'' and (B) section 2340A, of the Federal \n     criminal code ``must be construed as not applying to \n     interrogations undertaken pursuant to [the President's] \n     Commander-in-Chief authority''?\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\n       (A) In sections 2340 & 2340A of title 18, Congress defined \n     torture as an act ``specifically intended to inflict severe \n     physical or mental pain or suffering.'' Because Congress \n     chose to define torture as encompassing only those acts that \n     inflict ``severe . . . pain or suffering,'' Department of \n     Justice lawyers who are asked to explain the scope of that \n     prohibition must provide some guidance concerning what \n     Congress meant by the words ``severe pain'' (emphasis added). \n     In an effort to answer that question, the August 1, 2002 \n     memorandum examines other places in the federal code where \n     Congress used the same term--``severe pain.'' In at least six \n     other provisions in the U.S. Code addressing emergency \n     medical conditions, Congress identified ``severe pain'' as a \n     typical symptom that would indicate to a prudent lay person a \n     medical condition that, if not treated immediately, would \n     result in--``(i) placing the health of the individual . . . \n     in serious jeopardy, (ii) serious impairment to body \n     functions, or (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ \n     or part.'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 139w-22(d)(3)(B); see also 8 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1369(d) (same); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395x(v)(1)(K)(ii); id. \n     Sec. 1395dd(e)(1)(A); id. Sec. 1396b(v)(3); id. Sec. 1396u-\n     2(b)(2)(C). In light of Congress's repeated usage of the \n     term, the memorandum concluded that, in Congress's view, \n     ``severe pain'' was the type of pain that would be \n     associated with such conditions. (The opinion refers to \n     these medical consequences as a guide for what Congress \n     meant by ``severe pain''; it does not state, as your \n     question suggests, that, to constitute torture, conduct \n     must be likely to cause those consequences.)\n       Although, in other statutory provisions, Congress \n     repeatedly associated ``severe pain'' as a symptom with \n     certain physical or medical consequences, it is open to doubt \n     whether that statutory language actually provides useful \n     guidance concerning, the prohibition in sections 2340 & \n     2340A. A description of medical consequences--consequences \n     which could be accompanied by a variety of symptoms including \n     varying degrees of pain--does not necessarily impart useful \n     guidance to a lay person concerning the meaning of ``severe \n     pain'' The Office of Legal Counsel is currently reviewing \n     that memorandum with a view to issuing a new opinion to \n     replace it and may well conclude that the meaning Congress \n     intended when it defined torture to require ``severe pain'' \n     is best determined from the other sources addressed in the \n     original memorandum, including standard dictionary \n     definitions. See, e.g., FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 476 \n     (1994) (``In the absence of [a statutory] definition, we \n     construe a statutory term in accordance with its ordinary or \n     natural meaning.'').\n       (B) The analysis in the August 1, 2002, memorandum \n     concerning the President's authority under the Commander-in-\n     Chief Clause, U.S. Const. art. II, sect. 2, c1. 1, was \n     unnecessary for any specific advice provided by the \n     Department. The Department has concluded that specific \n     practices it has reviewed are lawful under the terms of \n     sections 2340 & 2340A of title 18 and other applicable law \n     without regard to any such analysis of the Commander-in-Chief \n     Clause. The discussion is thus irrelevant to any policy \n     adopted by the Administration. As a result, that analysis is \n     under review by the Office of Legal Counsel and likely will \n     not be included in a revised memorandum that will replace the \n     August 1, 2002, memorandum. The Department believes that, as \n     a general matter, the better course is not to speculate about \n     difficult constitutional issues that need not be decided. For \n     the same reason, it would be imprudent to speculate here \n     concerning whether some extreme circumstances might exist in \n     which a particular application of sections 2340 & 2340A would \n     constitute an unconstitutional infringement on the \n     President's Commander-in-Chief power. Cf Request of the \n     Senate for an Opinion as to the Powers of the President `In \n     Emergency or State of War,' 39 Op. A.G. 343, 347-48 (1939).\n       6. Has President Bush or anyone acting under his authority \n     issued any order, directive, instruction, finding, or other \n     writing regarding the interrogation of individuals held in \n     the custody of the U.S. Government or as an agent of the U.S. \n     Government? If so, please provide copies. If any portion of \n     any document is provided with redactions, please explain the \n     basis for such redactions. The basis for withholding any \n     document should also be explained in detail.\n       On June 22, 2004, the White House released the instruction \n     issued by the President to the Department of Defense on \n     February 7, 2002, concerning the treatment of al Qaeda and \n     Taliban detainees (it does not, however, expressly address \n     interrogation practices). The Department of Justice is not \n     aware of any writing issued by the President that expressly \n     addresses the issue of interrogations practices. The \n     President has, however, made it clear that the United \n     States does not condone or commit torture. We should also \n     emphasize that the President has not in any way made a \n     determination that doctrines of necessity or self-defense \n     would point conduct that otherwise constitutes torture. \n     The President has never given any order or directive that \n     would immunize from prosecution anyone engaged in conduct \n     that constitutes torture.\n       We assume that to the extent your question asks about \n     directives issued by others under the President's authority \n     it is limited to interrogations of enemy combatants in the \n     conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban or interrogations of \n     persons detained in connection with the conflict in Iraq. As \n     you know, numerous law enforcement agencies of the Executive \n     Branch have likely acted under the President's authority as \n     Chief Executive to issue numerous directives concerning \n     interrogations or interviews of subjects in custody in the \n     ordinary course of enforcing the criminal and immigration \n     laws. We assume that such directives are outside the scope of \n     your question.\n       Numerous individuals acting under the President's authority \n     have undoubtedly issued orders or instructions regarding \n     interrogations of individuals in U.S. custody, both in the \n     conflict with al Qaeda and the Taliban and in the conflict in \n     Iraq. Such documents, however, are not Department of Justice \n     documents. Those documents should be sought from the \n     appropriate departments or agencies that issued them, through \n     the appropriate oversight committees in Congress.\n       As for the Department of Justice, the General Counsel of \n     the FBI issued a memorandum on May 19, 2004, reiterating \n     existing FBI policy with regard to the interrogation of \n     prisoners, detainees or other persons under United States \n     control. That memorandum reiterated established FBI \n     requirement that FBI personnel ``may not obtain statements \n     during interrogations by the use of force, threats, physical \n     abuse, threats of such abuse, or severe physical \n     conditions.'' It also set forth reporting requirements for \n     known or suspected abuse or mistreatment of detainees. A copy \n     of that memorandum is enclosed. The Department is still \n     following up to determine whether there are any other similar \n     written directives relevant to your question. Please also see \n     the response to Question 8 concerning the Department's legal \n     advice to other agencies.\n       7. On Friday June 11, 2004, the President was asked the \n     following question at a press conference: ``Mr. President, \n     the Justice Department issued an advisory opinion last year \n     declaring that as Commander-in-Chief you have the authority \n     to order any kind of interrogation techniques that are \n     necessary to pursue the war on terror . . . [D]id you issue \n     any such authorization at any time?'' The President answered: \n     ``No, the authorization I issued . . . was that anything we \n     did would conform to U.S. law and would be consistent with \n     international treaty obligations.'' Please provide a copy of \n     the authorization to which the President was referring. \n     Please also provide a copy of the Presidential directive you \n     had before you and referred to at the hearing.\n       At the press conference to which you refer, it seems likely \n     that the President was referring to the February 7, 2002, \n     instruction discussed above. At the hearing before the \n     Committee, the Attorney General was also referring to the \n     President's instruction of February 7, 2002. The Attorney \n     General did not have any Presidential directive before him at \n     the hearing, He was merely reading language from the February \n     7, document that had been incorporated into his notes.\n       8. Were you ever asked to approve or otherwise agree to a \n     set of rules, procedures, or guidelines authorizing the \n     interrogation of individuals held in the custody of the U.S. \n     Government or an agent of the U.S. Government? If so, please \n     indicate when you were asked to do so, and whether you did, \n     in fact, approve or agree in any way in whole or in part. In \n     addition, please provide a copy of any such rules, procedures \n     or guidelines, or explain your basis for refusing to do so.\n       The Department of Justice has given specific advice \n     concerning specific interrogation practices, concluding that \n     they are lawful. The institutional interests the Executive \n     Branch has in ensuring that agencies of the Executive Branch \n     can receive confidential legal advice from the Department of \n     Justice require that that specific advice not be publicly \n     disclosed. In addition, that advice is classified. We \n     understand that, to the extent the client department(s) have \n     not already done so, they will arrange to provide the advice \n     to the relevant oversight committees in a classified setting.\n       As noted above, included among the memoranda that the \n     Department has already released are all unclassified, final \n     written opinions from the Department of Justice addressing \n     the legality of interrogation techniques used in \n     interrogations conducted by the United States of al Qaeda and \n     Taliban enemy combatants. While the Department has not issued \n     written opinions addressing interrogation practices in Iraq, \n     it has been the consistent understanding within the Executive \n     Branch that the conflict in Iraq is covered by the Geneva \n     Conventions, and the Department has concurred in that \n     understanding.\n       9. What were the criteria the Department used in selecting \n     civilian contractors to assist in the reconstituting of \n     Iraq's prison system? Please describe the vetting process to \n     which they were subjected. To what extent were concerns about \n     their backgrounds known to the officials who recommended them \n     to you and to what extent were you, aware of such concerns \n     when you selected them? Why were such concerns dismissed when \n     such individuals were recommended to you and selected by you? \n     Please explain in detail.\n       It was and is essential that we do whatever we can to help \n     create a fair and humane criminal justice system in Iraq. To \n     that end, the Department of Justice responded to urgent \n     requests from the Coalition Provisional Authority (``CPA'') \n     and its predecessor for the provision of experts in the areas \n     of prosecution, policing, and corrections. The individuals \n     whom the Department of Justice has sent to Iraq--federal \n     prosecutors, former state and local police officers; and \n     corrections experts--have volunteered to take on\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\n     one of the most dangerous missions in that country. They \n     are literally on the front lines: in the courts, in the \n     police stations, and in the prisons.\n       The experts the Department provided to the CPA--including \n     the corrections experts--have had neither responsibility for, \n     nor control over, individuals detained by the Coalition \n     military forces. The Department's role is strictly limited to \n     the Iraqi criminal justice system. In particular, the \n     corrections experts have operated heretofore under the \n     direction of the CPA's Senior Advisor to the Iraqi Justice \n     Ministry. Thus they have had no involvement in any of the \n     alleged abuses at the military portions of the Abu Ghraib \n     prison that are currently under investigation by Congress and \n     by the United States Military.\n       Ensuring that these contractors are appropriately screened \n     is a responsibility that we take very seriously. But it is \n     important to note that we are aware of no allegation that any \n     of the corrections contractors committed or countenanced any \n     abuse of prisoners in Iraq. To the contrary, their central \n     role in rebuilding the Iraqi prison system--including \n     creating systems for reporting and correcting abuses by Iraqi \n     prison officials--has been highly praised by the CPA's Senior \n     Advisors to the Iraqi Justice Ministry. Nevertheless, at the \n     Attorney General's request, the Inspector General is \n     undertaking a review of the process used to screen and hire \n     corrections advisors sent to Iraq.\n       With regard to the process for selecting the initial team \n     of corrections experts, which deployed in May 2003, the \n     Deparment of Justice consulted experts in the Bureau of \n     Prisons (BOP) and the American Correctional Association. The \n     Department contacted one of the individuals recommended by \n     BOP, a former BOP Regional Director, and requested his \n     assistance in further vetting proposed assessment team \n     members. That individual agreed to join the first assessment \n     team, and to help recommend other members. Candidates were \n     required to submit SF 85Ps (Questionnaires for Public Trust \n     Positions) and fingerprint cards. NCIC checks were conducted. \n     No disqualifying information was found.\n       A second assessment team was deployed starting in September \n     2003. This team was selected based in part on BOP \n     recommendations and in part on recommendations of members of \n     the first assessment team. To be sure, some of the \n     corrections experts sent to Iraq previously had been named in \n     lawsuits in the United States, in their capacities as the \n     directors of major state corrections systems. Although we do \n     not minimize the significance of such lawsuits, they are \n     commonplace for prison officials. And as far as we are aware, \n     none of the corrections experts sent to Iraq was ever found \n     by a court to have committed or countenanced abuses against \n     prisoners in their custody.\n       As the need for corrections advisors grew, the Department \n     worked with a government contractor firm to identify \n     qualified candidates willing to serve in Iraq. Since January \n     2004, more than 80 additional correctional experts have \n     served, or are now serving, in Iraq. These candidates were \n     also required to submit SF85Ps and fingerprint cards. The \n     preliminary results of our internal review indicate that a \n     few caudidates were deployed before the necessary checks \n     had been completed. (We would note, however, that we are \n     aware of no allegations or findings of abuse of prisoners \n     by these candidates in Iraq or elsewhere.) Appropriate \n     remedial action is being taken to address this situation.\n       It goes without saying that these experts have taken on one \n     of the most dangerous of tasks in Iraq. We are glad to be \n     able to report to you that, so far as we have been able to \n     determine, they have done so in a manner that has brought \n     honor to the United States. We nevertheless recognize that we \n     must engage in constant vigilance to ensure that this remains \n     the case, and intend to do so throughout the duration of our \n     mission in Iraq.\n       10. Is the Department of Justice currently drafting, or \n     considering drafting, legisation to authorize the President \n     to detain individuals as ``enemy combatants? If the \n     Department is drafting or considering drafting such \n     legislation, will you consult with us before submitting it to \n     Congress?\n       The Department is not currently drafting or considering \n     drafting such legislation. The Department does not believe \n     that such legislation is necessary at the present time. \n     Although the Department is still evaluating the full import \n     of the Supreme Court's recent decision, the decision in \n     Harmdi v. Rumsfeld, No. 03-6696, slip op. at 9-17 (June 28, \n     2004), confirms that additional legislation is unnecessary. \n     In Hamdi, the Court held that in the Authorization for Use of \n     Military Force, 115 Stat. 224 (Sept 18, 2001), Congress has \n     ``clearly and unmistakably authorized detention'' of enemy \n     combatants, id. at 12, including American citizens, where an \n     enemy combatant is defined as a person who is ``part of or \n     supporting forces hostile to the United States or coalition \n     partners'' and who ``engaged in an armed conflict against the \n     United States,'' id at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n       Should circumstances change, the Department would always be \n     willing to work with the Committee to ensure that necessary \n     and appropriate legislation is enacted.\n       11. During the Judiciary Committee hearing last week, you \n     mentioned the limitation placed on the torture statute (18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2340-2340A) by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 7(9). This section \n     was added to the definition of ``special maritime and \n     territorial jurisdiction'' by section 804 of the USA-PATRIOT \n     Act--originally an Administration proposal. The \n     Administration explained at the time, in its sectional \n     analysis, that the provision would ``extend'' Federal \n     jurisdiction to ensure that crimes committed by or against \n     U.S. nationals abroad on U.S. Government property did not go \n     unpunished. Unmentioned in the Administration's explanation \n     was that this provision creates a jurisdictional gap in our \n     ability to prosecute acts of torture.\n       (A) Did the Department of Justice know and intend that the \n     proposed amendment would restrict the applicability of the \n     anti-torture statute?\n       (B) Would the Department support legislation to restore the \n     pre-PATRIOT Act reach of the torture statute, making it \n     applicable to U.S.-owned, U.S.-run, and U.S.-controlled \n     facilities, including aircraft, ships, and other mobile \n     sites, located outside of the United States? If not, why not?\n       (C) Would the Justice Department support further extension \n     of the torture statute, to make it applicable anywhere \n     outside the geographical borders of United States (i.e., the \n     50 states, the District of Columbia, and the commonwealths, \n     territories, and possessions of the United States)? If not, \n     why not?\n       (A) An inquiry with Department personnel who were involved \n     in drafting the amendment to the provision defining the \n     special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United \n     States (``SMTJ''); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 7; has determined that they \n     were unaware of the potential that the amendment had for \n     affecting the applicability of sections 2340 & 2340A. To the \n     contrary, the provision was intended, as the Department's \n     section-by-section analysis indicated, to ensure jurisdiction \n     over crimes committed by or against U.S. nationals at \n     embassies and consular offices and on military bases and \n     other U.S. facilities overseas. In particular, the amendment \n     was intended to address a conflict among the courts of \n     appeals concerning the extraterritorial application of an \n     existing paragraph in section 7 and to codify the \n     longstanding position of the United States that the SMTJ did \n     extend to overseas bases. Compare United States v. Gatlin, \n     216 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding, contrary to position \n     taken by the United States, that section 7(3) does not apply \n     extraterritorially), with United States v. Corey, 232 F.3d \n     1166 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that section 7(3) does apply \n     extraterritorially), and United States v. Erdos, 474 F.2d 157 \n     (4th Cir. 1973) (same).\n       (B) The Department would support legislation making \n     sections 2340 & 2340A applicable to U.S.-owned, U.S.-run, and \n     U.S.-controlled facilities outside the United States. The \n     question, however, assumes that such applicability was clear \n     before the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act. As our answer to \n     part A indicates, that is not enturely accurate. Rather, \n     before the PATRIOT Act, there was a circuit split concerning \n     the scope of the SMTJ and whether or not it applied to \n     overseas military bases. Thus, under the view of the Ninth \n     Circuit, the SMTJ extended to military bases overseas and \n     accordingly sections 2340 & 2340A would not have appled to \n     such bases. See Corey, 232 F.3d at 1172. Under the view of \n     the Second Circuit, on the other hand, the SMTJ did not \n     extend to bases overseas, and sections 2340 & 2340A would \n     have applied to such bases. See Gatlin, 216 F.3d at 223.\n       The Department will gladly work with Congress to draft \n     appropriate legislation to achieve the objective of applying \n     sections 2340 & 2340A to such bases overseas. Simply \n     returning statutory language to its pre-PATRIOT Act form, \n     however, is likely not the best means for achieving that \n     goal.\n       (C) The Department would have no objection to such \n     legislation, and would work with the Committee to ensure that \n     it is carefully drafted to achieve its intended effect.\n\n                                 * * *\n\n       We hope that this information is helpful. We will \n     supplement this response with additional information relating \n     to other questions for the hearing record as soon as \n     possible. Please do not hesitate to contact this office if \n     you would like additional assistance regarding this or any \n     other matter.\n       Sincerely,\n                                              William E.

Fortunately, though, the letter and the way it has been \ndescribed by the chairman is absolutely correct. He has been very \nstraightforward in his description. But it does not say, and the \nquestion was asked of Mr. Gonzales and the White House, was he aware--\nwas he, Alberto Gonzales aware--of the second Bybee memo. That does not \nrequire a classified answer. It is either a ``yes'' or ``no'' and he \nstill refused to answer yes or no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, out of deference to my Democratic \ncolleagues this morning, I interrupted my remarks to allow Senator \nSchumer to speak briefly on the nominee. It now has been several hours \nsince I last spoke. Let me briefly recap for those just joining this \ndebate.\n  Everyone knows I support the nomination of Judge Gonzales to be the \nnext Attorney General of the United States.\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nEarly this morning, I talked about Judge Gonzales's inspirational \npersonal background. I talked about his educational and professional \nqualifications, and they are many. I talked about all the awards he has \nwon from so many civic organizations. I talked about many of the \nnumerous organizations, individuals, and entities that support his \nnomination--virtually most strong Hispanic organizations, including the \nDistrict Attorneys Association and the FBI Agents Association, and \nothers, as well.\n  In short, I talked about why this man is the right person for this \ndifficult job at this challenging time and why we should not stand in \nthe way of his fulfilling this wonderful opportunity--the first \nHispanic ever nominated to one of the big four Cabinet level positions. \nI even went over other major first-time Hispanic nominations to major \npositions in this country all the way from President Reagan, to the \nfirst President Bush, and finally to our current President.\n  I also talked about how this man--this good, honorable, decent man--\nis being treated by some like a scapegoat. Some of my colleagues are \ntrying to unfairly blame Judge Gonzales for abuses committed by \nrenegade soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison. But Judge Gonzales, of \ncourse, was not in charge of the soldiers in the field. He was not the \nperson telling soldiers what interrogation techniques they could or \ncould not use. I, like the President, like Judge Gonzales, and like \nmany of the American public, was sickened by the abuses that occurred \nat Abu Ghraib prison. But these violations are not going unpunished.\n  I talked about the investigations, prosecutions, and convictions the \nDefense Department has undertaken with respect to those perpetrators \nand how despicable those perpetrators are. I know we will see more \nprosecutions and convictions as time goes on. The Defense Department \nhas been active on this, acted immediately, and has been acting ever \nsince. It may not be published in the front pages of the newspapers and \nyou may not hear about it on the 6 o'clock news, but these people are \ngoing to be brought to justice for their wrongdoing. To blame Judge \nGonzales for this is making him a scapegoat. That is wrong.\n  That is not the only thing my colleagues are trying to unfairly blame \nJudge Gonzales for. They are trying to blame him for the so-called \nBybee memo, a memo Judge Gonzales did not write--a memo that was \nwritten by an agency, the Department of Justice, that Judge Gonzales \ndid not work in; an agency for which Judge Gonzales was not \nresponsible. And there has been an implication here that he, as White \nHouse Counsel, should have reversed everything and told the Justice \nDepartment what to do. If he had done that, he would be criticized for \nthat.\n  The fact of the matter is the Justice Department is the advisory body \non these types of legal issues for the executive branch of Government. \nHe may be White House Counsel, but that does not give him the right to \nchange any opinion given by the Justice Department.\n  I brought out that on February 7, before the Bybee memo was brought \nforth, on February 7 of the same year, the President did sign a \nmemorandum with regard to the Taliban and al-Qaida that basically said \nthat although these prisoners did not qualify for Geneva Convention \nprotections they should be treated humanely. We do not hear a lot about \nthat memorandum. If we do, his critics will probably distort it.\n\n  I would like to spend a few minutes to focus specifically on the \nGeneva Conventions. There has been a lot of discussion and, frankly, a \nlot of misinformation. I would like to take a few moments to clarify. \nSome of the legal principles involved might sound a little complicated, \nbut I will try to explain this as simply as I can.\n  The Geneva Conventions are an international treaty. One key question \nfacing the United States as we fought back against the terrorists was \nwhether Iraq, the Taliban, and al-Qaida should be treated differently \nunder this treaty.\n  First, as we all know, treaties are signed by countries. They are not \nsigned by individuals for individuals. Iraq signed the Geneva \nConventions. There has never been any question that the Geneva \nConventions apply to our conflict in Iraq where Abu Ghraib is located. \nAfghanistan also signed the Geneva Conventions. Afghanistan, however, \nhas been embroiled in internal violent conflicts for 22 years. There \nwas no legally recognized leader, no legally recognized central \ngovernment and, for that matter, there were not even basic government \nservices in the country at that time. The Taliban was a vile faction \nstruggling for control of the nation, but it did not have anything like \ncontrol over the entire country.\n  There was a question about whether Afghanistan was a failed state as \na matter of international law. If it was a failed state, then the \ntreaty, naturally, would not apply to it. Ultimately the President \ndecided regardless of what the law requires, that he was going to apply \nthe Geneva Conventions to the Taliban. That is what it says in the \nPresident's February 7, 2002 memorandum.\n  Going to the third category, al-Qaida is not a country. They are not \na faction within a single country. They are a group of individuals from \nlots of different places who go around the world spreading terror and \nmurdering innocent people. Simply put, they are a gang of terrorists, \nnot a country. Since al-Qaida is not a country, they could not sign the \ntreaty, nor would they, and we all know that. So it makes perfect sense \nto conclude that the President is not legally required to apply the \nGeneva Conventions to al-Qaida.\n  So far, the analysis has been pretty straightforward. You sign the \ntreaty, the treaty applies to you. The next step is a little more \ncomplicated. Under the Geneva Conventions, all detainees are not \ntreated alike. In order to receive preferential treatment as a \ndetainee, you must qualify as a POW, a prisoner of war. In order to be \nconsidered a prisoner of war, the group must have an organized command \nstructure, uniforms, or insignia, openly carry arms and obey the laws \nof war. Al-Qaida and the Taliban detainees cannot qualify as POWs.\n\n  Neither al-Qaida nor the Taliban have a permanent centralized \ncommunications infrastructure--the way you would expect to find such in \na typical military organization. The Taliban is a loose array of \nindividuals with shifting loyalties among various Taliban and al-Qaida \nfigures. Defections and bribery are rampant.\n  Second, the Taliban and al-Qaida members wear no uniform or other \ninsignia that serve as a ``fixed sign recognizable at a distance.'' \nThey dress like civilians in that area of the world.\n  Third, although the Taliban carry arms openly, so do many in \nAfghanistan. They do not attempt to distinguish themselves from others \ncarrying weapons.\n  Lastly, al-Qaida and the Taliban do not follow the laws of war. We \nare all too familiar with how al-Qaida operates since we saw their \ndespicable handiwork on September 11, 2001. They dress as civilians. \nThey specifically attack civilians after hijacking civilian commercial \nairlines. They transform civilian aircraft into weapons of destruction \nto murder thousands of ordinary, innocent human beings.\n  The Taliban used mosques for ammunition storage and for command and \ncontrol meetings. They put tanks and artillery in close proximity to \nhospitals, schools, and residences. The Taliban has massacred hundreds \nof Afghan civilians, raped women, and pillaged villages. They use \nvillages as human shields to protect stockpiles of weapons and \nammunition.\n  In fact, there is no indication that the Taliban understood or \nconsidered themselves bound by or aware of Geneva Conventions. The \nTaliban made little effort to distinguish between combatants and \nnoncombatants when engaging in hostilities. For example, they killed \nfor racial or religious purposes.\n  So even if the Geneva Conventions applied to al-Qaida, it would not \ngive them preferential treatment because they are not POWs. In fact, as \nI understand it, there is no significant difference between the \ntreatment being accorded to the Taliban and al-Qaida, even though the \nGeneva Conventions only apply to the former, the Taliban.\n  Now, let me cut to the chase. The President's February 7, 2002, \nmemorandum makes one thing crystal clear: Regardless of where and when \nthe Geneva Conventions apply--regardless of whether the Taliban or al-\nQaida are\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\nPOWs--the President says unequivocally that detainees are to be treated \nhumanely.\n  This is a crucial point that has often gotten lost in some of the \ninflamed rhetoric being employed by the opponents of Judge Gonzales and \nthe President. And let us be clear that a considerable amount of the \ncriticism being lodged against Judge Gonzales is merely an attempt to \ncause political damage to the President himself.\n  That the purpose of the February 7 memo is to ensure that all \ndetainees are treated humanely is evident by the fact that this concept \nis repeated four times in that memorandum.\n  First, you should know that this is clear from the title of the memo: \n``Humane Treatment of al Qaeda and Taliban Detainees.''\n  The President makes his policy directive explicit in paragraph No. 3 \nof the memo:\n\n       Of course, our values as a Nation, values that we share \n     with many nations in the world, call for us to treat \n     detainees humanely, including those who are not legally \n     entitled to such treatment.\n\n  He repeats the command again in the last sentence of paragraph 3:\n\n       As a matter of policy, the United States Armed Forces shall \n     continue to treat detainees humanely.\n\n  The President repeats the command a fourth time in paragraph 5:\n\n       I hereby reaffirm the order previously issued by the \n     Secretary of Defense to the United States Armed Forces \n     requiring that the detainees be treated humanely.\n\n  One last point on this. In addition to saying again and again that \ndetainees must be treated humanely, the President's February 7, 2002, \nmemorandum also mandates that the U.S. Armed Forces treat detainees in \na manner consistent with the principles of Geneva to the extent \nappropriate and consistent with military necessity.\n  Now, while lawyers can hem and haw about what this precisely means, \ngiven the context of the quotation in the paragraph immediately \nfollowing the POW analysis, it is logical to conclude that it means \nthat the U.S. military shall accord POW treatment to al-Qaida and \nTaliban detainees unless military necessity dictates otherwise.\n  Let me also make one other thing clear. What happened to some \ndetainees at Abu Ghraib was not humane treatment. We all know that. The \nArmy knows that. Our military knows that. I think all of us here can \nagree with that. It is also clear to me that the abuses that occurred \nat Abu Ghraib were contrary to the President's February 7, 2002, \nmemorandum to treat them humanely. Those who committed these abhorrent \nabuses can and should be vigorously prosecuted and punished, and they \nare. Right off the bat, the investigation took place. And right off the \nbat, they are bringing people to justice. There is no doubt about that.\n  I might add, the President is not given any credit for the \nprosecutions of Abu Ghraib. The desire of some who always want to score \npolitical points leads them to blame all wrongdoings on the President, \neven in a case like this where he had nothing to do with these actions. \nJudge Gonzales has made it clear that he does not defend the abuses \nthat occurred.\n  I am sure there are many people out there who are wondering what any \nof this has to do with the nomination of Judge Gonzales. Well, I have \nto undertake this legal analysis because some people have unfairly \nattacked Judge Gonzales for a draft memorandum with his name on it. The \nmemo was dated 2 weeks before the President's order on February 7, \n2002, and it suggests that the Geneva Conventions should not apply to \nthe Taliban.\n  Several allegations against Judge Gonzales have been raised in the \nmedia and elsewhere, and I want to set the record straight.\n  It appears from recent media accounts that this draft was not even \nwritten by Judge Gonzales. As is common in many Government offices, \ndrafts are often initially written by lower level individuals and then \nedited and approved by the intended high-level author.\n  We also know this was an early draft because other documents from the \nState Department indicate that Secretary Colin Powell and legal adviser \nWilliam H. Taft recommended extensive changes to the draft, as they \nshould have. The recommendations include significant changes to the \nstructure of the memorandum, and how the information is presented, as \nwell as correcting statements of fact and specific language.\n  Although we do not know what Judge Gonzales actually advised the \nPresident, and we cannot because it was confidential advice to the \nPresident, we do know the President's February 7, 2002 memorandum is \nconsistent with the views espoused by the State Department at the time.\n  Judge Gonzales has told this committee that this draft:\n\n     does not represent the final advice given to the President.\n\n  It seems odd to me that our colleagues cannot accept his statement on \nthat.\n  He continued:\n\n       Because it does not embody my final views as provided to \n     the President, I have not endorsed, nor do I have any \n     occasion to disavow, the tentative judgments about certain \n     provisions of the Geneva Conventions reflected in that draft.\n\n  Now, some will argue Judge Gonzales ought to tell the Senate \nprecisely what advice he gave the President on this very sensitive \nissue. The fear I have is that if the Senate demands this information \nin this instance and the White House succumbs to that demand, it will \nundermine the candor with which future White House Counsels communicate \nwith future Presidents. I think most people would argue it probably \nwould. That is why these types of conversations are privileged, and not \navailable to the Congress of the United States.\n  And, I might add, even when it is in the interest of the White House, \nin most instances this information remains privileged because the \nexecutive branch reasonably does not wish to set a precedent that will \nlead to Congress asking for access to every conversation that occurs in \nthe White House.\n  In this case, we have some salient facts. The President did not see \nthe January 25, 2002, draft prior to making his February 7, 2002, \ndecision to treat all detainees humanely. And, more important, at the \nend of the day, President Bush issued a policy directive that did not \ngo as far as some of the legal advisers within the administration told \nthem he could go under the law.\n  Now, the draft says some provisions of the Geneva Conventions are \nobsolete and quaint, such as providing athletic uniforms, scientific \ninstruments, advances of salary, and commissary privileges. People have \nquoted this out of context to say that Judge Gonzales thinks all of the \nGeneva Conventions are obsolete and quaint.\n  This is simply nonsense. President Bush and Judge Gonzales know how \nimportant the Geneva Conventions are to American military personnel. We \nall do. As Judge Gonzales told the Judiciary Committee on January 6 of \nthis year:\n\n       Honoring our Geneva obligations provides critical \n     protection for our fighting men and women, and advances norms \n     for the community of nations to follow in times of conflict. \n     Contrary to reports, I consider the Geneva Conventions \n     neither obsolete nor quaint.\n\n  Yet I have seen all kinds of comments suggesting otherwise. I know \nJudge Gonzales. I have worked with Judge Gonzales for 4 solid years. I \nknew him before those 4 years. He is a man of his word. I take him at \nhis word on this important matter. So should my colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  Let me review this one last time because it is an important point. \nJudge Gonzales has told this committee in writing that he does not \nbelieve the Geneva Conventions are obsolete and quaint. He said so \nunder oath in his confirmation hearing, and he said so again in writing \nin response to questions from Senators.\n  There have also been allegations that Judge Gonzales, because he has \nworked closely with President Bush for several years, is somehow \nincapable of having his own opinions and will be unable to give frank \nlegal advice. I recall that similar accusations were made over 40 years \nago with respect to the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy to be Attorney \nGeneral of all things. As many Americans know, Robert Kennedy was \nPresident John F. Kennedy's brother and the brother of our \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts and had previously served as \nthe President's campaign manager prior to his nomination to the office \nof Attorney General. While there was a good deal of controversy whether \nhe, too, could be\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nindependent of his brother as Attorney General before he was confirmed, \nRobert Kennedy went on to become a great Attorney General, one who was \nand still is much admired by many in this country. I believe Judge \nGonzales, too, can and will exercise that same independence.\n  I listened carefully to Judge Gonzales's responses during the \ncommittee's hearing, and I know that he fully understands the \ndifferences between the role of White House Counsel and the role of the \nAttorney General of the United States. As White House Counsel, in Judge \nGonzales's own words:\n\n       I have been privileged to advise the President and his \n     staff.\n\n  As Judge Gonzales further explained:\n\n       As Counsel to the President, my primary focus is on \n     providing counsel to the White House and to the White House \n     staff and the President. I do have a client who has an \n     agenda, and part of my role as Counsel is to provide advice \n     that the President can achieve that agenda lawfully. It is a \n     much different situation as Attorney General, and I know \n     that. My first allegiance is going to be the Constitution and \n     to the laws of the United States.\n\n  Judge Gonzales understands that as Attorney General, when confirmed, \nhe would have, as he describes it, ``a far broader responsibility to \npursue justice for all the people of our great Nation, to see that the \nlaws are enforced in a fair and impartial manner for all Americans.'' \nThis transition is no different than the type many in this body have \nmade over the years. People from this body, attorneys, work for all \nkinds of clients and every manner of clients. And the well-trained \nadvocate is always aware of who his client is. To suggest that Judge \nGonzales is somehow incapable of making this transition is more than \ninsulting. It is despicable to make that suggestion. He is a bright guy \nwith a lot of ability, and a record of which we should all be proud.\n  As someone who served in private practice, as a judge, in political \npositions, and as an advisor to the President, his record is testament \nto his ability to serve his client well no matter who that is. I know \nJudge Gonzales. I know he will make this transition. I guarantee you he \nis no ``yes'' man. He has the character, education, and experience to \nexercise independent judgment in the interest of the American public.\n\n  There have also been some allegations that Judge Gonzales's responses \nto the approximately 500 questions posed to him during the course of \nthis nomination process were somehow incomplete. These allegations have \nbeen made notwithstanding the fact that the New York Times \ncharacterized Judge Gonzales's answers to the committee as ``one of the \nadministration's most expansive statements of its position on a variety \nof issues, particularly regarding laws and policy governing CIA \ninterrogations to terror suspects.''\n  Some Senators have quoted Judge Gonzales's answers out of context. \nThey focus on the few sentences where they say he refused to provide \ncomplete information and ignore all the other sentences in response to \nsome 500 written questions to describe at length all of his knowledge \non the wide variety of issues raised by Senators.\n  Judge Gonzales is not someone who is trying to prevent the committee \nfrom seeing documents. To the contrary, Judge Gonzales was instrumental \nin the White House's release of hundreds of pages of documents \nrevealing the administration's policies relating to the treatment of \ndetainees last June. He helped negotiate among Congress, the Department \nof Defense, the Department of Justice, and the White House to \ndeclassify and publicly release documents relating to the humane \ntreatment of al-Qaida and Taliban detainees, the application of the \nGeneva Conventions, the War Crimes Act, the Convention Against Torture, \nthe Rome statute, as well as the Defense Department documents relating \nto specific techniques authorized and the report of the DOD working \ngroup which assessed the legal policy and operational issues relating \nto detainee interrogations in the global war on terrorism.\n  Frankly, there were good arguments for withholding some of this \ninformation or at least making it available to Congress in a classified \nor nonpublic forum so that the general public and our enemies in \nparticular would not be so well informed about our interrogation \ntechniques. But the administration and Judge Gonzales wanted to provide \nfull disclosure to the public and declassified this information so that \neveryone would know what went on.\n  Just last week, Judge Gonzales submitted over 250 pages of responses \nto written questions after his hearing. That was after questions were \nsupposed to be cut off. We used to do that in this body. We would give \na fair amount of questions, which never amounted to as many as these. \nBut just last week Judge Gonzales submitted over 250 pages of \nresponses--single-spaced pages, by the way--to written questions after \nhis hearing. I believe that Judge Gonzales attempted to answer the \nquestions and be responsive. Although the deadline for submitting \nwritten questions expired on January 13, 2005, four Democratic Senators \nfiled additional questions to Judge Gonzales on January 19, 21, 24, and \n25; I understand even maybe up to the present time. Judge Gonzales \nprovided written answers to all of those questions on or before January \n25, 2005. Yet that is still not enough.\n  Some have tried to make a big deal out of the fact that Judge \nGonzales did not personally conduct a search in response to overbroad \nrequests for notes, memoranda, e-mail, audio recordings, or documents \nof any kind. What my friend from Massachusetts Senator Kennedy fails to \ntell the American public, however, is that the White House informed the \nJudiciary Committee 2 months ago that Judge Gonzales recused himself \nfrom the decisionmaking process of releasing documents because of his \npending nomination. Judge Gonzales repeated his recusal at his \nconfirmation hearing in the first week of January. Obviously, a person \nin Judge Gonzales's shoes may have a short-term incentive to release \ndocuments to the committee when his nomination is pending. However, the \nWhite House may have a very different and legitimate view of such \nrelease as part of the historical relationship between the Executive \nOffice of the President and the Congress in releasing information on, \nfor example, matters pertaining to legal advice to the President and \nthe White House Counsel and policy recommendations on matters of \nnational security from White House components.\n  It makes sense that Judge Gonzales would recuse himself during this \ntime period. I believe it was proper for him to do so. Given Judge \nGonzales's recusal, it is understandable why he personally did not \nconduct a search of White House records. But placing the blame solely \non Judge Gonzales is just not right.\n\n  Senator Kennedy focuses on eight instances where Judge Gonzales did \nnot conduct a search. What do these responses have in common? First of \nall, they are all incredibly overbroad. One request seeks production of \nall notes, memoranda, e-mail, audio recordings, or documents of any \nkind that reflect the occurrence and substance of all meetings in which \nspecific interrogation techniques were discussed. The request is not \nlimited to specific documents, or documents written by Judge Gonzales, \nor received by him. This request wants every e-mail by anybody in the \nFederal Government who participated in a meeting about interrogation \ntechniques during a war. Come on now.\n  Another request seeks all notes, memoranda, e-mail, and documents \nthat reflect the CIA's request for legal advice on how far it could go \nin conducting interrogations, or which interrogation methods it could \nuse and any responsive actions by the White House Counsel's Office and \nthe Department of Justice. Now, you have an overbroad request that \nholds Judge Gonzales responsible not only for things he did not write, \nbut for e-mails written by others in two different agencies that he has \nno direct supervision over. Let's get real here.\n  Let me mention some other points about these requests. In response to \neach one of these, Judge Gonzales, to his credit, never complains that \nthe requests are unfair and overbroad--even though they are. He \nresponds by saying he has no notes, or that he does not know of any \naudio recordings, or that he is not aware of any responsive documents. \nAlso, for each of these requests he explains that the materials, if \nthey did exist, would fall under a privilege. Then he says he did not \nconduct a\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\nsearch. Imagine how futile it would be to look for e-mail or \nhandwritten notes of other people in other agencies about such a broad \ntopic like interrogation techniques that would then be subject to a \nprivilege?\n  I know what this tactic is. Ask for the kitchen sink in the hopes of \ntrapping the nominee with an unartful answer, so it can be claimed that \nhe is not forthcoming. In other words, this is pure, unmitigated \npolitics.\n  It is entirely transparent that the anti-Gonzales vote is pure \npolitics and nothing more.\n  Judge Gonzales is a good man. He has not tried to hide the ball. \nThere may well be legitimate requests for specific documents made by \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee at a later date as we learn more \nabout the abuses at Abu Ghraib. There may also be legitimate questions \nabout when and under what circumstances various executive privileges \napply. I don't know, there may be. But this is just not one of those \noccasions. It is as simple as that.\n  Look, this is not just any nomination. This is a nomination for the \nAttorney General of the United States of America. This is the first \nHispanic ever nominated for that position, or for any of the big four \npositions in the Cabinet of any President. I am chairman of the \nRepublican Senatorial Hispanic Task Force. We work with Hispanic people \nall over America who are every bit as devoted to our country as any \ncitizen who has ever been in this country. I personally love Hispanic \npeople. I can truthfully say I love this man as well because he is a \ngood man. I have seen him give good advice. I have seen him work very \nhard to try to be accurate. I have seen him cooperate with our \ncommittee time after time. I have seen him keep his cool in the face of \nsome of the outrageous requests that were made over the time I was \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I have seen him run the \nWhite House Counsel's Office, and he has done a terrific job. He is a \ngood administrator, a good lawyer. He has tremendous judicial \nexperience.\n  This man, regardless of his background, should be confirmed \nimmediately as Attorney General of the United States of America. \nFrankly, I know my friends in the Hispanic community, and Hispanic \npeople all over America, are watching this debate, and they are sensing \nsomething very unfair going on here. Every Democrat who opposed this \nman on the Judiciary Committee--virtually every one, as far as I can \nrecall--talked about his great and humble background, how he came from \nnowhere and accomplished all he did, and what a good man he is. But \nthey always have some reason to vote against him.\n\n  I suspect there are a lot of politics being played here. We all know \nAlberto Gonzales has constantly been mentioned by the media and \neverybody else as someone who might ultimately wind up on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States of America. Actually, if he never winds up \nthere, being Attorney General is not too bad. It is one of the greatest \npositions in any country anywhere and certainly in our country. And to \nhave this man come from the most humble of circumstances, which \ntypifies the struggle every immigrant family in this country has gone \nthrough, and to not give him this opportunity when he is fully \nqualified for it, I think, would be a travesty. Let me conclude by \ntelling my colleagues and the American public that I know Alberto \nGonzales well. He is a good man. He is a fair man. He understands \npersecution. He understands prejudice. He understands the need to fight \nback to make it in this life, regardless of all of the obstacles in his \nway. I believe when he is confirmed, Judge Gonzales will make an \nexcellent Attorney General. He has been fair to everybody on our \ncommittee time after time.\n  The Senate should not stand in his way of becoming the next Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. I do not believe it will. I do not \nbelieve people should be voting against this good man. If people vote \nagainst him, we have to stop and think, ``Why are they doing that to a \nman of his quality?''\n  When Judge Gonzales accepted the President's nomination for Attorney \nGeneral, he said the following:\n\n       When I talk to people around the country, I sometimes tell \n     them that within the Hispanic community there is a shared \n     hope for an opportunity to succeed. Just give me a chance to \n     prove myself--that is a common prayer for those in my \n     community.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to do exactly that--give Judge Gonzales a chance \nto prove himself. He will not let you down. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for Judge Gonzales to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates, and we will be very wise if we do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I find it ironic that we are debating the \nnomination of this fine nominee for Attorney General and hearing some \nvehement criticism of not just him but of this administration and its \npolicies in Iraq and combating the war on terror, and when on Sunday we \nsaw free Iraqis conduct their first democratic election in many years, \nwith the kind of turnout that, frankly, brings a little embarrassment \nto those of us in America because they had such a tremendous outpouring \nof emotion and support for the opportunity to rise up against their \noppressors, thanks to coalition forces and the sacrifices made by the \nAmerican people and our allies, and be able to do what we do here on a \nregular basis, and that is let the will of the American people be known \nthrough the process of electing our representatives. But here we are, \nand shortly on the heels of the debate on the nomination of Condoleezza \nRice as Secretary of State. Of course, what we are told by those on the \nother side of the aisle is the outcome of this debate is not in doubt. \nEven the opponents of Judge Gonzales, just as the opponents of \nCondoleezza Rice, even as they stand here and claim these are great \nAmerican success stories, which they are, and claim to personally like \nand respect these nominees, at the same time we see them excoriated and \nabused by partisan politics which, unfortunately, I hoped would cease \nor at least be mitigated somewhat by the results of the election on \nNovember 2.\n\n  We saw on November 2 not only the President's reelection by \nsubstantial margins, but we also saw an increase in our side of the \naisle in the Senate and larger numbers in the House. One reason I \nbelieve that happened was because of this debate on the wisdom of our \npolicies of this Government, particularly over the last 4 years. We \nheld a popular referendum on November 2 and, frankly, the politics of \nobstruction and anger were repudiated.\n  What the American people want and expect is that we will get the \nbusiness of the American people done in this body and that we will not \ndegenerate into partisan fingerpointing or name-calling, nor \nobstruction of the kind we have seen occur time and time again against \nthis President's nominees, particularly the judges who have been \nnominated by this President to circuit courts.\n  We know that while our friends on the other side of the aisle did \nhave an opportunity for self-examination and reappraisal on November 2, \napparently they have been unable or unwilling to change their habits \nand their destructive approach to this process. Unfortunately, it \ncauses good men and women, such as Al Gonzales and Condoleezza Rice, to \nhave to go through a process that, frankly, does not dishonor them but \nI think fails to bring honor to this institution and to those who \noppose their nominations.\n  There is no question that we have an obligation in the Senate to \nseriously conduct our advice and consent function, and certainly no one \nis suggesting that any Senator should not vote their conscience. That \nis not what we are talking about. What we are talking about is when we \ncross the line that should not be crossed between doing our duty, sent \nhere as we were by the people of our various States, and engaging in \npartisan politics on the floor, particularly on nominations, it is \nunfortunate.\n  I want to speak now not about this caricature that has been created \nby those who oppose this nomination, not the person I really see \ndescribed by his opponents that I do not recognize, but I want to talk \nabout the real Al Gonzales.\n  I am pleased Judge Alberto Gonzales happens to be a friend. He is a \ntalented lawyer and a distinguished public servant and a good man. He \nalso happens to be a good Texan and an inspiring American success \nstory. I am proud to call him my friend.\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\n  I have known Alberto Gonzales for a number of years, unlike most of \nthe people who are in this body, and that just is because I worked with \nhim and alongside him and had a chance to observe him day in and day \nout, as he first functioned as the President's then-general counsel \nwhen he was Governor of the State of Texas, when he then served in the \noffice of secretary of state for the State of Texas, and then was \nappointed and then elected to serve on the Texas Supreme Court, which \nhe did for a couple of years before the President of the United States \nasked him to leave his home behind and come to Washington to work with \nhim in the challenges of the Oval Office, to serve as his legal adviser \nand White House Counsel.\n\n  Little did this President know and little did Alberto Gonzales know \nthat September 11 would forever change the course not only of American \nhistory but their lives in such a dramatic and profound way.\n  The context I think the opponents of this nomination fail to take \ninto account is how much America and our way of life was threatened by \nthose who had no regard for human life, who had no regard for the law \nof war, but rather than attack our military in a battlefield chose to \nattack innocent civilians, resulting in the massive loss of human life \nin Washington, Pennsylvania, and in New York and resulting in almost a \ntrillion dollars' worth of economic loss to the American economy.\n  Not only is this an extraordinary nominee and a good man, but I \nsuggest to my colleagues that this President and his advisers, \nincluding his legal adviser, Alberto Gonzales, were met with challenges \nthey never could have imagined they would have to undertake. It is \nimportant to have that context as we judge the work he did.\n  As I say, I have known Alberto Gonzales for many years, and I can \ntell you the media is absolutely right when they call him the man from \nHumble. For those who are not from Texas, that refers to Humble, TX, \nwhere he was raised, but also the fact that he is a modest, self-\neffacing man. He is the son of migrant workers. His childhood home, \nwhere his mother still lives today, was built by his father and his \nuncle.\n  As a child, he earned a little bit of money selling soft drinks at \nRice University stadium and there, as he looked over the football games \nbeing played in that stadium, he dreamed of one day possibly going to \nschool at Rice University.\n  Alberto Gonzales was the first person in his family to attend \ncollege. Because of the love and support of his family, his hard work \nand determination, he graduated from Rice University. In other words, \nhis dream came true. Then he went on to graduate from Harvard Law \nSchool, two of the most prestigious institutions in this country.\n  Was it because he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth or was a \nchild of privilege or knew powerful people? I suggest the answer to \nthat is absolutely not. The reason Alberto Gonzales was successful in \nachieving his educational dreams is because of the love and support of \nhis family and because of the hard work that in America ought to be \nrewarded and not discouraged.\n  Indeed, this is a man who not only, after he went to college, went on \nto work in one of the most prestigious law firms in the United States \nof America, but was one of its first minority partners. Yes, it was \nthis young lawyer, after about 10 years of practice, who was first \nidentified by an aspiring Governor of the State of Texas, George W. \nBush.\n  It cannot be lost in this debate, as it goes on today, tomorrow, and \nThursday, that Judge Alberto Gonzales is truly an inspiration to all of \nus who still believe in the American dream.\n  His nomination to be the 80th Attorney General of the United States \nof America, the chief law enforcement officer of this great country and \nour first Hispanic Attorney General, that story should by all accounts \nhave a happy ending. But unfortunately that is not the way Washington \nworks. Once again, we will see that this confirmation process is \nunnecessarily partisan, even cruel to those who have selflessly \ndedicated themselves to serving the American people. Only in Washington \nwould a good man such as Alberto Gonzales, the personification of the \nAmerican dream, someone who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps by \ndint of hard work and determination and the love and support of his \nfamily--only in Washington would we see that a man such as this would \nget raked over the coals for doing his job.\n  This must be a little disorienting to Judge Gonzales and his family, \nbecause, frankly, he comes from that part of America that believes \nAmerica should always be a place where honesty, determination, and \ndiligence are rewarded.\n  I want to talk a little bit about some of the specifics of the \naccusations made against Judge Gonzales, because I don't think we can \ntake for granted that this is particularly well understood. They have \nto do with arcane matters, albeit important matters such as the Geneva \nConvention and the law of war, with the limits on interrogation \ntechniques that can be humanely employed by the United States as a \nmatter of policy, but first, I wish to point out that not only does a \nmajority of the Senate stand ready to vote and confirm this \nparticularly well-qualified and distinguished nominee, there are a \nnumber of groups around the country which support his nomination. I \nheard--and this happens to be a pet peeve of mine--that someone said \nthe Hispanic Caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives opposes \nAlberto Gonzales's nomination.\n  What that person did not say is that the Hispanic Caucus in the House \nof Representatives is composed only of Democrats. Indeed, there are \nHispanics, both in the House and in the Senate, who support Judge \nGonzales's nomination, as well as groups from all around the country \nthat believe this nomination should not hit a glass ceiling but, \nrather, be an example for all Hispanics who look for reward for their \nhard work and labor in American society and which see this as an \nopportunity to elevate one of their own as a role model to young boys \nand girls as they go to school and work hard and try to achieve their \nAmerican dream. The National Council of La Raza, the Hispanic Alliance \nfor Progress Institute, the Texas Association of Mexican American \nChamber of Commerce, the New America Alliance, the American-Latino \nBusiness Initiative, the National Association of Latino Elected and \nAppointed Officials, the Congressional Hispanic Conference, the League \nof United Latin American Citizens, the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation, the Latino Coalition, the National Association of Latino \nLeaders, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic \nAssociation of Colleges and Universities, MANA, a National Latino \nAssociation, the National Association of Hispanic Publishers, the \nHispanic Roundtable, and the National Association of Hispanic \nFirefighters endorse Alberto Gonzales's nomination to serve as this \nNation's 80th Attorney General.\n  I don't want those listening by reference to a solely Democratic \ncaucus in the House of Representatives, by hearing they do not support \nhis nomination to be under the misapprehension that Latinos in this \ncountry do not overwhelmingly support this nominee, because they do.\n\n  I would point out finally, with regard to the Hispanic Caucus in the \nHouse, the solely Democratic-member caucus, they didn't support Miguel \nEstrada's nomination to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, \neither. Frankly, it is beginning to be an unseemly trend.\n  Let me talk a minute about the Geneva Convention because this is, as \nmany legal matters are, somewhat confusing. Frankly, we get down so far \ninto the weeds on this that people's eyes glaze over and roll back into \ntheir heads and they quit receiving any additional information. But the \nbottom line is this: Judge Gonzales advised the President that all \ndetainees in the war on terror--whether they be al-Qaida fighters, \nwhether they be Taliban, whether they be the Iraqi military when we \nwent into Iraq; all--as a matter of policy of this Government, be \ntreated humanely. In other words, Alberto Gonzales, this President, \nthis Government, and all of its officials have said we oppose torture \nin any form as a means to get intelligence from detainees, whether they \nbe classified as unlawful combatants or are covered by the Geneva \nConvention.\n  Indeed, that is what Alberto Gonzales said in a memo he wrote to the \nPresident dated February 7, 2002, and which\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nthe President adopted. It is the policy of this Government to treat \ndetainees--no matter how they be classified--humanely, and that we \ncondemn the use of torture as a matter of national policy.\n  You would never know it by some of the statements, some of the \nmisstatements and some of the disinformation that has been spread about \nthis nominee. Unfortunately, it has been harmful to our effort in the \nwar on terror. This should come as fairly straightforward information, \nbut let me just emphasize it. I asked this question repeatedly during \nthe course of the hearings we had with Judge Gonzales. I said: Does \nanybody here take the position that America should not use all lawful \nmeans to obtain actionable intelligence that would save American lives? \nDoes anyone take the position that we should not use all lawful means \nto obtain actionable intelligence that would save human lives?\n  Thankfully, notwithstanding some of the rhetoric we have heard and \nmaybe some of the confusion we have heard propagated during this \ndebate, everyone said: No, we agree with that. You should use all \nlawful means to get actionable intelligence to save American lives.\n  What I was thinking back to was a hearing we had before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee on May 14, 2004. I asked that question of two \nof our Nation's most distinguished military leaders, MG Geoffrey \nMiller, who was in charge of the detention facilities there at \nGuantanamo, where many of the al-Qaida fighters are kept who have been \nthe subject of news reports and some discussion and litigation. I also \nasked GEN John Abizaid, who is the commander of the U.S. central \ncommand, including Iraq. I will just read what General Abizaid said:\n  I will start with a question.\n  I said: ``In your opinion, General Miller, is the military \nintelligence you have been able to gain from those who have recruited, \nfinanced and carried out terrorist activities against the United States \nor our military, has that intelligence as a consequence that you gained \nsaved American lives?''\n  General Miller said: ``Senator, absolutely.''\n  So I asked General Abizaid, who was also there on the same panel, I \nsaid: ``Would you confirm for us, General Abizaid, that it is also true \nwithin the Central Command''--which includes Iraq, Afghanistan, and I \nthink it covers 26 countries. I may be off one or two.\n  But General Abizaid, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said: \n``Senator, I agree that is true. And I'd also like to add that some of \nthese people we are dealing with are some of the most despicable \ncharacters you could ever imagine. They spend every waking moment \ntrying to figure out how to deliver a weapon of mass destruction into \nthe middle of our country, and we should not kid ourselves about what \nthey are capable of doing to us and we have to deal with them.''\n  I said: ``General Abizaid, if we needed any other reminder than that \nof the death of Nicholas Berg, I believe that reminds us again in a \ngraphic fashion.''\n  You will recall that it was Nicholas Berg who was captured by \nterrorists, who then was beheaded on camera, and that film was shown to \nthe entire world.\n  Our enemy does not play by the rules. They are not constrained by the \nlaw of war or the Geneva Convention. They believe it is perfectly \nacceptable to kill innocent civilians by suicide bombing attacks, as we \nhave seen. And they believe it is perfectly acceptable to behead \nunarmed hostages as a means to carry out their reign of terror.\n  On the matter of the Geneva Convention, it is clear that it is \nimportant for us to get actionable intelligence using humane and \nlegally acceptable means. Any suggestion that Judge Gonzales believes \ninhumane or illegal means are acceptable is simply not supported by any \nfacts.\n  Frankly, on the matter of the applicability of the Geneva Convention, \nJudge Gonzales is right. You don't have to take my word for it.\n  First, I heard the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, former chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, point out that al-Qaida never signed the \nGeneva Convention. But people may say, Well, that is a technical matter \nbut it is part of it.\n  I will tell you that the Red Cross's own guidelines, which I hold \nhere in my hand, have four requirements, four conditions of lawful \ncombat, none of which al-Qaida meets.\n  Here again I ask: Does anyone in this body or anywhere across the \ncountry seriously argue that al-Qaida complies with the law of war? \nJudge Gonzales is not binding himself in his legal conclusion about the \napplicability of the Geneva Convention. Even though you say it might \nnot meet the letter of the rules set out in this book I held up, the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross Guidelines on the Geneva \nConvention, I would suggest this is important. Three Federal courts \nhave concluded that Judge Gonzales's legal advice was correct. It has \nalso been endorsed by numerous legal scholars and international legal \nexperts across the political spectrum, as well as the 9/11 Commission, \nas well as a report given by the Schlesinger Commission, which was one \nof the commissions appointed to review the detention operations both at \nGuantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib.\n\n  Finally, in addition to those decisions by the Federal court, the 9/\n11 Commission, and the Schlesinger report, I would say a brief filed in \na recent Supreme Court case by former Carter administration officials, \nformer State Department legal advisers, judge advocates general, \nmilitary commanders, and liberal international law scholars, has agreed \nwith Judge Gonzales's conclusion about the applicability of the Geneva \nConvention to al-Qaida.\n  As a matter of fact, these legal scholars said the President's \nconclusions that members of al-Qaida and the Taliban are unlawful \ncombatants is clearly correct.\n  I would say to those who have been loose with the law and facts with \nregard to the Geneva Convention, they need to doublecheck their \ninformation, because time and time and time again Judge Gonzales's \nlegal advice to the President has been shown to be correct.\n  But I must say again, this is not the same as saying we are going to \ntreat these detainees in an inhumane fashion or that we are going to \nengage in torture. We are not. But some have inflated those two, saying \nif the Geneva Convention doesn't apply, what you are saying is there \nare no rules and anything goes, which is absolutely false. That is not \nwhat I am saying. That is not what Judge Gonzales said, that is not \nwhat the President says, and that is not the policy of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  One last thing on the Geneva Convention. My father's generation, \nwhich was part of the ``greatest generation'' that fought in World War \nII--there are a lot of television shows and movies that depict how POWs \nare maintained. One of them I remember watching when I was a kid was \ncalled ``Hogan's Heroes.'' You know what the Geneva Convention is \ndesigned to do--to protect American soldiers by providing reciprocal \ntreatment by nations that we are at war with so our soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and airmen will be kept in a humane and appropriate fashion. \nBut, of course, that presupposes the Geneva Convention applies, and \nthat your enemy respects the law of war and shows some sort of self-\nrestraint, something al-Qaida and the Taliban have not shown at all.\n  But does anybody believe that we ought not to be able to entice \ndetainees to respond by offering creature comforts or other \npreferential treatment?\n  For example, when I went to Guantanamo and observed detention of al-\nQaida terrorists there, it was explained to me by General Miller that \nthey would sometimes use a little better food, maybe a change of the \ndiet, perhaps allow people to cook on a grill outside and sort of \nencourage them to cooperate by more appetizing food, or maybe even move \nthem from an individual cell into a community cell block where they \ncould associate with one other and have a little greater freedom of \nmovement. Those were some of the techniques being used there which \nwould not be available if the Geneva Convention applied.\n  Surely those who oppose this nomination cannot believe that al-Qaida \nterrorists deserve to be treated better than an American citizen \naccused of a crime, which is in essence what they are saying.\n  I know I have dwelled upon this subject for a while, but let me \nconclude on\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nthis because, frankly, you hear the same old, tired, worn-out arguments \nbeing brought up time and time again without regard to the facts as I \nhave explained them or the law as I have explained it.\n\n  There was a time actually when President Reagan was in office where \nthere was a proposed amendment to the Geneva Convention, known as \nProtocol I of 1977, that would have actually extended the Geneva \nConvention to terrorists. President Reagan said: ``We must not, and \nneed not, give recognition and protection to terrorist groups as a \nprice for progress in humanitarian law.'' We did not adopt that \namendment but, indeed, we rejected it.\n  Notably at the time, even the New York Times and the Washington Post \nagreed. The Times called the President's position ``sound'' while the \nPost said it was right and even accused opponents of that of hijacking \nthe Geneva Convention.\n  But, my, how far we have come to this hyperpoliticized environment \nwhere the facts and the law seem to take a backseat, and continuation \nof some of the political campaign tactics that we saw before November 2 \nhave now carried over after the election not directed only at the \nPresident but now directed at his nominees.\n  All this support from multiple Federal courts, the 9/11 Commission, \nthe Schlesinger report, liberal international legal scholars, Carter \nadministration officials, even the New York Times and the Washington \nPost, and yet Judge Gonzales is being criticized by opponents of his \nnomination for taking the exact same position with regard to the \napplicability of the Geneva Convention.\n  All I can say is, it is only in Washington.\n  Let me touch on one other legal issue that gets down into the weeds. \nJudge Gonzales has been criticized for trying to understand what \nCongress meant when it passed the law prohibiting the use of torture, \nthe so-called torture statute. The memo he is being criticized for he \ndid not write, and the language defining what was torture and what was \nnot torture that he is being criticized for, he did not write that \nstatute either. Congress wrote that statute.\n  If Judge Gonzales, the officials at the Department of Defense, if the \nU.S. Government, including this administration, had so little regard \nfor the law and basic human norms like humane treatment of detainees, \nwhy in the world would they go through all of this trouble to try to \nfigure out what exactly did Congress intend and what are the limits? \nThe reason is not to find a limit so you can find a way around the \nstatute, it is to find how do you comply with the law because \nGovernment officials know if you violate the law, you, too, are \naccountable in a court of law.\n  Frankly, today--maybe it is a sign of the times--even military \ncommanders, the Secretary of Defense, and other high Government \nofficials do not make a move without consulting their lawyer because of \ntheir concern, No. 1, about complying with the law; and, No. 2, the \nconsequences of failing to comply with the law.\n  It is simply unfair to attack Judge Gonzales again for a memo he did \nnot write and a statute that defines torture that he did not write \neither, that Congress did. So I suggest some of the opponents of this \noutstanding nominee, if they do not like what the torture statute says, \nif they do not like the effort to try to understand and explain it, \nmaybe they ought to look in the mirror and maybe we ought to go back to \nwork and be more clear about what we mean when we say torture is \nillegal and what the limits are of that.\n  Again, everyone agrees--or at least I have not heard anyone object \nyet--to the goal of using all lawful means to obtain actionable \nintelligence to save American lives. And how can you determine what \nthose lawful means are unless you examine the treaties and the statutes \nand other laws that deal with what the permissible limits of \ninterrogation techniques are and use that as a bright line to determine \nwhat is legal, permissible, what is humane and what is not.\n  Let me mention, some have again tried to confuse the issue by taking \nthe criminal conduct of a few at Abu Ghraib prison and suggesting that \nsomehow this reflects the policy of this administration and of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Not only is that suggestion an insult to all law-abiding Americans, \nand particularly those men and women in uniform who are serving \nhonorably and who made the celebrations following the election in Iraq \non Sunday possible, but to try to paint with such a broad brush and to \nsay this is a matter of policy or practice and nobody cares what the \nlaw is and, you know what, we are going to take a few bad actors and \npeople who cross the line between legality and illegality and we will \nbasically suggest everybody is in the same big pot. That pot is people \nwho have committed criminal acts against detainees and prisoners at Abu \nGhraib.\n  It is safe to say that everyone agrees Abu Ghraib was a shameful \nepisode in our Nation's history. Yet again some want to actually \nexploit that tragedy, that shameful episode by a few, for political \npoints. Abu Ghraib is a serious matter. It should be treated seriously. \nIndeed, it has been.\n\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee has held hearing after hearing \nafter hearing to try to get to the bottom of what happened. The U.S. \nDepartment of Defense has conducted at least eight different \ninvestigations to try to figure out what went wrong and how to make \nsure it does not happen again, but to also hold those who cross the \nline into criminal conduct accountable. Indeed, we have seen that \nhappen.\n  Abu Ghraib should be treated seriously and not politically. Even the \nSchlesinger report--and I know there have been suggestions that somehow \nthe acts of a few miscreants at Abu Ghraib reflect broad, widespread \ndisregard for basic human rights of these detainees, or maybe somehow \nreflects the use of permissible interrogation techniques approved by \nthe Department of Justice--here again the Schlesinger report, composed \nof a bipartisan commission to investigate what happened at Abu Ghraib, \nconcluded:\n\n       No approved procedures called for or allowed the kinds of \n     abuses that, in fact, occurred. There is no evidence of a \n     policy of abuse promulgated by senior officials or military \n     authorities.\n\n  If there is no evidence of a policy of abuse promulgated by senior \nofficials or military authorities, and if there is no evidence whatever \nthat Judge Gonzales was in any way responsible for this, why are we \ntalking about Abu Ghraib during Judge Gonzales's confirmation? Again, I \nsuggest this is not about Alberto Gonzales and his fitness to serve. \nThis, unfortunately, has crossed the line into partisan politics, a \nplace we should not go.\n  I am proud of my friend, Judge Alberto Gonzales. He is a source of \ngreat inspiration and pride to his family, his friends, and to the \ngreat State of Texas from where we both come. Time and time again, \nJudge Gonzales has done his duty in the war on terrorism. It \ndisheartens me to see him held up to ridicule, distortions, and \noutright lies for being the patriot that he is.\n  I also will speak, because I know others will address this--I have \nnot been able to listen to all of the debate, but I have quite a bit of \nit. I know this matter came up in the committee and it is important to \nset the record straight. Judge Gonzales appeared before the committee \nand answered question after question by the members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. Of course, that was broadcast on C-SPAN for people \nall across the world to see. My own impression was that Judge Gonzales \ndid his very best to answer the questions that were asked of him.\n  Some members of the committee purported to be dissatisfied with the \nopportunity they were given to ask questions, and they had additional \nquestions to ask. I hold in my hand more than 400 questions--and these \nare on single-spaced pages--more than 400 questions asked of Judge \nGonzales after the hearing, and they generated 440 responses \nencompassing 221 single-spaced pages. After the New York Times argued \nthat Judge Gonzales was very forthcoming in his responses to the \ncommittee, there was another request made, and at that time an \nadditional 54 written responses were provided on 27 single-spaced \npages. There were requests for copies of documents, some of which I \nhave in my hand. I do not claim these are all of them, but I do believe \nit is a representative sample of what Judge Gonzales was actually \nprovided. I will get to who provided it in a minute.\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\n  I think all fairminded people would conclude not only did Judge \nGonzales attempt, to the best of his ability, to answer questions asked \nhim of the committee when we were in open session, but at least on two \noccasions answered other questions. On one occasion he gave 440 answers \nin a 227-page, single-spaced response, again provided additional \nwritten responses in 27 additional pages, and he also provided more \nthan 200 documents to go along with his answers.\n  So I think any fairminded person would have to conclude Judge \nGonzales has tried his best to be responsive. I do think it is \nimportant to point out, as I believe Senator Hatch did earlier, that \nactually Judge Gonzales recused himself from providing these responses \nor answering the questions. In other words, he felt it was improper for \nhim to have a personal hand in crafting the responses to the document \nrequests or necessarily questions directed to the White House or to \nsome other party.\n  So many of the responses, particularly to document requests, came \nfrom the White House Counsel's Office provided by, I believe it was Mr. \nLeitch, that Judge Gonzales had actually no hand in. But that was in an \neffort on his part to try to be fair and evenhanded and to basically \ntake himself out of any controversy and leave it up to the committee, \nthose requesting the documents, and the White House. I believe that was \nappropriate.\n  So time and time again, we have seen that the real Al Gonzales is not \nthe caricature that has been painted by his opponents during this \nconfirmation process. Time and time again, we have seen that not only \ndo the American people view Alberto Gonzales as a personification of \nthe American dream, he is a source of pride and admiration for Hispanic \norganizations and Hispanics all across this great land of ours, as he \nwell should be.\n  Notwithstanding what we have heard from opponents of this nomination, \nand of this administration, Judge Alberto Gonzales has condemned the \nuse of torture on detainees, prisoners of war, anyone in American \ncustody. Indeed, he has insisted, as a matter of American policy and \nlaw, on humane treatment. But he also believes, as the true patriot he \nis, that it is important we not lose the overall context of where this \nis happening and how this is happening.\n  Alberto Gonzales believes, as I believe everyone--at least no one \nobjected here on this side of the ocean--who supports freedom and \ndemocracy for the Iraqi people believes, it is important we continue to \nuse all lawful means to obtain actionable intelligence to save American \nlives and to help ensure our success against the insurgents who still \nplague Iraq.\n  I believe that on fair analysis by those who would listen to the \nfacts and the arguments on both sides of this particular debate, there \nis only one reasonable, nonpolitical conclusion, and that is, this \nnominee should be confirmed, and should be confirmed overwhelmingly by \nthe Senate.\n  After we saw the opposition to Condoleezza Rice's nomination, I was \ngratified to see that at least she received the vote of 85 Members of \nthe Senate in a bipartisan fashion. But I was troubled when, even \nthough several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said they \nwould likely be voting in favor of Alberto Gonzales's nomination, they \nhave now changed their tune. We saw a strict party-line vote in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee: all Republicans supporting his nomination, \nall Democrats opposing it.\n\n  So, unfortunately, I was left with the conclusion that we have seen \nnow again a continuation of the bitter politics of this confirmation \nprocess which not only I think fails to bring honor to this institution \nbut which I think does a real disservice to the honorable men and women \nwho agree to serve in important positions such as Secretary of State \nand Attorney General.\n  But I also say it does not bode well for the hoped-for beginning of a \nnew Congress on the President's judicial nominees. We know the \nPresident intends to send up 10 nominees who were previously \nfilibustered by the other side. I would have thought that after the \nelection they would have reconsidered that course. But here again, I \nthink we have seen an unfortunate continuation of the tactics and the \nbad habits that perhaps our opponents in this debate have lapsed into. \nAnd perhaps they know no other way to proceed, other than through \nobstruction and through mischaracterization of this nominee's fine \nrecord. We should confirm Alberto Gonzales as the 80th Attorney General \nof the United States, and do so overwhelmingly.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Under the previous order, the \nChair now recognizes the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I talked to the floor manager and \nindicated I was going to ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson, be recognized and permitted to speak for 15 \nminutes after I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, is there a 15-minute time limit on how \nlong Senator Nelson will speak?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That was the time he requested, and that is the time I \nask unanimous consent for.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Sounds good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as others have said, this is an extremely important \nnomination. I think all of us in this body take our responsibilities \nseriously. Those of us who have expressed some concern and reservation, \neven opposition, to this nominee are filled with admiration about his \nown personal story. I have said at other times, I wish I could vote for \nthe story, not the individual, because the story, as has been pointed \nout, is the story of the American dream.\n  But there are decisions that were made when this nominee had \nimportant responsibilities that I think are in conflict with American \nvalues. The primary issue I am concerned about and that I find should \nbe of concern to the American people is his attitude when he was the \nPresident's Counsel on the development of a policy of torture, which \nhas been recognized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, by the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, by the Defense Intelligence Agency, by the \nRed Cross.\n\n  There is no question that he was at the epicenter in terms of the \ndevelopment of that policy. I think that is what is at issue; at least \nit is for me. And I think it is important that our colleagues have an \nopportunity to listen to the record.\n  I listened to my friend and colleague from Texas speak on his behalf, \nand I certainly respect his presentation. But I think the facts speak \notherwise on a number of important points.\n  Earlier the chairman of the committee, Senator Specter, said in \nreference to the correspondence from the Department of Justice that he \nwas not satisfied with the Justice response to Senator Durbin's and my \nrequest for the memos relating to a New York Times story, again related \nto torture. And I am certainly not, either.\n  What the Justice Department said was that they brief the Intelligence \nCommittee on these memos and the materials then are classified. That \ndoes not help the rest of us. We still need to know whether the Times \nstory was accurate. We are all cleared, obviously, as Members of the \nSenate to classified information. We need the information to decide on \nthe Gonzales nomination, and we should have it before the vote.\n  In the final paragraph of the note from the Justice Department, it \nsays:\n\n       Finally, the Office of Legal Counsel in its recent \n     memorandum of December 30 stated we have received this \n     office's prior opinions addressing issues involving \n     interrogation of detainees and do not believe that any of \n     their conclusions would be different under the standards set \n     forth in the memorandum.\n\n  So the Justice Department piles secrecy upon secrecy.\n  Then in a letter received today, they refused to provide the second \nBybee memo.\n  Justice says basically what the administration has said: Don't worry, \nit is taken care of. You in the Senate don't have to worry very much \nabout it.\n  I find that troublesome.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield briefly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think the Senator misunderstood me. I did not say that \nI was dissatisfied with what the Department of Justice had submitted. \nWhat I\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\ndid was to ask them to respond to the letter which I received this \nmorning from you and Senator Durbin, and they responded with a letter \nwhich I have put in the Record where they have said that the second \nmemo was not a memo that went to Judge Gonzales, but it was a memo that \nwent from the Department of Justice to another client who had inquired \nas to what were the parameters of appropriate questioning. And the \nDepartment of Justice said that it had classified information and they \nwould not release it and that it had been identified in previous \ncorrespondence with Senator Leahy and that it had been the subject of a \nbriefing of a chairman of a relevant committee on the customer client.\n  I think all of this may boil down to a request by the CIA--I am \nspeculating now; I want that clear for the record because that is not \nwhat the letter said--in that there was later a briefing to the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee. So the matter did not go to \nJudge Gonzales, and that is a reason for not making the disclosure \nbecause he did not actually receive it. But I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for letting me comment. But I had not said that I was \ndissatisfied with what the Department of Justice had done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is all about the issue of torture. \nWe are talking about torture and the role that Mr. Gonzales played in \nthe development of the dramatic change in American policy that overrode \nstatutes that had been passed in the Senate and treaties which the \nSenate had signed. It is about torture. He is the legal counsel for the \nPresident. I will get back into the history of his role in this. But to \ndismiss a relevant document that is about torture, that is related to \nthe subject matter of Mr. Gonzales, and think that we don't have an \nopportunity or right to review that, I find troublesome. I don't know \nwhat the administration is attempting to hide. I will come back to that \nlater in my presentation about the failing of the responsiveness of Mr. \nGonzales on these issues. It seems to me that any fair reading of this \nmemoranda, of the questions that Senator Durbin and I asked, and \nreading of the Department of Justice memorandum would find them \ncompletely unresponsive. If that is not what the chairman of the \ncommittee says, I say it. I will move on.\n  This is one of the most important votes the Senate will take this \nyear. The issues raised by Mr. Gonzales's nomination go to the heart of \nwhat America stands for in the world and the fundamental values that \ndefine us as a nation: our commitment to individual dignity, our \nrespect for the rule of law, and our reputation around the world as a \nbeacon for human rights, not as a violator of human rights.\n  President Bush said it well in his inaugural address last month:\n\n       From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every \n     man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and \n     matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of \n     Heaven and Earth.\n       The world is watching to see if our actions match our \n     rhetoric.\n\n  How can the Senate possibly approve the nomination of Mr. Gonzales as \nAttorney General of the United States, the official who symbolizes our \nrespect for the rule of law, when Mr. Gonzales is the official in the \nBush administration who, as the White House Counsel, advised the \nPresident that torture was an acceptable method of interrogation in \nAfghanistan, Guantanamo, and Iraq? Torture is contrary to all that we \nstand for as Americans. It violates our basic values. It is alien to \nour military's longstanding rules and tradition. We send our men and \nwomen in the armed services into battle to stop torture in other \ncountries, not to participate in it themselves.\n  These values did not change or become less relevant after 9/11. \nAmericans did not resolve to set aside our values or the Constitution \nafter those vicious attacks. We didn't decide as a nation to stoop to \nthe level of the terrorists. To the contrary, Americans have been \nunited in their belief that an essential part of winning the war on \nterrorism and protecting the country for the future is safeguarding the \nideals and the values that America stands for at home and around the \nworld.\n  Americans agree that torture is and should remain beyond the pale. A \nrecent pole in USA Today showed that Americans strongly disapprove of \nthe interrogation tactics that have been used in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nGuantanamo, including the use of painful stress positions, sexual \nhumiliation, threatening prisoners with dogs, threatening to ship them \nto countries known to practice torture. The American public has held \nfast to our most basic fundamental values. How could our Government \nhave gone so wrong?\n  Mr. Gonzales is at the center of a torture policy that has run \nroughshod over the values that Americans hold so dear. On issue after \nissue in developing this policy he has endorsed expediency over the \nrule of law. He adopted an absurdly narrow definition of torture in \norder to permit extreme interrogation practices. He advocated an \nunjustifiably expansive view of Presidential power, purporting to put \nthe executive branch above the law. He ignored plain language of the \nGeneva Conventions in an attempt to immunize those who may commit war \ncrimes. He continues to push a discredited interpretation of our treaty \nobligations to permit the CIA to commit cruel, inhuman, and degrading \nacts outside of the United States. He refuses to be candid about his \ninterpretations, policies, and intentions.\n  The administration's policy on torture was established in August of \n2002 in a Justice Department document called the Bybee or, more \naccurately, the Bybee-Gonzales memorandum. The memorandum was written \nat Mr. Gonzales's request. It reads: ``Memorandum for Alberto R. \nGonzales, Counsel to the President.''\n  The first two sentences read:\n\n       You have asked for our Office's views regarding the \n     standards of conduct under the Convention Against Torture and \n     the Anti-Torture Statute passed by Congress in 1994. As we \n     understand it, this question has arisen in the context of the \n     conduct of interrogations outside the United States.\n\n  After its release in August 2002, the memoranda became the official \npolicy on interrogations by the Defense Department and the CIA for 2\\1/\n2\\ years, until it was repudiated just last month at the last minute on \nthe eve of Mr. Gonzales's nomination.\n  Yet, Mr. Gonzales refused to tell us anything about how the Bybee-\nGonzales memorandum was written and why he ordered it. We know from \npress reports that the C.I.A. asked him for advice on how far the \nagency could go in interrogating detainees. In July 2002, he held \nmeetings with other administration officials to discuss how to legally \njustify certain interrogation methods. He refuses to tell us anything \nabout those meetings.\n  I have here the questions I had submitted, which were filed on \nJanuary 18:\n\n       Did you participate in meetings where specific \n     interrogation techniques were discussed?\n\n  I will include the full answers, but included in the answer is this:\n\n       For me to provide details about the methods of questioning \n     terrorists mentioned in meetings that I attended would entail \n     discussing classified information, and I am not at liberty to \n     do so.\n       Could you tell the positions taken by the individuals \n     present at the meetings when these topics were discussed?\n       Any meeting of the type you described, any records \n     reflecting the information you specify would involve \n     predecisional deliberations, and I am not at liberty to \n     disclose.\n\n  What are predecisional deliberations? Is that executive privilege? If \nso, why don't they say it? If not, he has a requirement, and the \ncommittee should not have passed them out unless he was going to answer \nthe questions.\n  Then it goes on:\n\n       Identify any notes or memoranda reflecting the CIA's \n     request, any responsive actions by your office and the \n     Department of Justice.\n       Any meeting of that type would involve predecisional \n     deliberations and I am not at liberty to disclose.\n       Well, in preparation for your hearing, or since the \n     hearing, did you review documents relating to the Bybee \n     memorandum and its history?\n       I have conducted no search to the extent the documents \n     requested may exist; moreover, they would involve \n     deliberative material and I am not at liberty to disclose.\n\n  I listened to my colleagues on the other side talk about all of the \nquestions asked, and I have 4 pages, 5 books, 16 documents. These are \nthe answers. This is all part of the record. ``I am not at liberty to \ndisclose,'' he says.\n  It goes on:\n\n       Identify notes or correspondence reflecting advice or \n     assessments, recommendations and your views on these issues.\n\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I have not conducted a search.\n\n  The issue was torture.\n\n       I have not conducted a search. Any records reflecting the \n     information you specify would involve deliberative material, \n     and I am not at liberty to disclose.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President. I will not take the time to go on. I will \ninclude those questions in the Record. They conducted a word search \nabout torture, another word. It didn't kick out and they said: We \nconducted a complete search, and this is the best we can do for his \nanswers. It is an insult to not just the Senate of the United States \nbut the American people on the issue of torture.\n  We are talking about basically the single issue that is involved in \nthe remarks I am making, about his role in the development of torture. \nTalk about values in this country, this is torture.\n  He says he can't remember what specific interrogation methods were \ndiscussed.\n  He can't remember who asked for the Justice Department's legal advice \nin the first place.\n  He can't remember whether he made any suggestions to the Department \non the drafting of the Bybee-Gonzales Memorandum, although he admits \nthat ``it would not be unusual'' for his office to have done so.\n  He doesn't know how the memo was forwarded to the Defense Department \nand became part of its ``Working Group Report'' in April 2003, which \nwas used to justify the new interrogation practices at Guantanamo. \nThose practices, in turn, to use the obscure word resorted to by the \nadministration, somehow ``migrated'' to U.S. military operations in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, as if no human hand had been involved in the \ndissemination.\n  Torture became a pervasive practice. The FBI says so. The Red Cross \nsays so. The Defense Intelligence Agency says so. The Defense \nDepartment says it has investigated more than 300 cases of detainee \ntorture, sexual assault, and other abuse. Additional allegations of \nabuse--many of them too sickening to be described in open session on \nthe floor of the Senate--are reported almost daily. Yet, Mr. Gonzales \ncan't remember the details of how any of it happened.\n  The Judiciary Committee has repeatedly asked Mr. Gonzales to provide \ndocuments on his meetings, evaluations, and decisions on the Bybee \nmemorandum. These documents would speak volumes about all the issues \nMr. Gonzales says he has trouble remembering. Yet he refuses to provide \nthe documents. He won't even search for them. In his responses to our \nwritten questions, Mr. Gonzales stated eight times that he has not \n``conducted a search'' for the requested documents. In other words, the \ndocuments we want may exist, but he's not going to look for them. It's \nhard to imagine a more arrogant insult to the constitutional role of \nthe Senate in considering nominations.\n  Mr. Gonzales refused to answer other questions and requests on the \ngrounds that they would involve ``classified information,'' \n``predecisional'' or ``internal deliberations,'' or ``deliberative \nmaterial'' None of these grounds is sufficient. There is no legal \nprohibition against providing classified material to Congress. It's \nroutinely provided to Congress and discussed in closed meetings. There \nis no recognized privilege for ``predecisional'' or ``deliberative'' \nmaterials. The only exception is in the rare case where the President \nhimself decides that his interest in secrecy outweighs the public \ninterest in disclosure, and he himself invokes executive privilege. \nThat hasn't happened here.\n  It was clear when Mr. Gonzales was nominated that his involvement in \nthe policy on prisoner detention and interrogation would be a major \nconcern of the Senate, and that the Senate would need full information \nand materials on this subject. Serious abuses of detainees occurred in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo. Mr. Gonzales's role in developing \ntheir legal justification goes to the heart of the issue whether he \nshould be confirmed as the Nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n  If we vote to confirm this nominee without insisting on answers to \nour Questions, we'll be abdicating our advice-and-consent \nresponsibility and weakening our oversight function precisely when it \nis needed most.\n  The Bybee-Gonzales memorandum was not a law review article or \nnewspaper op-ed article. As Mr. Gonzales himself has said, it was the \ndefinitive legal opinion by the Justice Department on the rules on \ntorture for the entire executive branch of the Government.\n  We learned this past weekend from a New York Times article that the \nJustice Department's Criminal Division--then headed by Assistant \nAttorney General Michael Chertoff, now the nominee to head the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--was advising the CIA on the legality \nof specific interrogation techniques, using the Bybee-Gonzales memo as \nits legal guideline.\n  Further, the Times reported that there is a second Bybee memo which \ngoes into even more detail than the first about which methods of \ncoercion can be used. We have repeatedly asked for information about \nthe original Bybee-Gonzales memo and how it was used. The nominee and \nthe White House have stonewalled us. We have repeatedly asked for other \ndocuments to be produced that would be relevant to understanding the \nfirst Bybee-Gonzales memo. The nominee and the White House have \nstonewalled us.\n  Yesterday, Senator Durbin and I wrote a letter to the ranking members \nof the Judiciary and Government Accountability Committees outlining the \npressing need for all relevant documents before we proceed to fully \nconsider the nomination. Senator Durbin and I wrote:\n\n       It is clear that the Senate should have the documents \n     before it votes on these two nominations, since such \n     materials go to the heart of the qualifications of the \n     nominees to serve in the sensitive and important positions \n     which they have been nominated for.\n\n  As far as we know, until the Department released its revised version \nof the memorandum last month, the Bybee memorandum was the official and \ndefinitive Justice Department opinion on the definition of torture, on \nthe legal defenses for those who commit torture, and on the power of \nthe President to override laws and treaties on torture.\n\n  Given the recent New York Times article, it may be that in addition \nto the second Bybee memo, which we do not have, there are other memos \non torture that the White House refuses to disclose.\n  Harold Koh, a leading scholar of international law and Dean of the \nYale Law School who served in both the Reagan and Clinton \nadministrations, calls the Bybee memorandum the most clearly legally \nerroneous opinion he has ever read. As he told the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       If the counsel for the President receives such an opinion, \n     you would have expected him to do at least one of two things: \n     First, reject it on the spot and send it back or, second, \n     send it to other parts of the government and have them give a \n     second opinion, particularly the State Department which, I \n     believe, following the policies in the U.S. Report on the \n     Convention Against Torture, would have said that the opinion \n     is flatly wrong.\n       Instead . . . that opinion was allowed to become the \n     executive branch policy, was incorporated into the DOD \n     working group report, and remained as executive branch policy \n     for some 2\\1/2\\ years, during which time I believe that a \n     permissive environment was inevitably created.\n\n  That is what Harold Koh said at the hearing. I hope every Member of \nthe Senate will take the time to read his testimony.\n  In his response to our questions about the Bybee memorandum, Mr. \nGonzales said he has ``no specific recollection of [his] reaction to \nthe conclusions, reasoning, or appropriateness as a matter of policy of \nany of the particular sections of the memorandum at the time [he] \nreceived it 2\\1/2\\ years ago.''\n  He did say, however, that he believed at the time it was ``a good-\nfaith effort'' to interpret the antitorture statute. At the hearing, he \ntold Senator Leahy:\n\n       I don't recall today whether or not I was in agreement with \n     all of the analysis, but I don't have a disagreement with the \n     conclusions then reached by the Department.\n\n  Let's review those conclusions. They are summarized on the memo's \nfinal page. The Bybee memorandum made three basic points. First, it \nsaid that torture means only acts that inflict the kind of pain \nexperienced with death or organ failure. That is what the memo said: \nThe pain ``must be of an intensity akin to that which accompanies \nserious physical injury, such as death or organ failure.''\n  Second, the memo said that the President has the inherent \nconstitutional power as Commander in Chief to\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\noverride the prohibitions against torture enacted by the Congress. \nApplication of the antitorture statute ``to interrogations undertaken \npursuant to the President's Commander in Chief powers may be \nunconstitutional,'' the memo said.\n  Third, the memo said that even if a Government official were to \ncommit torture under the extremely narrow definition set forth, abusers \ncould still invoke the defenses of ``necessity'' or ``self-defense.'' \nAs the memo states, ``necessity or self-defense could provide \njustification that would eliminate any criminal liability.'' The memo \nmade this outlandish claim even though the Convention Against \nTorture, which Congress ratified in 1994, states very clearly that ``no \nexceptional circumstances whatsoever'' may be invoked as a \njustification for torture.\n\n  Fourth, the memo states that even if the person inflicting pain knew \nthat severe pain would result from his actions, he would not be guilty \nof a crime even if he acted without good faith if causing harm was not \nhis primary objective. This analysis defines ``intent'' in a way that \ndefines away any instances of torture. This is one of the serious \nerrors in the Bybee-Gonzales memo that was contradicted in the new OLC \nmemo of December 30, 2004, which replaced the original memo.\n  None of these points qualify as a reasonable or ``good faith'' legal \nargument. The Bybee memorandum defined torture so narrowly that Saddam \nHussein's lieutenants could have claimed immunity from prosecution for \nmany of their crimes. Beating you, suffocating you, ripping out your \nfingernails, burning you with hot irons, suspending you from hooks, \nputting lighted cigarettes in your ear--none of these categories are \nspecifically prohibited under the Bybee memorandum since none involve \nnear death or organ failure, the specific conditions required by the \nmemo to constitute torture.\n  As Chairman Specter himself said today, the original Bybee-Gonzales \nmemo was ``erroneous in its legal conclusions,'' and its definition of \ntorture ``was not realistic or adequate.''\n  Nevertheless, Mr. Gonzales allowed it to stand for over 2 years and \nallowed it to be disseminated to other agencies, such as DOD, where \nmajor portions were absorbed verbatim into official policy. And now we \nknow from the Times that it was used in the Justice Department to \napprove specific extreme methods for the CIA.\n  Mr. Gonzales also refused to tell us whether the extreme conduct at \nGuantanamo described in the FBI e-mails is illegal.\n  This conduct included burning detainees with lighted cigarettes, \nexposing them to extreme temperatures, giving forcible enemas, holding \nthem in prolonged stress positions in their urine or feces. He \nexplained his refusal to respond by saying to us:\n\n       [W]ere the administration to begin ruling out speculated \n     interrogation practices in public, by virtue of gradually \n     ruling out some practices in response to repeated questions \n     and not ruling out others, we would fairly rapidly provide \n     al-Qaida with a roadmap concerning the interrogation that \n     captured terrorists can expect to face.\n\n  That is arrant nonsense. Our laws and treaties, our military field \nmanuals all provide specific and clear guidance on where to draw the \nline on torture. Mr. Gonzales's failure to condemn these acts of \ntorture only weakens America's standing in the world and sets back our \nefforts against terrorism.\n  How can we confirm as the chief law enforcement officer a nominee who \nis afraid to stand up for the rule of law?\n  To reach this narrow definition of torture, the authors of the Bybee \nmemorandum relied on totally unrelated Federal statutes that define \nemergency medical conditions for purposes of providing health benefits. \nThe revision last December of the Bybee memoranda refuted this analysis \nstating that the statutes relied on ``do not define severe pain even in \nthat very different context . . . and they do not state that death, \norgan failure, or impairment of bodily function cause 'severe pain.'''\n  Clearly, the memo's original definition of torture is wrong. If it is \napplied in other countries, U.S. soldiers and citizens traveling abroad \nwould clearly be at risk.\n  The Bybee memorandum provisions on executive power are also wholly \ninconsistent with the separations of power in the Constitution. Article \nII, section 3 directs the President to ``take Care that the Laws be \nfaithfully executed.'' Yet the Bybee memorandum states that the Federal \nantitorture statute would be unconstitutional if it ``interferes with \nthe President's direction of such core war matters as the detention and \ninterrogation of enemy combatants.''\n  At a press conference in June 2004, Mr. Gonzales refused to say \nwhether this statement remains ``good law'' for the Bush \nadministration. He would say only that the President ``has not \nexercised his Commander in Chief override; he has not determined that \ntorture is, in fact, necessary to protect the national security of this \ncountry.''\n  Mr. Gonzales evaded questions on this issue by committee members. To \nthis day, we still do not know whether the President believes he has \nthe power as Commander in Chief to authorize torture. There is no such \nthing as a Commander in Chief override.\n  It is certainly not in my copy of the Constitution. It appears to be \nsomething that Mr. Gonzales and his colleagues have invented.\n  Congress has repeatedly passed laws and ratified treaties prohibiting \ntorture and mistreatment of detainees, and the President does not have \nthe power to violate them.\n  When a nominee claims that such an override exists, or suggests that \nthose who commit torture might be able to invoke the defense of \n``necessity'' or ``self-defense'' notwithstanding Cong-\nress's categorical prohibition against such a defense, it sends a \nmessage that ``anything goes'' to our troops and intelligence officers \nin the field. To allow such extreme claims to become official U.S. \npolicy for two whole years was reckless and, in my view, disqualifying \nin any nominee for Attorney General.\n  Mr. Gonzales has also demonstrated a flagrant disregard for the rule \nof law in his effort to facilitate the CIA practice of ``ghost \ndetainees.'' The administration has always claimed to be in full \ncompliance with the Geneva Conventions in Iraq. Yet in the spring of \n2004, we learned from General Taguba that between six and eight of the \nprisoners at Abu Ghraib Prison had not been registered as required by \nArmy regulations and were being moved around the prison to avoid \ndetection by the International Committee for the Red Cross. General \nTaguba described this practice as ``deceptive, contrary to Army \ndoctrine and in violation of international law.''\n  In September, Army investigators told the Armed Services Committee \nthat at the CIA's direction, as many as 100 detainees at Abu Ghraib had \nbeen hidden from the Red Cross and that the CIA had refused requests to \ncooperate with the military investigation. This disclosure drew outrage \nfrom both Democrats and Republicans. Senator McCain said:\n\n       The situation with the CIA ghost soldiers is beginning to \n     look like a bad movie. . . . This needs to be cleared up \n     rather badly.\n\n  Since then, we have learned that Mr. Gonzales was a major architect \nof this policy. On March 19, 2004, the Justice Department provided him \nwith a draft memorandum--the so-called ``Goldsmith Memorandum''--to \nallow the CIA to ship certain persons out of Iraq. Once again, the \nmemo's first page reads, ``Memorandum for Alberto R. Gonzales, Counsel \nto the President.'' A separate cover page confirms that the opinion was \nrequested by him. It is hard to imagine a clearer smoking gun.\n  Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention specifically states:\n\n       Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as \n     deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to \n     the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other \n     country occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their \n     motive.\n\n  Violations of Article 49 constitute ``grave breaches'' of the \nConvention and therefore qualify as ``war crimes'' under Federal law.\n  In spite of the clear, unequivocal language of this provision, the \nJustice Department ruled that Article 49 does not in fact prohibit, for \nthe purpose of ``facilitating interrogation,'' the temporary removal \nfrom Iraq of ``protected persons'' who have not been accused of a \ncrime. Scott Silliman, an expert in military law at Duke University, \nobserved that the Goldsmith memorandum:\n\n     Seeks to create a legal regime justifying conduct that the \n     international community\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\n     clearly considers in violation of international law and the \n     Convention.\n\n  Although the memo was labeled ``draft,'' it was put into action. In \nOctober 2004, the Washington Post reported that one intelligence \nofficial familiar with the operation said the CIA used the memo:\n\n     As legal support for secretly transporting as many as a dozen \n     detainees out of Iraq in the last six months. The agency has \n     concealed the detainees from the International Committee of \n     the Red Cross and other authorities, the official said.\n\n  The legal analysis in the Goldsmith Memorandum is preposterous. Yet \nit appears to have provided a legal justification for the CIA to commit \nwar crimes. As with the Bybee Memorandum, Mr. Gonzales has \ncategorically refused to answer the Senate's questions about his \ninvolvement.\n  He refuses to provide or even conduct a search for documents relating \nto his request for the Goldsmith Memorandum.\n  He refuses to say anything about his discussions with the author of \nthe memo.\n  He says he does not know whether the CIA acted on the memo, as the \nWashington Post reported.\n  He even says that he has never had the ``occasion to come to \ndefinitive views'' about the analysis in the memo.\n  Far from helping to clear the air, Mr. Gonzales has clouded it \nfurther. To let his nomination proceed would make a mockery of the \nnotion of congressional oversight and accountability.\n\n  There are many other issues in Mr. Gonzales's record that should give \nMembers of the Senate pause.\n  As predicted by Secretary Powell and senior military lawyers, Mr. \nGonzales's memorandum of January 2002 on the applicability of the \nGeneva Conventions to the war in Afghanistan brought a strong negative \nreaction from even our closest allies and lowered the bar for the \nprotection of our own troops.\n  According to the Schlesinger report, in September 2003 military \ncommanders in Iraq cited this memo as legal justification for the use \nof extreme interrogation techniques at Abu Ghraib prison. The worst \nabuses there occurred from September to December 2003.\n  In his answers to the committee, Mr. Gonzales made clear that the \nadministration does not consider the CIA to be bound by the prohibition \non cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in Article 16 of the \nConvention Against Torture. This shift in legal policy was apparently \nmade in a separate Justice Department memorandum which has also not \nbeen provided to Congress.\n  Today, therefore, CIA agents are authorized to treat detainees in a \ncruel, inhuman, and degrading manner--even if it violates \nconstitutional rules in the U.S.--so long as they do not commit \n``torture'' under the Department's narrow definition. President Bush \nalso exempted the CIA from his directive in February 2002 to treat all \ndetainees ``humanely.'' This shameful change in policy obviously \nendangers the safety of American soldiers who are captured abroad.\n  Finally, the New York Times reported that Mr. Gonzales excluded \nimportant administration personnel from deliberations on the \nadministration's plan to establish military tribunals at Guantanamo, a \nplan that was widely criticized as unjust, unworkable, and \nunconstitutional. Secretary of State Powell, National Security Adviser \nRice, and the head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, \nMichael Chertoff, saw the President's Military Order only after it was \npublished in November 2001. Most of the Pentagon's top military lawyers \nwere also kept in the dark. More than 3 years after the order's \npublication, not a single detainee at Guantanamo has been successfully \nprosecuted. To the contrary, as predicted by officials who have \nexpertise in the field, the military tribunal process there is falling \napart.\n  Torture has never before been a Republican versus Democrat issue. \nInstead, it has always been an issue of broad consensus and ideals, \nreflecting the fundamental values of the Nation. President Reagan \nsigned the Convention Against Torture in 1988.\n  President George H.W. Bush and President Clinton supported its \nratification in 1994. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led by \nSenator Helms and Senator Pell, voted 10-0 to report the Convention \nfavorably to the full Senate.\n  I hope that this tradition of bipartisanship and consensus will \ncontinue today. I hope that all Members of the Senate will cast their \nvote in a way that upholds our fundamental values.\n  A ``no'' vote is the right vote if we care about maintaining \nAmerica's standing in the world and fighting the war on terrorism. The \ntorture and other abuses of prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nGuantanamo have done immense damage to America's standing in the world. \nThe extreme and irresponsible claims in the Bybee and Goldsmith \nMemorandums have raised basic questions about the genuineness of our \ncommitment to the rule of law.\n  It is the right vote for our troops. The administration's shameful \ndisregard for our laws and treaties on torture has lowered the bar for \nthe protection of our own soldiers.\n  It has violated the military's longstanding ``golden rule'': Treat \ncaptured combatants in the manner we expect our own soldiers to be \ntreated. What can Mr. Gonzales possibly say to a country that justifies \nits torture of a U.S. soldier by citing Mr. Gonzales's own record of \nsupport for it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is now recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have just returned from a \nweekend in three different parts of my State and of the State of the \nPresiding Officer. I was conferring with many of our constituents \nregarding what is anticipated to be the President's proposal that he \nwill give in his speech tomorrow night regarding Social Security. Of \ncourse, this is of enormous importance to us, not only in America but \nespecially in Florida because of the high percentage of our population \nwho are senior citizens. In fact, it is 3 million Floridians, retirees, \nsurvivors, and people with disabilities who depend on monthly Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  Social Security provides a guaranteed benefit, and it helps retirees \nlive independently and with dignity. It is also the sole source of \nincome for one-fifth of our Nation's seniors.\n  In this day and age when you read daily in the newspaper about \nemployer pensions becoming scarce, Social Security provides a lifeline \nto retirees such as Lucille Solana, a 57-year-old retiree from Davie in \nBroward County. She worked for United Airlines for nearly 36 years and \nretired when the company's bankruptcy cut her pay and her office in \nMiami was closed. She had done what she was supposed to do. She \nfollowed the rule of savings: one-third personal savings, one-third \ncorporate pension, and one-third Social Security for her retirement. \nBut it hasn't all gone according to plan. United Airlines is going to \nterminate her pension, and her personal savings have suffered with the \nmarket. About all she has left is her Social Security.\n  I think we have a moral obligation to help people such as Lucille and \nour society's elderly citizens.\n  Social Security also helps us provide financial security to spouses \nand dependent children if a worker becomes disabled or dies.\n  Listen to this: 38 percent of all Social Security benefit dollars are \npaid to disabled Americans. That is 18 million individuals, their \nspouses, dependent children, and survivors. Without disability \nbenefits, over half of the families with disabled workers would have \nincomes below the poverty line.\n  I hasten to add that when we are talking about the spouses and \ndependent children and survivors, what does the Good Book tell us is \none of the highest necessities? It has been told to us in both the Old \nTestament and the New Testament in Isaiah and James. The widows and the \norphans are at the top of our list to be taken care of.\n  Most families in America know what an important program Social \nSecurity is to all Americans. We don't have to convince anyone.\n  But you also ought to hear the story by Gene and Lynda Christie of \nBeverly Hills, FL, two of our constituents who are concerned about the \nPresident's Social Security plan. They read about his projected plan in \nthe papers. What they read and how it would be calculated, their senior \nbenefits would be cut by $500 a month. They simply can't afford that \nkind of reduction. I will bet\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\nthat some of you would have a difficult time accepting such a cut.\n  I believe changes to Social Security cannot include cuts to benefits. \nBut that is what privatization would do. That is what the President is \nexpected to propose on Wednesday night as a central part of his plan.\n  I will oppose diverting money from the Social Security trust fund, \nbut I believe we should do something to keep Social Security solvent \njust as we have done successfully in the past.\n  Two decades ago, when I was in the House of Representatives, Social \nSecurity faced a real crisis. It truly was on the brink of insolvency. \nYou know what happened. Instead of this approach, ``it is my way or the \nhighway,'' Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan got together and they formed a \nbipartisan commission. On that commission, leadership was given to \nSenator Bob Dole, to Congressman former Senator Claude Pepper. And the \nwork of that bipartisan commission saved the system and built up the \ntrust fund for the retirement of the baby boomers.\n  When you put this into context, over the next three-quarters of a \ncentury, 75 years into the future, when you compare now with the \nprojected insolvency, lo and behold, we find that the recent tax cuts \nthat have been enacted will cost three times as much as the shortfall \nthat Social Security is projected to face.\n  According to the Social Security Trustees Report last year, Medicare \nexpenditures are now projected to surpass Social Security spending in \n2024. With Medicare expenditures over the next 75 years being far in \nexcess of the shortfall in Social Security, the Medicare deficit will \nbe three times as much as the shortfall in Social Security. Based on \nthese numbers, it is clear that a more real crisis lies in the \nexploding health care costs.\n  Privatization will not fix Social Security. In fact, it will actually \nworsen the country's overall fiscal health. When money is taken out of \nSocial Security to pay for private investment accounts, you won't have \nenough to pay for current beneficiaries.\n  Some have suggested that the Government should borrow $2 trillion to \nplug this hole.\n  I just came from the Budget Committee. When we are facing upwards of \n$430 billion and more in deficits in this particular year, and you take \nanother $2 trillion over the next 10 years and add it to it, that would \nswell the Federal debt and increase our dependence on foreign creditors \nsuch as the banks in Japan and China.\n  Rather than cut the benefits or borrow trillions of dollars, I \nbelieve we should pursue other ways to help Americans supplement Social \nSecurity and save for their retirement.\n  Social Security was intended to be a social safety net. Social \nSecurity was not intended and never was meant to be an investment \nprogram. By linking benefits to the volatile stock prices, \nprivatization shifts the risk to seniors and it weakens Social \nSecurity's guaranteed safety net.\n  Look at the wake of cases recently of corporate wrongdoing. We all \nknow too well the dangers of relying on the stock market for \nretirement. Just listen to Michael Pesho of Sanford, FL, who wrote to \nme this December. He says:\n\n       Dear Senator, I am a 56-year-old who had to work since the \n     age of 14. I lost both my parents when I was 16, and I have \n     had to provide for myself all these years. I am also a victim \n     of the WorldCom fiasco.\n       I was laid off at WorldCom and lost my entire retirement \n     portfolio when it was converted into worthless WorldCom \n     stock. I'm tired and would very much like to retire in 9 or \n     10 years but in order for me to do that Social Security will \n     have to be in place for me to have any kind of retirement \n     foundation to work off of.\n\n  He says:\n\n       I implore you to ensure Social Security benefits will be \n     there when I need them.\n\n  Michael doesn't want his Social Security entrusted to the same market \nthat devastated his retirement savings. It is too risky.\n  I intend to fight for people who worked hard and played by the rules. \nI will fight against cuts to Social Security benefits. I will fight \nagainst any plan that relies on massive borrowing and increases in \ndebt. I take the fiscally conservative position and I will fight to \nprotect this program that provides a safe and reliable source of \nretirement income for millions of Americans. I intend to work with the \nPresident, not to cut, but to strengthen Social Security. I agree with \nhim that we have a moral obligation to fix it for future generations.\n  Currently, I am working with other Members of the Senate to put \ntogether a moderate and more sensible plan that strengthens Social \nSecurity and expands opportunities for all Americans to save for their \nretirement. This plan would give workers additional tax breaks to save \nfor retirement on their own with a personal account over and above \nSocial Security.\n  Now is the time to reach out and to bring the various factions \ntogether. Now is the time to be conciliators and in the spirit of \nRonald Reagan and ``Tip'' O'Neill who saved the Social Security system \nin a bipartisan fashion back in the early 1980s. We need to bring the \nfactions together. We need to build mutual consent on how to protect \nSocial Security for the retirees of today and future generations. I am \nvery hopeful this can be achieved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 8:15 this evening be equally divided for debate between the \nchairman and ranking member or their designees; provided further that \nthe Senate then resume consideration of the nomination at 9:30 a.m. \ntomorrow, with the time until 4:30 again being equally divided as \npreviously mentioned; provided that the further hour be under the \ncontrol of the majority and that every 60 minutes alternate. Further, I \nask that from 2:30 to 4:30 be under the control of the minority, with 4 \no'clock to 4:30 under the control of the majority. I further ask \nconsent that when the Senate convenes on Thursday morning, immediately \nfollowing the time for the two leaders, there be a period of morning \nbusiness for 2 hours, with the first hour under the control of the \nDemocratic leader or his designee and the second hour under the control \nof the majority leader or his designee. I further ask consent that \nfollowing the morning business time, the Senate resume consideration of \nthe Gonzales nomination and there be an additional 8 hours of debate \nequally divided again between the chairman and ranking member or \ndesignees. Finally, I ask consent that following the use or yielding \nback of time the Senate proceed with a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination with no intervening action or debate, and that following the \nvote the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, if I could suggest to the \nchairman, Senator Specter, I think he misspoke on one line. I believe \nin the consent which we are considering it says that ``further, I ask \nthat from 2:30 to 4 o'clock be under the control of the minority and 4 \nto 4:30 under the control of the majority.'' If that is the way \nhis version reads, I would like to amend his statement.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. 2:30 to 4 under the control of the minority and 4 to \n4:30 under the control of the majority? That is acceptable.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I ask the chairman, does he intend, then, to proceed now, \nand is it the understanding that this side will have the next speaker, \nand I will follow that individual?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my intention to speak next in \nrebuttal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask through the Chair, I advise my colleague \nfrom Minnesota I will make a unanimous consent request about the lineup \nfor Democratic speakers. He will be the first on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order of \nspeakers on the Democratic side for today be as follows: Senator Dayton \nof Minnesota, Senator Stabenow of Michigan, and Senator Johnson of \nSouth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot intend to object, I believe implicit in what the Senator from \nIllinois said is\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\nthat there be an alternating of speakers, and I will present a list of \nRepublican speakers to integrate with what Senator Durbin has stated.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, both implicit and explicit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today we have heard quite a ring of \ncastigation against Judge Gonzales, virtually all of it misdirected, \nvirtually all of it factually incorrect. We have heard the Senator from \nMassachusetts castigate the Bybee memorandum in torrid prose, claiming \nthe Bybee memorandum was exactly wrong. He asserted that the Bybee \nmemorandum did not have a sensible interpretation, or a legal \ninterpretation of torture. He further claimed that the Bybee memorandum \nvastly overstated executive authority, and that it said the President \nhad as much authority on the question of detainees as he did on \nbattlefield control. These claims are palpably erroneous.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts then cited the Goldsmith memo, and \nsaid it certainly was a smoking gun. But Judge Gonzales did not hold \nthat gun, did not have anything to do with that gun. The Senator from \nMassachusetts said Judge Gonzales was sent a copy of that memorandum. \nDuring the course of Judge Gonzales's questioning by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, the Senator from Massachusetts never once, to my \nrecollection, ever viewed the transcript, or said anything about the \nGoldsmith memorandum.\n  So what we have is the castigation of Judge Gonzales for matters \nwhich were totally beyond his control. Judge Gonzales was the lawyer \nfor the President as White House Counsel. As such, he sat in on a \nseries of meetings. Those meetings were convened to find out what was \nthe law on how detainees could be appropriately questioned to avoid any \nimplication of the torture statute. When there is a determination of \nwhat the law is, that is up to the Department of Justice. And that is \nwhat Judge Gonzales testified to. And while there appears to be \ninstances in which the Bybee memorandum was off-base, Judge Gonzales \nwas not involved with the drafting of that memorandum.\n\n  Then when the question comes up as to what questions the detainees \nwere going to be asked, that is a matter for the experts. As Judge \nGonzales responded to questions from the Senator from Massachusetts at \nthe hearing, it is up to the CIA and up to the Department of Defense. \nIt is not up to the Counsel for the President.\n  When the Senator from Massachusetts castigates Judge Gonzales for not \nbeing able to remember what happened years ago, or what conversations \nmay have taken place, he is being unfairly critical. The Department of \nJustice was responsible to provide the memo. Whether it was for the CIA \nor the Department of Defense is something that was not recollected, but \nwho can recollect everything that happened several years ago?\n  When the Senator from Massachusetts castigates Judge Gonzales for not \nconducting a search and for not knowing certain information, he is \nmistaken. A search was conducted.\n  When the Senator from Massachusetts raised that issue in the \nexecutive session, I then asked the White House to conduct a search. \nThat search was conducted, and immediately a memorandum was circulated \ndisclosing what that search was.\n  When the Senator from Massachusetts, last night--I got it this \nmorning--asked for some more information from the White House, I again \nforwarded the request and got a reply today. It was not a reply that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts liked, but there has been nothing about \nthis entire proceeding that the Senator from Massachusetts has agreed \nwith. And that is his prerogative. He does not have to agree with it. \nHe does not have to vote for Judge Gonzales. And he can express his \nviews on oversight responsibilities. But there are others of us on this \ncommittee who have been here a while who understand our oversight \nresponsibility and who have made a very strong effort to provide the \ninformation which the Senator from Massachusetts has asked for.\n  Judge Gonzales was available to more than a dozen Members of the \nSenate, available to all members of the Judiciary Committee--not that \nall asked to see him--and provided more than 250 pages of voluminous \nanswers. So extensive were the answers that they were complimented, in \neffect, by the New York Times, saying it was the most comprehensive \nstatement made as to what was the policy of the U.S. Government on \nthese very important subjects.\n  But aside from the rhetoric, what are the facts? What does the \ntestimony show? What do the documents show?\n  Senator Feinstein says she still does not understand what Judge \nGonzales thinks about torture. Well, what Judge Gonzales thinks about \ntorture he has said on quite a number of occasions.\n  Let me remind all Senators who have to vote on this matter what Judge \nGonzales said about torture.\n  No. 1:\n\n       [T]he President has said we're not going to engage in \n     torture.\n\n  No. 2:\n\n       The President gave a directive to the military that despite \n     the fact that Geneva may not apply with respect to the \n     conflict and the war on terrorism, it is that everyone should \n     be treated humanely.\n\n  No. 3, this is in the record, according to his testimony:\n\n       [T]he position of the President on torture is very, very \n     clear, and there is a clear record of this. He does not \n     believe in torture, condone torture, has never ordered \n     torture, and anyone engaged in conduct that constitutes \n     torture is going to be held accountable.\n\n  No. 4:\n\n       All I know is that the President has said we are not going \n     to [have] torture under any circumstances. . . . the United \n     States has never had a policy of torture.\n\n  No. 5, further testimony:\n\n       Our policy is we do not engage in torture.\n\n  No. 6:\n\n       It is not the policy of the administration to tolerate \n     torture or inhumane conduct toward any person that the United \n     States is detaining.\n\n  No. 7, more testimony:\n\n       The President is not going to order torture.\n\n  No. 8:\n\n       [T]his President is not going to order torture. We don't \n     condone it.\n\n  No. 9:\n\n       Now, let me emphasize, and I can't emphasize this strongly \n     enough, there are certain basic values that this country \n     stands for and this President certainly believes in, and \n     those values are reflected in the directives that he has \n     issued regarding the treatment of al Qaeda detainees, and \n     those who do not meet those standards are going to be held \n     accountable.\n\n  This is all testimony or responses in the Record:\n\n       In addition, there are of course other legal restrictions. \n     For example, the convention against torture, that would be \n     applicable, Army regulations that would be applicable. All \n     those exist to conscript the type of conduct that our \n     military can engage in with respect to detainees. And so we \n     want to of course meet basic standards of conduct with \n     respect to treatment of al Qaeda[.]\n\n  No. 10, again, testimony:\n\n       [A]s I have said repeatedly today, this administration does \n     not engage in torture and will not condone torture. And so \n     what we are really discussing is a hypothetical situation. . \n     . .\n\n  No. 11:\n\n       [O]ther than the directive by the President that we're not \n     going to engage in torture and that we're going to abide by \n     our legal obligations, I'm not aware of any other directive \n     by the President.\n\n  No. 12: Judge Gonzales also reiterated his own opposition to torture \nin numerous responses to written questions submitted by Judiciary \nCommittee Senators following the hearing.\n\n  No. 13:\n\n       The President has repeatedly stated that his Administration \n     does not authorize or condone torture under any circumstances \n     by U.S. personnel. I, of course, fully support the \n     President's policy. . . .\n\n  No. 14:\n\n       I do denounce torture, and if confirmed as Attorney \n     General, I will prosecute those who engage in torture.\n\n  No. 15:\n\n       The President has made clear that the United States remains \n     committed to adhering to its obligations under the Geneva \n     Conventions and the Convention Against Torture and has \n     unequivocally condemned torture. I have repeatedly emphasized \n     the President's statement of these commitments on behalf of \n     the United States, and will continue to do so if confirmed as \n     Attorney General.\n\n  As chairman of the committee, I had the first round of questions, and \nthe first question I asked Judge Gonzales\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\nwas: What is your position on torture? And his words were to the \neffect: I condemn torture. Now, I do not know how much more explicit a \nwitness, a nominee, can be than Judge Gonzales has been, but if someone \ndoes not understand Judge Gonzales's position after this kind of an \nemphatic, definitive statement, it is plain and clear for the record.\n  The contention has been made that Judge Gonzales agrees with a Bybee \nmemorandum's conclusion that severe pain, for purposes of the torture \nstatute, must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying organ \nfailure, impairment of bodily function, or even death. This has been a \nsource of contention throughout the hearings in the executive session \nand on the Senate floor. Judge Gonzales responded to the ranking \nmember, who said:\n\n       Do you agree today that for an act to violate the torture \n     statute it must be equivalent in intensity to the pain \n     accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure, \n     impairment of bodily function or even death?\n  Judge Gonzales answered:\n\n       I do not. That does not represent the position of the \n     Executive Branch.\n\n  So Judge Gonzales categorically repudiated the Bybee memorandum in \nthat respect.\n  There has been a source of argument about what the Bybee memorandum \nmeant and what Judge Gonzales's position was about it. Judge Gonzales \nwas deferential to the determinations by the Department of Justice. \nThere is a complicated issue here as to whether the White House is \ngoing to be overly determinative in what the Department of Justice's \nposition should be, and the White House has been very cautious. This is \ntraditional--not just with this White House but with prior White \nHouses--not to tell the Department of Justice what to say or not to \nappear to tell the Department of Justice what to say because that would \nbe politicization of a Department of Justice by the White House. The \nWhite House's role, as we have emphasized it, is not to tell the \nDepartment of Justice what to do, and the Department of Justice and the \nAttorney General's role is to represent all of the American people and \nnot just the President.\n  There was discussion between the White House and the Department of \nJustice, as well as other agencies, about what the torture statute \nmeant. Judge Gonzales testified to that and said, in effect, that it \nwould be natural to have those kinds of discussions. Judge Gonzales \nsaid:\n\n       It was very, very difficult. I don't recall today whether \n     or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis, but I \n     don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached \n     by the Department. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of \n     the Department to tell us what the law means, Senator.\n\n  In the very next question, however, we clarified his views on the \nnarrow definition of torture in the Bybee memo. The ranking member \nasked:\n\n       Do you agree today that for an act to violate the torture \n     statute it must be equivalent in intensity to the pain \n     accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, \n     impairment of bodily function or even death?\n\n  And as noted previously, Judge Gonzales said he did not. Later, in \nanother response to the ranking member, Judge Gonzales agreed that it \nwould be horrific conduct--I think you would agree to this, and Judge \nGonzales did, to what Senator Leahy asked--that cutting off someone's \nfinger would be considered torture.\n  Judge Gonzales also explained his agreement with the conclusion of \nthe Justice Department based on respect for the Department's \nindependence. This is what Judge Gonzales had to say on that facet of \nthe issue:\n\n       Senator, what you're asking the counsel to do is to \n     interject himself and direct the Department of Justice, who \n     is supposed to be free of any kind of political influence, in \n     reaching a legal interpretation of a law passed by Congress. \n     I certainly give my views. There was of course conversation \n     and a give and take discussion about what does the law mean, \n     but ultimately, ultimately by statute the Department of \n     Justice is charged by Congress to provide legal advice on \n     behalf of the President.\n\n  Well, it is apparent from the totality of the context of what Judge \nGonzales had to say that aside from giving deference to the role of the \nDepartment of Justice in interpreting the law, the Bybee memo was not \naccepted by Judge Gonzales.\n  When it came to the critical question of the assertion in the Bybee \nmemorandum that the President had as much authority on the questioning \nof detainees as the President had on battlefield decisions, Judge \nGonzales said he disagreed with that. When the question came up about \nthe scope of the President's authority to immunize people who would \nviolate Federal law, of course, any suggestion in the Bybee memo or \notherwise would be contrary to a basic understanding of the law of the \nUnited States, where nobody is above the law.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Judge Gonzales specifically rejected the \nportion of the August 1, 2002, Bybee memorandum, which asserted that \nthe President, as Commander in Chief, possessed the constitutional \nauthority in certain circumstances to disregard the Federal criminal \nprohibition against torture. He stated that the memo has been \n``withdrawn.''\n\n       It has been rejected, including that section regarding the \n     Commander in Chief's authority to ignore the criminal \n     statutes. So it has been rejected by the Executive Branch. I, \n     categorically, reject it . . . [T]his administration does not \n     engage in torture and will not condone torture.\n\n  A question was raised about a reservation to the Convention Against \nTorture under article 16, which provided that aliens interrogated by \nU.S. personnel outside of the United States did not enjoy the \nsubstantive rights of the 5th, 8th and 14th amendments, a technical \nreservation for international law purposes.\n  Judge Gonzales responded that this is a legislative issue that may \nperhaps require additional consideration. Nevertheless, regardless of \nthe debate about the strict requirements of article 16, Judge Gonzales \ntestified that the administration had sought to be in compliance as a \nsubstantive matter under the 5th and 18th amendments. He also testified \nthat to the best of his knowledge, the U.S. has met its obligations \nunder the 5th, 8th, and 14th amendments.\n  A major question was raised about Judge Gonzales's independence. He \nwas emphatic, saying that:\n\n       If confirmed, I will no longer represent only the White \n     House. I will represent the United States of America and its \n     people. I understand the difference between the two roles. In \n     the former, I have been privileged to advise the President \n     and the staff. In the latter, I would have a far broader \n     responsibility to pursue justice for all the people of our \n     great nation, to see that the laws are enforced in a fair and \n     impartial manner for all Americans.\n\n  Both Senator Leahy and I, in our opening statements, emphasized this \nissue, and this was a matter which Judge Gonzales had thought about and \nhad included in his opening statement and was prepared to affirm the \nvery fundamental difference in his duty as Attorney General to the \nAmerican people, contrasted with his responsibilities as White House \nCounsel to the President.\n  We have seen a rather dramatic turnabout in the course of the \nhearings on Judge Gonzales, the issue of the esteem in which he had \nbeen held and what Senators had to say about him and what they have \nsaid about him since in executive session.\n  Senator Kohl had this to say about Judge Gonzales:\n\n       We have had an opportunity to work together on several \n     different issues over the years, and I have come to respect \n     you. And I believe if you are confirmed, you will do a good \n     job as Attorney General of the United States.\n\n  Senator Durbin said:\n\n       I respect him and his life story very much.\n\n  Senator Leahy said:\n\n       When this nomination was first announced, I was hopeful. I \n     noted at the time that I like and respect Judge Gonzales.\n\n  Senator Schumer said:\n\n       I like Judge Gonzales. I respect him. I think he is a \n     gentleman and I think he is a genuinely good man. We have \n     worked very well together, especially when it comes to \n     filling the vacancies on New York's Federal bench. He has \n     been straightforward with me and he has been open to \n     compromise. Our interactions haven't just been cordial; they \n     have been pleasant. I have enjoyed the give-and-take we have \n     engaged in.\n  Senator Schumer later said:\n\n       I was inclined to support Judge Gonzales. I believed, and I \n     stated publicly early on, that Judge Gonzales was a much less \n     polarizing figure than Senator Ashcroft had been. . . . Even \n     if you are, as Judge Gonzales is, a good man, a good person \n     with top-notch legal qualifications, you must still have the \n     independence necessary to be the Nation's chief law \n     enforcement officer.\n\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\n\n  He continues:\n\n       I still have great respect for Judge Gonzales. He has the \n     kind of Horatio Alger story that makes us all proud to be \n     Americans. It is an amazing country when a man can rise from \n     such humble beginnings to be nominated for Attorney General.\n\n  So the question arises, as we are engaging in floor debate on the \nnomination of Judge Gonzales to be Attorney General of the United \nStates, what happened here? We know of the atrocities of Abu Ghraib, \nand although there have been some efforts in some of the speeches to \nidentify Judge Gonzales with Abu Ghraib, they are not substantial. \nThere have been some criticisms regarding Guantanamo. Those matters are \nunder investigation. But Judge Gonzales is not the interrogator; he is \nnot the questioner; he is not the person who made up the questions; he \nis not the person who has defined the torture statute. He has been one \nindividual in a series of meetings, where his role has been defined as \nbeing the representative of the President.\n  But the role of the Department of Justice is clearly delineated. They \nare to interpret what the statutes mean. The experts in the CIA and in \nthe Department of Defense have their own responsibilities.\n  So what is happening here? Is it the constant Washington search for \npolitical advantage that goes around this town every day? During the \ncourse of our discussion on Judge Gonzales, we heard a speech about \nSocial Security. It surprised me a little, in the middle of the \nproceedings. We have questions on political advantage on so many \nsubjects that I am not going to digress. But there is no doubt that the \nair is very heavy with politics in this town.\n  We had the nomination proceedings as to Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice. She was challenged in a way that was highly unusual \nin the Senate of the United States--challenged as to her integrity. Not \nwas she wrong about weapons of mass destruction, but did she falsify, \nwas her testimony deliberately false and misleading. Dr. Rice had more \nnegative votes than any nominee for Secretary of State since John Jay \nin 1824. That says something about the atmosphere in Washington and the \nconstant Washington search for political advantage.\n  Senator Schumer has raised a contention repeatedly in the course of \nthe proceedings on Judge Gonzales about the so-called nuclear option. \nHe asked Judge Gonzales for his opinion as to whether the so-called \nnuclear option is constitutional. That is quite a cloud hanging over \nthe Senator--potentially hanging over the Senate--as to whether the \nrules of the Senate require only 51 votes on the confirmation of a \nFederal judge as opposed to the requirement of cloture of 60 votes. \nSenator Schumer has raised that issue. I don't think he is looking for \na commitment there as a condition to his vote, so why question Judge \nGonzales about that collateral matter that has no bearing on his \nfitness for the post to which he has been nominated?\n  So there is some sense on my part that we have found a wedge issue. \nIt is certainly true that Judge Gonzales has not been the most artful \nof witnesses. To say he has a generalized agreement with the Bybee \nmemorandum was not the most artful of answers, after it had been \nuniversally condemned and withdrawn by the Department of Justice. But \nhe made that reference as a theoretical matter as to how the \nWhite House respects the Department of Justice's role in interpreting \nthe law so that if the Department of Justice came down with an \ninterpretation, Judge Gonzales was not going to say it was wrong to \nappear to be having undue influence, or to be politicizing the process. \nBut that wasn't the most artful of answers.\n\n  When asked hypothetical questions about was there any circumstance \nwhere the President of the United States might not follow a statute, \nagain, it wasn't the most artful of answers. There is no doubt that Abu \nGhraib and Guantanamo and the horrors of torture are overwhelming to \nthe American psyche.\n  Back in 1991, I introduced legislation to protect victims of torture, \nto have rights of actions in Federal courts. I spoke out about the \ntorture issue before it became a matter for legislation for the \nCongress generally. The legislation I introduced in 1991 was adopted, \nso that people who are subjected to torture in foreign countries can \nsue in U.S. courts. So the issue of torture has always been on the mind \nof this Senator. It is on the minds of the American people.\n  But Judge Gonzales is not responsible for what went on in Abu Ghraib \nor Guantanamo. Judge Gonzales is not responsible for actions by the \nCIA, or the Department of Defense, or for legal opinions by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  If you look at his record and his qualifications as a lawyer, his \nacademic qualifications as a Harvard Law graduate, his qualifications \nfor practicing law with a big firm, his qualifications for being a \nsupreme court justice in Texas, his qualifications for being White \nHouse Counsel for 4 years, where Judge Gonzales has had contact with \nmany Senators--I dare say in that capacity, my colleagues in the Senate \nwould share my views that he was always courteous, always relevant, \nalways on top of the issues in discussing judicial nominees, where most \nof us have had some role to confirm a judge in his or her State. I \nthink the comments would be uniform, as the ones I quoted, about how \npleasant it was and how effective it was and how professional it was to \ndeal with Judge Gonzales.\n  So if the winds of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo had not blown across \nthis hearing, I think we would have had perhaps a unanimous vote in \nfavor of Judge Gonzales. In this highly charged political atmosphere, \none has to wonder whether he is not, himself, a torture victim. He is \nclearly a victim of Washington politics.\n  Judge Gonzales is still highly likely to be confirmed. He was voted \nout of committee on a party-line vote. It had been my hope and \nexpectation at an earlier stage that it would have been a strong \nbipartisan vote. It is still my hope and expectation he will be \nconfirmed with some bipartisanship, but it will not be the kind of \nstrong vote that would have given him a much stronger position as \nAttorney General absent the Bybee memo, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo. But \non the basis of his academic, professional, and public service record, \nthere was much, and still is much, on which to recommend him to be the \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I have taken some more time. I made a very short \nopening statement to begin debate today and have listened to the \narguments made by Senators from the other side of the aisle and find \nfactually that they are off the mark; that in terms of what Judge \nGonzales has had to say out of his own mouth have come very forceful \ndenunciations of torture, very forceful denunciations of the Bybee \nmemorandum, and a strong statement as to why he ought to be the next \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following list be \nnext in order of Republican speakers: Senator Coburn, Senator Sessions, \nSenator Brownback. Before the Chair rules, I will add that we will \ncontinue to alternate between Republican and Democratic speakers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I wanted to put this on the record so the people who are \nnext up would know it, and would be in a position to come to the \nChamber in a timely fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I highly respect the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has been noted with his \nown stellar examples of bipartisanship, working with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. But I must say I have to respond to his remarks \nabout those of us who oppose Judge Gonzales as being engaged in nothing \nother than political partisanship. I suggest that term could be applied \nto those who support these nominees because they are of the same \npolitical party as the President as much as they could be applied to \nthose of us who are on the other side of the aisle.\n  If the Founders of this country did not intend for the Senate to \nexercise an independent judgment about the nominees to these high \noffices, such as Attorney General and Secretary of State, they would \nnot have provided for a separate Senate confirmation of the President's \nnominees.\n  These individuals are not employees of the President, even though \nthey are\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nnominated by him and serve as members of his Cabinet and serve at his \npleasure, as are his employees in the White House, who are not subject \nto Senate confirmation. These men and women become public officials who \nrepresent the United States of America within our country, before the \nSupreme Court, as Secretary of State in the seats of government around \nthe world. They have to meet an American standard, and it is that \nstandard that each of us has the independent responsibility to apply \naccording to our own best judgments, but one the Constitution clearly \nintends we should apply independent of the President's judgment and \nindependent, one would hope, of our own respective political parties.\n  I think ultimately, in the light of this debate, it is for the \nAmerican people to decide whether this nominee, or any of the \nPresident's nominees, meet the standards for those who will represent \nthis Nation in the highest public offices in the land.\n  I rise today to oppose the nomination of Judge Gonzales to be our \nNation's next Attorney General, and I cite, as have other colleagues, \nthe key role that he played in what is certainly one of the darkest \ndisclosures about this administration: Its secret decisions to \ndisregard the principles of the Geneva Convention for the humane \ntreatment of prisoners of war who Judge Gonzales and others \nconveniently renamed ``enemy combatants.''\n  This role and its consequences were described in graphic detail in a \nrecent Sunday New York Times review of a couple of books, including the \nInternational Commission of the Red Cross's documents regarding the \nabuse of prisoners in Iraq by American service men and women. I would \nlike to quote to some extent from the New York Times report because it \nexpresses both the severe consequences of the decisions that were made \nin which Judge Gonzales, unfortunately, played a key role as White \nHouse Counsel.\n  The reviewer cites part of the memorandum that the President approved \nthat was written by Judge Gonzales in that role which states:\n\n       As a matter of policy, the United States Armed Forces shall \n     continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent \n     appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a \n     manner consistent with the principles of Geneva.\n\n  The article reporter goes on to say:\n\n       Notice the qualifications. The president wants to stay not \n     within the letter of the law, but within its broad \n     principles, and in the last resort, ``military necessity'' \n     can overrule all of it. According to his legal counsel at the \n     time, Alberto R. Gonzales, the President's warmaking powers \n     gave him ultimate constitutional authority to ignore any \n     relevant laws in the conduct of the conflict. Sticking to the \n     Geneva Convention was the exclusive prerogative of one man, \n     George W. Bush; and he could, if he wished, make exceptions. \n     As Assistant Attorney General Jay S. Bybee argues in another \nmemo, ``Any effort to apply Section 2340A in a manner that interferes \nwith the President's direction of such core war matters as the \ndetention and interrogation of enemy combatants thus would be \nunconstitutional. (Section 2340A refers to the United States law that \nincorporates the international Convention Against Torture.)\n\n       Bybee asserted that the president was within his legal \n     rights to permit his military surrogates to inflict ``cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading'' treatment on prisoners without \n     violating strictures against torture. For an act of abuse to \n     be considered torture, the abuser must be inflicting pain \n     ``of such a high level intensity that the pain is difficult \n     for the subject to endure.'' If the abuser is doing this to \n     get information and not merely for sadistic enjoyment, then \n     ``even if the defendant knows that severe pain will result \n     from his actions,'' he's not guilty of torture. Threatening \n     to kill a prisoner is not torture; ``the threat must indicate \n     that the death is `imminent.' '' Beating prisoners is not \n     torture either. Bybee argues that a case of kicking an inmate \n     in the stomach with military boots while the prisoner is in a \n     kneeling position does not by itself rise to the level of \n     torture.\n       Bybee even suggests that full-fledged torture of inmates \n     might be legal because it could be construed as ``self-\n     defense,'' on the grounds that ``the threat of an impending \n     terrorist attack threatens the lives of hundreds if not \n     thousands of American citizens.'' By that reasoning, torture \n     could be justified almost anywhere on the battlefield of the \n     war on terror. Only the president's discretion forbade it. \n     These guidelines were formally repudiated by the \n     administration the week before Gonzales's appearance before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee for confirmation as attorney \n     general.\n       In this context, Secretary Rumsfeld's decision to take the \n     gloves off in Guantanamo for six weeks makes more sense. The \n     use of dogs to intimidate prisoners and the use of nudity for \n     humiliation were now allowed. Although abuse was specifically \n     employed in only two cases before Rumsfeld rescinded the \n     order, practical precedents had been set; and the broader \n     mixed message sent from the White House clearly reached \n     commanders in the field. Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, in \n     charge of the Iraq counterinsurgency, also sent out several \n     conflicting memos with regard to the treatment of prisoners--\n     memos that only added to the confusion as to what was \n     permitted and what wasn't. When the general in charge of \n     Guantanamo was sent to Abu Ghraib to help intelligence \n     gathering, the ``migration'' of techniques (the term used in \n     the Pentagon's Schlesinger Report) from those reserved for \n     extreme cases in the leadership of Al Qaeda to thousands of \n     Iraqi civilians, most of whom, according to the intelligence \n     sources, were innocent of any crime at all, was complete. \n     Again, there is no evidence of anyone at a high level \n     directly mandating torture or abuse, except in the two cases \n     at Gitmo. But there is growing evidence recently uncovered by \n     the ACLU . . . that authorities in the FBI and elsewhere were \n     aware of abuses and did little to prevent or stop them.\n\n  Then there were the vast loopholes placed in the White House torture \nmemos, the precedents at Guantanamo, the winks and nods from \nWashington, and the pressure of an Iraqi insurgency that few knew how \nto restrain. It was a combustible mix.\n  The article continues:\n\n       What's notable about the incidents of torture and abuse is \n     first, their common features, and second, their geographical \n     reach. No one has any reason to believe any longer that these \n     incidents were restricted to one prison near Baghdad. They \n     were everywhere from Guantanamo Bay to Afghanistan, Baghdad, \n     Basra, Ramadi and Tikrit and, for all we know, in any number \n     of hidden jails affecting ``ghost detainees'' kept from the \n     purview of the Red Cross.\n\n  I will might add that is in direct contradiction to what we have been \ntold, those of us like myself who sit on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, who have been told repeatedly by this administration's \nrepresentatives, and by military leaders, that these abuses were \nrestricted to one prison, Abu Ghraib, in Iraq. I commend Senator \nWarner, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who has done his \nutmost, by holding these hearings and pressing the military and \npressing the administration, to bring the full scope of what occurred \nthere to public light through those hearings. To have sat through all \nthose, as I have, and now hear that contradicted directly by the facts \nas they become known is greatly distressing and confirms my own \nunfortunately necessary judgment that this administration has not been \ncandid with this Congress or with the American people about the conduct \nof the war in Iraq in this and other very important respects.\n\n  Going back to the New York Times article, they, meaning the abuses of \nprisoners in Iraq:\n\n     were committed by the Marines, the Army, the Military Police, \n     Navy Seals, reservists, Special Forces and on and on. The use \n     of hooding was ubiquitous; the same goes for forced nudity, \n     sexual humiliation and brutal beatings; there are examples of \n     rape and electric shocks. Many of the abuses seem \n     specifically tailored to humiliate Arabs and Muslims, where \n     horror at being exposed in public is a deep cultural \n     artifact.\n       An e-mail message recovered by Danner from a captain in \n     military intelligence in August 2003. . . . In the message, \n     he asked for advice from other intelligence officers on which \n     illegal techniques work best: a ``wish list'' for \n     interrogators. Then he wrote: ``The gloves are coming off \n     gentlemen regarding these detainees, Col. Boltz has made it \n     clear that we want these individuals broken.''\n\n  The article continues:\n\n       How do you break these people? According to the I.C.R.C., \n     one prisoner ``alleged that he had been hooded and cuffed \n     with flexicuffs, threatened to be tortured and killed, \n     urinated on, kicked in the head, lower back and groin, force-\n     fed a baseball which was tied into the mouth using a scarf \n     and deprived of sleep for four consecutive days. \n     Interrogators would allegedly take turns ill-treating him. \n     When he said he would complain to the I.C.R.C. he was \n     allegedly beaten more. An I.C.R.C. medical examination \n     revealed hematoma in the lower back, blood in urine, sensory \n     loss in the right hand due to tight handcuffing with \n     flexicuffs, and a broken rib.''\n\n  That is only one of several incidents of that kind of horrible abuse \nthis article contains. It continues:\n\n       And the damage done was intensified by President Bush's \n     refusal to discipline those who helped make this happen. A \n     president who truly recognized the moral and strategic \n     calamity of this failure would have fired everyone \n     responsible. But the vice president's response to criticism \n     of the defense secretary in the wake of Abu Ghraib was to \n     say, ``Get off his back.'' In fact, those with real\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\n     responsibility for the disaster were rewarded. Rumsfeld was \n     kept on for the second term, while the man who warned against \n     ignoring the Geneva Conventions, Colin Powell, was seemingly \n     nudged out. The man who wrote a legal opinion maximizing the \n     kind of brutal treatment that the United States could legally \n     defend, Jay S. Bybee, was subsequently rewarded with a \n     nomination to a federal Court of Appeals. General Sanchez and \n     Gen. John P. Abizaid remain in their posts. Alberto R. \n     Gonzales, who wrote memos that validated the decision to \n     grant Geneva status to inmates solely at the president's \n     discretion, is now nominated to the highest law enforcement \n     job in the country: attorney general. The man who paved the \n     way for the torture of prisoners is to be entrusted with \n     safeguarding the civil rights of Americans. It is astonishing \n     he has been nominated, and even more astonishing that he will \n     almost certainly be confirmed.\n\n  I conclude my citation of that article. The abuses it describes are \nterrible, however limited in number they may be. Obviously almost all \nof our American service men and women serving so heroically in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and around the world were not involved in those abuses. In \nfact, they paid the price for them. They become the targets of \nrelatives and friends of those abuse victims who swear revenge. Our \ntroops are placed at greater risk if, God forbid, they are captured, \nbecause we cannot demand that their captors practice standards of \nhumane treatment which we do not practice ourselves.\n  But there is something that runs even deeper here and that is even \nmore dangerous to our democracy. It is Judge Gonzales's advice that \n``the President's warmaking powers gave him ultimate constitutional \nauthority to ignore any relevant law in the conduct of the conflict.''\n  This is, I suspect, only the tip of the iceberg. Early in the \nadministration's campaign, in the fall of 2002, to stampede Congress \nand scare the American people into the Iraq war, the White House stated \ntheir legal view that the President didn't actually need congressional \nauthorization to invade Iraq. Members of this body on the other side of \nthe aisle were instrumental in persuading him nevertheless to seek that \nauthority.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld's legal advisers have reportedly reinterpreted \nexisting law to permit him to set up his own CIA-type operations \nwithout informing Congress. They reinterpreted another law, purportedly \nto authorize military counterterrorist commando units to operate within \nthe United States. Who knows how many other laws this administration's \nlegal advisers have reinterpreted or decided that the President or \nothers can ignore entirely, reinterpret or ignore without informing \nCongress, without informing the American people?\n  The Attorney General of the United States is entrusted to uphold the \nlaws of this Nation and to apply them consistently and fairly to every \nAmerican citizen, whether he agrees with them, whether they are \nconvenient, whether the President or anyone else tells him otherwise. \nHe cannot reinterpret them or ignore them or instruct the President or \nanyone else that they can reinterpret or ignore them. Change them? Yes, \nthrough the public process prescribed by the Constitution, by our \nConstitution: by an act of Congress signed into law by the President \nhimself, reviewed if necessary by the judiciary. No exclusions and no \nexceptions, not for this President or any President; not for this \nadministration or any administration, whether Republican, Democrat, or \nanything else. There are no special circumstances. There is no election \nmandate for secretly ignoring or reinterpreting laws of this Nation, or \nacting contrary to the rule of those laws or in violation of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Unfortunately, there is tragic precedent in this country's proud \nhistory for the demise of administrations who deviated from the rule of \nlaw, who considered themselves above the law or beyond the law or \njustified in reinterpreting or ignoring the law. Their hubris did great \ndamage to themselves and they did great damage to our country.\n  They occurred more often than not during second terms, even after \nreceiving that most special of electoral mandates: reelection. What a \nprofound affirmation of the public trust, the most sacred political \ntrust we have in this country: reelection of the President of the \nUnited States of America.\n  For the next 4 years, this President is our President. He is my \nPresident. I pray that he succeeds. Where he succeeds, our country \nsucceeds. If he fulfills that sacred trust inferred upon him by the \nAmerican people, the faith of all Americans in their Government is \nfulfilled.\n  We can have policy disagreements here in the Senate, in the House of \nRepresentatives, and with the administration. This is what a great \nDemocratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle, called the ``noise of \ndemocracy.'' They were intended by this country's Founders, who \ndesigned our system of government to allow them, to address them, and \nresolve them, publicly, lawfully, and constitutionally. When those \nprinciples are followed publicly, lawfully and constitutionally, our \nNation is strengthened. When they are not, our Nation is almost always \nweakened, regardless of what those leaders intended at the time.\n  I respectfully urge this administration to stop reinterpreting and \nignoring existing laws and to stop ignoring and misleading Congress and \nthe American people and to nominate an Attorney General who will not \nadvise it, not hide it, and not condone it. That Attorney General I \nwill gladly vote to confirm; this nominee, I will not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am struck as a newly-elected Senator \nfrom the State of Oklahoma. I must say I am extremely disappointed that \nmy first opportunity to speak on the floor of this body is on the basis \nto refute the claims that are being made against a gentleman that I \nbelieve has already served our country miraculously and has been an \nexample in this country of what can happen from very humble beginnings \nif somebody applies hard work, great effort, and perseverance.\n  I am also struck by the claims that are made which don't have \nanything to do with history.\n  I was sitting here asking myself this question: Were President \nKennedy, President Johnson, and President Nixon responsible for My Lai, \nVietnam? Was it their policies that caused that to happen? The \natrocities that occurred during the Korean conflict, was that the fault \nof President Truman? The atrocities that occurred during World War II, \nwas that the fault of President Roosevelt? No.\n  And to make the reach and to make the claim that Alberto Gonzales, in \nhis role as adviser to the President, as a legal counsel, to do what is \nexpected of him in that position and to do that in a way that gives the \nPresident of the United States the advice, the knowledge, and the legal \nopinion of the Justice Department--not his opinion but the legal \nopinion of the Justice Department--that he somehow has disqualified \nhimself from the position of Attorney General.\n  I come to the floor today to make a statement in support of Alberto \nGonzales's nomination to be the Attorney General of the United States. \nI believe an injustice is being carried out against him, both \npersonally and professionally. Instead of looking at his \nqualifications, many have used him as a lightning rod for their \ncomplaints about the administration's handling of the war on terror. \nSpecifically, many blame him for the administration's policies on the \ntreatment of detainees and for its inquiries about the definition of \ntorture. I am reminded that the President stated in 2002 that we would \noffer humane treatment to all prisoners. I am also reminded of how \nimportant it was for him to have a definition of what that was \naccording to the Geneva Convention, but also according to our own law.\n  What have the President and Judge Gonzales done to deserve the \ncriticism they received? We saw Monday the results of Sunday's \nelections in Iraq.\n  The allegations against him are based on two sets of advice that were \ngiven to the administration by the Attorney General and Department of \nJustice.\n  First, the President made a decision based on the legal advice that \nhe received from the Attorney General and the Department of Justice \nthat certain detainees should not receive prisoner-of-war status while \nthey were held in U.S. custody.\n  Second, Judge Gonzales asked the Department of Justice Office of \nLegal Counsel under its statutory authority\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nto render legal opinions to determine the precise meaning of the U.S. \nanti-torture statute. The Department of Justice responded to this \nrequest August 1, 2002, and December 30, 2004.\n  I must say that torture is not a pleasant subject for us to discuss, \nbut one might ask why the President and his top lawyer needed a \nclarification on an issue as unsettling as torture. I believe it is \ngood to repeat the words of Senator Cornyn in his discussion. Why would \nwe not use every legal means which are appropriate to protect this \ncountry? Finding out the definition of appropriateness is well within \nthe purview of what Alberto Gonzales did.\n  It is remarkable how quickly we forget. Just 3 years, 4 months, and \n21 days ago, this Nation came under attack. We all watched helplessly \nas more than 3,000 of our fellow Americans were murdered, and nearly an \nequal number were severely injured in an assault that we had never seen \nbefore in this country.\n  As the horrors of September 11, 2001, unfolded before our eyes, we \nquickly realized that we were not under the attack of another country, \nwe were not assaulted by a nation that respects and obeys the laws of \nwar and international order. We were ripped from a world paradigm that \nwe understood, one where states follow rules while fighting each other, \nand thrust into a new world where a nonstate enemy infiltrates society \nand targets our citizens. Our enemy does not acknowledge that while at \nwar soldiers must wear uniforms, carry their weapons openly, obey a \nchain of command, and treat captives--especially civilian captives--\nhumanely. What they do is cut their heads off. They don't hide the \nfact.\n\n  The nightmare that began on September 11 has not ended. We watch \ndaily as our enemy attacks our soldiers who are risking their lives and \nlimbs to better the lives of the citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan and \ndrive out terrorist cells. Gone are days when our soldiers were able to \nface the enemy on the battlefields, eye-to-eye. Today, enemy combatants \nlaunch surprise attacks by hiding among civilians and behind the bodies \nof the wounded. Gone are the days when combatants understood how \nimportant it was to protect civilians from harm. Enemy combatants today \nbrutally and repeatedly behead innocent civilians.\n  As our leaders first faced the aftermath of September 11, a dark \nreality set in: Our enemy would not play by the rules that civilized \npeople and nations have developed over the course of history. Our \nleaders needed to understand exactly what our laws required and what we \nneeded to do to survive in this new world we faced. They needed to make \nstrong policy decisions based on our country's domestic laws and \ninternational obligations.\n  First, our leaders needed to understand who we were fighting. Under \ncustomary international law, civilians are not allowed to engage in \ncombat. Because soldiers are not supposed to target civilians in \nbattle, it is essential that civilians are distinguishable from \ncombatants. If civilians wish to be protected from harm, they must look \ndifferent than combatants; therefore, every person who wishes to engage \nin combat and if captured receive the protections accorded to prisoners \nof war by the Third Geneva Convention, they must fulfill four \nconditions: that of being commanded by a person responsible for his \nsubordinates; that of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a \ndistance; that of carrying arms openly; and that of conducting their \noperations in accordance with the laws and customs of war. We saw none \nof that.\n\n  If someone engaged in combat does not follow these rules, he or she \nis an illegal combatant. Illegal combatants have long been recognized \nby state practice in the law of war field. In Ex parte Quirin, the U.S. \nSupreme Court held that ``by universal agreement and practice the law \ndraws a distinction between the Armed Forces and the peaceful \npopulations of belligerent nations and also between those who are \nlawful and unlawful combatants.''\n  Furthermore, the state practice of the United States does not \nevidence any understanding of a customary international law norm \nextending the Geneva Convention and prisoner-of-war treatment to \ncombatants who commit terrorist acts. Instead, international law \nregards such individuals as illegal combatants who cannot claim the \nprotection of the laws of war that extend to legal combatants.\n  Only lawful combatants, members of fighting units who comply, again, \nwith the four conditions--being commanded by a person responsible for \nsubordinates; having a fixed distinctive sign, recognizable at a \ndistance; carrying arms openly; and conducting their operations in \naccordance with the laws and customs of war--are license to engage in \nmilitary hostilities. Only those who comply with these four conditions \nare entitled to the protections afforded to captured prisoners of war \nunder the laws and usages of war.\n  In fact, the denial of protected status under the laws of war has \nbeen recognized as an effective method of encouraging combatants to \ncomply.\n  As we hear those opine about what has gone on, I ask the American \npeople to think about it. Who are these people who are killing our \nsoldiers? Who are these people who are blowing people up? Who are they? \nThey meet none of the criterion for a legal combatant.\n  How has the President applied these principles to the War on Terror? \nIn the February 7, 2002, Order on the Humane Treatment of al-Qaida and \nTaliban Detainees, President Bush stated unequivocally that all \ndetainees are to be treated humanely, ``including those who are not \nlegally entitled to such treatment.'' Therefore, even though many of \nthe fighters our soldiers encounter are not entitled to prisoner-of-war \ntreatment, they are still being treated humanely.\n  Furthermore, the President has unequivocally stated the Third Geneva \nConvention applies to detainees captured in Iraq. Even those Iraqi \nprisoners who do not meet the four requirements to receive POW status \nare subject to an appearance before a Third Geneva Convention Article 5 \ntribunal to determine their status. Prior to that, they must receive \nPOW protection until their status is determined.\n  Second, while the President agrees with the Department of Justice \nthat he has the authority under the Constitution to suspend Geneva, as \nbetween the United States and Afghanistan, he has declined to do so and \nhas stated that the provisions of Geneva apply to our present conflict \nwith the Taliban. However, common Article 3 of Geneva, and article 4, \nPOW status, do not apply to the Taliban because they are unlawful \ncombatants.\n  Finally, none of the provisions of Geneva apply to the conflict with \nal-Qaida in Afghanistan or elsewhere. Al-Qaida detainees are not \nprisoners of war but are unlawful combatants.\n  Next, the administration officials acknowledge that there could be \ncircumstances where detainees hold information that could literally be \na matter of life or death for thousands or even millions of American \ncitizens. Judge Gonzales needed to understand what we are allowed to do \nunder the laws of our Nation to save the lives of our people. \nTherefore, Judge Gonzales sought the legal expertise of the Department \nof Justice--not his opinion, but the Department of Justice's opinion--\nto understand the definition and meaning of torture in the United \nStates anti-torture statute.\n  This request by Judge Gonzales did not in any way indicate the desire \nof the administration to use torture. It is a far reach to claim it. As \na matter of fact, it is absolutely untrue to claim it. In fact, the \nofficial position of the administration is that neither torture nor \ninhumane treatment are to be used against anyone by the United States \nregardless of whether they have prisoner-of-war status or not. Because \nthe administration's position is so strong, it was critical that the \nPresident and his advisers fully understand what constitutes torture so \nthat no lines would be crossed.\n\n  What does all this mean? Members of the Taliban and al-Qaida \ndetainees do not receive the luxuries afforded prisoners of war because \nthey are unlawful combatants. Iraqi fighters, even if they are \nterrorists, and most are, receive prisoner-of-war status until they \nreceive a hearing before an article 5 tribunal to determine their \nstatus. None of these detainees are to be tortured or otherwise treated \ninconsistently with U.S. constitutional principles.\n  It would have been irresponsible for Judge Gonzales to have not \nsought to understand the legal rights of enemy combatants and the law. \nHe had a duty\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nto the President and to the United States to understand these concepts \nand pass those on to the President in his private executive position as \nlegal counsel to the President.\n  We all went to sleep in a different world on September 11, 2001, very \ndifferent than the one we lived in the night before. Our leaders needed \nto understand our domestic and international obligations well to \nrespond to the new needs of our country. Alberto Gonzales should not be \nfaulted for doing his duty for his client, the President of the United \nStates. He is well qualified to serve as a U.S. Attorney General, and \nhe should be confirmed.\n  I also conclude by saying the following: In late November, I came to \nWashington to go through a process of orientation as a new Senator in \nthis body. The message I heard from the other side of the aisle is, We \nwant cooperation. We want bipartisanship. We do not want to politicize. \nThe opposite of that is happening at this very moment in this body. \nHere is a good man who has demonstrated tremendous ability through his \nlife. Everyone says he is well qualified. Everyone knows he will make a \ngreat Attorney General. The fact is, politics is getting in the way of \nhis confirmation.\n  I urge my fellow Members in this body to support and confirm him as \nthe next Attorney General of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nJudge Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney General of the United States. \nThe Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer for our \ncountry with tremendous legal powers. He or she is responsible for \nenforcing our laws and for making important decisions on how they will \nbe interpreted. The Attorney General can decide what person will be \ncharged with a crime or detained. This is a job that requires sound \nlegal judgment and impartiality because the Attorney General's duty is \nto uphold the Constitution and the rule of law.\n  But this job is not just about our laws; it is also about the ideals \nof our country. It is about what we stand for. It is about our freedom \nand liberty and justice as embodied in our Constitution. It is about \nrepresenting these fundamental types of democracy, not just to \nAmericans but to the world.\n  During the inauguration, we heard the wonderful words from President \nBush about the cause of freedom. I was pleased to hear him talk about \nour history as a country that has led the world in the cause of \nfreedom. These are the ideals that our children learn about every day. \nWe should be proud of our history. But our words must match our deeds.\n  I am deeply concerned not only about Mr. Gonzales's judgment, but \nthat his confirmation would send the wrong message to the world about \nthe value we place on our basic constitutional rights. Judge Gonzales \nhas played a prominent role in shaping this administration's policy on \ndetention and torture. Some of these policies have not only damaged our \ncountry's reputation and moral leadership, but they have also placed \nour troops in greater danger. Judge Gonzales holds legal positions that \nviolate treaties the United States has ratified and supported, and he \nhelped to provide the justification for the treatment of prisoners that \nled to the abuses at Abu Ghraib.\n  He also advocated and advised the President on legal positions that \ncircumvented the Geneva Conventions. In following Judge Gonzales's \nadvice to circumvent the Geneva Conventions, this administration \nclearly set the stage for the abuses at Abu Ghraib, the torture \nscandal, and this opinion ignored decades of U.S. support for humane \ntreatment of prisoners. Such a reckless disregard for human rights laws \nnot only violates international law but, again, it puts our own troops \nat additional peril.\n  The Convention Against Torture, which was ratified by the United \nStates in 1994, prohibited torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading \ntreatment. The Senate defined such treatment as abuse that would \nviolate the 5th, the 8th, or 14th amendment to our Constitution. This \nstandard was formally accepted by the Bush administration.\n\n  During Judge Gonzales's testimony it became clear that under his \nwatch the administration twisted this straightforward standard to make \nit possible for the CIA to subject detainees to practices such as \nsimulated drowning and mock execution. The standard he approved defined \ntorture as inflicting pain equivalent to ``serious physical injury, \nsuch as organ failure, impairment of bodily function or even death.''\n  In his testimony he told the committee that these constitutional \namendments do not apply to foreigners held abroad; therefore, in his \nview, the torture treaty does not bind intelligence interrogators \noperating on foreign soil.\n  Such a distortion is unacceptable and, again, is dangerous to our \ntroops who are serving us on foreign soil.\n  How can someone who has sought to find the loopholes in the law be \nentrusted to be the chief law enforcement officer of our land?\n  These attempts to circumvent the very laws he will be called upon to \nenforce not only show a reckless disregard for the law, put our troops \nin further danger, but they have damaged our position in the world. \nSince World War II, the United States has been a moral authority in the \nworld, an effective leader on the world stage. Such damage not only \ntarnishes our reputation in the world, but it negatively affects our \nvery ability to enlist our allies in the critical war on terror. How \ncan we hope to reclaim the moral leadership we once had with this \nperson as our chief law enforcement officer? What signal does this send \nto the world?\n  For more than 10 years, Judge Gonzales has served as President Bush's \nlegal counsel, but now he must represent a higher authority, the \nConstitution of the United States of America, and he must do so with \nintegrity and independence from his former long-term client.\n  The Attorney General of the United States cannot be a spokesperson \nfor the President. The Attorney General is the highest ranking law \nenforcement officer in the land. The Attorney General has \nresponsibilities for enforcing, interpreting, and creating the laws \nthat govern our democratic way of life in the United States. It is, \ntherefore, imperative that the person who holds this position be \nsomeone who has the confidence of the American people. Our laws must \ncome first. He or she must look not for the political rationale or the \nloophole but, rather, always seek the appropriate legal path, as guided \nby the U.S. Constitution. This is the people's attorney.\n  I was disturbed that during the confirmation hearings Judge Gonzales \nrestated his belief that the Commander in Chief can override--can \noverride--the laws of our country and immunize others to perform what \nwould otherwise be unlawful acts. This is wrong. No one person can \nstand above the laws that govern our Nation. The rule of law applies to \nevery one of us, including the President of the United States.\n  I had hoped that during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Judge Gonzales would have used the opportunity to address \nthese questions and concerns, and that he would have also used it as an \nopportunity to demonstrate an understanding that the Attorney General \ndoes not represent the President but, rather, the American people, the \nlaws of our Nation, and the Constitution of the United States.\n  I am troubled by the many questions that remain by his refusal to \nstate categorically that the President may not authorize the use of \ntorture in violation of U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions.\n  On Sunday, Iraqis took an important step toward democracy by holding \ntheir first free elections in decades. We applaud and celebrate with \nthem. Let's not take a step backwards now in America by confirming a \nnominee who does not represent the fundamental rights that the word \n``democracy'' represents.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of Judge Gonzales, \nPresident Bush's nominee to serve as our Nation's 80th Attorney \nGeneral. I want to address a few points that have been brought up today \nand discuss those a little bit. We will be able to vote on this nominee \nthis week. I think he is going to make an outstanding Attorney General. \nHe has been an outstanding lawyer in various capacities throughout his \nprofessional career already. He is going to continue to show that. I \nwant to articulate why that is going to be the case.\n  His background is well known. I serve on the Judiciary Committee. We \nhad lengthy hearings with Judge Gonzales. We had multiple rounds. \nEverybody on the committee got to ask and have answered every question \nthey asked. This is a nominee who has been through the question-and-\nanswer process on a lengthy basis. It is time we move forward. The \nPresident needs an Attorney General. This is the office that heads so \nmany of our functions that are very important in the war on terrorism, \nand we need to move forward with this.\n  It is well known to people who have been watching this debate. As the \nson of migrant workers from a family of seven children, the first to go \nto college, he is the epitome of the American dream. He has a law \ndegree from Harvard. He could have done anything, yet he chose a path \nof public service. And he is an extraordinarily good public servant--\nhumble, wise, has a tremendous ability to persevere through difficulty.\n  Through his work as chief counsel to the President, Judge Gonzales \nhas become seasoned in national security issues and legal challenges \nthat are essential to the job of Attorney General. He is unquestionably \nqualified for the position, and I have no doubt he will be confirmed by \nthe Senate this week and should be confirmed and should be given our \nstrong support.\n  I am deeply saddened by many distortions and unjustified criticisms \nof Judge Gonzales's nomination that he has had to go through and to \nface. Even if you disagree with the administration in the war on \nterror, Judge Gonzales should have been treated during the nomination \nprocess with a level of dignity and respect by this body in going \nthrough the discussion. One can say: I believe that this is a good \nnominee, that this is a good person, and they should look at those \ncriteria and those qualifications and not say: I am voting against him \nbecause I have a disagreement with the administration on a policy \nissue.\n  Undoubtedly, there are disagreements on policy issues. Undoubtedly, \nthere are a number of people who disagree with Judge Gonzales on how he \nwould view policy issues. But that is not the issue in the confirmation \nprocess. The issue is, is this person qualified to hold this job? Will \nhe do a good job? The President, in winning the election, does need to \nhave his people in key positions to be able to carry out policies that \nhe put forward, that the American public has passed on in the election \nprocess.\n  In the past few weeks, there are some who have done all they can to \nassociate Judge Gonzales with the word ``torture'' and the disturbing \npictures from Abu Ghraib because he offered a legal memorandum stating \nthat the Geneva Conventions do not apply to members of al-Qaida. These \nkinds of accusations are factually inaccurate and only serve to bring \ndown the reputation and morale of our Armed Forces who are serving \nhonorably and nobly in defense of this Nation. As we saw over this past \nweekend, there was an incredible vote by the Iraqi people that was so \nheartening to myself and to all of America because this is something we \nhave fought for, that our young men and women have died for, to give \nthem freedom. Now they have it, and they are expressing it.\n\n  Clearly, there are going to be problems ahead and difficulties, and \nit is not going to be anything close to a perfect democracy. Ours isn't \nyet, although we continue to aspire and are moving closer and closer \ntoward that end. They are going to have difficulties. Yet they have \nmade a step that would not have happened had our young men and women \nnot put their lives on the line and the President made bold decisions \nthat this body authorized to go to war to remove Saddam Hussein from \npower. Judge Gonzales has been part of the Bush team and the White \nHouse. He has done a good job there, and he will do an excellent job as \nAttorney General.\n  I wanted to take a few minutes to set the record straight on some key \nissues. Some have questioned Judge Gonzales's independence from the \nPresident. Judge Gonzales understands that his role as Attorney General \nof the United States will be very different from his role as counsel to \nthe President. He has made that quite clear in his confirmation \nhearing. He stated:\n\n       I do very much understand that there is a difference in the \n     position of Counsel to the President and [that of] Attorney \n     General of the United States. . . . As counsel to the \n     President, my primary focus is on providing counsel to the \n     White House and to White House staff and the President. I do \n     have a client who has an agenda, and part of my role as \n     counsel is to provide advice that the President can achieve \n     that agenda lawfully. It is a much different situation as \n     Attorney General, and I know that. My first allegiance is \n     going to be to the Constitution and to the laws of the United \n     States.\n\n  Upon confirmation, Judge Gonzales will be ready and able to take on \nthe independent responsibilities of the Attorney General. His service \nas a Texas Supreme Court justice proved his ability to be independent \nfrom then-Governor and now-President Bush. At his confirmation hearing, \nhe indicated he would be very sensitive to any perception that law \nenforcement was being politicized by the White House and would seek to \navoid such perceptions by ``talk[ing] to the career staff . . . to make \nthem understand that [he's] coming to th[e] department with a clear \nunderstanding of the distinct roles between the two jobs.\n  Remember, this is a gentleman who earlier in his professional career \nserved on the Texas Supreme Court, a Supreme Court of one of the States \nof United States. He understands a different position. He has been in \nan independent position. He understands these different roles and the \nplaces they serve in Government. And he understands how they work and \nhe will abide by them.\n  Also at his hearing he emphasized the ``very restrictive contacts \npolicy between the [Justice] Department and the White House, limiting \nwho from the White House can contact the Department of Justice,'' \nsaying that ``what we don't want to have is people from various \ndivisions within the White House calling the Department about an \nongoing investigation.''\n  He offered his commitment to ensure that the contacts policy is as \nstrong as it should be. He also offered his commitment to abide by that \npolicy. Judge Gonzales has stated his commitment to respecting and \nfostering the professionalism of the career employees of the Department \nof Justice. In response to written followup questions from the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Judge Gonzales said he would ``do everything in \n[his] power to reassure the career professionals at the Department and \nthe American people that [he] would not politicize the Department.''\n\n  There is a direct statement from Judge Gonzales of how he would \noperate.\n  Judge Gonzales emphatically endorsed the proposition that ``all \ngovernment lawyers should always provide an accurate and honest \nappraisal of the law, even if that will constrain the administration's \npursuit of desired policies.''\n  Again, that is another direct quote from Judge Gonzales in response \nto a question by a Member of the Senate.\n  Judge Gonzales also suggested in his response to the Senator from \nMassachusetts that his close personal relationship with the President \nwould make it easier for him to be honest and forthright with the \nPresident. So he has a personal relationship that he can build on as \nwell, but he understands the professional relationship. He is a lawyer, \nand he understands the role in which he would be serving.\n  I would like to make it clear that on the issue of the Geneva \nConventions, despite what you are hearing today, the United States is \ncommitted to complying with the governing law and treaty obligations in \nthe war on terrorism.\n  There have been some criticisms of Judge Gonzales regarding the \nGeneva Conventions. Some have claimed that\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nJudge Gonzales finds the Geneva Conventions to be an impediment, a \nhindrance to our present efforts, quaint and obsolete in important \nrespects. Others are claiming that the administration had refused to \napply the Geneva Conventions to the conflict in Afghanistan:\n\n       Afghanistan was the first time in which we said that it did \n     not apply to a conflict.\n\n  Senators have accused the administration of taking its obligations \nunder the Geneva Conventions lightly.\n  The administration has fully and faithfully adhered to its \nobligations under the Geneva Conventions. Judge Gonzales's critics meld \ntogether two different issues: First, whether the Geneva Conventions \napply to a particular armed conflict and, second, whether particular \nindividuals in that conflict are entitled to a particular protected \nstatus under one of the Geneva Conventions. The mere fact that the \nGeneva Conventions apply to a conflict between two nations does not \nmean that all persons involved in that conflict qualify for a \nparticular status, such as prisoner-of-war status, under the terms of \nthe conventions.\n  The administration and Judge Gonzales have been very clear in \nseparating the two issues. But as demonstrated in the claims made \nabove, Judge Gonzales's critics have sought to confuse the issue by \nmixing the two questions.\n  The administration did not determine that the Geneva Conventions did \nnot apply in enemy conflict in Afghanistan. Rather the President \ndetermined that the Geneva Conventions do, indeed, apply to the \nconflict in Afghanistan, but that neither al-Qaida terrorists nor \nTaliban fighters qualify for prisoner-of-war protections under the \nGeneva Conventions.\n  This obvious distinction is grounded in the very text of the Geneva \nConventions. This has been ignored by Judge Gonzales's critics. The \njudge explained the distinction quite clearly in his testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee. He stated this:\n\n       There was a decision by the President that Geneva would \n     apply with respect to our conflict with the Taliban. \n     However--and I believe there is little disagreement about \n     this as a legal matter--because of the way the Taliban fought \n     against the United States, they forfeited their right to \n     enjoy prisoner-of-war legal protections.\n\n  Judge Gonzales has repeatedly affirmed his respect for the Geneva \nConventions. He has worked to ensure that we protect Americans from the \nthreat of terrorism, while treating al-Qaida and Taliban detainees \nhumanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military \nnecessities, in keeping with the principles of the Geneva Conventions.\n  Judge Gonzales has also stated further at the hearing:\n\n       I consider the Geneva conventions neither obsolete nor \n     quaint.\n\n  In closing, we have an outstanding nominee in judge Gonzales. His \npersonal background is one of incredible accomplishments. His ability \nand his legal mind are excellent. His commitment to public service is \ntremendous. The faith that people have in him is there and is what we \nneed in a person who is Attorney General of the United States. We need \nto have a person there that people look up to and say this is a person \nwho will uphold the law, who is an upright individual, and will do all \nhe can to make this a better place. Judge Gonzales will do all of those \nthings and he will do it in a tremendous fashion.\n  I don't think this is a particularly helpful or good debate, where we \nquestion a person's ability to stand independent, or to do these other \nthings, when that person stated clearly he would and his past track \nrecord has shown that he will.\n  For those reasons, I hope we can move expeditiously through this \ndebate. Let people question his ability if they choose, but let's have \nthe vote and get Judge Gonzales approved to serving this country in \nthis important time and in this very important job.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in many ways, Judge Gonzales's life story is \nthe American dream--rising from humble beginnings to being nominated to \nbe our Attorney General. Yet, Judge Gonzales must be evaluated on more \nthan his life story; indeed, the decisions he has made in his public \ncapacity must be closely scrutinized. We are, after all, being asked to \nconfirm him as the Nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n  We begin with a standard of granting deference to the President to \nsurround himself with the people he chooses for his Cabinet. But that \ndeference is not absolute. The Attorney General is not the President's \nlawyer, but the people's lawyer. As I listened to the nominee's answers \nat his confirmation hearing, read his responses to our additional \nquestions, and examined the facts, I found that my deference was \nchallenged. Indeed, we are being asked to confirm the administration's \nchief architect of its legal policies in the war on terror--policies \nwith questionable legal support that have proven harmful to the conduct \nof the war and injured our reputation abroad.\n  We must expect more from our Attorney General. The war on terrorism \nhas proven more clearly now than ever before that the Justice \nDepartment's mission is too central to our democracy to be entrusted to \nsomeone who leaves us with such doubt. As the President's chief legal \nofficer in the White House, Judge Gonzales's advice sadly fell short \ntime and again. For these reasons, I must vote no.\n  A closer examination of the administration's legal policies \ndemonstrates why we have reached this conclusion. Over the strong \nobjections of Secretary of State Powell, career military lawyers, and \nothers with great expertise, Judge Gonzales advised the President to \ndeny prisoners the protections of the Geneva Conventions. Others warned \nJudge Gonzales that this advice could undermine military culture, \ngenerate confusion about how to treat detainees, and ultimately lead to \nabuse. We now know that their worst fears were warranted.\n  His role in shaping the policy on torture was similarly regrettable. \nThe ``torture memo'' that was drafted at Judge Gonzales's request stood \nas administration policy for 2 years. The Defense Department used the \nmemo's disturbing conclusions to justify abusive interrogation \ntechniques.\n  These policies have consequences. To defeat terrorism, the 9/11 \nCommission concluded that we must win the war of ideas in the Muslim \nworld. The importance of this recommendation cannot be emphasized \nenough. Undermining our fundamental commitment to due process, failing \nto honor our international agreements, and flouting our laws \nprohibiting torture and war crimes harms that effort.\n  Judge Gonzales's performance at the hearing did little to alleviate \nour concerns. We heard him condemn torture, generally, but refuse to \ndiscuss what he thought constituted torture. We heard him commit to \nhonor our international agreements but waffle when asked when they \napply. We heard him denounce the abuses that were committed in Iraq but \nrefuse to discuss whether they might be illegal. We heard him commit to \nhold anyone involved responsible for their actions but repeat \npredetermined conclusions about what happened and who was to blame.\n  When asked by members of the Judiciary Committee about his views on \nthese policies and his roll in shaping them, Judge Gonzales either \ncould not remember or was nonresponsive. When asked about whether he \nthought torture was ever productive, after more than 2 years of \nparticipating in discussions on the subject, he told the Committee, ``I \nhave no way of forming an opinion on that.'' He admits to attending \nmeetings where specific methods of torture were discussed but told the \ncommittee that he cannot recall anything that was said. His evasiveness \nwas not an encouraging preview or his ability to be candid with the \nAmerican people about the basis of the decisions he will be responsible \nfor making as our Attorney General.\n  This has not been an easy decision to reach. We hope that if Judge \nGonzales is confirmed, he will prove us wrong. For now, however, our \ndoubts are too great to support his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S732-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the important work \nof the Nathan Adelson Hospice in Las Vegas.\n  For more than 25 years, the Nathan Adelson Hospice has been the only \nnonprofit provider of hospice care in southern Nevada. When the Nathan \nAdelson Hospice was established in 1978, it was one of the first \nhospices in the country. Its mission is to provide dignified and \ncompassionate care for the terminally ill and their loved ones. In \nkeeping with this mission, no one is turned away from the Nathan \nAdelson Hospice due to lack of funds.\n  As great as it is, the Nathan Adelson Hospice is always trying to \nimprove the care it offers to patients. Last year, the hospice began \nconstruction on a 16-bed, inpatient facility in Henderson, NV. This \nfacility will provide respite services for families, pain and symptom \nmanagement for patients, and day care for adults in the community. It \nis a state-of-the-art facility, and I am pleased to say that I was able \nto secure funds to help with its construction.\n  Finally, my recognition of the Nathan Adelson Hospice would be \nincomplete without mentioning its efforts on behalf of minorities. \nStudies indicate that minorities and members of traditionally \nunderserved populations do not take advantage of hospice care as much \nas they should. In fact, while minorities make up almost 30 percent of \nthe U.S. population, they account for fewer than 20 percent of hospice \npatients nationwide. Some experts have suggested that inequities in \naccess to health care, cultural differences, and language barriers are \nresponsible for this situation.\n  No matter the reasons, it is clear that members of minority \ncommunities could benefit from greater access to hospice care. That is \nwhy I was so pleased to hear of the Nathan Adelson Hospice's new \nefforts to expand care to Nevada's underserved minority communities.\n  Last week, the Nathan Adelson Hospice hosted a multicultural luncheon \nand concert in an effort to connect with minority businesses that want \nto sponsor outreach and educational efforts for minority communities in \nLas Vegas. This event was a creative way to build business and \ncommunity partnerships while raising the profile of an important \nprogram.\n  I know you will join me in applauding the Nathan Adelson Hospice, and \nits efforts to increase minority participation in hospice care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S733-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DON WILSON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor the \nwork of my good friend, Don Wilson, who will be retiring after 22 years \nof service to the people of Nevada in the House of Representatives and \nthe United States Senate.\n  Don was born in Carl Junction, MO, in 1939. His father, like my own, \nwas a miner, and the search for work led the Wilson family to move \naround the West for much of Don's early years. The Wilsons spent time \nin Oklahoma, South Dakota, Idaho, New Mexico and Washington State and \nfinally settled in Henderson, NV in June 1952.\n  I first met Don at Basic High School in Henderson in 1957, and we \nquickly became friends. He and I both played on the football and \nbaseball teams together, but Don was the star. He set many records, \nsome of which stand to this day, and he led our high school teams to \nseveral championships. One year, he even batted over .500. With that \ntype of talent, it is hardly surprising that Don earned a full athletic \nscholarship at Arizona State University in Tempe, where he graduated \nwith a degree in marketing in 1961.\n  After graduation, Don worked for a few months for IBM Corporation. He \nwas drafted, however, in 1962 and served his country honorably for 2 \nyears in the Army. He worked in the Clark County Juvenile Justice \nSystem for over 15 years, trying to make a difference in the lives of \ntroubled young Nevadans. During his time at the Juvenile Court, he \nserved in various leadership positions, including director of the \nSpring Mountain Youth Camp.\n  Since then, Don has worked hard on behalf of Nevada on my staff--both \nin the House of Representatives and in the United States Senate. He \nfilled many roles in my office over the years--legislative assistant, \nbusiness manager, and currently deputy regional manager for my Las \nVegas office--but, first and foremost, he has remained my trusted \nfriend.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said, ``The better part of one's life consists \nof his friendships.'' Don Wilson has been my friend for the better part \nof my life, and I thank him for this friendship and look forward to our \ncontinued relationship in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S733-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNION LEAGUE CLUB OF CHICAGO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, last week I listened to the comments of my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Missouri, regarding the devastating \nimpact of the tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, which caused so much loss of \nlife and destruction of property. Senator Bond paid tribute to the \ncontributions of American relief agencies that have done so much to \nalleviate the suffering there, and I want to echo those comments.\n  He also expressed concern about what he called ``unintended \nconsequences'' of restrictions on our assistance to the Indonesian \nmilitary, otherwise known as the TNI. Specifically, he referred to the \nInternational Military Education and Training Program, and spare parts \nfor C-130 aircraft.\n  I want to respond to that portion of Senator Bond's remarks, to be \nsure there is no misunderstanding about what our law says.\n  To begin with, I want to disabuse those who might be misled by some \nIndonesian officials who often mistakenly refer to a U.S. military \n``embargo'' against Indonesia. I ask unanimous consent that a Defense \nDepartment document from our Embassy in Jakarta, which describes the \nmany programs and other contacts we currently have with the TNI, be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The fact is that the TNI participates in training programs \nunder both the expanded International Military Education and Training, \nE-IMET, program and the Counterterrorism Fellowship Program, CTFP. This \nis the largest CTFP program currently underway anywhere in the world. \nMillions of dollars have been appropriated for these programs in recent \nyears, including for the types of defense management, military justice, \ncivil military relations, and other courses that\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nthe Senator from Missouri and I support. The TNI is participating in \nthe E-IMET program which Congress has funded at the level requested by \nthe Bush administration.\n  Our law also does not prevent military exercises and other contacts \nwith the U.S. military through officer visits, educational exchanges, \nand port visits. Perhaps the most visible evidence of this is the U.S. \nmilitary working side by side with the TNI during the ongoing \nhumanitarian relief operations in Aceh.\n  With respect to training, U.S. law restricts only the full \nrestoration of regular IMET assistance until the Indonesian Government \nand the TNI ``are cooperating'' with the FBI's investigation into the \nAugust 31, 2002, murders of two American citizens and one Indonesian \ncitizen. By ``cooperating,'' we obviously mean not simply cooperating \nin limited ways, but fully cooperating. I am concerned with reports \nthat the TNI may have conspired with the shooters in that case, and \nthat the one Papuan individual who has been indicted, who is not a \nmember of the TNI, remains at large even though his whereabouts are \nreportedly known to the TNI.\n  With respect to equipment, our law does not restrict the sale of non-\nlethal equipment to the TNI. Specifically, with regard to spare parts \nfor the C-130's, there has been no change in U.S. law, although I am \ntold that there may have been a relaxation of this administration's \npolicy. Our law does not and never has prevented the sale of spare \nparts for these aircraft for humanitarian purposes. Over 4 years ago, \nwhen the TNI first requested to purchase C-130 spare parts for ``search \nand rescue'' missions, the U.S. Ambassador and I, as well as, I am \ntold, the Secretary of Defense, informed the Indonesians that this was \nnot prohibited by either U.S. law or policy and that they could \npurchase these parts from us. For reasons the Pentagon is aware of, the \nTNI decided to obtain them elsewhere.\n  The only conditions on the sale of lethal equipment are that the \nIndonesian Government is prosecuting and punishing members of the TNI \nfor gross violations of human rights, and that the TNI is (1) taking \nsteps to counter international terrorism consistent with democratic \nprinciples and the rule of law; (2) cooperating with civilian judicial \nauthorities and with international efforts to resolve cases of gross \nviolations of human rights; and (3) implementing financial reforms to \ndeter corruption.\n  There are good reasons for these limited conditions. The United \nStates has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in training and \nequipment to the Indonesian military since the 1950s. Despite the close \nrelationship that developed between the U.S. military and the TNI over \nfour decades, the TNI acquired a reputation for being notoriously \nabusive and corrupt. After the TNI murdered some 200 civilians in a \ncemetery in Dili, East Timor in 1992, our IMET assistance was cut off. \nOur relations with the TNI were further curtailed in 1999, after the \nindependence referendum in East Timor when the TNI orchestrated \nwidespread killings and the destruction of property. Although senior \nTNI officers have repeatedly vowed to support reform, they have done \nnext to nothing to hold their members accountable for these heinous \ncrimes. Instead, the TNI has consistently obstructed justice.\n  I should note that these conditions do not apply to the Indonesian \nnavy. Congress specifically exempted the navy because enhancing \nmaritime security is a critical priority.\n  There are also credible reports that after 9/11, the TNI provided \nsupport to radical Indonesian groups that have been involved in \nterrorism.\n  Since 1999, restrictions on our relations with the TNI have been \nnarrowed, and today, as I mentioned, we have a wide range of military-\nto-military activities.\n  I am disappointed that some Pentagon officials and my friend from \nMissouri, rather than acknowledging the extent of the United States-\nIndonesia military relationship and urging the TNI to demonstrate that \nit is serious about reform by meeting these reasonable conditions, have \nexpressed support for weakening our law.\n  Indonesia's new President Yudhoyono is a career military officer. He \nhas a reputation as a reformer, and I wish him well. I have always \nsupported substantial economic assistance to Indonesia. In fact, \nSenator McConnell, the Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, \nand I have worked to increase this assistance.\n  Prior to President Yudhoyono's election, there were some important \nreforms which reduced the TNI's influence in politics. But a key gap \nremains regarding justice for the victims of atrocities, including \ncrimes against humanity. This is the focus of our law, and it is as \nimportant to Indonesia and the TNI as it is for the United States. I \nbelieve that President Yudhoyono should agree and want the TNI to make \nthese necessary reforms.\n  I applaud the U.S. military and the TNI for working together to bring \naid to tsunami victims in Aceh. But just as our policy should promote \ncooperation in humanitarian operations and in counterterrorism, so \nshould it promote respect for human rights, accountability, and the \nrule of law. These are fundamental to the freedom and democracy that \nPresident Bush spoke of in his inaugural address. Our law, which was \nnarrowly written to provide an incentive for reform while allowing \nmilitary contacts to continue, strikes the right balance.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                              IMET/E-IMET\n\n       (Allocated FY 04 $599,000; Requested for FY 05 $600,000.)\n       The International Military Education and Training (IMET) \n     program continues to be restricted for Indonesia.

Mr. President, I rise to share some observations on my \nrecent\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\ntrade mission to Australia and New Zealand.\n  In May 2004, the United States and Australia signed a historic free-\ntrade agreement. That agreement went into force on January 1, 2005, \nlowering trade barriers and opening new markets for goods, services, \nand agriculture.\n  This agreement opens the door to a greater relationship with one of \nthe most vibrant and promising economies in the world.\n  For Australia, it offers integration with the world's largest \neconomic power. For the United States, it offers a link to an \nAustralian market that has one of the highest standards of living in \nthe world--and one of the few large economies with whom the U.S. enjoys \na trade surplus.\n  Further benefits will accrue to U.S. exporters from using Australia \nas a platform for more efficient access to Asian markets.\n  Australia has for years pursued a strong policy of economic \nengagement in the Asia-Pacific region. It has completed, or is \ncurrently negotiating, trade agreements with several key countries in \nthe region. This network of trade relationships will increase the value \nof the free trade agreement to U.S. exporters and investors in \nAustralia.\n  The free-trade agreement further cements the relationship between the \nUnited States and one of its strongest allies in the world. Australia \nis a major partner with the U.S. in global antiterrorism efforts. It is \na significant partner in Iraq.\n  It is also one of our most important partners within the WTO. As a \nleader of the Cairns Group, a loose association of major agriculture \nexporting countries, Australia has been a reliable ally in our fight \nfor reform of global agriculture markets.\n  I believe in economic engagement and in trade. Reducing barriers and \nopening markets creates opportunities and jobs. It helps spread the \nvalues of democracy and international cooperation.\n  But the benefits of trade do not come without challenges. In the case \nof Australia, it is our agriculture sector that was initially concerned \nabout the challenges a free trade agreement might pose. This is \nparticularly true in Montana, where agriculture makes up about one half \nof the State's economy.\n  That is why I worked hard to make sure the United States-Australia \nFree-Trade Agreement was a good deal for the United States and a good \ndeal for Montana. By working with negotiators from both Governments, I \nwas able to include strong provisions that leveled the playing field \nfor Montana's agriculture industry in the deal, while also assuring \nMontana's businesses access to tremendous new market opportunities.\n  With a strong deal in place, it was a good time to see for myself \nwhat new opportunities are available in Australia and to start making \nthe free-trade agreement work for Montana.\n  Joining me were a group of nine Montana business and agriculture \nleaders--representing the full range of our State's economy, including \nmanufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and services. They were: Montana \nChamber of Commerce president Webb Brown, from Helena; Greg Dumontier \nof St. Ignatius, general manager of S & K Technologies; David Cameron \nof Bozeman, a rancher and retired biologist with Montana State \nUniversity; Steve Holland, director of the Montana Manufacturing \nExtension Center in Bozeman; Fraser McLeay, senior manager with the \nMontana World Trade Center in Missoula; Lillian Ostendorf of \nPowderville, State Women's Committee chair with the Montana Farm \nBureau; Mike Overstreet of Billings, chairman of the board and vice \npresident of international relations for Corporate Air; Jeff Ruffner of \nButte, senior vice president and general manager with MSE Technology \nApplications; and Kathy Brown, property manager with Project Management \nin Helena.\n  Also joining the delegation were several representatives of some of \nour largest national companies with operations in Australia and the \nAsia-Pacific region. They were: David Beier, senior vice president for \nglobal government affairs for Amgen, Inc.; Lionel Johnson, vice \npresident and director, International Government Affairs, for \nCitigroup, Inc.; Thomas Quinn, partner with the law firm Venable, \nrepresenting U.S. Tobacco; and Elizabeth Schwartz, vice president for \nlegislative affairs for the Boeing Company.\n  The goal of our trade delegation was to meet with business and \ngovernment leaders, build relationships, find opportunities, and \ndiscuss solutions to common challenges. We met with great success.\n  A highlight of the visit was a meeting of the entire delegation with \nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard at Parliament House in Canberra.\n  I was very pleased to have the opportunity to personally thank Prime \nMinister Howard for working with me to address Montana's interests in \nthe free-trade agreement. We also explored ways Australia and the \nUnited States can work together to advance our mutual interests in the \nWorld Trade Organization, the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum, and the \nAsia-Pacific region.\n  In Sydney, members of the delegation were able to benefit from the \nexperience of AmCham members doing business in Australia and of the \nU.S. Commercial Service. Many participated in individual business \nmeetings with counterparts or potential customers in Sydney, Melbourne, \nand Brisbane.\n  Our thanks go out to the U.S. Embassy and Consulate staffs in \nCanberra, Sydney, and Melbourne for all their hard work making this \nsuch a productive and meaningful trip for me and for each member of the \ndelegation. I particularly want to thank U.S. Ambassador to Australia \nJ. Thomas Schieffer for his hospitality and assistance.\n  I also thank Australian Ambassador to the United States Michael \nThawley and his staff in Washington for all their help in making the \ntrip such a success.\n  During the negotiations of the United States-Australia Free-Trade \nAgreement, Ambassador Thawley and Adam McCarthy from his staff made \nseveral trips to Montana. They met with our state officials, business \nand agriculture groups, and were able to contribute to their own \nnegotiators' sensitivity to Montana's goals in the negotiations. The \nresults were, I believe, in the best interests of both Montana and \nAustralia.\n  I am excited about future prospects for trade and cooperation with \nAustralia. Australia is a large market for American manufactured goods \nand services and promises to become an even larger one. For example, \nAustralia is fast becoming a major market for Montana's growing high \ntech and services industries, including medial products, environmental \nconsulting, and engineering.\n  In addition, from Montana's perspective, one of the most important \naspects of the new trade agreement goes beyond its market access \nprovisions: it is Australia's commitment to support the United States \nin its efforts to negotiate disciplines on state trading enterprises in \nthe WTO Doha Round.\n  State trading enterprises like the Canadian Wheat Board and the \nAustralian Wheat Board give agricultural producers in those countries \nunfair advantages when competing with our world class Montana \nagricultural products in global markets.\n  I also used the visit as an opportunity to promote cooperation \nbetween Australia and the United States on a broader range of \nmultilateral and regional trade and economic issues.\n  Australia and the United States have a mutual interest in promoting a \nbroad vision of Asia-Pacific economic integration. We are both Pacific \npowers, but not Asian.\n  If we neglect our ties with Asia, we risk a narrow Asian economic \nintegration that deprives our businesses of the most preferential \naccess to these growing markets. I challenged the Government and the \nprivate sector in Australia to be our partners in broadening that \nvision.\n  Our trade efforts also led us to New Zealand. While not as big a \ncountry as Australia, New Zealand is an important trading partner for \nthe United States. In 2003, merchandise trade between the two countries \nexceeded $4 billion. There was an additional $2 billion in trade in the \nservice sector.\n  Exports of Montana products to New Zealand increased more than \nsevenfold over the last 5 years. Equally important to Montana, New \nZealand kept a cool head and did not overreact to the recent BSE scare \nwith a ban on U.S. beef--a major product in my State and critical to \nour economy.\n  More importantly, New Zealand is a vital piece in the Asian puzzle. \nJust as\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\nwith our relationship with Australia, an enhanced commercial \nrelationship between the United States and New Zealand would offer yet \nanother platform for increased exports to the growing markets in places \nlike China, Thailand, Taiwan, and Malaysia.\n  That is why I have long been an advocate for closer economic ties \nbetween our countries. In fact, back in 2001, I introduced legislation \nto authorize fast-track consideration of a free-trade agreement with \nNew Zealand.\n  The New Zealand Government has been actively pursuing a free-trade \nagreement with the United States for several years. Up until recently, \nthey have been rebuffed by the Bush Administration for reasons having \nnothing to do with the potential economic merits of such an agreement.\n  I disagree with that approach. I believe that trade agreements should \nbe pursued or not pursued primarily on the basis of their economic \nmerit.\n  I thought it was time to allow the Government of New Zealand to make \nits case. And so I brought my trade delegation to New Zealand to meet \nwith Government officials and business representatives, to explore \nmarket opportunities, and to build new relationships.\n  As in Australia, a highlight of the visit was my meeting with New \nZealand Prime Minister Helen Clark. Prime Minister Clark and I \ndiscussed prospects for a bilateral free-trade agreement and also \nexchanged views on how the United States and New Zealand can cooperate \non regional and multilateral trade issues.\n  I told the Prime Minister that I think a free-trade agreement between \nthe United States and New Zealand makes sense--so long as it is the \nright agreement. And the Australia Free-Trade Agreement--with its \nstrong protections for Montana agriculture--is the right model to \nfollow.\n  Australia and New Zealand share a common market. For that reason, it \nwould have made sense to include New Zealand in the United States-\nAustralia Free-Trade Agreement in the first place.\n  The Administration settled for 80 percent of the Australia-New \nZealand market, when it could have had 100 percent. But that is in the \npast, and Prime Minister Clark and I agreed that we need to look \nforward.\n  During my visit, I was also privileged to meet, along with members of \nmy delegation, with New Zealand's Minister of Agriculture and Trade \nNegotiations Jim Sutton and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil \nGoff. I appreciate the useful and wide-ranging discussions that we \nshared.\n  In New Zealand, the trade delegation was able to visit several \ncutting-edge agricultural facilities, including a revolutionary robotic \nmilking station, an advanced agricultural research station, and an \nagricultural technology incubator. Many of the Montanans who \nparticipated in the trip have gone home with new ideas that will help \nthem both emulate and compete with their New Zealand counterparts.\n  My sincere thanks go out to our hosts, the Government of New Zealand, \nfor their great hospitality. I also thank the U.S. Embassy and \nConsulate staffs in Wellington and Auckland for all their hard work \nputting together a fantastic schedule for a whirlwind 2-day visit. I \nparticularly want to thank U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand Charles \nSwindells for his advice and assistance.\n  Finally, I thank New Zealand Ambassador to the United States John \nWood as well as Ian Hill and Janette Malcolm from the New Zealand \nEmbassy in Washington for all their help in making the trip such a \nsuccess.\n  After all the government meetings, tours of agricultural facilities, \nand discussions with business groups, I came away believing that the \nright free-trade agreement with New Zealand makes sense for the United \nStates and makes sense for Montana.\n  Like Australia, New Zealand is a strong market for American \nmanufactured goods and services. Like Australia, New Zealand can serve \nas a launching pad for reaching Asian markets. And New Zealand is a \ndeveloped country with a strong legal system, which sets the stage for \na high-standards agreement.\n  You may not guess this, but from Montana's standpoint, New Zealand is \na more important market, relatively speaking, than it is for the United \nStates as a whole. While New Zealand is the United States' 49th largest \ntrading partner, it is one of Montana's top 25 export markets--not far \nbehind Malaysia, and more important than Thailand or the Philippines.\n  That doesn't mean it would be easy. I know that negotiating a free-\ntrade agreement with New Zealand would raise sensitive issues for \nMontana's farmers and ranchers, several of whom joined me on the trip. \nBut I also know that facing difficult trade issues pays off in the end.\n  That is because--in the end--trade means jobs.\n  There are tremendous opportunities in the Australia and New Zealand \nmarkets awaiting those Americans intrepid enough to seek them out. \nIncreased trade will generate jobs and good-paying ones at that.\n  I want Montana to participate in and benefit from an enhanced trading \nrelationship with these countries.\n  Yet, in a more general sense, these enhanced relationships are about \nopenness.\n  While historians like to talk about the past 100 years as the \n``American Century,'' Americans are anxious about the challenges facing \nour country. We wonder whether our children and grandchildren will \nenjoy the same standard of living we have known.\n  Faced with this uncertainty, some Americans look at the Pacific Rim \nand see danger. They see the rise of China's and Asia's economic \nprowess as a threat to American prosperity.\n  But we have never been a nation that succeeds only by the economic \nfailure of others.\n  We used the Marshall Plan to help pull Europe out of economic \ndistress--and have benefited enormously. We believed that capitalism \nwould win the Cold War--and it did.\n  Now China, Vietnam, Russia, and others are beginning the transition \nto a free market economy. This is a positive development--not one to \nfear.\n  To me, the challenge is elementally about whether we will meet the \nfuture with open minds and open arms, or whether we will turn inward \nand seek shelter from the inevitable storms that change always brings.\n  America has never shied away from engagement with the rest of the \nworld. We have been successful because we are confident, innovative, \npositive, and open. We can only lose our place in the world if we \nforget who we are and forget how we got here in the first place.\n  That is why I will continue to work for an open trade policy. It is \nwhy I will continue to fight hard for Montana's place in the world.\n  It is also why I think it is so important to take these trade \nmissions abroad. In the past couple of years, I have led missions to \nCuba, Japan, China, and Thailand. This time, we went to Australia and \nNew Zealand.\n  Every trip has brought success. Each trip has opened doors for \nMontana business. And discovering the potential in any market or \nrelationship ultimately is what makes trade work for Montana, as well \nas for the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S737-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S737-S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONSERVANCY OF SOUTHWEST FLORIDA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nthe Conservancy of Southwest Florida for its 40th year of service in \nprotecting the environment of my great State. In 1964, citizens joined \ntogether to save Rookery Bay from over-development, and since that day \nthe conservancy and its many supporters have worked to preserve the \nbreathtaking natural habitat and the quality of life in southwest \nFlorida.\n  The Conservancy of Southwest Florida has created so many wonderful \ninstitutions that all Floridians, young and old can enjoy. This \nincludes the Conservancy Nature Center, which allows kids and adults \nalike to work hands-on to learn about the ecosystem and the varied \nwildlife that inhabits the area. Whether it is testing water quality, \nacquiring at-risk lands or rehabilitating nearly 2000 animals a year, \nthe conservancy makes Florida a better place to live.\n  Throughout my years in public service, the conservancy has been an \nally and a friend in the work of preserving Florida's natural \nresources. I hope that for the next 40 years and beyond, this wonderful \norganization will continue\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\nto help Florida and its citizens enjoy the beauty the state has been \nblessed with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S738-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONFIRMATION OF SAMUEL BODMAN AS SECRETARY OF ENERGY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nSenate's confirmation of Dr. Samuel Bodman as our new Secretary of \nEnergy.\n  I believe Dr. Bodman will bring considerable skill to the position of \nSecretary of Energy. Dr. Bodman's distinguished career speaks for \nitself. In the private sector, he excelled as a professor at MIT, \npresident of an investment company, and chairman and CEO of a worldwide \nindustrial company. In these positions, he gained a great deal of \nknowledge in financial markets and the impact energy and technology has \non those markets. He further proved his capabilities in his service as \nDeputy Secretary of Commerce and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. \nThere is no question that Dr. Bodman is qualified to assume this \nimportant position.\n  As a Nation, we are far too dependent on foreign sources of energy \nand must work to increase our energy independence. While I support \ndomestic oil production, I also believe that we must continue to \ndevelop alternative sources of energy in the United States. In my home \nState, Utah State University is working with the Department of Energy \nto that end. I was pleased that the Department of Energy recently \nawarded Utah State University a grant to further the university's \nstudies into alternative energy research and development programs. Such \nprograms are essential to ensure we can meet our Nation's future energy \nneeds, and I admire the university for being at the forefront on this \nissue.\n  I have a great deal of respect for Dr. Bodman, and I look forward to \nworking with him on the compelling energy issues facing our Nation. \nWhile there will certainly be challenges to overcome as we work to \nshape our energy policy and increase our energy independence, I am \nconfident that Dr. Bodman will serve admirably in the position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S738-2", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to again be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Collins' Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act. \nThis important legislation will coordinate and simplify the often \ncomplicated and confusing homeland security grant process. This bill \nwill make it much easier for local first responders to get funding by \nreducing the many, and often redundant, grant applications steps. The \namendment also gives local officials far more flexibility in spending \nhomeland security dollars, including paying for overtime costs \nassociated with homeland security tasks and training. Successful \nprograms, such as FIRE Act grants, the COPS program, and the Emergency \nManagement Performance Grant program, are protected in this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation also tackles the controversial topic of how to \nallocate funding. I believe it has struck a fair balance by both \nallocating funding based on threat, as recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission and others, and maintaining baseline funding so that States \nand local officials can have a predictable stream of funding to meet \nthe homeland security needs faced by all jurisdictions. As Senator \nCollins noted, the support this bill has gotten from Senators from both \nlarge and small States is indicative of the balanced approach taken by \nthis legislation.\n  The Senate adopted this measure by voice vote in the last Congress as \nan amendment to the intelligence reform bill and it is my hope that the \nSenate will soon take up and pass this important bill. Simplifying and \nrationalizing the current homeland security grant system should be a \ntop priority. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to \nadequately allocate resources to meet our homeland security needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S738-3", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WARNER, from the Committee on Armed Services, \n     without amendment:\n       S.

A bill to extend the period for COBRA coverage for victims of \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the greatest domestic challenges \nfacing our country today is the soaring cost of health care. It's a \nserious problem for millions of families. But when the chief income \nearner in a family suddenly becomes unemployed, the problem can be \ncritical, and we give a helping hand. We give them the opportunity to \ncontinue their coverage through their employer for a reasonable period. \nFamilies who lost loved ones on September 11 deserve the same \nopportunity until they can land on their feet again.\n  The Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act I am introducing \ntoday in the Senate with Senator Corzine and Senator Lautenberg, and \nCongressman Markey is introducing today in the House of \nRepresentatives, recognizes that many of the September 11 families are \nstill struggling to recover and we have an obligation to assist them.\n  Some of the families have found ways to cover their health costs by \npurchasing private insurance or obtaining grant assistance on their \nown. For others, employers have agreed to provide coverage. For still \nother families, however, the safety net has fallen apart, because their \ncoverage has expired under COBRA--the temporary low-cost continuation \nof coverage available under current Federal law for those who change \ntheir job, lose their job or for families that lose their chief income \nearner through death.\n  The Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act will give spouses and \nchildren of victims of September 11 the ability to purchase or continue \nto purchase coverage under COBRA indefinitely, as long as they enroll \nwithin 120 days after passage of the Act or 120 days after they lose \ntheir COBRA coverage. Eligibility for the program would expire only if \nthey become eligible for Medicare.\n  The families of September 11 have shown great courage and \nextraordinary resilience. But we still have much more to do to help \nthem on their long and arduous road to recovery, and I hope very much \nthat we can pass this legislation this year. It will only affect a \nsmall number of families. But for them, it will make a world of a \ndifference.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 225. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a \nprogram\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\nto reduce the risks from and mitigate the effects of avalanches on \nrecreational users of public land; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I introduce, with Senators Inouye \nand Murkowski, the Federal Land Recreational Visitor Protection Act of \n2005.\n  Across our State of Alaska, Western States, and areas of the \nNortheast, local governments and businesses struggle each year to \nremove potential avalanches or recover from the disastrous effects of \navalanches.\n  While such damage can bring hardships to many local communities, none \ncan compare with the loss of a friend or family member. The U.S. \naverages over 20 deaths a year from avalanches, a majority of which are \nresults of recreational activities in unmitigated avalanche areas. \nEarlier in January, 3 people were killed in two separate avalanches in \nnorthern Idaho and Utah, bringing the total number of people already \nkilled in the U.S. this winter season to 16.\n  Some States try and set aside money for rescues prior to the winter \nseason, knowing that the resources required to clear all avalanche \nthreats are not at hand.\n  This bill brings those resources to the entities that need them the \nmost, enabling us to significantly reduce the effects of avalanches on \nvisitors, recreational users, transportation corridors, and our local \ncommunities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 226. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nimmunization rates by increasing the supply of vaccines; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from \nNew York, Senator Clinton, to introduce the Improved Vaccine Supply \nAct--a bill that would help ensure that our Nation's public health \nsystem has an adequate vaccine supply.\n  We all know that vaccinations are critical in our efforts to keep our \npopulation, particularly children and the elderly, healthy. They are \nkey to protecting the elderly from influenza during flu season and \nprotecting children from contracting polio or the mumps. Vaccinations, \ninoculations, immunizations--whatever you want to call them--also help \nlessen the threat of bacterial or viral infections and potential \ndisease outbreaks.\n  Currently, it is recommended that children receive 12 routine \nvaccinations against preventable diseases. These vaccinations are given \nin a series of shots and booster shots by the age of two, with an \nadditional four doses later in life. This ends up being about 16 to 20 \ndoses of vaccines for children.\n  Any shortage of vaccines is not acceptable, and we should do all we \ncan to prevent any future shortage. As a Senator, and more importantly, \nas a parent of eight and grandparent of eight, I believe that nothing \nis more important than the health and safety of our children. While we \nare not currently experiencing a shortage, we know that the vaccine \nmarket is unstable and unpredictable. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control's National Immunization Program, there were several \nreasons for the shortages in past years. The CDC concluded and posted \non its website that the ``reasons for these shortages were multi-\nfactorial and included companies leaving the vaccine market, \nmanufacturing or production problems, and insufficient stockpiles.''\n  The CDC did as good a job as it could, considering the vaccine \nshortages our Nation has faced in past years. The agency's website has \nposted information about shortages and released revised vaccine \nschedules to keep our public informed and knowledgeable about \nvaccination shortages. But, even with the strong efforts of the CDC, we \nneed to work toward preventing a future vaccine shortage. We need a \nmore permanent solution. The bill I am introducing will go a long way \ntoward doing just that.\n  The bill we are introducing today--the Improved Vaccine Supply Act--\nwould help bring some stability to our fragile vaccine supply. Unlike \ndrug manufacturers, vaccine manufacturers do not have to give notice \nwhen they stop making a vaccine, whether the vaccine is withdrawn from \nthe market intentionally or because the manufacturer is simply unable \nto continue making the vaccine. Essentially, these manufacturers leave \nthe marketplace with no notice and no warning. Most doctors and \nhospitals--and more importantly parents and older adults--often have no \nidea that a vaccine is in short supply until they line up for a flu \nshot or go to the doctor for their child's immunizations.\n  Our bill would change this. It would require any manufacturer of a \nvaccine to give a one-year notice of discontinuance. By giving notice, \nthe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) would be better able to ensure an adequate vaccine \nsupply for our Nation's population. Additionally, our bill would \nrequire all drug and vaccine manufacturers to give notice when they \nwithdraw from the market. This change would ensure that we have a \nbetter sense of who is making vaccines and drugs and would allow the \nCDC and FDA to monitor the manufacturer's production and release of \nvaccines.\n  Let me explain why this is important. Vaccines, or biological \nproducts, are difficult to develop and manufacture. They are more \ncomplex than drugs. Because of this, it takes longer for a biological \nproduct to reach the market. For example, a pharmaceutical company that \nmanufactured tetanus vaccine stopped producing it, leaving only one \ncompany to produce tetanus vaccine for the entire country. The \nremaining company increased production to accommodate all of the needs \nof the United States. Despite this, it still required about 11 months \nfor the vaccine to be ready for release. In other words, it took 11 \nmonths for the company to ramp-up production to meet demand. Our bill \nwould create a notification mechanism to capture those drugs and \nvaccines leaving the market so we can avoid future vaccine and drug \nshortages.\n  Our bill also would require the Secretary, acting through the CDC, to \ndevelop a plan for the purchase, storage, and rotation of a supply of \nvaccines sufficient to provide routinely recommended vaccinations for a \nsix-month period for children and adults. Essentially, it would create \na framework for the CDC to develop a national vaccine stockpile to \nensure that childhood vaccine shortages simply do not occur.\n  Our children need and deserve timely vaccinations. When childhood \nvaccinations are in short supply or are unavailable, they do without, \nliving unprotected against disease. That should never happen. The bill \nwe are introducing today is another step toward ensuring that children \nget the vaccines they need and that they get them at the right time. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in support of this important public \nhealth legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clear title to certain real property in New Mexico \nassociated with the Middle Rio Grande Project, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nAlbuquerque Biological Park Title Clarification Act with my colleague \nSenator Domenici. This bill, which passed the Senate in the 108th \nCongress, is necessary to assist the City of Albuquerque, NM clear \ntitle to two parcels of land located along the Rio Grande. If title is \ncleared, the City will be able to move forward with its plans to \nimprove the properties as part of a Biological Park Project, a city \nfunded initiative to create a premier environmental educational center \nfor its citizens, and the entire State of New Mexico.\n  The Biological Park Project has been in the works since 1987 when the \nCity began to develop an aquarium and botanic garden along the banks of \nthe Rio Grande. Those facilities constitute just a portion of the \noverall project. As part of this effort, in 1997, the City purchased \ntwo properties from the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD) \nfor $3,875,000. The first property, Tingley Beach, had been leased by \nthe City from MRGCD since 1931 and used for public park purposes. The \nsecond property, San Gabriel Park, had been leased by the City since \n1963, and also used for public park purposes.\n  In the year 2000, the City's plans were interrupted when the U.S. \nBureau of Reclamation asserted that in 1953, it had acquired ownership \nof all of MRGCD's property associated with the Middle Rio Grande \nProject. The United States' assertion called into question the validity \nof the 1997 transaction between the City and MRGCD. Both MRGCD and the \nCity dispute the United States' claim of ownership.\n  This dispute is unnecessarily delaying and complicating the City's \nprogress in developing the Biological Park Project. If the matter is \nsimply left to litigation, the delay will be indefinite. Reclamation \nhas already determined that the two properties are surplus to the needs \nof the Middle Rio Grande Project. Moreover, the record indicates that \nReclamation had once considered releasing its interest in the \nproperties for $1.00 each. Obviously, the federal interest in these \nproperties is low while the local interest is high. This bill is \nnarrowly tailored to address this local interest, affecting only the \ntwo properties at issue. The general dispute concerning title to \nproject works is left for the courts to decide.\n  I hope my colleagues will work with me to help resolve this issue. \nWhile much of what we do here in the Congress is complex and time-\nconsuming work, we should also have the ability to move quickly when \nnecessary and appropriate to solve local problems caused by federal \nactions. I therefore urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the supply of quality child care; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored today to \nintroduce the ``Caring for Children Act''--a bill designed to help meet \nthe child care challenges facing families, child care providers and \nsmall businesses around the Nation.\n  Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when both \nparents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. \nUnfortunately, finding quality, affordable child care is one of the \nmost pressing problems for families in Kansas and around the country. \nIt is estimated that quality child care can cost as much or more than \ncollege tuition in some areas.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' takes the first steps in addressing \nthis challenge through a responsible approach. This legislation expands \nchild care opportunities without unnecessary government intervention or \nmandates. This legislation will help working families who want quality \nchild care for their children, child care providers who aim to provide \nthe highest quality of care, and small businesses who currently may not \nhave the resources to provide child care for their employees.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' recognizes that small businesses play \na critical role in providing child care options to millions of working \nparents. Unfortunately, small businesses generally do not have the \nresources required to start up and support a child care center. This \nlegislation includes a short-term, flexible grant program to encourage \nsmall businesses to work together or with established local child care \norganizations to provide child care services for employees. This \nprogram is more of a demonstration project that will sunset at the end \nof five years. In the meantime, small businesses will be eligible for \ngrants up to $250,000 for start-up costs, training, scholarships, or \nother related activities. Businesses, however, will be required to \nmatch Federal funds to encourage self-sustaining facilities well into \nthe future. Business must continue to meet State quality and health \nstandards. In essence, this grant program takes the necessary steps to \nensuring small businesses and other local organizations are able to \nwork together to provide child care for employees.\n  The ``Caring for Children Act'' also addresses another key component \nof quality child care: child care training. My bill creates a new grant \nprogram to allow organizations to develop and operate distance learning \nchild care training infrastructures and to develop model technology-\nbased training courses for child care providers. These infrastructures \nand courses will enable child care providers to receive the training, \neducation and support they need to improve the quality of child care. \nThe ``Caring for Children Act'' encourages grantees to work with \nsecondary schools, institutions of higher education, state and local \ngovernments, and child care organizations to promote networking, \ninformation sharing, and resource sharing. These grants will be \ntargeted to those areas with the fewest training opportunities for \nchild care providers.\n  Child care is an issue that impacts each and every one of us. While \nparents continue to struggle to meet the constant demand of work and \nfamily, we must continue to do our part to expand child care options \nand protect our nation's most valuable resource, our children. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues in this important effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nclarify the treatment of payment under the medicare program for \nclinical laboratory tests furnished by critical access hospitals; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President. Today, I introduce legislation \nthat will overturn a new regulation that is putting critical access \nhospitals (CAH) at risk by arbitrarily lowering the Medicare \nreimbursement for laboratory services. Sixty rural hospitals in \nNebraska will be negatively impacted unless this regulation is \nreversed.\n  This legislation would repeal a Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices' (CMS) regulation that would prohibit critical access \nhospitals from being reimbursed at-cost for laboratory services, unless \npatients are ``physically present in a critical access hospital'' when \nlaboratory specimens are collected. Many CAHs provide laboratory \nservices in rural health clinics (RHCs) and nursing homes in smaller, \nneighboring communities, as well as in home-health settings; however, \nthe elimination of cost-based reimbursement may make it prohibitive for \nthem to continue offering off-site laboratory testing. In short, under \nthe new regulation, lab services would not be reimbursed by CMS unless \nthe patient is at the facility where testing will occur.\n  This change jeopardizes rural Americans' access to care by imposing \nan additional burden on the frail elderly by requiring them to visit \nthe hospital to get simple lab tests done. The additional time and \nexpense incurred by the patient is unnecessary if the CAR is willing \nand able to conduct tests at the point of patient care and transport it \nback to the hospital for analysis.\n  Congress created the CAR program in 1997 to ensure that those in \nisolated, rural communities have access to health care. To protect the \nviability of these hospitals, often a community's only source of vital \nhealth care services, Congress established cost-based reimbursement for \nMedicare inpatient and outpatient services--regardless of where the \nservices are provided. The new regulation would fundamentally alter \nthis well-established practice.\n  We have tried to work with CMS to change the rule. In November of \n2003, I was joined by 28 Senators in a bipartisan letter to the \nAdministrator of CMS asking for his assistance in constructing a rule \nthat does not penalize CAHs for offering off-site laboratory services. \nUnfortunately, CMS responded that the rule would stay intact.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Susan Collins. \nSenator Collins has been a strong advocate for rural health care, and I \nlook forward to working together on this legislation.\n  The Nebraska critical access hospitals affected by the regulation \nare:\n  Harlan County Health System in Alma\n  Fillmore County Hospital in Geneva\n  Pawnee County Memorial Hospital in Pawnee City\n  Niobrara Valley Hospital Corporation in Lynch\n  Thayer County Health Services in Hebron\n  Kimball County Hospital in Kimball\n  Kearney County Health Services/Hospital in Minden\n  Saunders County Health Services in Wahoo\n  Henderson Health Care Services in Henderson\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\n  Community Memorial Hospital in Syracuse\n  Garden County Hospital & Nursing Home in Oshkosh\n  Franklin County Memorial Hospital in Franklin\n  Genoa Community Hospital in Genoa\n  Gothenburg Memorial Hospital in Gothenburg\n  Annie Jeffrey Memorial County Health Center in Osceola\n  Brodstone Memorial Nuckolls County Hospital in Superior\n  Webster County Community Hospital in Red Cloud\n  Tilden Community Hospital in Tilden\n  Morrill County Community Hospital in Bridgeport\n  Jefferson Community Health Center in Fairbury\n  Memorial Hospital in Aurora\n  Oakland Memorial Hospital in Oakland\n  St. Francis Memorial Hospital in West Point\n  Alegent Health Memorial Hospital in Schuyler\n  Nemaha County Hospital in Auburn\n  Brown County Hospital in Ainsworth\n  Antelope Memorial Hospital in Neligh\n  Cozad Community Hospital in Cozad\n  Litzenberg Memorial County Hospital in Central City\n  Avera St. Anthony's Hospital in O'Neill\n  Warren Memorial Hospital in Friend\n  Creighton Area Health Services in Creighton\n  Butler County Health Care Center in David City\n  Rock County Hospital in Bassett\n  Boone County Health Center in Albion\n  Callaway District Hospital in Callaway\n  York General Hospital in York\n  Howard County Community Hospital in St. Paul\n  Memorial Hospital CAH in Seward\n  Dundy County Hospital in Benkelman\n  Chadron Community Hospital Health Services in Chadron\n  St. Mary's Hospital in Nebraska City\n  West Holt Memorial Hospital in Atkinson\n  Cherry County Hospital in Valentine\n  Providence Medical Center in Wayne\n  Plainview Public Hospital in Plainview\n  Osmond General Hospital in Osmond\n  Tri Valley Health System in Cambridge\n  Pender Community Hospital in Pender\n  Johnson County Hospital in Tecumseh\n  Chase County Community Hospital in Imperial\n  Community Medical Center in Falls City\n  Valley County Hospital in Ord\n  Crete Area Medical Center in Crete\n  Ogallala Community Hospital in Ogallala\n  Perkins County Health Services in Grant\n  Memorial Health Center in Sidney\n  Gordon Memorial Hospital District in Gordon\n  Memorial Community Hospital in Blair\n  Box Butte General Hospital in Alliance\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 237. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to ensure that \ncertain states remain eligible for Federal highway funds; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to correct \na serious problem in Federal law which prevents States like New Jersey \nfrom receiving vital Federal highway funds under certain conditions.\n  On September 22, 2004, former New Jersey Governor James McGreevey \nissued an Executive Order that prohibited the State from entering into \ncertain contracts. Governor McGreevey took this step to ensure fairness \nand transparency in the contracting process, and under current Federal \nlaws, our State is being punished for it.\n  Bush administration officials interpreted Federal law as prohibiting \nthis type of action by New Jersey and consequently withheld \nauthorization of Federal funding for highway projects in our State, \nputting some $250 million in highway projects at risk.\n  I worked with Department of Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta in \nan attempt to resolve this problem quickly. Ultimately, Acting Governor \nRichard Codey reluctantly suspended the part of the Executive Order \ncausing the problem. But since that's not really a permanent solution, \nI am introducing this legislation today.\n  New Jersey's transportation infrastructure is vital to millions of \ntravelers and the entire East Coast economy. It is estimated that some \n70 billion vehicle miles are traveled in New Jersey each year, but only \n6 million drivers are licensed in our State. In addition, projected \nincreases in port traffic will put 80 percent more trucks on the roads \nin the next 15 years, which will exacerbate congestion and continue to \ntax our infrastructure.\n  In short, I believe that New Jersey's good intentions should not cost \nour State the Federal highway funding we need so desperately.\n  I thank my colleague and friend Senator Corzine for co-sponsoring \nthis legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in \ngetting it enacted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pay to Play Reform \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PAY TO PLAY REFORM.\n\n       Section 112 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Construction.--Nothing in this section prohibits a \n     State from enacting a law or issuing an order that limits the \n     amount of money an individual who is doing business with a \n     State agency for a Federal-aid highway project may contribute \n     to a political campaign.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Feinstein, \n        and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 239. A bill to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for medicare \nbeneficiaries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Senator Wyden and I broke new ground \ntogether when we introduced the first bipartisan Medicare Prescription \ndrug bill known as SPICE back in 1999. And after Congress passed the \nhistoric Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, Senator Wyden and I \nauthored legislation aimed at ensuring long term value of the drug \nbenefit to seniors. Today we are joined again by Senator Feinstein, who \nhas been committed with us to forging a bipartisan effort to do what we \nmust today--to move beyond offering a benefit and ensure that we meet \nour obligation to address affordability.\n  When we consider both a recent ten year cost estimate of over $534 \nbillion for the prescription drug benefit, and drug price increases \nwhich have rapidly outpaced inflation and earnings, we could see the \nbenefit to seniors depreciated--and the cost to the Federal Government \nincreased. So today we introduce The Medicare Enhancements for Needed \nDrugs Act of 2005, MEND, today to manage costs, and assure seniors will \nreceive better value for their dollar.\n  This bill provides both better consumer information to help \nbeneficiaries and the negotiation power to assure that the power of \nmillions of seniors will result in competitive pricing. That is why two \nof our colleagues--Senators McCain and Feingold--have now joined us in \nthis effort.\n  Ours is a simple approach informed by a ``healthy dosage'' of common \nsense. It simply makes no sense to cut off the ability of the HHS \nSecretary--the individual who is responsible for the success of this \nbenefit--from negotiating on behalf of beneficiaries. That's why our \nlegislation repeals the ``noninterference provision'' of the \nprescription drug bill and authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to participate in negotiations on drug prices. Last month when \nSecretary Thompson announced his departure from HHS, he described \nseveral issues of critical concern--one of these was that he had been \nbarred from negotiating on behalf of beneficiaries. He noted, ``I would \nlike to have had the opportunity to negotiate''. And for good reason! \nThe Congressional Budget\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nOffice has confirmed that this negotiation authority can help us \nrealize savings, particularly for drugs that lack significant \ncompetition.\n  When Senator Gregg recently queried Secretary Leavitt about keeping \nthe cost of the Part D program within the original $400 billion budget, \nand the Secretary asserted that ``It's my practice as a manager to act \nwithin my budget''. That will require competition, so I ask why \nwouldn't we employ negotiation to do what it does best--drive costs \ndown? I asked Secretary Leavitt about negotiation at his confirmation \nhearing in the Finance Committee and he told me, ``I know little about \nnegotiation authority, but there are times when the national government \nshould play a role''. Well, that time is now. Senator Wyden and I have \nreceived our first report on drug price trends from the GAO, and the \nnews isn't good. Since 2000, the increase in prescription drug prices \nhas increase at two to three times the rate of inflation. And worse, we \nfound the rate spiked in 2002, just as we were working to create a \nprescription drug benefit. It's no wonder that the Congressional Budget \nOffice projects an annual increase of about 8.5 percent in costs, most \nof which can be attributed to the rise in prices. But we can address \nthis problem, and avoid depreciating the value of this long sought \nbenefit.\n  To do so you must do more than simply end the prohibition on the \nSecretary negotiating, you must do more than simply granting permissive \nauthority, you must actually ensure that when needed, the Secretary \nwill negotiate.\n  So our legislation will not only empower the HHS Secretary to \nnegotiate but, under two circumstances, requires it. For those \nbeneficiaries who do not have access to two prescription drug plans, \nthe Secretary steps in with a fallback plan, and this plan must be \ncompetitive--so the Secretary must assure that he negotiates on behalf \nof those beneficiaries. In addition, the Secretary must be responsive \nto the needs of the plan providers. When a manufacturer simply is not \ninclined to negotiate--as may occur when competition for a drug is \nlacking--then the Secretary must respond when plans request his \nassistance in negotiations.\n  Some will say this will compel excessive involvement by the \nSecretary, but the truth is quite to the contrary. Plans will compete \nto gain advantage, and it is when they are stymied and cannot achieve \nreasonable discounts that they will call upon the Secretary. CBO \nforesaw one such situation--when a drug lacks significant competition--\nand those are among our most expensive drugs!\n  The buying power of millions of seniors should produce substantial \nsavings, but at the same time, competitive plans won't help if seniors \ncannot identify which plan is right for them.\n  Senator Wyden and I believe we must arm beneficiaries with \ninformation. Our bill requires GAO to track not only the price of drugs \nunder the Medicare program, but calls for that price to be compared to \nthe price negotiated by the VA, DOD and other privately run systems. We \nwill have a measure of how well the seniors are being served.\n  This bill will also help seniors determine which Medicare plan offers \nthe most savings by requiring that beginning in 2007 the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services will determine the savings received from \neach plan by the average Medicare beneficiary, using a market basket of \ncommonly-used drugs. This will allow seniors to make the proverbial \n``apples to apples'' comparison. This information will be shared with \nall beneficiaries during the annual enrollment period each fall, and \nwill be a great help as a starting point for seniors to compare plans.\n  Our legislation will make annual the report Senator Wyden and I first \nrequested following passage of the prescription drug bill in 2003. We \nasked the GAO to review changes in drug prices from 2000 through 2003, \nfocusing on the drugs most likely to be used by seniors, and the \nresults are in: Prescription drug prices have increased at two to three \ntimes the rate of inflation.\n  Finally, many advocates and seniors alike have raised questions about \nthe restriction of Medigap policies under the new Part D benefit. The \nprohibition of the sale of new Medigap policies which include \nprescription drug coverage has prompted the need for a re-examination \nof the role of Medigap plans. So we have directed the Secretary to work \nwith the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to conduct a \nreview of the changes to the Medigap policies and to evaluate the \nimpact on Medicare beneficiaries. It is an important step in looking at \nthe future of Medigap plans. With this report in hand, we will have the \ninformation necessary to make wise adjustments.\n  Some say we don't need to act now. But we have seen drug price \nincreases which are driving costs upwards--contributing to the \nestimated 8.5 percent annual increases in costs projected by CBO. We \nsimply cannot wait until 2006 to address the issue of drug prices. This \nbill provides beneficiaries and our government with the information and \ntools necessary to achieve access to low-cost prescription drugs. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill so that we can \npass it quickly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Snowe and I are once again teaming \nup to work on a bipartisan commonsense proposal to help America's \nseniors receive affordable prescription drugs. Our bill, ``The Medicare \nEnhancement for Needed Drugs Act'' or ``MEND Act'' focuses on cost \ncontainment.\n  At our request, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) \nrecently reviewed drug cost trends. For 77 prescription drugs \nfrequently used by seniors on Medicare the usual and customary price \nincreased 21.8 percent from January 2000 through June 2004, a 4.6 \npercent average annual rate of increase. They also found that the \nprocess for the brand drugs increased 26.4 percent for that same time \nperiod whereas prices for generic drugs increased 8.3 percent. We need \nto make sure that Medicare has every weapon in its arsenal to assure \nseniors and Medicare get the best deal possible on prescription drug \nprices.\n  One of the most important tools for Medicare to use to assure better \nprescription drug prices for seniors is bargaining power. That tool is \nmissing from the legislation Congress passed in 2003. The legislation \nthat Senator Snowe and I are introducing today, the MEND Act, would \nprovide the Secretary of Health and Human Services that tool. As \nresponsible stewards of the taxpayers' money, Congress must provide \nMedicare all the tools, including bargaining power, in its cost \ncontainment arsenal.\n  This concept was endorsed by the outgoing Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Tommy Thompson. The Congressional Budget Office in a \nletter to me last March stated that striking the so-called ``non \ninterference'' provision in the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement \nand Modernization Act could provide opportunities for savings.\n  In addition to providing the Secretary with bargaining power, the \nMEND Act will require the Secretary to negotiate on behalf of what are \nknown as ``fall back'' plans, those plans that are provided when there \nis no choice of a drug plan and the company administering the benefit \nis not at risk. In addition, if any plan asks the Secretary for \nassistance in negotiations for any covered drug, the Secretary must \nassist the plan. Lower drug prices should mean lower premiums; lower \nout of pocket costs and a better benefit.\n  America's seniors are savvy and they will shop around for a plan that \nis going to provide them the best deal on prescriptions. That is why \nthe MEND Act also requires Medicare to provide a comparison of how much \na plan is saving seniors on the cost of the most commonly used drugs. \nGiving seniors more control over their health care and health care \ndollars will also help keep costs down.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nSenator Snowe, Senator Wyden and Senator McCain in introducing the \nbipartisan Medicare Enhancement for Needed Drugs, MEND, Act of 2005. \nThis legislation is an important step toward controlling the spiraling \ncost of prescription drugs for America's seniors.\n  The MEND Act addresses what I saw as a major weakness of the Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003 when I voted for the bill. The Medicare \nModernization Act offers an opportunity for the Federal Government via \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to harness its bulk \npurchasing power to deliver lower drug prices for our seniors.\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\n  However, the Medicare bill prohibits the HHS Secretary from doing \njust that.\n  I have said several times that I would work to see that this \nprohibition on the HHS Secretary from negotiating with drug \nmanufacturers be stricken and I was pleased that Secretary Tommy \nThompson, upon announcing his departure as HHS Secretary, acknowledged \npublicly that he sought the negotiating power that this legislation \nprovides. Secretary Thompson said, ``I would have liked to have had the \nopportunity to negotiate.''\n  First and foremost the bill strikes the prohibition language in the \nMedicare bill, also called the noninterference provision.\n  I strongly believe that the HHS Secretary should be given the \nauthority similar to that of other Federal entities that purchase \nprescription drugs in bulk to negotiate prices with manufacturers of \nprescription drugs to ensure that beneficiaries pay the lowest possible \nprice for their prescription drug plans.\n  The CBO has told us that the effect of striking the \n``noninterference'' provision would have a ``negligible effect'' on \nfederal spending. CBO's conclusion is based on their prediction that \nprivate plans will be able to obtain savings that will be greater than \nwhat the Secretary will be able to achieve and that simply striking \nthis provision does not ensure that the Secretary will use the \nnegotiation authority.\n  Meanwhile, our seniors are being given no guarantee that private plan \ncompetition will mean lower drug prices for them. So while CBO makes \nthis conclusion that private market forces will bring about savings, \nthe federal government is forced to sit on the sidelines, unable to \nleverage its purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices. The \nFederal Government cannot even participate in negotiations for \nprescription drug plans for which it assumes the risk.\n  That is simply wrong and the MEND Act corrects this flaw in the \nMedicare bill.\n  Second, if a future HHS Secretary does not agree with Secretary \nThompson's view that he be given the opportunity to negotiate with drug \nmanufacturers, there must be circumstances under which the Secretary is \nrequired by law to negotiate.\n  The MEND Act mandates two scenarios under which the Secretary must \nnegotiate with manufacturers. First, the Secretary must negotiate with \nmanufacturers of covered Part D drugs for the fallback prescription \ndrug plan.\n  The ``fallback'' plan is a guaranteed drug benefit to beneficiaries \nliving in areas where only one private plan, or none, shows up. In \nareas where a ``fallback'' prescription drug plan is triggered, the \nfederal government must offer the standard drug benefit and assume \nperformance risk. However, the Federal Government does not have a say \nin the prices manufacturers charge them in the ``fallback.''\n\n  To ensure that the Federal Government achieves the lowest available \nprice for enrollees in a ``fallback'' plan, the MEND Act requires that \nthe Secretary negotiate drug prices in such plans.\n  The MEND Act also requires the Secretary to participate in \nnegotiations upon the request of an approved prescription drug plan or \nMedicare Advantage prescription drug plan.\n  If the untested theory that private plans can achieve larger drug \nprice discounts than the Secretary could negotiate proves to be false \nbecause the smaller insurers in the private market cannot achieve the \nsavings larger, more established companies can, a company can petition \nthe Secretary to negotiate with drug manufacturers on their behalf.\n  So that seniors can make an ``apples to apples'' comparison when \ndetermining which drug plan offers them the most competitive drug \nprices, the bill requires that the Secretary of HHS determine the \naverage aggregate beneficiary costs and savings basic prescription drug \nplans are able to achieve to better inform seniors about which plan \nmight suit them best.\n  I have heard concerns raised by many of my constituents about the \nimpact the Medicare bill will have on their Medigap plans. This bill \ndirects the HHS Secretary to work with the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners to conduct a review of the changes to the \nMedigap policies in the new drug benefit for the purpose of evaluating \nits impact on Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Lastly, the bill requires GAO to conduct a review of the retail cost \nof prescription drugs in the U.S. during 2000 through 2003 with an \nemphasis on the prescription drugs most utilized for individuals age 65 \nor older. Subsequent reviews will be required annually through 2007.\n  And, it requires GAO to conduct an annual study that compares the \naverage retail cost in the U.S. for each of the 20 most utilized \nprescription drugs for individuals 65 or older with the average price \nat which private health plans acquire each such drug, the average price \nat which the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration each \nacquire such drug, and the average negotiated price for each such drug \nthat eligible beneficiaries enrolled in a prescription drug plan under \nPart D of Medicare pay.\n  As someone who voted for the Medicare bill and has seen the cost \nestimate of that bill go from $400 billion to $534 billion and someone \nwho is very concerned about the growth of entitlement spending, I \nbelieve that this bill will shed light on one of the big drivers of \nhealth care costs, the cost of prescription drugs.\n  CBO projects that Americans over 65 will spend $1.8 trillion on \nprescription drugs over the next ten years. Recent studies of U.S. and \nCanadian drug-price comparisons show that, on average, prices charged \nby manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers were higher in the U.S., \nmost recently by about 70 percent.\n  For example, an American consumer pays $62.99 for a 30-day supply of \nthe popular cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor. The same consumer in \nCanada is paying $35.42. For Prevacid, used to treat acid reflux, an \nAmerican consumer pays $120.99 for a 30-day supply whereas a Canadian \nconsumer pays $44.27.\n  If we do not address the exorbitant costs of prescription drugs in \nthis country today, we threaten the viability of programs like Medicare \nfor future generations. I am pleased to join Senators Snowe, Wyden and \nMcCain in the fight for lower prescription drug prices for our seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Durbin, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 240. A bill to mend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nsmall business employers a credit against income tax with respect to \nemployees who participate in the military reserve components and are \ncalled to active duty and with respect to replacement employees and to \nallow a comparable credit for activated military reservists who are \nself-employed, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the continuing activation of military \nreservists to serve in Iraq and the war on terror has imposed a \ntremendous burden on many of our country's small businesses, their \nemployees and their employees' families. Too many small businesses, \nwhen their employees are asked to leave their jobs and serve the \nNation, are unable to continue operating successfully and face severe \nfinancial difficulties, even bankruptcy. At the same time, more than 40 \npercent of military reservists and National Guard members suffer a pay \ncut when they're called to defend our Nation. Most large businesses \nhave the resources to provide supplemental income to resist employees \ncalled up for active duty and to replace them with a temporary \nemployee. However, too many small businesses are unable to provide this \nassistance (or temporarily replace the employee called up to active \nduty. I believe the Federal Government must take action to help small \nbusinesses weather the loss of an employee to active duty and protect \nsmall business employees and their families from suffering unnecessary \nfinancial hardship to serve our Nation. That is why I am again \nintroducing legislation that will provide an immediate tax credit \nassist both military reservists who are called to active duty and the \nsmall businesses who must endure their absence.\n  The Small Business Military Reservist Tax Credit Act that I am \nintroducing today will provide immediate\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\nhelp to affected small businesses through a Federal income tax credit \nand a reduced withholding requirement to help pay the difference in \nsalary for a reservist called up to active duty and the cost of \ntemporarily replacing that employee while he or she is serving our \nNation. Specifically, the bill will provide a tax credit of up to \n$21,000 to any very small business, defined as any business with up to \n50 employees, whose employee has been called up for active duty. Up to \n$15,000 for businesses that pay any difference in salary for the \nactivated reservist and up to an additional $6,000 for the business to \noffset the cost of hiring a temporary replacement. For small \nmanufacturers with up to 100 employees, the bill will provide a tax \ncredit of up to $30,000, up to $20,000 for small manufacturers that pay \nall or part of the difference in salary for the reservist called to \nduty and up to $10,000 for small manufacturers to offset the cost of \nhiring a temporary replacement. This tax credit is critically necessary \nif we are to immediately help struggling entrepreneurs keep their small \nbusinesses running after the loss of an employee to temporary military \nservice. Too many American small manufacturers are already facing a \ndifficult economy and strong international competition. This \nlegislation provides higher thresholds for small manufacturers because \nthey need greater help and they employ more technical workers who \ntypically command higher salaries and are more difficult to replace. It \nwill also help cushion the financial cost of being a citizen solder for \nour reservists.\n  To fight our wars and to meet our military responsibilities, the \nUnited States supplements its regular, standing military with \nreservists, citizen soldiers who serve nobly. Since 1973, the United \nStates has built an all-volunteer military of which reservists are an \nessential part. Our reservists are much more than weekend warriors. \nWhen they are called to active duty, they are an essential ingredient \nof any long-term or significant deployment of American forces. Everyone \nknows the contributions our reservists have made in the Army, Navy, Air \nForce, Marines and Coast Guard. They have been serving our country with \ndistinction and pride for many years and should not be penalized \nfinancially for their honorable service. The use of reservists is a \nsignificant way to reduce the costs of maintaining a standing army, and \nthose costs, in lieu of having a critical reservist component, are far \nhigher than the cost of providing the small, targeted tax credit \noffered by this legislation.\n  Reservists have become a vital component of U.S. forces in Iraq and \nthe war on terror. On September 14, 2001, President Bush issued \nExecutive Order 13223 authorizing the activation of up to 1 million \nmilitary reservists for up to 2 years of active duty. Since October \n2002, there has been a presidentially approved ceiling of 300,000 on \nthe number of reservists that can be on duty at anyone time. Some \n475,000 reserves have been called up cumulatively since the issuance of \nthe original Executive Order. Today, there are about 193,458 reserves \non active duty in the war against terrorism. Of the approximately \n150,000 troops serving in Iraq, 40 percent are reserves. This number is \nexpected to increase to approximately 50 percent in the near future as \ncurrent troop deployments mobilize.\n  Earlier this month, published reports showed that Lt. Gen. James R. \nHelmly, the Commander of the Reserve, has told Army Chief of Staff \nGeneral Peter J. Schoomaker that the burdens placed on military \nreservists since the September 11, 2001 attacks, combined with \ndysfunctional Pentagon policies, have damaged morale and retention and \nthreaten to turn the Army Reserve into a broken force. Lt. Gen. Helmly \ncriticized Pentagon decisions to extend reservists tours in war zones, \ngiving troops as little as 3 days' notice before mobilizations, and \ncalling reservists to active duty after they had served and returned to \ncivilian life. Such policies have strained the Army Reserve to the \npoint that the 200,000 force could be unable to carry out future \nmissions.\n  Both the Army Reserve and National Guard have suffered shortfalls in \nrecruitment because of the unpredictability, extended call-ups and stop \nloss policies associated with the Iraq war. National Guard officials \nsaid last month that the service must be overhauled.\n  Everyone knows that small businesses continue to be a most effective \nat creating new jobs and spurring economic growth nationwide. Small \nbusinesses employ over 50 percent of the nation's workforce. \nNationwide, small businesses are currently creating 75 percent of new \njobs. Furthermore, many of these small businesses provide quality goods \nand services that are a vital link in the supply chain for our national \ndefense. Many of these small companies need immediate help to keep \ntheir business going while their employees are sacrificing for our \ncountry in Iraq and elsewhere.\n  Many of our reservists left their companies in good shape. They were \nprofitable, providing goods or services, creating jobs, adding to the \ntax base. Our Nation should do everything possible to ensure that upon \ntheir return, reservists and their businesses do not suffer unnecessary \nhardships, which range from impaired operations and financial ruin to \ndeserted clients, layoffs, and even closure. Pedro Sotelo, a 33-year-\nold veteran from Kansas City, MO, was a reservist for 9 years. From \n1997 to 2004 he was called up to active duty 10 times. Each time he was \nactivated, he saw his income drop from $60,000 a year as a small \nbusiness sheet metal worker to about $30,000 the Army paid him as a \nstaff sergeant. While he was away serving his country, the bills would \njust keep pilling up. Eventually his credit rating plummeted. The \ncontinual financial strain contributed to the end of his first \nmarriage, and after 9 years of service, Mr. Sotelo left the military to \ntake a job selling cars. He is still recovering from the financial ruin \ncreated by his service, but I am happy to say that Mr. Sotelo has \nremarried and was recently promoted to manager at his dealership. Had \nthe bill I introduce today been available for Staff Sergeant Sotelo, \nhis small business employer could have kept his income steady and \nreceived a tax credit to cover half of the costs of doing so.\n  Beyond the hardship of leaving their families, their homes and their \nregular employment, 41 percent of military reservists and National \nGuard members, like Staff Sergeant Sotelo, face a pay cut when they're \ncalled for active duty in our armed forces. Many of these reservists \nhave families who depend upon that paycheck to survive and can least \nafford a substantial reduction in pay. Unlike many big businesses that \ncan afford to provide supplemental income to make up for the salary \ndisparity for military reservists called to active duty, most small \nbusinesses cannot afford to provide this benefit. This makes it more \ndifficult for small businesses to attract and keep workers. I think it \nis imperative that we help families of reservists maintain their \nstandard of living while their loved one serves our Nation. We must \nensure that our great tradition of citizen soldiers does not fade or \nstop because of the effect service has on work and family.\n  Back in 1999, I wrote the Military Reservist Small Business Relief \nAct, which was enacted into law during the 106th Congress and \nauthorized the Small Business Administration (SBA) to defer existing \nloan repayments and to reduce the interest rates on direct loans that \nmay be outstanding, including disaster loans, for small businesses that \nhave had a military reservist called up for active duty. It also \nestablished a low-interest economic injury loan program administered by \nthe SBA through its disaster loan program. These loans have been \navailable to provide interim operating capital to any small business \nwhen the departure of a military reservist for active duty causes \neconomic injury. However, in today's economy, many small businesses are \nunable to take on additional debt to continue their operations. These \nsmall businesses need immediate tax relief to assist them in hiring a \nreplacement and to pay their reservist worker who is away serving our \ncountry.\n  This bill will help every small business whose owner, manager or \nemployee is called to active duty. Most immediately, this bill will \nassist those small businesses whose employees are in service in Iraq \nand elsewhere but the act also applies to future contingency \noperations, military conflicts, or national emergencies.\n  By helping our reservists and the small businesses that employ them, \nwe can ensure that our great tradition of\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\ncitizen soldiers does not fade or stop because of the effect service \nhas on work and family.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support this important legislation to help \nboth military reservists and the small businesses they are forced to \nleave when they are called up for active duty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 241. A bill to amend section 254 of the Communications Act of 1934 \nto provide that funds received as universal service contributions and \nthe universal service support programs established pursuant to that \nsection are not subject to certain provisions of title 31, United \nStates Code, commonly known as the Antideficiency Act; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Rockefeller \nand the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation, Senators Stevens and Inouye, to \nintroduce legislation to safeguard the Universal Service Fund, or \n``USF,'' the institution that allows rural and low-income Americans to \nobtain affordable telephone service, allows America's schools and \nlibraries to provide Internet access to all segments of society through \nthe E-Rate program, and permits rural health care providers to obtain \ntelecommunications and Internet services at reduced rates. The concept \nof Universal Service has been with us nearly as long as the telephone \nitself, and this bill today marks one key step in ensuring that this \nvital policy remains intact in the 21st Century.\n  The legislation introduced today pertains specifically to the \nUniversal Service Administration Company, or ``USAC,'' the private, \nnonprofit corporation that Congress created to administer the USF. This \nbill is very similar to S. 2994, a Universal Service bill that I \nintroduced during the last session of Congress and that was passed \nright before adjournment as part of a larger telecommunications \npackage, H.R. 5419. That bill temporarily exempted USAC from complying \nwith new, arbitrarily-imposed accounting rules that had severely \ndisrupted the E-Rate program and threatened to cause huge spikes in \nconsumers' telephone bills. Many will recall that hundreds of millions \nof dollars in E-Rate funding for schools and libraries stayed unissued \nfor months because of the accounting rule change, and immediate action \nwas necessary to resolve the problem.\n  According to USAC's Federal regulators, these new accounting rules \nneeded to be imposed to ensure that the USF was compliant with the \nfederal Anti-Deficiency Act, a law which prevents government agencies \nfrom incurring financial obligations beyond the amount that has been \nappropriated to them by Congress. However, USAC, in administering the \nUSF, does not receive any appropriated funds from Congress. Rather, the \nUSF is funded by a regular disbursement, on a more-or-less monthly \nbasis, of monies derived from a surcharge placed on the revenue \ngenerated from interstate telephone calls. The existence of this \npredictable revenue stream negates any of the risks and concerns that \nthe Anti-Deficiency Act was designed to prevent.\n  After government accounting rules were imposed on USAC last summer, \nthe entire E-Rate program was frozen. On the eve of the start of the \nschool year, this program--which has enabled 93 percent of schools and \nlibraries in the country to hook up to the Internet--was unable to \nreview and act upon the funding recommendations of thousands of \napplicants. Many recipients of E-Rate funding actually shut off their \nInternet connections because they had no money available to maintain \nservice. In order to alleviate this problem, Congress decided last fall \nto exempt the USF from the Anti-Deficiency Act for one year until a \npermanent solution to this problem was found. Senator Rockefeller and I \ndecided to pursue a one-year exemption in order to ensure speedy \npassage of the legislation before adjournment, so that schools and \nlibraries could receive their funding again. Today's legislation \nprovides that permanent solution: a permanent exemption from the Anti-\nDeficiency Act.\n  Clear precedent exists for such an exemption. Numerous other federal \nprograms already are exempt from complying with the Anti-Deficiency \nAct, including the National Park Service and the Conservation Trust. \nMoreover, an exemption is the rational solution to ensure that this \nproblem does not continue to recur. As I previously mentioned, an \nexemption is particularly appropriate in this instance because the USF \nhas a funding mechanism different from most federal programs. The USF \nfunctioned very well for many years utilizing the Generally Accepted \nAccounting Principles used by the entire American business world. \nTrying to engraft special government rules onto USF is akin to forcing \na square peg into a round hole. And the result would be another \nstoppage in E-Rate--and likely the USF Rural High Cost Fund as well--\nand also a spike in the USF surcharge on consumers' telephone bills.\n  Finally, I want to ensure my colleagues that a permanent exemption \nfrom the Anti-Deficiency Act poses no risk of increased fraud or abuse \nin the E-Rate Program or in Universal Service as a whole. Some well-\npublicized abuses of E-Rate did in fact occur, and I will fully support \nefforts to stamp out such government waste. But the Federal \nCommunications Commission has repeatedly stated that there is \nabsolutely no connection between the Anti-Deficiency Act land the \nability of the Inspector General to effectively monitor the program to \nstamp out waste, fraud, and abuse. As such, government waste cannot be \nused as a valid reason for opposing this bill.\n  Last fall we undertook a bipartisan effort among Members on the \ncommittees of jurisdiction in both Houses of Congress to enact a \ntemporary exemption for the USF from unnecessary, burdensome \nregulations. In undertaking that effort we worked closely with the \nFederal Communications Commission, and enjoyed widespread support among \nthe telecom industry, educators, and State and local governments. I am \ngrateful of the continuing bipartisan support of the Chairman and \nRanking Member, as well as of Senator Rockefeller, and it is my hope \nthat we can proceed in similar fashion to make this exemption \npermanent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 242. A bill to establish 4 memorials to the Space Shuttle Columbia \nin the State of Texas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today in honor of the memory and \nsacrifice of seven astronauts whose lives were tragically cut short two \nyears ago in the destruction of the Space Shuttle Columbia, I bring to \nthe floor a bill to authorize the construction of several memorials in \ncommunities along the Space Shuttle Columbia Recovery Corridor; \nspecifically, Lufkin, Hemphill, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine, TX.\n  Each of these communities will memorialize the disaster and the \nindomitable spirit of adventure and courage, the spirit that defies \ncomplacency and accepts challenge, the spirit that each of these \nastronauts and each of these communities showed.\n  This search for adventure turned space travel from dreams to a \nreality. It is this spirit of challenge which fueled the courage and \nambition of seven men and women into the sky on January 6, 2003. It is \nalso this same spirit that drives these communities to permanently \ncommemorate the high price we sometimes pay for reaching new horizons.\n  Hemphill, TX, where the nose cone of the Shuttle was found, is also \nwhere the remains of the crew were recovered. The VFW post in Hemphill \nfed thousands of volunteers for weeks without so much as a complaint or \na dime. The men and women of Hemphill did not take their task lightly, \nbut rather with a solemn grace and dignity.\n  The greatest amount of debris came down in the populated areas of \nNacogdoches, TX. Backyards and streets were littered with debris, \npermanently altering the community. The citizens of Nacogdoches pulled \ntogether and focused on the recovery, working day and night with NASA \nuntil the job was complete. A spirit of courage filled the community of \nNacogdoches and their efforts should never be forgotten.\n  The population of Lufkin, TX doubled overnight as the retrieval \neffort\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\nstarted. The community's residents welcomed thousands with hospitality \nand made their civic center NASA's Columbia retrieval command center. \nFrom combing the streets and fields for debris to making home cooked \nmeals for the recovery workers, the people of Lufkin mustered around \nthe Columbia tragedy.\n  The citizens of San Augustine, TX were a driving force behind the \nrecovery effort. Local elected officials and countless volunteers \nopened their hearts and their homes to strangers also affected by the \ntragedy. Searching the piney woods of deep east Texas on horseback and \nwalking the streets in search of shuttle fragments, the spirit of San \nAugustine could not be crushed.\n  In recent years, America has experienced grief with the loss of many \nheroes. But our collective loss with the Columbia tragedy still sears \nour souls and the pain is never easy to bear. Today, two years after \nthey vanished into the deep blue skies of Texas, we pause to remember \nand honor Rick Husband, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark, Ilan Roman, \nWilliam McCool, David Brown, and Michael Anderson.\n  And though the families' losses cannot be diminished, their pain and \ngrief is shared around the world and our prayers are with them. This \nbill will memorialize their sacrifice and will honor the courageous \nspirit of the communities affected. Their sacrifices will never be \nforgotten.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a program and criteria for National \nHeritage Areas in the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``National \nHeritage Partnership Act,'' a bill to establish a program and criteria \nfor National Heritage Areas in the United States.\n  Twenty-seven National Heritage Areas currently exist in this country, \nincluding 4 new areas designated in appropriations bills by the 108th \nCongress. Six occur in the State of Pennsylvania alone. They range in \nsize from a 10-mile canal in Augusta, GA, to the entire State of \nTennessee. Specific areas are designated to recognize and preserve the \ncultural heritage of the oil industry, coal mining, the evolution of \nmanned flight, and the Civil War, just to name a few. The National Park \nService has responsibility for advising heritage area managers and \nproviding Federal funds, but a formal process and criteria for \ndesignating new areas do not exist.\n  State delegations are planning to introduce legislation to designate \n13 new National Heritage Areas and authorize studies on an additional \n5. Hundreds of State heritage areas currently exist and all could \npotentially become National Heritage Areas under the current process. \nThis program is out of control. We are continuing to put unnecessary \nfiscal and resource demands on the National Park Service at a time when \na significant maintenance backlog exists in park units throughout the \nNation. We have no established criteria to ensure the recognition of \ntruly nationally important areas.\n  During the 108th Congress, the National Parks Subcommittee conducted \ntwo hearings on heritage areas and received a review from the General \nAccounting Office. My legislation combines the recommendations of the \nNational Park Service, General Accounting Office, and witness testimony \nby establishing criteria such as national importance, creating a \nprocess for studying and reviewing new areas, requiring fiscal \naccountability and protecting the rights of property owners.\n  This legislation is overdue. It provides a balanced approach to \nNational Heritage Area designation, management, and oversight.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 245. A bill to provide for the development and coordination of a \ncomprehensive and integrated United States research program that \nassists the people of the United States and the world to understand, \nassess, and predict human-induced and natural processes of abrupt \nclimate change; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Abrupt Climate \nChange Research Act of 2005. This bill would authorize $10 million per \nyear for the next six years for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, in partnership with universities across the Nation, to \nconduct research on abrupt climate change.\n  The subject of climate change remains controversial. Nevertheless, I \nbelieve there is one issue on which almost everyone can agree: A great \ndeal more scientific research is necessary in order to better \nunderstand the potential risk of abrupt climate change.\n  Understanding and predicting climate change are enormous scientific \nchallenges. The challenges are made even more difficult with the \nrecognition that the climate system is capable of dramatic and abrupt \nchanges. Scientists have determined that past global temperatures have \nswung as much as 20 deg. F within a decade, accompanied by drought in \nsome places and catastrophic floods in other places. An abrupt climate \nchange triggered by the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere would also likely result in the redistribution of \natmospheric moisture and rainfall, with substantial impact on the \nworld's food supplies. Unfortunately, we have no satisfactory \nunderstanding of what triggers abrupt climate changes.\n  Both the National Academy of Sciences and the Administration's \nStrategic Climate Change Science Plan identify abrupt climate change as \na key priority for additional research. In a 2002 report, the National \nAcademy of Sciences stated that ``Large, abrupt climate changes have \nrepeatedly affected much or all of the Earth.'' Furthermore, the report \nstated that ``abrupt climate changes are not only possible but likely \nin the future, potentially with large impacts on ecosystems and \nsocieties.'' The report noted that we're not doing nearly enough to \nidentify even the threat of abrupt climate change. My bill would lay \nthe framework and provide the funds for the United States to understand \nand address abrupt climate change.\n  One reason this funding is so urgent is that we're rapidly losing one \nof the greatest sources of information: Ice cores from glaciers. The \nUniversity of Maine's Climate Change Institute has one of the best \nabrupt climate change research programs in the world. The Climate \nChange Institute uses ice cores from glaciers and ice sheets around the \nworld to make discoveries that change the way we think about climate \nchange. Unfortunately, numerous glaciers around the world are melting; \nand\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\nwhen they go, we lose the very record that has given us so much of this \ncritical climatic history.\n  I recently had the opportunity to see for myself how scientists are \nable to use glaciers and ice sheets to understand climate change. In \nAugust, I traveled with Senators McCain, Sununu, and others to the \nnorthernmost community in the world. We visited Ny-Alesund on the \nNorwegian island of Spitsbergen. Located at 79 degrees north, Ny-\nAlesund lies well north of the Arctic Circle and is much closer to the \nNorth Pole than to Oslo, the country's capital. It has even served as a \nstarting point for several polar expeditions, although thankfully, \nSenator McCain did not include an attempt to reach the North Pole on \nour itinerary.\n\n  The scientists we met with told us that the global climate is \nchanging more rapidly now than at any time since the beginning of \ncivilization. They further state that the region of the globe changing \nmost rapidly is the Arctic. The changes are remarkable and disturbing.\n  In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea-ice cover over an area \n10 times as large as the State of Maine. In the summer, the change is \neven more dramatic, with twice as much ice loss. The ice that remains \nis as much as 40 percent thinner than it was just a few decades ago. In \naddition to disappearing sea-ice, Arctic glaciers are also rapidly \nretreating. In Ny-Alesund, Senator McCain and I witnessed massive \nblocks of ice falling off glaciers that had already retreated well back \nfrom the shores where they once rested.\n  The melting of glaciers and sea ice, the thawing of permafrost, and \nthe increases in sea levels resulting from warming are already \nbeginning to cause environmental, social, and economic changes. Indeed, \nthe social and economic disruption resulting from climate change is \nalready evident in a number of regions throughout the Arctic, including \nAlaska. Some coastal communities in Alaska are facing increased \nexposure to storms and coastal erosion as a reduction in sea ice allows \nhigher waves and storm surges to reach shore. In other areas, thawing \nground is disrupting transportation, buildings, and other \ninfrastructure. Some indigenous communities are already facing the \nprospect of relocating. If these changes were to be compounded with an \nabrupt climate change on the scale seen in our climatic history, the \nresult could be devastating.\n  I know that my colleague, the chairman of the Commerce Committee and \nsenior Senator from Alaska, is very concerned about how Arctic climate \nchanges are affecting his State. I know he recognizes that more \nresearch funding is necessary in order to understand future climate \nchanges. I look forward to working with Chairman Stevens, Ranking \nMember Inouye, and other members of the Commerce Committee to address \nthis extremely important issue in the 109th Congress.\n  I am grateful to my cosponsors, Senators Cantwell, Snowe, Murray, \nJeffords, and DeWine. I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues over the coming months in order to address this important \nissue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Abrupt \nClimate Change Research Act of 2005, legislation which will address the \ncritical, comprehensive and integrated research needed for abrupt \nclimate change. In the 108th, this legislation was passed by the Senate \nCommerce Committee. Its merits are just as pressing, if not more \ncritical, for the 109th Congress as the legislation calls for \ndeveloping and coordinating a research program over 6 years aimed at \nunderstanding, assessing, and predicting both human-induced and natural \nprocesses of abrupt climate change.\n  The abrupt climate change research issue is one that the Maine Senate \ndelegation has been working on for the past 3\\1/2\\ years, the genesis \nof which goes back to a Climate Change Conference in Maine in October \n2001, which was attended by a wide array of stakeholders in the State \nwho have been active in climate change issues for a number of years.\n  I believe we all ought to be concerned by the picture scientific \nresearch is painting, which points to the reality and potential impact \nof abrupt shifts in climate. The December 2001 National Academy of \nSciences report documented a growing body of scientific evidence that \nsuggests our global climate can swing abruptly, not gradually over \ntime. Moreover, such sudden jumps, and I quote from the Academies' \nreport, ``are not only possible but likely in the future.''\n  Rather than dismiss this, as some have, as the ``science de jour'' I \nprefer to take this as a serious warning, based on the best available \nevidence and analysis. The risk of complacency is to gamble immense \nenvironmental and societal consequences. That's why the NAS report \nurged that a new research program be initiated to examine the potential \nimpact of a sudden change in climate in response to global warming. And \nthat's also why, back in May of 2002, when NOAA's Admiral Lautenbacher \nwas before the Commerce Committee testifying on NOAA's FY 2003 Budget, \nI raised the need for abrupt climate change studies, and the Admiral \nagreed this is a pressing priority. Since the introduction of the \nresearch bill in the 108th Congress, NOAA, in a January 15, 2004 \nreport, stated that calendar year 2003 tied 2002 as the 2nd warmest \nyear on record.\n  Mr. President, as co-chair of the independent International Climate \nChange Taskforce, I was pleased to disseminate to my colleagues the \nrecently published Taskforce report, ``Meeting the Climate Challenge.'' \nThe ICCT includes leaders from public service, science, business and \ncivil society, from both developed and developing countries. Our goal \nwas to find common ground through recommendations that could be helpful \nto all governments and policymakers worldwide for developing solutions \nto address climate change.\n  Indeed, our first recommendation calls for a long-term objective to \nprevent global average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees \nCentigrade, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above the pre-industrial level \nby 2100. This target would limit the extent and magnitude of the \nimpacts of climate change if all countries take various actions. I will \nask unanimous consent to submit the ICCT's ten recommendations for the \nRecord. In the upcoming weeks and months, I will be introducing \nlegislation that reflects these public policy recommendations.\n  The temperature goal is crucial to the debate on abrupt climate \nchange because, if the earth goes beyond the 2 degree C level, \nscientists have suggested that risks to both ecosystems and humans \nincrease significantly. As the risks of accelerated or--as our report \nstated--``runaway'' climate change increases, a ``tipping point'' could \nbe reached that would include the loss of the West Antarctic and \nGreenland ice sheets, leading to the rise of sea levels.\n  On this score, abrupt and paleoclimate research can greatly enhance \nthe evolving body of scientific evidence, and that is why Senator \nLautenberg and I spearheaded the effort last year to restore the FY2005 \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, research \nprograms that will enable us to examine past climate change patterns. \nThis information will guide the development of future models to assist \nboth scientists and policymakers to improve their understanding of \nclimate change through, for instance, the CORC-ARCHES program and \npaleo-\nclimate research. The University of Maine, under the direction of Dr. \nGeorge Denton, has been part of the decades-long consortium that has \nbeen studying deep ocean currents in the Weddell Sea in Antarctica, and \nice core samples from northern latitudes, which is helping scientists \ncommand a greater understanding of abrupt climate change.\n\n  There have also been other, newer scientific reports that should give \nus great pause. Among those reports, the Arctic Climate Impact \nAssessment states, ``Arctic average temperature has risen at almost \ntwice the rate as the rest of the world in the past few decades. \nWidespread melting of glaciers and sea ice and rising permafrost \ntemperatures present additional evidence of strong arctic warming. \nThese changes in the Arctic provide an early indication of the \nenvironmental and societal significance of global warming.''\n  There is scientific observational evidence that indicates that \nregional changes in climate, particularly increases in temperature, are \nalready affecting a diverse set of physical and biological systems in \nmany parts of the\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\nworld. Off the coast of Canada lies a 150-square mile, 100-foot thick \nmass of ice that has existed on the coast for 3,000 years, but it is \nnow disintegrating. That melting has been accelerating over the past 2 \nyears. In addition, coral reefs, an irreplaceable marine resource \naround the world, are under tremendous stress as coral bleaching is \ninduced by high water temperatures. Indeed, there are reports of a \nmassive region-wide decline of coral which supports a huge variety of \nsea life across the entire Caribbean Basin.\n  As we turn to the future, we should harbor no illusions that we are \nlooking at a timetable measured in epochs. We are talking about tens of \nthousands of years. To the contrary, observed changes tell us that the \nsnows of Kilimanjaro could vanish in 15 years, the glaciers in the \nBolivian Andes that once appeared indestructible may disappear in \nanother 10 years, and in Alaska, where the average temperature has \nrisen almost 5 and one half degrees over the past 30 years, there is \nevidence of melting permafrost and dying forests.\n  So my question is, what are we waiting for? Is this the kind of \nlegacy we want to leave to future generations and the next millennium? \nWhy not apply now the lessons of the past and present?\n  Indeed, if ``past is prologue,'' and I believe it is, this bill will \nimprove our understanding of climate change by calling for research to \nbolster existing, global records of past abrupt climate change, through \nthe study of ice cores, for instance. In this manner we can improve \nscientific understanding of the mechanisms of abrupt climate change, \nand incorporate this knowledge into current scientific models. Even for \nthose who question prevailing scientific opinion on the climate change \nissue, this bill should hold the appeal of increasing our stock of \nknowledge, wherever it may lead.\n  In the final analysis, we need to carry out research that will allow \nus to gauge climate change secrets of the past, so we in turn might \ndevelop future models that will assist both scientists and policymakers \nin understanding climate change. The reality is, there is no doubt our \nglobal climate has changed in the past. There should similarly be no \nquestion that it would be beneficial to understand the manner in which \nthat change has occurred and why, and so I urge my colleague's support \nfor this legislation, and will work for its passage out of the Commerce \nCommittee and to the Senate floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Summary of Main Recommendations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Summary of Main Recommendations\n\n       1. A long-term objective be established to prevent global \n     average temperature from rising more than 2 deg.C (3.6 deg.F) \n     above the pre-\n     industrial level, to limit the extent and magnitude of \n     climate-change impacts.\n       2. A global framework be adopted that builds on the UNFCCC \n     and the Kyoto Protocol, and enables all countries to be part \n     of concerted action on climate change at the global level in \n     the post-2012 period, on the basis of equity and common but \n     differentiated responsibilities.\n       3. G8 governments establish national renewable portfolio \n     standards to generate at least 25% of electricity from \n     renewable energy sources by 2025, with higher targets needed \n     for some G8 governments.\n       4. G8 governments increase their spending on research, \n     development, and demonstration of advanced technologies for \n     energy-efficient and low- and zero-carbon energy supply by \n     two-fold or more by 2010, at the same time as adopting near-\n     term strategies for the large-scale deployment of existing \n     low- and no-carbon technologies.\n       5. The G8 and other major economies, including from the \n     developing world, form a G8+ Climate Group, to pursue \n     technology agreements and related initiatives that will lead \n     to large emissions reductions.\n       6. The G8+ Climate Group agree to shift their agricultural \n     subsidies from food crops to biofuels, especially those \n     derived from cellulosic materials, while implementing \n     appropriate safeguards to ensure sustainable farming methods \n     are encouraged, culturally and ecologically sensitive land \n     preserved, and biodiversity protected.\n       7. All developed countries introduce national mandatory \n     cap-and-trade systems for carbon emissions, and construct \n     them to allow for their future integration into a single \n     global market.\n       8. Governments remove barriers to and increase investment \n     in renewable energy and energy efficient technologies and \n     practices through such measures as the phase-out of fossil \n     fuel subsidies and requiring Export Credit Agencies and \n     Multilateral Development Banks to adopt minimum efficiency or \n     carbon intensity standards for projects they support.\n       9. Developed countries honour existing commitments to \n     provide greater financial and technical assistance to help \n     vulnerable countries adapt to climate change, including the \n     commitments made at the seventh conference of the parties to \n     the UNFCCC in 2001, and pursue the establishment of an \n     international compensation fund to support disaster \n     mitigation and preparedness.\n       10. Governments committed to action on climate change raise \n     public awareness of the problem and build public support for \n     climate policies by pledging to provide substantial long-term \n     investment in effective climate communication activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. DeMint, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Santorum, \n        Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 246. A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the expansion of the \nadoption credit and adoption assistance programs; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Adoption \nTax Relief Guarantee Act of 2005. This legislation will help American \nfamilies break the financial barriers to successfully adopting a child, \nespecially those children with special needs who cannot take care of \nthemselves. By helping to ease this financial burden, we can encourage \nthe development of more stable families and provide a brighter future \nfor thousands of children.\n  These important goals prompted us to act 4 years ago, when we passed \nadoption tax incentives in the 2001 tax bill. However, they are set to \nsunset and will expire on December 31, 2010. I believe it is essential \nthat we support the American family and extend these provisions.\n  This bill repeals the sunset for adoption tax credits. Specifically, \nthis will allow those Americans who adopt a child to continue to \nreceive a credit in the amount of their qualified expenses and \nguarantees the maximum $10,000 credit for those who adopt children with \nspecial needs. If we fail to act, these credits would revert to $5,000. \nThis legislation also continues the expanded eligibility for adoption \nassistance programs for those earning up to $150,000, rather than \nallowing it to fall back to $75,000.\n  I am pleased that a bipartisan group of Senators has cosponsored this \nlegislation, and that it has been endorsed by the National Council for \nAdoption. Those children without parents and those parents without \nchildren need our help to bring them together. We owe it to them to act \nnow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT:\n  S. 248. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to permit \nStates to carry out surface transportation program projects on local \nroads to address safety concerns; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, each State has unique road needs and \ndifferent transportation priorities. In order to more effectively \nleverage limited dollars, State transportation agencies need increased \nflexibility to use Federal funds for projects identified as safety \nconcerns.\n  Currently, when an urgent need arises, a State must apply to the \nSecretary of Transportation for a waiver and fill out mountains of \npaperwork in order to transfer funds to critical priorities. We need to \nempower States to make their own decisions when it comes to meeting \ntheir most urgent safety needs.\n  Today, I introduce legislation called the Surface Transportation \nAdaptability to Ensure Safety Act or ``STATES Act,'' which allows \nStates to undertake a surface transportation project on any State-\nmaintained public road if the State determines that the project is \nnecessary to address high fatality rates or other safety concerns.\n  This bill empowers States, such as South Carolina, to respond to \nserious needs quickly, while also allowing them to make the most \nefficient use of the transportation dollars they receive. Under this \nlegislation, a State can decide to use its Surface Transportation \nProgram funding on a road functionally classified as a rural or minor \ncollector without getting permission from Washington.\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\n  No red tape. No Federal bureaucracy. Just a decision made at the \nlocal level by the people with the best understanding of the situation. \nIt is time to bring safety decisions down to the local level and give \neach State the discretion to allocate funds to the most pressing safety \nconcerns in its highway program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Surface Transportation \n     Adaptability to Ensure Safety (STATES) Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LOCATION OF SURFACE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM PROJECTS.\n\n        Section 133(c) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Except'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Except''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Safety projects.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a \n     State may undertake a surface transportation program project \n     on any State-maintained public road, including a road \n     functionally classified as a local or rural minor collector, \n     if the State determines that the project is necessary to \n     address high fatality rates or other safety concerns.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 249. A bill to establish the Great Basin National Heritage Route \nin the States of Nevada and Utah; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself, Senator Ensign and \nSenator Bennett to introduce this bill, which will establish a National \nHeritage Route in eastern Nevada and western Utah.\n  National Heritage areas, corridors, and routes are designated regions \nin which residents and businesses, as well as local and tribal \ngovernments join together in partnership to conserve and celebrate \ncultural heritage and special landscapes. The Great Basin National \nHeritage Route includes historic mining camps and ghost towns, Mormon \nand other pioneer settlements, as well as Native American communities. \nThe Route passes through classic Great Basin country along the trails \nof the Pony Express and the Overland Stage. Cultural resources within \nthe route include highly valued Native American archaeological sites \ndating back to the Fremont Culture.\n  The creation of this Heritage Route will bring much deserved \nattention to the Great Basin's natural wonders. Passing through Millard \nCounty, UT, and parts of the Duckwater Reservation and White Pine \nCounty in Nevada, the Route contains items of great biological and \ngeological interest. In Nevada, it encompasses forests of bristlecone \npine, the oldest living things on the earth. In Utah, the Route \nincludes native Bonneville cutthroat trout as well as other distinctive \nspecies and ecological communities.\n  Designation of the corridor as a Heritage Route will also ensure \nlong-term protection of key educational and recreational opportunities \nwithout compromising traditional local use of the land. The Great Basin \nNational Heritage Route will provide a framework for celebrating \nNevada's and Utah's rich historic, archaeological, cultural, and \nnatural resources for both visitors and residents.\n  The bill will establish a board of directors consisting of local \nofficials from both counties and tribes to manage the designated route. \nThe board will develop a management plan within 3 years of the bill's \npassage, and the Secretary of the Interior will enter into a memorandum \nof understanding with the Board of Directors for the management of the \nresources of the heritage route. Our legislation authorizes up to $10 \nmillion to carry out the Act but limits Federal funding to no more than \n50 percent of the project's cost. The bill allows the Secretary to \nprovide assistance for 15 years after the bill is enacted.\n  Our bill benefits not just the people of Nevada and Utah, but \ncitizens of every State in our Union. It highlights an area of \noutstanding cultural and natural value and brings people together to \ncelebrate common values and a common history of which we all can be \nproud.\n  I was pleased that my distinguished colleagues recognized the value \nof this legislation during the 108th Congress and supported its passage \nby the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and by the Senate as a \nwhole. I look forward to working with my friends to move this bill in a \ntimely manner during the current session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Great Basin National \n     Heritage Route Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical \nEducation Act of 1998 to improve the Act; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Carl D. \nPerkins Vocational and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2005. The \nPerkins Act, together with the Workforce Investment Act, the Higher \nEducation Act, and other federal education and programs, provides \nimportant resources that are needed to help adequately prepare students \nof all ages for jobs in high-wage and highskilled occupations. It is \npart of a group of federal education and programs that are critical to \na lifelong of learning. In this technology driven, global economy, \nschool is never out. Everyone is a student who must adapt to the \nchanging needs of their jobs and the workforce by continuing to pursue \nan education in their chosen field. In turn, Congress must ensure that \neducation and training are connected to the needs of business, \nincluding small businesses, now and into the future.\n  It is my hope that this body will take the necessary action to \nreauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act. \nThe Act works together with a combination of federal education and \ntraining programs that will strengthen our workforce and enable America \nto compete--and succeed--in the global economy.\n  At a hearing held on June 24, 2004, before the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee, members heard testimonies from leaders in \ncareer and technical training emphasizing the importance of constant \ntraining, retraining and upgrading of the skills today's jobs require. \nOne of the things we learned at that hearing is that many students \nleaving high school or college and entering the workforce find \nthemselves unprepared for life because they lack the skills they need \nto succeed in the workforce. This country created over 2 million new \njobs since January 2001. That's great news. Unfortunately, the \ncomplaint heard from employers is that there are too few skilled \nworkers to meet their needs. We have a strong interest in making sure \nthis is corrected. The Perkins Act would provide both strong academic \nand relevant job skill training to promote and sustain the long-term \ncompetitiveness of this country.\n  A unique aspect of the Perkins program that addresses the needs of \nthe changing workforce is that it targets funds to both secondary and \npostsecondary schools. This approach provides a good platform from \nwhich we can better coordinate workforce preparation policy and \ntraining with an emphasis on lifelong learning. It is essential to \nfacilitate a sequence of career or technical education courses that a \nstudent can complete before they even get to college, and that they can \ncontinue at the postsecondary level, whenever they decide to go on.\n  This legislation introduced today is the result of a bipartisan \nprocess that began in the 108th Congress. I'm pleased to have worked \nwith the Members of the Committee and stakeholders on a bipartisan bill \nthat will improve the Perkins Act to better meet the needs of students, \nworkers, and business. This legislation will help strengthen the \nPerkins program by improving accountability, involving businesses in \ncareer and technical education programs, emphasizing challenging \nacademic instruction, and advancing the field of career and technical \neducation by linking those programs to advances in industry.\n  This legislation would also encourage greater collaboration between \nstate agencies responsible for education and training activities. It \nrequires state agencies to work together on identifying the needs of \nthe workforce and designing curriculum to match those needs. It also \nemphasizes the needs of nontraditional students and other lifelong \nlearners, who are returning to school for the first time, or those who \nare seeking additional skill training.\n  This legislation also continues to emphasize the need to introduce \nwomen and girls to high skill, high wage jobs. It is important that we \nhelp expand the vision of our students to ensure they consider all the \noptions that are available to them, not just the ones that fit general, \nand sometimes erroneous, conceptions.\n  I hope our bipartisan efforts will continue to produce results as we \nmove the bill through the Senate and into Conference. I do not wish to \nsee another piece of bipartisan legislation lost in the legislative \nlimbo of election year politics. An important step that the Senate must \ntake is to appoint conferees to finish the reauthorization of the \nWorkforce Investment Act. That program offers the resources that are \nneeded to help adequately prepare more than 900,000 unemployed workers \nfind work each year. It passed the Senate unanimously, both in \nCommittee and the floor. Conferees must now be appointed before the \nAugust recess. If we are going to help workers in this country, we must \nsend this important legislation to Conference so that it will \nultimately reach the President and be signed into law.\n  I cannot stress enough the importance of Federal initiatives like the \nCarl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act and the \nWorkforce\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\nInvestment Act to keep American workers and businesses competitive. The \nPerkins Act can help close the gap that threatens America's long-term \ncompetitiveness. It is essential that we take advantage of the \nopportunity we have during this reauthorization process to improve the \nlink between education and relevant academic and skills preparation. By \nso doing, we will create a pathway to prosperity for American workers \nand businesses alike, that both will make good use of for years to \ncome.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land in Washoe County, Nevada, to the Board of Regents of the \nUniversity and Community College System of Nevada; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dandini \nResearch Park Transfer Act on behalf of myself and Senator Ensign. This \nbill will transfer an important tract of land in Washoe County, NV, to \nthe University and Community College System of Nevada.\n  The University of Nevada holds two patents from the Bureau of Land \nManagement for approximately 467 acres of public land located north of \ndowntown Reno. In the early 1970s, the land was patented to the \nuniversity pursuant to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Now \nknown as the Dandini Research Park, it is the home of Truckee Meadows \nCommunity College and the Desert Research Institute's Northern Nevada \nScience Center.\n  Truckee Meadows Community College and its predecessor, Western Nevada \nCommunity College, have provided educational programs and opportunities \nto the residents of Reno, Sparks, and the surrounding communities for \nover 30 years. Construction of the College's facilities on the Dandini \ncampus began in 1975, shortly after conveyance of the original patents.\n  For over 25 years the Desert Research Institute has excelled in \napplied scientific research and the application of technologies to \nimprove people's lives in Nevada and throughout the world. Its three \ncore divisions of Atmospheric, Hydrologic, and Earth and Ecosystem \nSciences cooperate with two interdisciplinary centers to provide \ninnovative solutions to pressing environmental problems. The Center for \nArid Lands Environmental Management and the Center for Watersheds and \nEnvironmental Sustainability apply scientific understanding to the \neffective management of natural resources while addressing our needs \nfor economic diversification and science-based educational \nopportunities. In doing so, DRI undertakes fundamental scientific \nresearch in Nevada and around the globe. For example, as a key \nparticipant in the U.S. Geological Survey Water Research Program, DRI \nplays a critical role in identifying and helping protect the region's \nscarce water resources.\n  DRI shares its facility with the Western Regional Climate Center, one \nof six regional climate centers operating under the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration's climate program. The Western Regional \nClimate Center conducts applied research and provides high quality \nclimate data and information pertaining to the western United States.\n  The Desert Research Institute wishes to expand its Northern Nevada \nScience Center. DRI is considering an innovative means of financing the \nexpansion, which would involve a private developer who would build and \nfinance the expansion and lease it back to DRI. The private developers \nwith whom DRI has discussed the proposal, as well as the Institute's \ncounsel, however, have pointed out that the terms of the patents and \nthe restrictions imposed by the Recreation and Public Purposes Act \nrepresent obstacles to such an arrangement.\n  Truckee Meadows Community College and the Northern Nevada Science \nCenter are exceptional assets of the scientific and educational \ncommunity in the Truckee Meadows. The Center serves not only the \ncitizens of Washoe County, but the needs of all Nevadans and the \nwestern United States as well. It deserves the opportunity to grow and \nprosper with the community--one of the fastest-growing communities in \nthe Nation.\n  The bill Senator Ensign and I present to you today simply directs the \nSecretary of the Interior to convey this property from the Bureau of \nLand Management to the University and Community College System of \nNevada. Because of the overwhelming public benefit provided by the \nCenter, we ask that the land be conveyed for free, but that the \nUniversity cover the costs of the transaction.\n  During the 108th Congress this legislation received strong support \nfrom my colleagues and was passed by both the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and the Senate as a whole. I look forward to \nworking with my fellow senators during this session to usher this \nimportant legislation towards final passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dandini Research Park \n     Conveyance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Board of regents.--The term ``Board of Regents'' means \n     the Board of Regents of the University and Community College \n     System of Nevada.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE TO THE UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE \n                   SYSTEM OF NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall convey to the Board of \n     Regents, without consideration, all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the approximately 467 \n     acres of land located in Washoe County, Nevada, patented to \n     the University of Nevada under the Act of June 14, 1926 \n     (commonly known as the ``Recreation and Public Purposes \n     Act'') (43 U.S.C. 869 et seq.), and described in paragraph \n     (2).\n       (2) Description of land.--The land referred to in paragraph \n     (1) is--\n       (A) the parcel of land consisting of approximately 309.11 \n     acres and more particularly described as T. 20 N., R. 19 E., \n     Sec. 25, lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 11, SE\\1/4\\NW\\1/4\\, NE\\1/\n     4\\SW\\1/4\\, Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada; and\n       (B) the parcel of land consisting of approximately 158.22 \n     acres and more particularly described as T. 20 N., R. 19 E., \n     Sec. 25, lots 6 and 7, SW\\1/4\\NE\\1/4\\, NW\\1/4\\SE\\1/4\\, Mount \n     Diablo Meridian, Nevada.\n       (b) Costs.--The Board of Regents shall pay to the United \n     States an amount equal to the\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\n     costs of the Secretary associated with the conveyance under \n     subsection (a)(1).\n       (c) Conditions.--If the Board of Regents sells any portion \n     of the land conveyed to the Board of Regents under subsection \n     (a)(1)--\n       (1) the amount of consideration for the sale shall reflect \n     fair market value, as determined by an appraisal; and\n       (2) the Board of Regents shall pay to the Secretary an \n     amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale, for use by the \n     Director of the Bureau of Land Management in the State of \n     Nevada, without further appropriation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 253. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land to the Edward H. McDaniel American Legion Post No. 22 in \nPahrump, Nevada, for the construction of a post building and memorial \npark for use by the American Legion, other veterans' groups, and the \nlocal community; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pahrump \nAmerican Legion Post Land Conveyance Act for myself and Senator Ensign. \nThis Act will transfer approximately 5 acres of BLM land in Pahrump, \nNV, to the American Legion for the purpose of constructing a post home \nand other facilities that will benefit veterans' groups and the local \ncommunity.\n  The American Legion and other non-profit organizations that represent \nour Nation's veterans in the vicinity of Pahrump have tripled in size \nover the last 10 years. The local memberships of the American Legion, \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Disabled American Veterans will \nsoon exceed 1,000 members, and these groups will continue to expand as \nPahrump draws more and more new residents.\n  The existing facility used by the veterans in Pahrump was built by \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars in the 1960s. It is much too small and not \nat all adequate for the veterans' current needs. The nearest facility \nthat can accommodate them is located in Las Vegas more than 60 miles \naway.\n  The Pahrump American Legion would like to build a post building, \nveterans' garden, and memorial park. These new facilities would benefit \nnot only the local veterans, but would be made available--at no cost--\nfor community activities. The American Legion has tried for over six \nyears to acquire a suitable tract of land to provide a home for a new \nveterans center. The Legion started a pledge campaign and raised over \n$16,000 for the building fund before the parcel of land they sought to \nacquire was removed from consideration by the BLM. Unfortunately, other \ntracts of land that might represent alternative sites in Pahrump are \nnot suitable.\n  This situation is truly regrettable. Without a home, the Pahrump \nAmerican Legion Post can't offer the kind of services and programs that \nthe veterans in the area deserve. Our veterans aren't the only ones who \nare suffering, either. All across the United States, the American \nLegion is deservedly famous for supporting community activities like \nthe Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, as well as the National Oratorical \nContest, American Legion Baseball, Girls and Boys State, and other \nactivities for young people. All of these worthy groups and projects \nwould benefit from the construction of a new post home, and from the \nconveyance of this small parcel of federal land. In sum, this bill is \ngood for veterans, good for kids, and good for hard-working Nevada \nfamilies.\n  Our bill simply directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey this \nproperty from the Bureau of Land Management to American Legion ``Edward \nH McDaniel'' Post No. 22 in Pahrump. Because of the great public \nbenefit such a facility will provide, we ask that the land be conveyed \nfor free, but that the American Legion cover the costs of the \ntransaction.\n  I was pleased that my distinguished colleagues recognized the value \nof this legislation during the 108th Congress and supported its passage \nby the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and by the Senate as a \nwhole. I look forward to working with my friends to move this bill in a \ntimely manner during the current session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land to Lander County, Nevada, and the Secretary of the \nInterior to convey certain land to Eureka County, Nevada, for continued \nuse as cemeteries; to the Committee on Energy' and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto introduce this bill, which will address a long standing public land \nissue in central Nevada. As you may know, the Federal Government \ncontrols over 87 percent of the lands in the State of Nevada. This \nmeans that Nevadans must frequently seek the assistance of Congress to \ndeal with land issues that would otherwise be relatively uncomplicated. \nToday we offer a bill to address a simple land ownership issue in \nLander and Eureka Counties.\n  This bill would convey two small cemeteries in central Nevada from \nfederal control back to the local communities to which they should \nbelong. The cemeteries in question the Kingston Cemetery in Lander \nCounty and the Maiden's Grave Cemetery in Eureka County--were first \nestablished by pioneers and immigrants who settled the isolated high \ndesert valleys of the Great Basin in the mid-1800s. These same pioneers \ncreated the Kingston and Maiden's Grave cemeteries to serve as sacred \nresting places for friends and family. Unfortunately, years after their \nfounding, the private nature of these lands was overlooked and the \ncemeteries were placed in the hands of federal land management \nagencies. Today much of the original Kingston Cemetery is on land \nmanaged by the U.S. Forest Service and the Maiden's Grave Cemetery in \nBeowawe sits on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management.\n  Under current law, these agencies must sell the cemeteries back to \nthe communities at fair market value. However, these historic \ncemeteries were established prior to the designation of the Federal \nagencies that now manage them. For years, Lander County has been \nrequired to lease much of the Kingston Cemetery from the Forest\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nService. The Forest Service previously sold approximately 1 acre to the \nTown of Kingston, but this land transfer did not allow for the \nprotection of uncharted graves or for the implementation of the \ncommunty' s original site plan.\n  Because the people of Beowawe and Kingston should not have to buy or \nlease cemeteries that are rightfully theirs, our bill provides for the \nsimple conveyance of the Maiden's Grave Cemetery to Eureka County and \nthe balance of the original location of the Kingston Cemetery to Lander \nCounty, NV. The conveyances provided by this bill will benefit our \nfederal land managers as well as our rural communities. The disposal of \nthese small parcels of land for no consideration will benefit the \nUnited States because they represent isolated tracts that prove \ndifficult to manage for public use.\n  In the 108th Congress I was pleased that this bill received approval \nfrom the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and from the Senate as \na whole. I look forward to working with my colleagues to complete this \nsmall conveyance during the current Congress. It is time that we \nrestore ownership of these two small rural cemeteries to the \ncommunities to which they rightfully belong.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Central Nevada Rural \n     Cemeteries Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO LANDER COUNTY, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historical use by settlers and travelers since the \n     late 1800's of the cemetery known as ``Kingston Cemetery'' in \n     Kingston, Nevada, predates incorporation of the land within \n     the jurisdiction of the Forest Service on which the cemetery \n     is situated;\n       (2) it is appropriate that that use be continued through \n     local public ownership of the parcel rather than through the \n     permitting process of the Federal agency;\n       (3) in accordance with Public Law 85-569 (commonly known as \n     the ``Townsite Act'') (16 U.S.C. 478a), the Forest Service \n     has conveyed to the Town of Kingston 1.25 acres of the land \n     on which historic gravesites have been identified; and\n       (4) to ensure that all areas that may have unmarked \n     gravesites are included, and to ensure the availability of \n     adequate gravesite space in future years, an additional \n     parcel consisting of approximately 8.75 acres should be \n     conveyed to the county so as to include the total amount of \n     the acreage included in the original permit issued by the \n     Forest Service for the cemetery.\n       (b) Conveyance on Condition Subsequent.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights and the condition stated in subsection (e), \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the \n     Forest Service (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary''), not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, shall convey to Lander County, Nevada \n     (referred to in this section as the ``county''), for no \n     consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to the parcel of land described in subsection \n     (c).\n       (c) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (b) is the parcel of National Forest System land \n     (including any improvements on the land) known as ``Kingston \n     Cemetery'', consisting of approximately 10 acres and more \n     particularly described as SW\\1/4\\SE\\1/4\\SE\\1/4\\ of section \n     36, T. 16N., R. 43E., Mount Diablo Meridian.\n       (d) Easement.--At the time of the conveyance under \n     subsection (b), subject to subsection (e)(2), the Secretary \n     shall grant the county an easement allowing access for \n     persons desiring to visit the cemetery and other cemetery \n     purposes over Forest Development Road #20307B, \n     notwithstanding any future closing of the road for other use.\n       (e) Condition on Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The county (including its successors) \n     shall continue the use of the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (b) as a cemetery.\n       (2) Reversion.--If the Secretary, after notice to the \n     county and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a finding that \n     the county has used or permitted the use of the parcel for \n     any purpose other than the purpose specified in paragraph \n     (1), and the county fails to discontinue that use--\n       (A) title to the parcel shall revert to the Secretary, to \n     be administered by the Secretary; and\n       (B) the easement granted to the county under subsection (d) \n     shall be revoked.\n       (3) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the application of \n     subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) if the Secretary \n     determines that a waiver would be in the best interests of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE TO EUREKA COUNTY, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historical use by settlers and travelers since the \n     late 1800's of the cemetery known as ``Maiden's Grave \n     Cemetery'' in Beowawe, Nevada, predates incorporation of the \n     land within the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management \n     on which the cemetery is situated; and\n       (2) it is appropriate that that use be continued through \n     local public ownership of the parcel rather than through the \n     permitting process of the Federal agency.\n       (b) Conveyance on Condition Subsequent.--Subject to valid \n     existing rights and the condition stated in subsection (e), \n     the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of \n     the Bureau of Land Management (referred to in this section as \n     the ``Secretary''), not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, shall convey to Eureka County, Nevada \n     (referred to in this section as the ``county''), for no \n     consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to the parcel of land described in subsection \n     (c).\n       (c) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (b) is the parcel of public land (including any \n     improvements on the land) known as ``Maiden's Grave \n     Cemetery'', consisting of approximately 10 acres and more \n     particularly described as S\\1/2\\NE\\1/4\\SW\\1/4\\SW\\1/4\\, N\\1/\n     2\\SE\\1/4\\SW\\1/4\\SW\\1/4\\ of section 10, T.31N., R.49E., Mount \n     Diablo Meridian.\n       (d) Easement.--At the time of the conveyance under \n     subsection (b), subject to subsection (e)(2), the Secretary \n     shall grant the county an easement allowing access for \n     persons desiring to visit the cemetery and other cemetery \n     purposes over an appropriate access route consistent with \n     current access.\n       (e) Condition on Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The county (including its successors) \n     shall continue the use of the parcel conveyed under \n     subsection (b) as a cemetery.\n       (2) Reversion.--If the Secretary, after notice to the \n     county and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a finding that \n     the county has used or permitted the use of the parcel for \n     any purpose other than the purpose specified in paragraph \n     (1), and the county fails to discontinue that use--\n       (A) title to the parcel shall revert to the Secretary, to \n     be administered by the Secretary; and\n       (B) the easement granted to the county under subsection (d) \n     shall be revoked.\n       (3) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the application of \n     subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) if the Secretary \n     determines that a waiver would be in the best interests of \n     the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Thune, \n        Mr. Carper, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 256.

Res. 27\n\n       Whereas on January 9, 2005, for the first time in 9 years, \n     large numbers of Palestinians living in the West Bank, the \n     Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem voted in elections that were widely \n     described by outside monitors as free and fair;\n       Whereas the Palestinian people elected former Prime \n     Minister Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, to the \n     office of President of the Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas an estimated 65 percent of eligible Palestinians \n     living in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem \n     participated in voting at over 1000 polling stations, and for \n     the first time in nearly 30 years, the Palestinian people \n     elected new leadership;\n       Whereas on January 9, 2005, President of the United States \n     George W. Bush stated that it was a ``historic day for the \n     Palestinian people and for the people of the Middle East'' \n     and that ``Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza \n     took a key step toward building a democratic future by \n     choosing a new president in elections that observers \n     described as largely free and fair'';\n       Whereas Israel provided important cooperation with the \n     Palestinian Authority to enable the holding of this election, \n     including minimizing delays at checkpoints and redeploying \n     Israeli security forces away from Palestinian population \n     centers;\n       Whereas the Palestinian election was an important step \n     towards democracy for the Palestinian people and an example \n     to all those in the region who are striving to achieve \n     democracy in their own nation;\n       Whereas during his inaugural speech, President Abbas stated \n     that ``The winner in\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\n     these elections is the great Palestinian people who have \n     created this democratic epic and who will safeguard it'', \n     that ``The people have voted for the rule of law, order, \n     pluralism, the peaceful transfer of authority, and equality \n     for all'', and further ``Let us start implementing the \n     Roadmap'';\n       Whereas these comments build upon Mr. Abbas' 1993 \n     statements on the White House lawn, where he said that a \n     Palestinian state and an Israeli state could live in \n     ``peaceful coexistence and cooperation'';\n       Whereas the election of Mahmoud Abbas was hailed around the \n     world as a positive step opening new opportunities to move \n     toward peace between the Palestinian Authority and Israel;\n       Whereas the Palestinian election provided President Abbas \n     with a mandate from the majority of Palestinians to reject \n     violence and pursue peace with Israel;\n       Whereas the extent of cooperation between the Israelis and \n     Palestinians during the period leading up to and including \n     election day was unprecedented in the past four years and \n     reflects the potential for future cooperation;\n       Whereas the election must be followed quickly by concrete \n     steps on the part of the new Palestinian President to meet \n     his commitment to reform the Palestinian security services, \n     establish the rule of law, and do all in his power to combat \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas a democratic Palestinian Authority will serve as \n     one of the most important building blocks for a viable, free, \n     and stable Palestinian state;\n       Whereas President Abbas' success likely will depend upon \n     his ability to tangibly and quickly improve the quality of \n     life for Palestinians, and end corruption and violence;\n       Whereas the United States Government stands ready to work \n     with the new Palestinian President to facilitate a renewed \n     dialogue between the new Palestinian leadership and the \n     Government of Israel with the goal of achieving through the \n     Performance Based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (the ``Roadmap''), \n     President George W. Bush's vision of two states, Israel and \n     Palestine, living side by side in peace;\n       Whereas the Roadmap, endorsed by the United States, Israel, \n     the Palestinian Authority, the European Union, Russia, and \n     the United Nations, remains the only realistic and widely \n     recognized plan for making progress toward peace;\n       Whereas the policy of the United States is to work toward a \n     just and peaceful resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli \n     conflict based on two democratic states, Israel and \n     Palestine, living side by side in peace and security;\n       Whereas all parties to the Roadmap have an obligation to \n     urgently provide support for the Palestinian Authority in its \n     efforts to confront and fight terror as well as to assist in \n     the creation of true democratic institutions that will \n     enforce the rule of law; and\n       Whereas people of all peaceful nations believe peace \n     between the Palestinian Authority and the state of Israel \n     will have far reaching positive effects on the entire region \n     and throughout the world; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that, on January 9, 2005, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, \n     also known as Abu Mazen, was elected by the Palestinian \n     people to the office of President of the Palestinian \n     Authority in what were widely described as free and fair \n     elections;\n       (2) recognizes this milestone in the development of \n     Palestinian democracy and congratulates President Abbas on \n     his election to the presidency of the Palestinian Authority;\n       (3) commends the efforts of the Israeli Government to \n     facilitate the election;\n       (4) expresses its respect for the freely expressed will of \n     the Palestinian people, and its intention to work with \n     President Abbas to help the Palestinian people realize the \n     opportunity for a more peaceful, prosperous future;\n       (5) urges President Abbas and the new Palestinian \n     leadership to abide by its commitments to reform the security \n     services, establish the rule of law, and press on with the \n     development of democratic institutions, including an \n     independent judiciary and an empowered and democratically \n     elected legislature;\n       (6) urges President Abbas to move quickly to honor his \n     pledges to halt violence and incitement against Israel, \n     dismantle terrorist organizations, and fulfill the \n     Palestinian Authority's obligations according to the terms of \n     the Roadmap;\n       (7) supports efforts to increase United States assistance \n     to the Palestinian people and to help President Abbas rebuild \n     and reform the Palestinian Authority's institutions, as \n     President Abbas takes actions consistent with the Roadmap, so \n     that they may better serve the Palestinian people;\n       (8) urges all members of the international community, \n     particularly all parties to the Roadmap, to take advantage of \n     this historic opportunity by providing timely assistance to \n     the new Palestinian Government as it moves forward to \n     implement the Roadmap, to help it build the necessary \n     political, economic, and security infrastructure essential to \n     establishing a viable, democratic state and improving the \n     lives of the Palestinian people;\n       (9) calls upon Arab states in particular to provide \n     political and financial support to the Palestinian Authority, \n     to support a complete end to terrorism against Israel, to end \n     incitement against it, and to reach out to the State of \n     Israel in friendship and full recognition;\n       (10) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     security of Israel as a democratic, Jewish state, and \n     supports the commitment of Israel to fulfill its obligations \n     under the Roadmap; and\n       (11) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     Roadmap including realization of the vision of two democratic \n     states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace \n     and security, and looks forward to working closely with the \n     Executive Branch to achieve this vision.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 28--DESIGNATING THE YEAR 2005 AS THE ``YEAR OF \n                        FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY''\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 28\n\n       Whereas according to the 2000 decennial census of the \n     population, 9.3 percent of Americans speak both their native \n     language and another language fluently;\n       Whereas according to the European Commission Directorate \n     General for Education and Culture, 52.7 percent of Europeans \n     speak both their native language and another language \n     fluently;\n       Whereas the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     names foreign language study as part of a core curriculum \n     that includes English, mathematics, science, civics, \n     economics, arts, history, and geography;\n       Whereas according to the Joint Center for International \n     Language, foreign language study increases a student's \n     cognitive and critical thinking abilities;\n       Whereas according to the American Council on the Teaching \n     of Foreign Languages, foreign language study increases a \n     student's ability to compare and contrast cultural concepts;\n       Whereas according to a 1992 report by the College Entrance \n     Examination Board, students with 4 or more years in foreign \n     language study scored higher on the verbal section of the \n     Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) than students who did not;\n       Whereas the Higher Education Act of 1965 labels foreign \n     language study as vital to secure the future economic welfare \n     of the United States in a growing international economy;\n       Whereas the Higher Education Act of 1965 recommends \n     encouraging businesses and foreign language study programs to \n     work in a mutually productive relationship which benefits the \n     Nation's future economic interest;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for International Business \n     Education and Research program, foreign language study \n     provides the ability both to gain a comprehensive \n     understanding of and to interact with the cultures of United \n     States trading partners, and thus establishes a solid \n     foundation for successful economic relationships;\n       Whereas Report 107-592 of the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives concludes that \n     American multinational corporations and nongovernmental \n     organizations do not have the people with the foreign \n     language abilities and cultural exposure that are needed;\n       Whereas the 2001 Hart-Rudman Report on National Security in \n     the 21st Century names foreign language study and requisite \n     knowledge in languages as vital for the Federal Government to \n     meet 21st century security challenges properly and \n     effectively;\n       Whereas the American intelligence community stresses that \n     individuals with proper foreign language expertise are \n     greatly needed to work on important national security and \n     foreign policy issues, especially in light of the terrorist \n     attacks on September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas a 1998 study conducted by the National Foreign \n     Language Center concludes that inadequate resources existed \n     for the development, publication, distribution, and teaching \n     of critical foreign languages (such as Arabic, Vietnamese, \n     and Thai) because of low student enrollment in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas a shortfall of experts in foreign languages has \n     seriously hampered information gathering and analysis within \n     the American intelligence community as demonstrated by the \n     2000 Cox Commission noting shortfalls in Chinese proficiency, \n     and the National Intelligence Council citing deficiencies in \n     Central Eurasian, East Asian, and Middle Eastern languages: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that foreign language \n     study makes important contributions to a student's cognitive \n     development, our national economy, and our national security;\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) designates the year 2005 as the ``Year of Foreign \n     Language Study'', during which foreign language study is \n     promoted and expanded in elementary schools, secondary \n     schools, institutions of higher learning, businesses, and \n     government programs; and\n       (B) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to--\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\n       (i) encourage and support initiatives to promote and expand \n     the study of foreign languages; and\n       (ii) observe the ``Year of Foreign Language Study'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies, programs, and other activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 29--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                             ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. WARNER submitted the following resolution;

Res. 33\n\n       Whereas on November 15, 2004, the Government of Canada \n     opened a commercial hunt for seals in the waters off the east \n     coast of Canada;\n       Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the \n     seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the \n     European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins and the \n     subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;\n       Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of any \n     seal products;\n       Whereas in February 2003, the Ministry of Fisheries and \n     Oceans in Canada authorized the highest quota for harp seals \n     in Canadian history, allowing nearly 1,000,000 seals to be \n     killed over a 3-year period;\n       Whereas harp seal pups can be legally hunted in Canada as \n     soon as they have begun to molt their white coats at \n     approximately 12 days of age;\n       Whereas 95 percent of the seals culled over the past 5 \n     years were pups between just 12 days and 12 weeks of age, \n     many of which had not yet eaten their first solid meal or \n     learned to swim;\n       Whereas a report by an independent team of veterinarians \n     invited to observe the hunt by the International Fund for \n     Animal Welfare concluded that the seal hunt failed to comply \n     with basic animal welfare regulations in Canada and that \n     governmental regulations regarding humane killing were not \n     being respected or enforced;\n       Whereas the veterinary report concluded that as many as 42 \n     percent of the seals studied were likely skinned while alive \n     and conscious;\n       Whereas the commercial slaughter of seals in the Northwest \n     Atlantic is inherently cruel, whether the killing is \n     conducted by clubbing or by shooting;\n       Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt, but \n     escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never \n     recovered, and these seals are not counted in official kill \n     statistics, making the actual kill level far higher than the \n     level that is reported;\n       Whereas the commercial hunt for harp and hooded seals is a \n     commercial slaughter carried out almost entirely by non-\n     Native people from the East Coast of Canada for seal fur, \n     oil, and penises (used as aphrodisiacs in some Asian \n     markets);\n       Whereas the fishing and sealing industries in Canada \n     continue to justify the expanded seal hunt on the grounds \n     that the seals in the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the \n     recovery of cod stocks, despite the lack of any credible \n     scientific evidence to support this claim;\n       Whereas 2 Canadian Government marine scientists reported in \n     1994 that the true cause of cod depletion in the North \n     Atlantic was over-fishing, and the consensus among the \n     international scientific community is that seals are not \n     responsible for the collapse of cod stocks;\n       Whereas harp and hooded seals are a vital part of the \n     complex ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic, and because the \n     seals consume predators of commercial cod stocks, removing \n     the seals might actually inhibit recovery of cod stocks;\n       Whereas certain ministries of the Government of Canada have \n     stated clearly that\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\n     there is no evidence that killing seals will help groundfish \n     stocks to recover; and\n       Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless \n     commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned \n     international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the Government of Canada to \n     end the commercial hunt on seals that opened in the waters \n     off the east coast of Canada on November 15, 2004.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, according to the highly respected Humane \nSociety of the United States, HSUS, Canada's government has authorized \nthe slaughter of nearly 1 million seals over 3 years, 2004-2006, most \nof them between 12 days and 12 weeks old. This is the largest kill \nquota in history, which means that Canada is facilitating the \nartificial extension of an industry that has ceased to exist in most \ndeveloped countries.\n  Canada officially opened its 6 months commercial seal hunt on \nNovember 15, 2004, paving the way for hundreds of thousands of baby \nseals to be killed for their fur during the 2004-2005 season. Today, I \nam joined by Senators Collins, Lugar, Reed, Lautenberg, Feinstein, \nJohnson, Jeffords, Wyden, Cantwell, Dodd, Feingold, Durbin, Schumer, \nMurray, and Dorgan in submitting a resolution that urges the Government \nof Canada to end this senseless, inhumane slaughter. Last year, we \nsubmitted a similar resolution, which was favorably reported by the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Opposition to the seal hunt is mounting. Canada's own people don't \nsupport the hunt. Polling shows that 71 percent of Canadians--including \n60 percent of Atlantic Canadians--believe the seal hunt should be \nbanned outright or limited to seals over one year of age. Last week, \nCanada's conservative newspaper, National Post, called for an end to \nthe hunt. In January 2004, the Belgian government announced its \nintention to prohibit the sale of seal fur; and in November 2003, 166 \nmembers of the British House of Commons signed an Early Day Motion \nopposing Canada's seal hunt. That motion received strong support from \nBritain's Foreign Office Minister, Mike O'Brien. The American people \ndon't support it either. According to a 2002 poll conducted by Penn, \nSchoen and Berland, 79 percent of American voters oppose Canada's seal \nhunt; and the U.S. Government has gone on record in opposition to this \nsenseless slaughter, as noted in the attached, January 19, 2005, letter \nfrom the U.S. Department of State, in response to a letter Senator \nCollins and I wrote to President Bush, urging him to raise this issue \nduring his November 30, 2004 visit with Canadian Prime Minister Paul \nMartin.\n  In 2001, a group of independent veterinarians traveled to observe the \nseal hunt. What they witnessed was shocking to all who are concerned \nabout the humane treatment of animals. The images are difficult to \nenvision but harder to believe: skinning oflive animals and the \ndragging of live seals across the ice using steel hooks.\n  Few would argue that this industry still serves a legitimate purpose. \nEven in Newfoundland, where 93 percent of the hunt occurs, the economic \ncontribution of the seal hunt is marginal. Exports of seal products \nfrom Newfoundland account for less than one-tenth of one percent of the \nprovince's total exports. Is that worth the damage the seal hunt causes \nto Canada's reputation? Out of a population of over half a million \npeople, only about 4,000 Newfoundlanders participate in the hunt. \nThat's a total take home pay of well under $800 per sealer.\n  Many believe that it makes little sense to continue an industry that \nonly operates for a few weeks a year, in which the concentrated \nkillings takes place. Moreover, it employs only a few hundred people on \na seasonal, part-time basis.\n  The clubbing of baby seals can't be defended or justified, and Canada \nshould end it just as we ended the Alaska baby seal massacre 20 years \nago.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the January 19, 2005 letter from the \nU.S. State Department be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2005.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This is in response to your letter to \n     the President of November 24, 2004 regarding Canadian \n     commercial seal hunting. The White House has requested that \n     the Department of State respond. We regret the delay in \n     responding. Unfortunately, this letter was not received in \n     the Department of State until mid-December, well after the \n     referenced meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister \n     Paul Martin of Canada.\n       We are aware of Canada's seal hunting activities and of the \n     opposition to it expressed by many Americans. Furthermore, we \n     can assure you that the United States has a long-standing \n     policy opposing the hunting of seals and other marine mammals \n     absent sufficient safeguards and information to ensure that \n     the hunting will not adversely impact the affected marine \n     mammal population or the ecosystem of which it is a part. The \n     United States policy is reflected in the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) which generally prohibits, with \n     narrow and specific exceptions, the taking of marine mammals \n     in waters or lands subject to the jurisdiction of the United \n     States and the importation of marine mammals and marine \n     mammal products into the United States.\n       The United States has made known to the Government of \n     Canada its objections and the objections of concerned \n     American legislators and citizens to the Canadian commercial \n     seal hunt on numerous occasions over recent years. The United \n     States has also opposed Canada's efforts within the Arctic \n     Council to promote trade in sealskins and other marine mammal \n     products.\n       We hope this information is helpful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact us if we can be of assistance in this or \n     any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Nancy Powell,\n        (For Paul V.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nCollins, Akaka, Warner, Lieberman, Allen, Mikulski, Snowe, Johnson, \nDayton, Lautenberg, Kennedy, Durbin, Corzine, Landrieu, Bingaman, and \nMurray in submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress \nthat parity between Federal civilian pay and military pay should be \nmaintained.\n  During this unprecedented time in our Nation's history, both members \nof the uniformed services and civilian Federal employees are \nmaintaining our Nation's defenses, ensuring the security of the \nhomeland, and making remarkable contributions to the general welfare of \nthe United States. Pay parity among all those who serve our Nation \nappropriately recognizes the crucial work and honorable sacrifices of \nthe civilian Federal workforce. The contributions of civilian employees \nrange from Department of Defense employees working alongside the \nmilitary in hostile environments abroad to those at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services who consistently achieve critical \nbreakthroughs in science and medicine. The sacrifice of these \nindividuals is made evident by individuals such as CIA employee Mike \nSpann, the first casualty of the conflict in Afghanistan; Lawrence \nFoley, an employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development who \nwas assassinated by terrorists in Jordan; Joseph Curseen, Jr. and \nThomas Morris, Jr., postal workers who died as a result of the anthrax \nattacks of 2001; and many others.\n  Congress has demonstrated a bipartisan and longstanding commitment to \nthe principle of pay parity by providing for equal pay adjustments in \neach of the last three years and 17 of the last 19 years. The budget \nproposal presented to Congress for Fiscal Year 2005 included a 3.5 \npercent pay raise for members of the uniformed services, but only a 1.5 \npercent pay raise for our dedicated public servants. However, both \nHouses of Congress reaffirmed their support for equal pay by including \na 3.5 percent raise for both civilian and military employees in their \nrespective resolutions and relevant Fiscal Year 2005 appropriations \nbills.\n  Providing equitable pay raises for federal employees is not just an \nissue of fairness. It is also critical to recruiting and retaining \ntalented individuals in public service, and therefore, to successfully \nadministering important Federal programs. Our Federal Government is \nfacing a ``human capital'' crisis that threatens institutional \nexperience and knowledge at every level. Within the next five years, \nour government could lose up to half of its workforce to retirement. \nThese vacancies will occur in an era in which those entering the \nworkforce are far less likely to join public service. Numerous studies \nby groups such as the Partnership for Public Service and the Council \nfor Excellence in Government indicate that young Americans have \ndeveloped a more positive attitude towards government and politics in \nrecent years, but are still unlikely to consider government service as \na career. One way to address this looming crisis is to take tangible \nsteps to make Federal service more financially attractive.\n  I should note that despite the pressing need to draw more qualified \ncandidates to Federal service, the Federal Employee Pay Comparability \nAct (FEPCA)--designed to bring Federal pay in line with private sector \npay--has never been fully implemented. If we are serious about \nresolving our Federal workforce shortage issue, we must also begin a \nconversation about implementing FEPCA. At a minimum, however, we should \nrecognize the importance of civilian Federal employees by providing \nequal pay raises to all those who choose to serve our country. \nOtherwise we risk further reducing the number of qualified candidates \nwe can recruit to civilian federal jobs.\n  The dedication of both the uniformed services and our civilian \nemployees embody the greatness of our Nation, day in and day out, \nthrough their commitment to public service. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution so that the contributions of both are \nrecognized in an equitable manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S826-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1.

This bill \ncompletes the ambitious package of intellectual property legislation \nthat we undertook, along with our counterparts in the House of \nRepresentatives, to enact at the end of the 108th Congress. This is a \nbipartisan bill that makes important changes to our copyright laws and \nthat will help ensure the preservation of America's cultural heritage. \nToday's passage of this bill is testimony to the efforts of several in \nthis Chamber to ensure we make good law, capable of swift enactment, \nand for that I thank in particular the bill's cosponsors, Senators \nHatch, Feinstein, Alexander, and Cornyn.\n  The FECA bill is made up of four important provisions. Title I of the \nbill contains the ART Act, which will criminalize the use of camcorders \nto steal movies surreptitiously from the big screen. The second title \nof the bill is the Family Movie Act, which was designed to allow \nconsumers to view only those portions of movies, in their own homes, \nthat they want to. Title III of the bill contains the Film Preservation \nAct, legislation that I sponsored in the last Congress. The Film \nPreservation Act will allow the Library of Congress to continue its \nimportant work in preserving America's fading film treasures. What is \nmore, the bill will assist libraries, museums, and archives in \npreserving films, and in making those works available to researchers \nand the public. Finally, the bill contains the Preservation of Orphan \nWorks Act, which will correct a drafting error in the Sonny Bono \nCopyright Term Extension Act and will allow libraries to create copies \nof orphan works--copyrighted materials that are in the last 20 years of \ntheir copyright term, are no longer commercially exploited, and are not \navailable at a reasonable price.\n  I thank the cosponsors of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, \nand I hope the House of Representatives will move with dispatch to pass \nand send to the President this consensus legislation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, as we celebrate the extraordinary elections \nin Iraq, let us also recognize the historic progress being made by the \nPalestinian people toward democracy.\n  On January 9, for the first time in 9 years, Palestinians living in \nthe West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem voted in free and fair \nelections. They elected former Prime Minister Dr. Mahmoud Abbas, also \nknown as Abu Mazen, to be their President.\n  For the first time in 30 years, they cast their ballots for new \nleadership. It was a great moment for the Palestinian people. It was, \nas President Bush remarked, ``a key step toward building a democratic \nfuture.''\n  The election was also a powerful example to all who strive for \nfreedom. It proved that free and fair elections are not only possible \nin the Middle East, but the hope and right of all people. During his \ninaugural speech, President Abbas declared that:\n\n       The people have voted for the rule of law, order, \n     pluralism, the peaceful transfer of authority, and equality \n     for all.\n\n  I commend President Abbas for these important and inspiring words.\n  This election represents a genuine opportunity for peace. A \ndemocratic Palestinian Authority that rejects violence and embraces the \nrule of law is one of the most important building blocks for a viable, \nfree, and stable Palestinian state.\n  Israel also deserves praise for its support of the Palestinian \nelection. Israel provided important cooperation with the Palestinian \nAuthority to minimize delays at checkpoints. Israeli security forces \nwere also deployed away from Palestinian population centers.\n  The U.S. Government stands ready to work with the new Palestinian \nleadership to build the bridge to that hopeful future. With wise and \nprincipled leadership, Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side \nin peace.\n  The road ahead will be difficult. Yesterday, Hamas fighters shelled a \nJewish settlement in a purported retaliatory strike. I remain hopeful, \nhowever, that Palestinian and Israeli leadership will continue to work \ntogether to bring the peace. There is a roadmap. There is a will. With \nthe support of the international community, including the Arab world, \nboth sides will find the way.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 27) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 27\n\n       Whereas on January 9, 2005, for the first time in 9 years, \n     large numbers of Palestinians living in the West Bank, the \n     Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem voted in elections that were widely \n     described by outside monitors as free and fair;\n       Whereas the Palestinian people elected former Prime \n     Minister Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, to the \n     office of President of the Palestinian Authority;\n       Whereas an estimated 65 percent of eligible Palestinians \n     living in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem \n     participated in voting at over 1000 polling stations, and for \n     the first time in nearly 30 years, the Palestinian people \n     elected new leadership;\n       Whereas on January 9, 2005, President of the United States \n     George W. Bush stated that it was a ``historic day for the \n     Palestinian people and for the people of the Middle East'' \n     and that ``Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza \n     took a key step toward building a democratic future by \n     choosing a new president in elections that observers \n     described as largely free and fair'';\n       Whereas Israel provided important cooperation with the \n     Palestinian Authority to enable the holding of this election, \n     including minimizing delays at checkpoints and redeploying \n     Israeli security forces away from Palestinian population \n     centers;\n       Whereas the Palestinian election was an important step \n     towards democracy for the Palestinian people and an example \n     to all those in the region who are striving to achieve \n     democracy in their own nation;\n       Whereas during his inaugural speech, President Abbas stated \n     that ``The winner in these elections is the great Palestinian \n     people who have created this democratic epic and who will \n     safeguard it'', that ``The people have voted for the rule of \n     law, order, pluralism, the peaceful transfer of authority, \n     and equality for all'', and further ``Let us start \n     implementing the Roadmap'';\n       Whereas these comments build upon Mr. Abbas' 1993 \n     statements on the White House lawn, where he said that a \n     Palestinian state and an Israeli state could live in \n     ``peaceful coexistence and cooperation'';\n       Whereas the election of Mahmoud Abbas was hailed around the \n     world as a positive step opening new opportunities to move \n     toward peace between the Palestinian Authority and Israel;\n       Whereas the Palestinian election provided President Abbas \n     with a mandate from the majority of Palestinians to reject \n     violence and pursue peace with Israel;\n       Whereas the extent of cooperation between the Israelis and \n     Palestinians during the period leading up to and including \n     election day was unprecedented in the past four years and \n     reflects the potential for future cooperation;\n       Whereas the election must be followed quickly by concrete \n     steps on the part of the new Palestinian President to meet \n     his commitment to reform the Palestinian security services, \n     establish the rule of law, and do all in his power to combat \n     terrorism;\n       Whereas a democratic Palestinian Authority will serve as \n     one of the most important building blocks for a viable, free, \n     and stable Palestinian state;\n       Whereas President Abbas' success likely will depend upon \n     his ability to tangibly and quickly improve the quality of \n     life for Palestinians, and end corruption and violence;\n       Whereas the United States Government stands ready to work \n     with the new Palestinian President to facilitate a renewed \n     dialogue between the new Palestinian leadership and the \n     Government of Israel with the goal of achieving through the \n     Performance Based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict (the ``Roadmap''), \n     President George W. Bush's vision of two states, Israel and \n     Palestine, living side by side in peace;\n       Whereas the Roadmap, endorsed by the United States, Israel, \n     the Palestinian Authority, the European Union, Russia, and \n     the United Nations, remains the only realistic and widely \n     recognized plan for making progress toward peace;\n       Whereas the policy of the United States is to work toward a \n     just and peaceful resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli \n     conflict based on two democratic states, Israel and \n     Palestine, living side by side in peace and security;\n       Whereas all parties to the Roadmap have an obligation to \n     urgently provide support for the Palestinian Authority in its \n     efforts to confront and fight terror as well as to assist in \n     the creation of true democratic institutions that will \n     enforce the rule of law; and\n       Whereas people of all peaceful nations believe peace \n     between the Palestinian Authority and the state of Israel \n     will have far reaching positive effects on the entire region \n     and throughout the world; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that, on January 9, 2005, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, \n     also known as Abu Mazen, was elected by the Palestinian \n     people to the office of President of the Palestinian \n     Authority in what were widely described as free and fair \n     elections;\n       (2) recognizes this milestone in the development of \n     Palestinian democracy and congratulates President Abbas on \n     his election to the presidency of the Palestinian Authority;\n       (3) commends the efforts of the Israeli Government to \n     facilitate the election;\n       (4) expresses its respect for the freely expressed will of \n     the Palestinian people, and its intention to work with \n     President Abbas to help the Palestinian people realize the \n     opportunity for a more peaceful, prosperous future;\n       (5) urges President Abbas and the new Palestinian \n     leadership to abide by its commitments to reform the security \n     services, establish the rule of law, and press on with the \n     development of democratic institutions, including an \n     independent judiciary and an empowered and democratically \n     elected legislature;\n       (6) urges President Abbas to move quickly to honor his \n     pledges to halt violence and incitement against Israel, \n     dismantle terrorist organizations, and fulfill the \n     Palestinian Authority's obligations according to the terms of \n     the Roadmap;\n       (7) supports efforts to increase United States assistance \n     to the Palestinian people and to help President Abbas rebuild \n     and reform the Palestinian Authority's institutions, as \n     President Abbas takes actions consistent with the Roadmap, so \n     that they may better serve the Palestinian people;\n       (8) urges all members of the international community, \n     particularly all parties to the Roadmap, to take advantage of \n     this historic opportunity by providing timely assistance to \n     the new Palestinian Government as it moves forward to \n     implement the Roadmap, to help it build the necessary \n     political, economic, and security infrastructure essential to \n     establishing a viable, democratic state and improving the \n     lives of the Palestinian people;\n       (9) calls upon Arab states in particular to provide \n     political and financial support to the Palestinian Authority, \n     to support a complete end to terrorism against Israel, to end \n     incitement against it, and to reach out to the State of \n     Israel in friendship and full recognition;\n       (10) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     security of Israel as a democratic, Jewish state, and \n     supports the commitment of Israel to fulfill its obligations \n     under the Roadmap; and\n       (11) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     Roadmap including realization of the vision of two democratic \n     states, Israel and Palestine, living side by\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\n     side in peace and security, and looks forward to working \n     closely with the Executive Branch to achieve this vision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/02/01/senate-section/article/S831-1", "month": "02", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2005\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.
