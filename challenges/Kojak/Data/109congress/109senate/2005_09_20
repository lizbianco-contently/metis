If Senators have not contacted the \nmanagers about their amendments and no one comes to the floor to \npropose them, then the managers will be asking for third reading and \npassage of the bill.\n  We have a lot of work to do this fall. We need to use every day \nwisely, so Members should not delay with their amendments. I do thank \neveryone for their help and patience as we go through these \nappropriations bills.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this country is reminded virtually every \nmorning that we are at war. This morning we learned that additional \nAmericans--these, I believe, civilian contractors--have been killed in \nthe country of Iraq.\n  I have been listening in recent days to the discussions in the Senate \nand discussions from President Bush about where we find ourselves and \nwhat our obligations are. We not only are at war, we have just \nexperienced the most significant natural disaster in the history of \nthis country along the gulf coast, with a million people displaced from \ntheir homes. Yet the discussion in recent days from the President and \nothers is that nothing has changed. Nothing has changed. Our agenda is \nthe same.\n  I went back and pulled out a speech of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a \nfireside chat on April 28, 1942. I want to read what the discussion was \nby someone who provided, I thought, great leadership to this country at \na time of war. He said:\n\n       As we here at home contemplate our own duties, our own \n     responsibilities . . . our soldiers and sailors are members \n     of well disciplined units. But they are still and forever \n     individuals--free individuals. They are farmers, and workers, \n     businessmen, professional men, artists, clerks. They are the \n     United States of America. That is why they fight. We too are \n     the United States of America. That is why we must work and \n     sacrifice. It is for them. It is for us. It is for victory.\n\n  That is from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  The thing is, leadership is not about accounting or numbers. \nLeadership is calling this country together to say we are all in this \ntogether; yes, in a war, and in a response to a devastating hurricane. \nYet we continue to hear around this Chamber and at the White House: No, \nthings haven't changed. The agenda is the same. More tax cuts. Repeal \nthe death tax--which, incidentally, doesn't exist. There is no death \ntax.\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\nBut it is still a priority. We must repeal the death tax; tax work, \nexempt investment. Nothing really has changed.\n  The thing is, perhaps the President's agenda hasn't changed, but \neverything else has changed. Some years ago, 4\\1/2\\ years ago, we had a \nrobust economy. It was morning in America, as it would have been \nportrayed in 1984 in the Reagan commercials: ``Morning in America.'' We \nhad budget surpluses, we were told, and things were growing and we had \nbudget surpluses that would last 10 years. So the President, the new \nPresident, said let's provide very large tax cuts for a long period, \nthe bulk of which went to the highest income earners in America.\n  Some of us, and I, on this Senate floor, said maybe we should be a \nlittle bit conservative. What if something happens? After all, these \nbudget surpluses don't yet exist. They are projections. What if they do \nnot exist? What if they do not materialize? What if something happens \nin the interim?\n  ``Oh, be happy, don't worry,'' the President and others said. So the \nCongress passed very large tax cuts, and it was not long before some \nthings happened. We found ourselves in a recession. Then, very shortly \nwe found ourselves victims of a devastating attack by terrorists on 9/\n11/2001. Following that, we found ourselves in a war in Afghanistan, a \nwar in Iraq, and then we saw, instead of budget surpluses, the largest \ndeficits in history begin to grow in this country. Even as that \nhappened, we saw the dependency of this country on foreign oil continue \nto increase to now over 60 percent and headed toward 69 percent. \nFollowing that, of course, a natural disaster unlike any we have seen \nin this country, with a million people displaced, called Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  The response from the President? Nothing has really changed with \nrespect to his fiscal policy or his plans. We have spent over $200 \nbillion in Iraq and Afghanistan, all of it borrowed, none of it paid \nfor. It is anticipated we will spend somewhere close to $200 billion \nwith respect to Katrina and the natural disaster, the devastating \ndisaster. The question is, What do we do to pay for that? The President \nsays we can manage that. We can manage that.\n  We send soldiers abroad and ask for their sacrifice, but we ask \nnothing of the American people at the same time: Be happy.\n  There are legitimate questions being asked about the response to \nHurricane Katrina. But in my judgment we face a time when the question \nis not, Are we doing things right? The question is, Are we doing the \nright things? Are we on the right track? As I said, it is not about \naccounting; it is about leadership. It is about asking a country to \njoin in common purpose and asking a country to sacrifice. Sometimes \nleadership asks people to do things that are not popular at the moment.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt lifted a country out of a depression and \nlifted the spirits of the country in the middle of the Second World \nWar. He did that by being brutally honest with straight talk. He said \nto the American people: Here is what you must sacrifice. And he said: \nSacrifice is a privilege, when in this country, together, we go to war \nwith a need to be victorious over the oppression of the Nazis.\n  So he asked the American people for sacrifice. That is what \nleadership is about. It is about being honest. It is about straight \ntalk, which we have too little of today.\n  The truth is, this country is off course and we need to put it on \ncourse. The truth is, we have made some mistakes, all of us. We started \na war in Iraq because we said there were weapons of mass destruction in \nIraq. It appears there were not. The intelligence community provided \nthis information to us with great certainty, but now it turns out it \nwas wrong. The person who led the Central Intelligence Agency during \nthat period was given the Medal of Freedom after he retired, for \nreasons I will never understand.\n  But we are where we are. We now must ask more of the American people. \nIn my judgment, we should not just ask of our soldiers for their \nsacrifice. We are where we are and we must ask the American people for \ntheir sacrifice as well.\n  We had the largest tax cuts in the history of this country because we \nwere expected to have 10 years of budget surplus that was \nunprecedented. It turns out that was not accurate. It turns out things \nhappened that were not anticipated by this President and others, and \nthe result is we now have the highest deficits in history, not the \nhighest surplus in history. But now we are told that the tax cuts were \nnot for the purpose of giving back the surplus. That is what they were \ndesigned to do, and that is what we were told they were in 2001, but \nnow we are told the tax cuts are really about stimulating the economy. \nSo nothing ever really changes and now we have a hurricane, a \ndevastating hurricane that hits the gulf coast of this country \ndisplacing 1 million people, perhaps costing up to $200 billion.\n\n  We need to create kind of a Marshall Plan to rebuild and to tell \nthose folks we want to help you. Surely, if this country can \nreconstruct the country of Iraq, it can decide it is important to \nreconstruct this country. Any country that commits the billions of \ndollars we have to reconstruct the country of Iraq can reconstruct the \ngulf region of the United States of America. But we can't do that \nsaying nothing has changed and our priority remains tax cuts for \nAmerica's wealthy.\n  Cut spending; we should tighten our belt. I will support spending \ncuts. I believe all of us ought to tighten our belts. But if belt \ntightening, as it usually does, means withdrawing health care from poor \npeople and the kind of things that hurt most those who are poorest in \nthis country, that, in my judgment, is not advancing America's cause.\n  Warren Buffett, the second richest man in America and perhaps the \nworld, as far as I know, wrote an op-ed piece and said: By the way, \nwhen all these tax cuts proposed by the President are phased in--that \nis exempting income from investments and taxing work--I will pay a tax \nrate of one-tenth the tax rate that is paid by the receptionist in my \noffice.\n  So the question is, Are we willing as a country to sacrifice? Have \nsome things changed? Are we willing to change course? Are we willing to \ntake some risks? Is there some leadership, perhaps in the White House, \nmaybe in this Congress? After all, we are in this together. All of us \nwant the same thing for our country.\n  I take no pleasure in criticizing the President's program, nor the \nPresident and his actions. But I understand that our future is \ndependent on making right choices now. It is dependent on our deciding \nto look truth in the eye and to insist the President do the same and \nunderstand things have changed. That requires us to adjust course. It \nrequires us to ask of the American people that we have a common purpose \ntogether and work together and join together--yes, to support our \nsoldiers, to support those in the gulf region who are rebuilding, to \nsupport those in this country who have no health insurance, to support \nthose in this country who are jobless so we lift America up and make \nAmerica better. That is our responsibility.\n  That will not happen by a message coming from the White House or from \nthis Congress that nothing has changed, that our responsibility is to \ncontinue to press to see if we cannot give higher tax cuts, more tax \ncuts. At a time when we are borrowing money to fund a war and we are \ngoing to borrow money for reconstruction for Iraq, to give more tax \ncuts for the upper income people in America--why? Because those who do \nbelieve that America works when you dump something on top and it \nfilters down--that is called trickle down economics.\n  I had a guy in North Dakota write me some while ago who said: I have \nbeen listening to all this trickle down nonsense for a long time and I \nain't even damp.\n  The fact is, trickle down does not work. What works in this country \nis percolate up economics. You give the American people something to \nwork with: A job and opportunity and hope.\n  When America goes to work, America does just fine. But, as I said, \nyou have to look truth in the eye. And when this President says nothing \nhas changed, he is wrong. My hope is that Republicans and Democrats \nwill understand two things: Yes, we need to tighten our belts. Yes, we \nneed to cut some spending. Yes, we need to decide when we are going to \nhave to start paying taxes once again, and that we have a common \npurpose, and our common purpose\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\nought to be to work together and march together toward a common goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Friday, I joined 13 of my colleagues \nand went to view the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, \nLA, and Mississippi, It was a sight which I will never forget. This \ngreat bustling city of New Orleans is now a ghost town with hardly any \nactivity other than a few people returning to their homes trying to \nretrieve lost treasures left behind from the flood--trying to put their \nlives back together by gathering all of this water-laden debris and \ntossing it outside in the hopes they might save their structures.\n  We then went over to Mississippi where it was a stunning scene in \nvillage and community and town after town--to see subdivisions that \nhave been wiped away, to look down at what appeared to be 50 concrete \nslabs and to see no evidence of debris but evidence of destruction, all \ngone, scoured from the Earth by these horrible hurricane winds and \nwaves which consumed some of these communities.\n  A man in Pass Christian in Mississippi told us of the panic that set \nin when the remaining villagers went to the library with hurricane-\nproof windows, believing they might be safe, and then, as a 28-foot \nwave hit this library, thinking they all might drown right there in \nthat building at that moment. I can't imagine what that was like. I \ncan't imagine what it was like for so many who went through this \ndevastating experience. Some are trying to come to grips with their \nfuture and there lives.\n  The President came to the American people last week at Jackson Square \nin New Orleans and made a speech which I think will be important for \ngenerations to come. I was asked to react to it, and I said I think the \nPresident has given us an agenda that we have to follow--to rebuild the \ngulf coast, to rebuild the lives and the communities. But I believed \nthen, and I believe now, that the President's call for this unity as a \nnation and this community of caring also has to be called for fiscal \nresponsibility and accountability. We have to rebuild the gulf coast \nand help Katrina victims rebuild their lives. It is in our national \ninterest. It is part of our national character. We rally as Americans \nto help our fellow Americans.\n  But I have a real concern. Instead of the ``Big Easy,'' people are \ngetting a big uneasy feeling about where Katrina reconstruction effort \nis headed and who is in charge. Several published reports say the \nperson heading up the administration's Katrina rebuilding project is \nnone other than Karl Rove, the President's long-time political \ndirector. That is an incredible suggestion--that Karl Rove will have \nresponsibility for the Katrina reconstruction effort, the No. 1 \npolitician, the No. 1 political operative in the White House. Have we \nlearned nothing?\n  Consider what happened when Katrina struck. FEMA was not there. \nMichael Brown is now gone. But how did he get in a position to be in \ncharge of FEMA? It was because of political connections. He didn't have \nthe experience. He didn't have the resume. He didn't have the skills \nneeded when he faced the greatest natural disaster in our history. What \nwas his claim to this job to head FEMA? His claim was he was a college \nroommate of Joe Allbaugh, who happened to be the President's Chief of \nStaff and campaign director in Texas who, when he left the FEMA agency \nto become a consultant, turned it over to Michael Brown, his college \nroommate, to take over--this little daisy chain of politicians who \nplayed out with disastrous incompetence when Katrina struck.\n\n  Now this administration, instead of moving away from the politicians \nto the professionals when it comes to rebuilding, has decided that Karl \nRove is going to be in charge--the same Karl Rove who, just a few weeks \nago in a political speech, said the Democrats didn't share the \nRepublicans' zeal for stopping the war on terrorism; the same Karl Rove \nwho won't give us straight answers when it comes to his role in \nrevealing the identity of Valarie Plame, an undercover CIA operative, \nwhich disclosure of her identity not only endangered her life but the \nlives of many other career employees; the same Karl Rove who \nincidentally will take his mind off of the Katrina reconstruction \neffort long enough to go to North Dakota on this Saturday night for a \nbig political rally.\n  Is this the person we want in charge of $60 billion or $100 billion \nin reconstruction funds? I hope not. I hope the President reconsiders.\n  This is a troubling admission--that this administration doesn't have \nleadership to turn to in time of crisis, if the best the President can \nfind is his political adviser, Karl Rove, to deal with the disaster of \nKatrina.\n  What have we seen so far? The Wall Street Journal said last week:\n\n       The Bush administration is importing many of the contract \n     practices blamed for spending abuses in Iraq as it begins the \n     largest and costliest rebuilding effort in United States \n     history.\n\n  We know what happened in Iraq--no-bid contracts to Halliburton and \nthe buddies of this administration, contracts that have never been \ninvestigated by this Congress. And here they go again with Katrina and \nwith Karl Rove keeping his watchful eye on what is being done.\n  The Wall Street Journal article went on to say:\n\n       The first large-scale contracts awarded to Hurricane \n     Katrina, as in Iraq, were awarded without competitive \n     bidding, using so-called ``cost-plus'' provisions that \n     guarantee contractors certain profits regardless of how much \n     they spend.\n\n  It turns out that not only are there no-bid contracts, but \ncoincidentally they happen to be going to the clients of Joe Allbaugh. \nRemember that name? I mentioned him earlier. He was the President's \npolitical campaign director in Texas who became the head of FEMA and \nwho left to be a consultant, and is now making certain that his clients \nget $100 million no-bid contracts.\n  When is this going to end? When are we going to have true \naccountability? Once again, we see the same names coming out of \nHurricane Katrina--Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root--the names of Joe \nAllbaugh's clients who are, once again, coming up with these contracts.\n  If it wasn't bad enough, this morning's Washington Post, on the front \npage, tells the story of a Bush official arrested in a corruption \nprobe. It says:\n\n       The Bush administration's top Federal procurement official \n     resigned Friday and was arrested yesterday, accused of lying \n     and obstructing a criminal investigation into Republican \n     lobbyist Jack Abramoff's dealings with the Federal \n     Government. It was the first criminal complaint filed against \n     a government official in the ongoing corruption probe related \n     to Abramoff's activities in Washington.\n       The complaint, filed by the FBI, alleges that David H. \n     Safavian, 38, a White House procurement official involved \n     until last week in Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, made \n     repeated false statements to government officials and \n     investigators about a golf trip with Abramoff to Scotland in \n     2002.\n\n  The top official in the White House that was in charge of procurement \ninvolved in the Katrina effort not only resigned but was arrested for \nmisleading the Federal Government in terms of his involvement with the \nRepublican lobbyists.\n  Now the administration comes out and says they found just the person \nto look into the mistakes of Hurricane Katrina. It is a woman by the \nname of Frances Townsend. I do not know her. She may be a very \ncompetent individual. But how in the world can we get to the truth of \nthe question as to what went wrong with Hurricane Katrina? How can we \nreally hope to discover the incompetence that led to all of this human \nsuffering and devastation if the administration is going to investigate \nitself?\n  We know from 9/11 that the only way we got to the heart of the \nmatter, the critical questions about what went wrong on 9/11, was with \nan independent, nonpartisan commission. Yet this administration \nresisted the efforts of that 9/11 commission being created and today \nresists the efforts of an independent, nonpartisan commission to look \ninto what went wrong with Hurricane Katrina.\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter.) The Senator has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will conclude by saying this: We owe it to the victims and their \nfamilies and to the American people and the American taxpayers to get \nhonest answers about what went wrong with Katrina, and to put people in \ncharge to make certain that we don't waste the billions of dollars that \nare going to be spent in this reconstruction effort. Putting Karl Rove \nin charge makes no sense whatsoever. He has no resume and no skills \nother than running political campaigns. If he is being put in place to \nprotect the President politically, that decision does not serve the \nbest interests of the American people nor the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  It is time to get to the bottom of this. If Congress will not have an \nhonest investigation of what happened with Hurricane Katrina, we need \nto have this nonpartisan, independent commission like the 9/11 \nCommission to answer the questions about what went wrong and to make \ncertain that we don't replicate those mistakes in the expenditure of \nthese funds in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before Senator Durbin leaves the floor, he \nhas mentioned the 9/11 Commission. When he and I were first elected in \nthe Congress in 1982--to the House--we arrived at a time when Social \nSecurity was not just rumored to be in dire straits but was in very \ndire straits. And an earlier commission was created similar to the 9/11 \nCommission but different as well. The Republican Members were appointed \nby President Reagan. As I recall, the Democratic Members were appointed \nby Democratic Speaker, Tip O'Neill, and I think by Senator Robert Byrd. \nThe Blue Ribbon Commission was chaired by Alan Greenspan, with Members \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan, Robert Dole, and Claude Pepper, with whom we \nserved in the House. They worked for a whole year trying to couple a \ncombination of benefit cuts and revenue increases to enable us to put \nSocial Security on a sound footing for another quarter of a century. I \nthink that serves as a good role model as well as the 9/11 Commission, \nwhich Senator Durbin mentioned.\n  While he was on the floor, I wanted to remind him and us of that. But \nI think our first response to the catastrophe is to make sure that \npeople who need help get help.\n  First of all, get help in getting out of dangerous places to safe \nplaces, get help in reuniting families, get help in making certain \ntheir medical needs are met, having something to eat and drink, making \nsure the kids from K-12th grade are getting to the schools they need to \nget into, making sure students who have been displaced in college have \na chance to get back in a college or a university to continue their \nstudies without losing a quarter or a semester or a year, helping to \ncreate jobs and getting the economy moving in places that have been \ndestroyed or badly damaged. Those are the kinds of things that need to \nbe done and are being done.\n  While our startup was slow and disappointing, I believe, as time goes \nby, we are doing better. I commend all--not just in government, not \njust the first responders, not just the Guard, not just FEMA, which is \ndoing a better job today, but also a lot of folks who are giving of \nthemselves--volunteers from my State, and all other States, who have \ngone to the region, giving blood, and raising money in our home States, \nreceiving folks who have been displaced, to give them a home, a place \nto live, and a job for a while. Those efforts are to be commended. \nThose are the first responders. Maybe I should say second responders \nbecause the first responders were not even responding.\n  Second, last week, Senator Coburn, Senator Obama, and I spoke about \nthe introduction of legislation which is supported by Senator Frist, by \nSenator Reid, our respective leaders, to create a CFO--chief financial \nofficer--to serve as a watchdog so we don't find ourselves 6 months or \n12 months from now looking back to see that we spent X billions so \nfoolishly in response to Katrina, to make sure we get out ahead of this \nexpenditure as best we can rather than looking at it after the money \nhas already been spent, in some cases inappropriately.\n  The amount of money that is going to be spent in Katrina relief over \nthe next couple of months will dwarf the annual appropriations that go \nto most of our Federal departments. Every one of our Federal \ndepartments has a chief financial officer. We need to make sure, when \nwe are spending this much money this quickly to try to help a lot of \npeople in a hurry, that we spend it wisely.\n  It is a bipartisan issue. We believe one of the ways to make sure we \ndo that is to have a chief financial officer who is well qualified and \ncan get on the job and do the work quickly.\n  The third thing I mention is oversight. I serve on the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs. We have obvious oversight \nof a good deal of what is going on, including the Homeland Security \nDepartment, FEMA, the Coast Guard, and any number of responder \nagencies. We have a responsibility to do our oversight. We have begun \nthat oversight with hearings last week and informal hearings the week \nbefore that. We will continue this week and next week and on and on.\n  Our interest is in finding out what we did well, what we did \ncollectively--State, local, Federal, volunteer organizations, military, \nNational Guard, Armed Forces--and what we did not do well. Then, if \nthis happens again--and we have another hurricane that is trying to \nround the corner in Key West today--to make sure if this comes north \nand revisits again, whether New Orleans, God forbid, or Mississippi--\nthat we are better prepared to do more of the right things.\n  The last thing is the point Senator Durbin raised, the notion of an \nindependent commission. I was skeptical as to whether or not the 9/11 \nCommission would enable Congress to do much good with respect to \nrestructuring of our intelligence operations in this country. The \nintelligence operation in place had not been changed much for 50 years. \nI don't know if there was any reason to believe five Republicans and \nfive Democrats could somehow find common ground and entice the rest of \nCongress to do the same thing, to work with the President to change in \nsubstantial, far-reaching ways the way our intelligence community works \nin this country. They did, and the 9/11 Commission provides an \nexcellent template, role model, if you will, for how we should, once \nthe first surge of oversight activity and the successive waves of help \nand aid are out the door, proceed to make sure a couple months from now \nwe are in a position, whether it is five Republicans and five \nDemocrats--it could be a chairman appointed by the committee, a vice \nchairman appointed by our leadership, but to put in place a commission \nthat might have the kind of success not for us, and not just for them, \nbut for our country.\n  Success would be measured by better ensuring that a lot of the good \nthings that happened this time in response to Katrina happen the next \ntime--and we know there will be a next time--and we reduce the \nlikelihood that some of the same mistakes and foolish choices will be \nmade.\n  The American people would approve of that. It is great the President \nhas asked the Cabinet Secretaries to look at what they did within their \ndepartments to make sure what they did was right, it made sense, and \nwas appropriate. It is all well and good to have oversight here, but it \nwould be helpful to have an independent commission that could stand \nback, not distracted by other issues we are distracted with each day, \nand impartially--led by people such as Governor Tom Kean and former \nCongressman Lee Hamilton--with good staff and only with this issue to \nfocus on, and figure out what went well, what went badly, and how we \ncan do better next time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 12 minutes.\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Please indicate when 2 minutes are remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will talk this morning about helping \nall of Katrina's displaced schoolchildren. Each weekend when I go home \nto Tennessee, the people who elected me teach me about how we should be \ndoing our jobs in Washington, DC. This is not a lesson they shout from \nthe rooftops. It is a lesson they live by their own example, and we \nwould be wise to follow.\n  Two weeks ago in Maryville, my hometown, it was Al Gore flying a \nplaneload of evacuees from New Orleans into one of Tennessee's most \nRepublican counties. Nobody asked about anybody's politics. Everybody \njust pitched in to help.\n  Last weekend, members of the church where I am an elder, Westminster \nPresbyterian Church in Nashville, sent $80,000 and a truckload of \nclothes and Clorox to southern Mississippi. ``The Presbyterians are \nhere,'' one grateful Mississippi man relayed to his friends on his cell \nphone to say, ``and they have Clorox.'' When the Clorox was passed out, \nnobody asked if anybody was a Presbyterian.\n  And now this Sunday, the headline in the Tennessean, the Nashville \nnewspaper, was:\n\n       Private schools Welcome Those Displaced by Katrina.\n\n  According to the newspaper:\n\n       A growing number of private schools in Middle Tennessee [in \n     the Nashville area] . . . have volunteered to help students \n     displaced by Katrina. Many of them are also waiving or \n     drastically discounting tuition and fees for these students \n     and some also accept evacuees from public schools.\n\n  Continuing the quote, ``These children are in crisis. They have been \ndisplaced, but they have found a home,'' said the principal of Father \nRyan High School who has accepted 20 students and is trying to \naccommodate every student who shows up.\n\n  Father Ryan High School is waiving the $6,880 tuition, the $350 \nactivity fee, and the $500 in books for displaced students it simply \ncalls ``transfers.'' ``It's not all about money,'' said the principal. \n``There is no amount of money that equals being family,'' he said.\n  Public schools, by law, have to accept all children. And Tennessee's \npublic schools have made room for more than 3,000 of Katrina's \ndisplaced school children.\n  Our public schools have been greatly helped by these private schools, \nwho do not have to accept anybody. In Tennessee, private schools have \naccepted at least 400 students, and probably many more.\n  ``We couldn't sit quietly and do nothing. We felt a need to reach \nout,'' said the headmaster of Webb school in Bell Buckle, which is \nwaiving the $29,500 room and board for up to 30 students. ``No one \nflinched. Everybody just responded with, what can we do to help?'' said \nthe headmaster at Webb school in Bell Buckle.\n  Especially in Memphis and Shelby County, where so many displaced \nstudents have gone up the Mississippi River from New Orleans, the \nwillingness of private schools to accept these students is a huge help \nto overcrowded public schools.\n  In Baton Rouge, according to a report this morning on National Public \nRadio, there are 5,000 to 10,000 of these displaced private school \nstudents who have no school to attend. To accommodate them, the \nCatholic Diocese in Baton Rouge is struggling to establish satellite \nschools, some located great distances away, which these students will \nhave to attend at night.\n  These private schools that reach out are filling a huge need because \nthe four Louisiana parishes hit the hardest had nearly one-third, or \n61,000, of their 187,000 students in private schools, according to the \nU.S. Department of Education.\n  That is the story and the lesson from Tennessee.\n  The story in Washington last weekend, unfortunately, was different. \nAccording to Saturday's Washington Post, when the President proposed \ntemporary emergency disaster legislation that would help all of \nKatrina's 372,000 displaced school children during the rest of this \nschool year, the Senator from Massachusetts and some teachers' unions \nobjected. Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       I am extremely disappointed that [the President] has \n     proposed this relief using such a politically charged \n     approach. This is not [the] time for a partisan political \n     debate on vouchers.\n\n  I absolutely agree with that last sentence. This is not the time for \na partisan political debate on vouchers.\n  This is the time for those of us in the Senate to do what Tennesseans \nand Americans all across our country are doing: opening our arms and \nasking what we can do to help all displaced children not just some \nschool children.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows so well, Katrina displaced 20 times \nmore families than any natural disaster in the history of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. Mr. President, 372,000 of those displaced \npersons are children who were just beginning the K-12 school year, and \n73,000 more are college students.\n  The President has proposed $2.6 billion in funding for students in \nelementary and secondary schools and colleges. Under the President's \nproposal, colleges and universities would receive $1,000 for each \ndisplaced student enrolled; no person in an affected area in Louisiana, \nMississippi, or Alabama would have to pay interest on their student \nloans for the next 6 months; public school districts would receive up \nto 90 percent of the State's per-pupil expenditure, up to $7,500 per \nstudent; and $488 million would go to help displaced students who \nattend private schools.\n  The President is not throwing out a lifeline to just some displaced \nstudents. He is trying to help them all. The private schools in \nTennessee are not turning their backs. They are opening their arms. \nKatrina did not discriminate among children and neither should we. The \nonly politically charged approaches around here are coming from those \nwho oppose helping every child.\n  For Heaven's sake, this is not the beginning of some big, new voucher \nprogram. It is the beginning, hopefully, of a big, new 1-year effort to \nhelp children who are in desperate trouble. The best way to do it, in \nmost cases, is simply to let the money follow the child or the person \nwho needs help.\n  We have already approved vouchers that follow displaced persons for \nhousing in this exceptional case. Food stamps are vouchers, and they \nare helping in this exceptional case. No one is suggesting a displaced \nmother cannot take her Federal daycare voucher to a Catholic daycare \ncenter in these exceptional cases. No one is suggesting we cannot pay \nBoston College or Harvard University $1,000 for enrolling a displaced \nstudent who was set to attend Loyola or Xavier in New Orleans.\n  Scholars agree there is no constitutional issue here. So are we going \nto stand here and argue about old ideologies and leave these displaced \nchildren standing on the levee because the only doors that are open to \nthem for this 1 year happen to be to a private school?\n  At the end of World War II, a grateful Nation enacted the GI bill, \ngiving veterans scholarships for college. A lot of veterans had these \nvouchers for college but no high school degree. So thousands of \nveterans took their GI vouchers to Catholic high schools to earn their \nhigh school diploma. That did not create a big, new voucher program for \nhigh schools, this will not either. This is a one year exceptional \ndisaster relief program for kids from the gulf coast who desperately \nneed help.\n\n  The public schools are brimming over. They need help from private \nschools. I hope those who are objecting to helping all displaced school \nchildren will think again. We can have our debates about vouchers next \nyear when the floodwaters subside and the schools are open again. Right \nnow we need to be throwing out every lifeline we can for all of \nKatrina's displaced schoolchildren, not just some.\n  Mr. President, in Time magazine this week, there is a story on this \nsubject. It quotes Andrew Rotherman, a codirector of a think tank here \nand a former Clinton education adviser. Mr. Rotherman, who is not a fan \nof public school vouchers, says:\n\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\n\n       As a temporary initiative to help families in exceptional \n     circumstances, it's reasonable.\n\n  He is talking about the President's proposal. He says:\n\n       But if they use this disaster as a beachhead to establish a \n     longstanding voucher program in the Gulf region, it would be \n     wildly inappropriate.\n\n  I would agree. This is a temporary initiative to help families in \nexceptional instances.\n  Time goes on to say:\n\n       For evacuees, the constitutionality of assistance matters \n     far less than the assistance itself. The day before Katrina \n     hit, Albert and Anne Betz moved with Jane Todd, 10, and Owen, \n     7, out of soon-to-be-drowned Pass Christian, Miss., and into \n     a condo in Sandestin, Fla. Back home, Anne had taught at the \n     children's private Episcopal school, but the couple heard \n     that the best schools near Sandestin were public and were \n     happy with the one to which their kids were assigned. Within \n     days, however, Anne received a letter from the Walton County \n     School District stating that the onslaught of evacuees had \n     caused overcrowding, and her children would have to study \n     elsewhere. Now they are bused daily to one school, only to be \n     placed on a second bus to another. At this point, all Anne is \n     asking for is normality. ``It does not matter if it's private \n     or public school,'' she says. ``The most important thing is \n     my children's happiness.''\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire article from Time, and also the story from Sunday's \nNashville Tennessean about the generosity of private schools all across \nTennessee. I hope the example they are setting will be a good lesson \nfor all of us in this Chamber.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Time Magazine, Sept. 19, 2005]\n\n                    Public Bailout. Private Agenda?\n\n                          (By David Van Biema)\n\n       Houston Independent School District superintendent Abelardo \n     Saavedra's week started poorly, got worse and then, thanks to \n     the healing powers of federal dollars, took a turn toward the \n     jubilant. Saavedra's 305 schools are educating more of the \n     Gulf Coast's evacuee students than any other district in \n     Texas, which in turn is housing more evacuees than any other \n     state. On Tuesday, all that generosity seemed to backfire \n     when a group of Katrina kids billeted in the Astrodome \n     rumbled with local Texans at one of Saavedra's schools, \n     sending five students to jail and three to a hospital. The \n     scene did not recur, but by Thursday, Saavedra had an even \n     greater problem: math. The long-term cost of serving 4,700 \n     evacuee students, times an average estimated annual student \n     cost of $7,500, equals a total of $35.2 million--and the pre-\n     hurricane Bush Administration commitment was only 9% of pupil \n     cost.\n       On Friday, however, Saavedra was ecstatic. At a press \n     conference in one of the Houston district's middle schools, \n     Education Secretary Margaret Spellings announced that the \n     Federal Government would request $2.6 billion from Congress \n     to pay 90% of the average cost of educating each Katrina \n     student, whether publicly or privately, up to a ceiling of \n     $7,500 apiece. ``From 9% to 90%,'' Saavedra said afterward, \n     with the dazed elation of a lottery winner.\n       Spellings' announcement had a lot of school administrators \n     smiling--although a key component angered some of the \n     legislators who will eventually have to vote on it. A \n     proposed set-aside of $488 million for private schools \n     (which, if private-leaning evacuees seek out the kind of \n     education they left behind, would be mostly Catholic) \n     represents a historic federal bankrolling of those \n     institutions and their overtly religious subset, and it drew \n     quick fire from Democrats like Massachusetts Senator Edward \n     Kennedy. He pronounced himself ``disappointed'' that ``[Bush] \n     has proposed. . . relief using such a politically charged \n     approach,'' while California Representative George Miller \n     complained that ``to launch a new private-school voucher \n     program in the midst of a disaster response creates a \n     quagmire that could hinder rather than expedite the return to \n     school for tens of thousands of students.''\n       The ramifications of Spellings' bombshell will take months, \n     if not years, to sort out, but most agree that a major \n     federal foray into emergency school funding was desperately \n     needed. The fate of 372,000 displaced children is at least as \n     important to the nation as the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast, \n     and unlike the payment of rebuilding costs, education isn't a \n     choice--it's a government guarantee. Yet for days it appeared \n     the feds might foist much of the obligation on state \n     school systems, 47 of which are hosting Katrina students. \n     Most evaluated the problem and decided to teach first and \n     ask questions later. ``If that 6-year-old kid coming off \n     that transport plane was yours, how would you want him \n     taken care of?'' Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee asked \n     TIME. Huckabee hopes for federal reimbursement, ``but if \n     not, we will have done the right thing, and I believe we \n     will have no regrets about how we handled matters.''\n       But Huckabee was tutoring only 1,755 Katrina kids. Texas \n     has 41,000, with 19,000 more expected to arrive. Those \n     numbers left some state officials skeptical that the feds \n     would really come through. Comptroller Carole Strayhorn, who \n     will run against incumbent Rick Perry in the state's \n     Republican gubernatorial primary, challenged him to ask the \n     legislature for $1.2 billion in hurricane-related funds. (He \n     declined.) Texas educators are worried that they will be \n     punished in the form of even less federal cash if Katrina's \n     influx keeps them from meeting the conditions of Bush's No \n     Child Left Behind Act and an earlier law that benefits the \n     children of the homeless.\n       Spellings' proposal eased those tensions while creating \n     others, most sharply over the possible erosion of the church-\n     and-state barrier. Her department noted that in Louisiana's \n     flood-impacted communities, 25% of the students had been \n     enrolled in private schools--should government simply ignore \n     them? ``We are not provoking a voucher debate,'' Spellings \n     contended, ``as much as trying to provide aid for these \n     displaced families, whether they have been in private schools \n     or public schools.'' Her proposal seems carefully crafted to \n     avoid substantive constitutional objections. Although it \n     calls for the distribution of the public-school funds \n     primarily through districts, the private-school money is \n     directed not to schools but to families, in keeping with the \n     concerns of the 2002 Supreme Court decision allowing private-\n     school vouchers so long as the parents retain a ``true \n     private choice'' as to where their children learn.\n       Nonetheless, the proposal represents a major, if legal, \n     shift toward government activism. According to Chester E. \n     Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, \n     which promotes school reforms, the number of children \n     receiving government money for private school is roughly \n     30,000, with a ``handful'' involving federal funds. The \n     Spellings plan assumes roughly 60,000 federally funded \n     private-school placements. Finn, an Assistant Education \n     Secretary under Ronald Reagan, approves of it as \n     ``compassionate and constitutional.'' Andrew Rotherman, a co-\n     director of a think tank called the Education Sector and a \n     former Clinton education adviser, says the proposal's \n     eventual legitimacy may depend on details Spellings has not \n     yet made available. ``As a temporary initiative to help \n     families in exceptional circumstances, it's reasonable,'' he \n     says. ``But if they use this disaster as a beachhead to \n     establish a longstanding voucher program in the Gulf [Coast] \n     region, it would be wildly inappropriate.''\n       For evacuees, the constitutionality of assistance matters \n     far less than the assistance itself. The day before Katrina \n     hit, Albert and Anne Betz moved with Jane Todd, 10, and Owen, \n     7, out of soon-to-be drowned Pass Christian, Miss., and into \n     a condo in Sandestin, Fla. Back home, Anne had taught at the \n     children's private Episcopal school, but the couple heard \n     that the best schools near Sandestin were public and were \n     happy with the one to which their kids were assigned. Within \n     days, however, Anne received a letter from the Walton County \n     School District stating that the onslaught of evacuees had \n     caused overcrowding, and her children would have to study \n     elsewhere. Now they are bused daily to one school, only to be \n     placed on a second bus to another. At this point, all Anne is \n     asking for is normalcy. ``It does not matter if it's private \n     or public school,'' she says. ``The most important thing is \n     my children's happiness.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Tennessean, Sept. 18, 2005]\n\n           Private Schools Welcome Those Displaced By Katrina\n\n                          (By Claudette Riley)\n\n       Teresa Castellon is more than 500 miles from her parents, \n     her friends, her flooded New Orleans home and the now-closed \n     private school she was attending just three weeks ago.\n       The sophomore was eager to go back to class. But, after \n     years of going to private schools--and with so much of the \n     rest of her life up in the air--she just couldn't handle \n     making the switch to public schools right now.\n       Luckily, she didn't have to.\n       A growing number of private schools in Middle Tennessee, \n     including the prestigious Webb School that Teresa now \n     attends, have volunteered to accept students displaced by \n     Hurricane Katrina. Many of them also are either waiving or \n     drastically discounting tuition and fees for these students, \n     and some also accept evacuees from public schools.\n       ``It just happened immediately. They're just really \n     welcoming and accepting,'' said Teresa, 15, one of four \n     evacuees now attending the private boarding school for grades \n     6-12. ``The students and teachers are very nice and always \n     want to help us with whatever we need.''\n       At lease 50 private schools in Tennessee--including the 22 \n     Catholic elementary, middle and high schools in the \n     Midstate--have expressed a willingness to help. No one is \n     required to track displaced students who enroll in private \n     schools statewide, but 390 have enrolled in the dozen or so \n     schools that reported their numbers to the state Department \n     of Education.\n       Some schools have room only for a few. Others, including \n     Father Ryan High School in Nashville, are trying to \n     accommodate all who show up.\n       ``Our school's mission is to be an example of the living \n     gospel, and these children are in crisis. They have been \n     displaced, but they have found a home,'' said Jim McIntyre, \n     principal of the 995-student Father Ryan\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\n     High, which has 20 displaced students. ``Even though we don't \n     know these people, we know these people. We are these \n     people.''\n       The high school is waiving the $6,880 tuition, the $350 \n     activity fee and the $400 to $600 in books for displaced \n     students it simply calls ``transfers.''\n       ``It's not all about money. There's no amount of money that \n     equals being family,'' he said, noting that the school has \n     accepted Catholic and non-Catholic students. ``I've told \n     these families that they're a blessing to us because they're \n     giving us a chance to live our mission.''\n       Private schools don't fall under the federal law that \n     requires public schools to immediately enroll displaced \n     students and give them busing, free meals and any required \n     services. However, many private schools are opening their \n     doors and going the extra mile anyway.\n       ``We couldn't sit quietly and do nothing. We felt a need to \n     reach out,'' said Albert Cauz, headmaster of Webb School, \n     which is waiving the $29,500 room and board for up to 30 \n     students. ``No one flinched. Everybody just responded with \n     `What can we do to help?' ''\n       The boarding school south of Nashville even allowed Teresa \n     Castellon's little sister, Madeline, to stay in her private \n     dorm room even though she's too young to attend the school. \n     The fourth-grader attends nearby Cascade Elementary and has \n     found a surrogate family in the Webb faculty members, who \n     regularly invite her to dinner and take her on outings.\n       ``I like it here,'' said Madeline, 9, who misses her \n     parents, involved in salvaging and rebuilding their home in \n     New Orleans.\n       The private schools that do reach out are filling a huge \n     need because the four Louisiana parishes hardest hit by the \n     storm had an above-average number of students enrolled in \n     private school. They had 61,000 of the 187,000 students \n     there, or roughly 32% of students in kindergarten through \n     grade 12, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n       Shane Persich, 17, said his New Orleans school, Brother \n     Martin High, is underwater and he appreciated being able to \n     go to Father Ryan. He started his senior year at the all-boys \n     school shortly before his family evacuated and ended up in \n     Nashville, where they're staying with family.\n       ``I like it a lot but sometimes after class you get a \n     little lonely. I do. And you want to go home but then you \n     don't want to be home.'' he said, adding that his home has \n     severe wind damage. ``Your senior year you're supposed to \n     rule the school. Now it's like starting all over again.''\n       Many displaced students who enroll in private and public \n     schools don't have access to their medical or academic \n     records so counselors have to help them reconstruct their \n     transcripts and find classes they need to graduate.\n       ``We want to get their schedule identical to the one they \n     had. We don't know if they're going to be here on week, two \n     weeks or a year,'' said Connie Hansom, Father Ryan's director \n     of admission, who assigns two students ambassadors to help \n     each displaced student. ``We do whatever we can do to make \n     them feel a part. We don't want them to stand out.''\n       Olivia Milton, a sophomore at Father Ryan, will soon return \n     to Covington, La, because her all-girls Catholic high school \n     is reopening and taking in students from surrounding high \n     schools. She said her time at Father Ryan and the way she was \n     welcomed will help her reach out to the displaced students \n     who transfer into her high school back home.\n       ``I'll get to return the favor,'' said Olivia, 15, who will \n     be back in Louisiana in the coming weeks. ``I like it a lot \n     here. I don't want to go back.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on Thursday, at 3 o'clock, the Education Subcommittee \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee will be holding \na hearing on helping all of Katrina's displaced schoolchildren, with \nthe hopes that we can come up with a temporary exceptional way to do \nthis, not as a way of establishing a long-term change in Federal \npolicy, but as a way of helping all schoolchildren today who were \ndisplaced by Katrina who need help--whether they are going to public \nschools or private schools.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we have all been saddened to see the \nimages of Hurricane Katrina's devastation. I know the Presiding Officer \nhas seen more of these images than perhaps anyone in the Senate. We \nhave seen images of children who have lost their parents and families \nwho have lost their homes. These images break the heart of every \nAmerican.\n  Hurricane Katrina created an area of destruction that is 90,000 \nsquare miles, roughly the size of Great Britain. Homes have been \nleveled, roads are unusable, bridges have crumbled, and hundreds of \nthousands of lives will be forever changed.\n  As the chairman of the Commerce Committee's Disaster Prediction and \nPrevention Subcommittee, I traveled with the Coast Guard to the gulf \ncoast earlier this month. We viewed the coasts of Mississippi, Alabama, \nand Louisiana.\n  What became immediately clear to me was that television cannot \naccurately convey what happened. The devastation is massive and \ncomprehensive. Seeing a home demolished on television begins to \ncommunicate the tragedy, but seeing 60 to 70 miles of that repeated \nover and over again is heartbreaking and almost impossible to \ncomprehend.\n  As we can see from these slides, beginning in New Orleans, during the \nhelicopter trip, from a distance, we could see the waters covering \neverywhere. From a few feet above the water, you could also smell the \ncontamination from oil and sewage. It is unbelievable what the folks \nthere are having to deal with.\n  To continue, at the time, the water was still up to the rooftops. The \nCoast Guard captain who was with me told me when they first arrived the \nday after the hurricane, about 70 percent of these roofs had people on \nthem who needed to be rescued.\n  We became very aware that we had two disasters: in New Orleans, \ncontinued flooding; and along the entire coast of Mississippi, it was \nas though a hand had wiped everything off a table. Everything was \ncompletely destroyed. Not a house along the beaches was either there or \ninhabitable. And we continued to see the same thing all along the \ncoast.\n  Again, television can capture one or two homes, but the concretelike \n``gravestones'' showed where homes used to be, and trees are already \ndying from the saltwater, which will damage the whole coastal area for \nmany years to come.\n  These are completely different disasters and different challenges for \nour first responders.\n  In Mississippi, the houses themselves have been demolished by the \nwind and storm, as we can see. In New Orleans, the flooding has \nseverely damaged the homes.\n  One thing both locations have in common is that the homes will never \nagain be inhabitable. The wind-damaged homes, those that still stand, \nwill likely be declared a complete loss.\n  In New Orleans, the homes that were flooded are permanently damaged \nand are beyond repair.\n  One of the positive stories that is often lost in this tragedy is the \namazing work performed by first responders, especially those from the \nU.S. Coast Guard.\n  Working hours on end in awful conditions, they rescued thousands of \npeople and are, without question, true heroes. I visited the Coast \nGuard aviation training center in Mobile, AL, which was transformed \nfrom a few hundred personnel before the storm to nearly 1,200 personnel \nafter the storm. The Coast Guard sent people from all around the Nation \nto run rescue operations 24 hours a day. Coast Guardsmen from all over \nthe Nation, as far away as Alaska, answered the call and came to the \nrescue of their fellow citizens. To date, first responders have been \nresponsible for saving approximately 49,000 lives, 33,000 by the Coast \nGuard alone. That is more than six times the number they saved in all \nof 2004.\n  The impact to the coast is going to be a long-term issue. The storm \nhas had a significant impact on the trees in the region. You can see \nsignificant portions of the area along the coastline where trees are \ndead. These trees were a natural obstacle to erosion, and now that \nprotection will be missing for a number of years. Boats can be seen \namong the trees far inland. The gulf coast is our Nation's largest \nprovider of shrimp and oysters. Their way of life has been destroyed. \nIt was clear from the boats I saw stranded inland, sometimes on \nrooftops, that the gulf's fishing industry will need years to recover. \nBut while Hurricane Katrina was certainly one of the worst disasters to \never hit our Nation, it has also brought out the greatest outpouring of \ncompassion from American citizens.\n  In my State of South Carolina, families have opened their wallets and \nhomes to affected people. Our State knows all too well the tragic \neffects hurricanes can bring, and we have often been the recipient of \nhelp from\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\nother States. We remember the show of support from the gulf when we \nwere struck by Hurricane Hugo, and South Carolinians have not been \nhesitant to come to the gulf's rescue. Well over 2,000 South Carolina \nfamilies have contacted our Red Cross to offer whatever assistance is \nneeded. It is now estimated that up to 5,000 evacuees are being hosted \nin South Carolina, either by individual families or in shelters such as \nthe Palmetto Expo Center in Greenville.\n  The South Carolina National Guard has also joined in the relief \neffort. Nearly 350 of them have been to the gulf to help. Countless \nchurches and civic organizations have taken their own initiatives to \norganize relief efforts. From fundraising drives to collections and \ndelivery of supplies, to driving to the region to volunteer in any \ncapacity needed, the people of South Carolina have risen to the \noccasion. This show of support is so encouraging to me about our State \nand the state of our Nation. Americans are caring and compassionate, \nand we will work side by side with our fellow citizens to rebuild and \nbring hope back to the gulf coast.\n  This afternoon my Subcommittee on Disaster Prevention and Prediction \nwill be hearing from the Director of the National Hurricane Center and \nwitnesses from the gulf coast region on what the Government got right \nin advance of the storm and how we can replicate that in the future to \nprotect our Nation's coastal communities. Our most powerful defense \nagainst hurricanes is accurate prediction and effective evacuation. I \nlook forward to their testimony and am confident it will provide \nimportant lessons for America's emergency planners.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1732\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise to speak about efforts \nto resume normal beef trading relationships with Japan. I thank my \ncolleagues from my neighboring beef States for their leadership and \nsupport and so many others for their efforts in seeking a bipartisan \nresolution to this matter.\n  As I travel through Nebraska, attending events and participating in \nsummer parades throughout the largely rural landscape, I am constantly \nreminded of the importance of our beef industry. Prominently displayed \non many vintage cars and pickup trucks are generic black and yellow \nlicense plates that boast a clear message--``Nebraska, the Beef \nState.'' While it is unlikely any modern day automobile in Nebraska now \nor in the future will sport that yellow and black plate of old, our \nbillboard slogan, ``the Beef State,'' is still the message people \nequate with Nebraska.\n  I am here to address an important amendment that will suspend the \nrulemaking process the United States Department of Agriculture has \nproposed and published in the August 18, 2005 printing of the Federal \nRegister in a rule entitled ``Importation of Whole Cuts of Boneless \nBeef from Japan.'' The formal public comment period was closed \nyesterday so prompt Senate action is imperative. At the time the rule \nwas published, the Nebraska Cattlemen, a grassroots organization whose \nindividual producer members determine issues of importance to the \nNebraska beef industry, wrote to me to request a stepped-up effort to \nconvince Japan to resume imports of United States beef. In their letter \nthey stated:\n\n       [n]ormalization of beef trade must be progressively pursued \n     because it impacts the state's economy and because \n     responsible trading partners treat each other fairly and \n     justly.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       [t]rade should not be based on politics and protectionism.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. Trade must be based on fair play. Free trade \nmust include a vision of fair trade. I am going to step back a moment \nto state why this is so important to me and the hard-working cattle \nproducers and beef processors in my State. In the beef State, cattle \noutnumber people four to one and more than one of every five steaks and \nhamburgers in the Nation comes from my State. According to USDA, \nNebraska ranks first in commercial cattle slaughter, processing over 4 \nmillion metric tons of beef and beef products in 2004. Nationally, the \nnumbers are even more compelling. The U.S. beef industry is worth an \nestimated $175 billion, with cattle producers conducting business in \nall 50 States and operating 800,000 individual farms and ranches. The \neconomic impact of the beef industry contributes to nearly every county \nin the Nation, and they are a significant economic driver in rural \ncommunities.\n  Demand for beef continues to increase, up nearly 20 percent since \n1998. With 94.9 million cattle reported to be in the United States as \nof January 2004, there are 1.4 million jobs directly attributed to the \nbeef industry. It is not a surprise that both the National Cattlemen's \nBeef Association and R-Calf United Stockgrowers of America have weighed \nin on the significance of their industry and the importance of having \naccess to valuable markets throughout the world. With beef and beef \nvariety meat exports accounting for approximately $3.8 billion in 2003 \nalone, it is important to recognize NCBA's and R-CALF USA's statements \non the USDA proposed rule that is the subject of my amendment.\n  On August 22, R-CALF USA stated that this is an example of ``USDA \ntilting the playing field away from independent U.S. cattle producers \nby continuing to give market access before we gain market access.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the R-CALF USA statement be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 R-CALF United Stockgrowers of America\n\n\n              APHIS' Plan to Lift Japan Beef Ban Premature\n\n       R-CALF USA expressed disappointment with the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health \n     Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) proposed rule titled \n     ``Importation of Whole Cuts of Boneless Beef from Japan,'' \n     published in Thursday's Federal Register (70 Fed. Reg. \n     48,494) to amend the agency's regulation for the importation \n     of meat and other edible animal products that would allow \n     Japan to export boneless cuts of beef to the United States.\n       ``This is another example of the USDA tilting the playing \n     field away from independent U.S. cattle producers by \n     continuing to give market access before we gain market \n     access,'' said R-CALF USA President and Co-Founder Leo \n     McDonnell.\n       ``In addition, USDA has yet to implement the scientifically \n     recommended measures to prevent the potential for BSE \n     amplification if it is introduced through imports,'' said \n     Missouri veterinarian and R-CALF USA Region VI Director Max \n     Thornsberry. ``USDA's own scientists have strongly and \n     consistently advised the agency to strengthen the U.S. feed \n     ban by prohibiting plate waste from cattle feed before the \n     U.S. lifts its ban on imported beef from any country where \n     BSE exists.''\n       Thornsberry, who also chairs the R-CALF USA Animal Health \n     Committee, explained that the plate waste loophole would \n     allow the uneaten portions of imported beef from BSE affected \n     countries served at domestic restaurants to potentially enter \n     the food chain for U.S. cattle. Although Japan currently \n     performs a BSE test on all cattle\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\n     slaughtered for human consumption, nothing in this rule \n     indicates importation of beef from Japan would be required to \n     cease if Japan decides to stop testing for BSE.\n       ``Ironically, while the USDA ignores this potential pathway \n     for BSE infectivity, Japan has prohibited the feeding of \n     plate waste to cattle since 2002. Japan has gone much further \n     in developing systems to prevent exposure of cattle to BSE by \n     prohibiting the feeding of blood meal and poultry meal.''\n       Thornsberry explained that while Japan did not have a feed \n     ban in place prior to 2001, it has since adopted the most \n     stringent BSE risk-mitigation measures recommended by \n     science, and will likely eradicate the disease from its \n     cattle herds long before countries like Canada, which has \n     chosen not to adopt stringent risk-mitigation procedures. \n     Canada has chosen to implement only the minimal BSE-\n     protection measures, despite recognition of multiple cases of \n     the disease in Alberta.\n       ``It is a real irony that while USDA supports its proposed \n     rule based on the fact that Japan conducts BSE tests on all \n     cattle slaughtered in Japan, thereby ensuring that BSE-\n     infected cattle are removed from the food chain, the agency \n     continues to prohibit U.S. packers from voluntarily testing \n     for BSE to meet Japan's testing requirements, and as a means \n     of restoring other U.S. export markets,'' said Thornsberry.\n       ``The U.S. cattle industry deserves consistent and science-\n     based standards from USDA, but this proposed rule is \n     inconsistent with what the agency has stated are necessary \n     standards for reopening U.S. export markets with countries \n     the agency considers to be minimal risk for BSE,'' said \n     McDonnell.\n       McDonnell explained that in January 2005, USDA published a \n     major rule that set criteria for determining whether imports \n     from a country would present a minimal risk of introducing \n     BSE into the United States. While R-CALF USA has shown those \n     criteria are insufficient, USDA now proposes to ignore its \n     own rule and allow imports from countries that do not meet \n     the minimal-risk criteria.''\n       Thornsberry also expressed concern about USDA's action.\n       ``It is obvious from this rule that the USDA intends to \n     open the U.S. market to countries that have identified cases \n     of BSE within their domestic herds,'' he explained. ``It was \n     thought that BSE affected countries would have to meet the \n     same requirements placed upon Canada, and thus be classified \n     as minimal risk countries prior to being cleared to export \n     into the U.S. marketplace. That does not appear to be the \n     case.\n       ``If the United States does not take a leadership role in \n     upwardly harmonizing global import and export standards for \n     beef from countries affected by BSE, the U.S. will become the \n     dumping ground for beef from countries that have BSE endemic \n     within their cattle herds,'' Thornsberry said.\n       Also disappointing about USDA's proposed rule is that it \n     clearly shows how the agency is subjecting U.S. cattle \n     producers to a double standard. The proposed rule requires \n     Japan to certify that exported beef was born, raised, and \n     slaughtered in Japan.\n       ``This is the very definition of origin that USDA found so \n     objectionable in the Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling (M-\n     COOL) law passed by Congress in the 2002 Farm Bill and \n     intended to benefit U.S. cattle producers,'' said McDonnell. \n     ``USDA has repeatedly claimed there is no food-safety basis \n     for COOL and that the `born, raised and slaughtered' standard \n     is both unnecessary and unworkable. Yet, in its proposed \n     rule, USDA is using the `born, raised, and slaughtered' \n     standard in COOL to assure the safety of Japanese beef, for \n     the benefit of the Japanese cattle industry. This is the type \n     of inconsistent treatment of the U.S. cattle industry that \n     continues to erode industry confidence in the USDA.''\n       ``USDA cannot--with complete disregard for established \n     science--keep moving the bar to suit its political agenda,'' \n     Thornsberry emphasized. ``It is a disservice to our trading \n     partners, a disservice to U.S. cattle producers, and a \n     disservice to global trade relations.\n       USDA will consider public comments on its Proposed Rule \n     that are submitted before or on Sept. 19. For more \n     information on making comments, or to view the Proposed Rule, \n     please visit www.r-calfusa.com and click on ``BSE-\n     Litigation.''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I also have a statement from NCBA in reaction \nto the rule that states it ``will not support finalization of this \nproposed rule until Japan has completed its process and accepts beef \nfrom the United States.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the NCBA statement, dated August 19, \n2005, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n NCBA Statement on USDA Proposed Rule To Allow Boneless Beef From Japan\n\n                            (By Jim McAdams)\n\n       Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture published a \n     proposed rule in the Federal Register titled: Importation of \n     Whole Cuts of Boneless Beef from Japan.\n       NCBA will not support finalization of this proposed rule \n     until Japan has completed its process and accepts beef from \n     the United States. Until both countries can agree to World \n     Organization for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines, any beef \n     product coming into the United States should meet the same \n     requirements Japan has set for us.\n       This proposed rule would allow imports of boneless beef \n     from Japan into the United States if the product meets all \n     U.S. safety standards, including removal of specified risk \n     material. Historically, annual beef imports from Japan have \n     been very small, averaging 19,000 pounds in recent years, an \n     amount equal to approximately one-half of one semi-trailer \n     load. The highest level was 33,510 pounds in 1999, which is \n     less than what one semi-trailer can haul. This Japanese \n     product has averaged $45 per pound.\n       The publication of this proposed rule begins the U.S. rule-\n     making process to fulfill our part of the framework agreement \n     announced October 23, 2004 by U.S. and Japanese officials.\n       There is no scientific basis for continued restrictions on \n     boneless beef when safeguards are in place. BSE infectivity \n     has never been found in muscle tissue. For these reasons, the \n     United States has repeatedly called on Japan to open the \n     border to U.S. beef, and NCBA calls for this action \n     simultaneous to allowing imports of Japanese beef into the \n     United States.\n       NCBA will continue our aggressive push for the complete re-\n     opening of all export markets for U.S. beef. At NCBA's \n     continued urging, re-establishing beef exports is at the top \n     of the trade agenda at the White House, USDA and Congress. \n     The President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Agriculture, \n     U.S. Trade Representative and several senators and \n     congressmen are actively pursuing this goal. NCBA also has \n     traveled to Japan to meet with government officials to give \n     them the assurances they need that U.S. beef is safe from \n     BSE.\n       NCBA will not rest on this issue until there is \n     harmonization of beef trade based on science. The framework \n     agreement states, the ``two countries will resume two-way \n     trade in beef and beef products, subject to their respective \n     domestic approval processes, based upon science.''\n       NCBA members believe our beef has every right to compete \n     for its share of the 96 percent of the world's population \n     that lives outside the United States. Not only do U.S. cattle \n     and beef producers produce the best beef in the world, \n     scientists agree beef is safe from BSE.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Over the past few days, much has been done to \nelevate the discussion on the need to resume a normal trade \nrelationship with the Government of Japan. Last week I joined \nCongressman Tom Osborne of Nebraska in a letter to USDA Secretary Mike \nJohanns, urging the Secretary to delay the proposed rule until such \ntime as Japan completes its process and accepts beef from the United \nStates. Another letter was sent to Secretary Johanns at approximately \nthe same time by a number of my Senate colleagues--Senators Roberts, \nCornyn, Craig, Burns, Crapo, Allard, Hutchison, Thomas, Thune, and \nfellow Nebraskan Senator Hagel. Their letter emphasizes that Japan must \nlift this unnecessary embargo, stating that U.S. ranchers and rural \ncommunities cannot continue to bear the economic uncertainty resulting \nfrom bad international policy. They added that it would be difficult \nfor Congress to accept any admission of Japanese beef into the United \nStates. I am thankful for their leadership and recognition that USDA's \nrulemaking effort should cease.\n  Additional letters that I signed, again with bipartisan support, were \nforwarded to President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \nThe letters complimented the administration's work in impressing upon \nJapanese officials the importance of the resumption of trade and urged \ntheir continuing efforts in making restoration of United States beef \ntrade the highest economic priority with Japan.\n  This amendment is simple and straightforward. If passed, the \namendment would restrict funds made available in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill from being used by the Secretary of Agriculture for \nthe purpose of developing a final rule relating to the proposed rule \nentitled ``Importation of Whole Cuts of Boneless Beef from Japan,'' to \nallow the importation of beef from Japan unless the President certifies \nto Congress that Japan has granted open access to Japanese markets for \nbeef and beef products produced in the United States.\n  While some have said this amendment is too restrictive, limiting the \nability of the Agriculture Secretary to negotiate with Japan, I see it \nanother way. I see it as simply applying the same policy Japan has in \nplace against United States beef.\n  I think it strengthens the Secretary's hand by sending Japan the \nclear message that the Senators from beef-producing States and from our \nneighboring States are not going to drop\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\nthis matter. Our beef is the safest and highest quality in the world. \nThere is no science-based reason for the embargo to continue, and if \nthey want to sell beef here, then they need to let us sell beef there.\n  Finally, I cannot back down from a personal commitment to the folks \nback home to aggressively pursue a Japanese market that in 2003 \naccounted for $1.4 billion of the $1.7 billion beef export market.\n  Like Secretary Johanns, when he served as Governor of Nebraska, I \nhave traveled to Japan on numerous occasions touting the exceptional \nquality and value of Nebraska beef and U.S. beef. Beef producers \nthroughout the Nation produce a superior quality product and have been \nvery supportive of Secretary Johanns' continuing efforts on behalf of \nthe U.S. beef industry as Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Unfortunately, bipartisan letters of support have not been able to \nresolve this issue. A congressional response is warranted. That \nincludes a strong statement that prematurely allowing Japan any access \nto our markets is simply unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am interested in the subject which is \nraised by the Senator from Nebraska in his amendment. There are some \naspects with relationship to it about which I would like to get a \nlittle more information. I would like to set the vote for 11:25 a.m. If \nI may, before we lock that in, there are a few items I would like to \nsettle.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Democratic \nleader be recognized to speak at 2:15 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1738\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be laid \naside, and I ask that the clerk report amendment No. 1738.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard], for himself, Mr. \n     Roberts, Mr. Craig, Mr. Burns, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Hagel, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1738.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the importation into \n                 the United States of beef from Japan)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. It is the sense of the Senate that the United \n     States Government should not permit the importation into the \n     United States of beef from Japan until the Government of \n     Japan takes appropriate actions to permit the importation \n     into Japan of beef from the United States.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Allard amendment No. 1738, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Nelson amendment No. 1732, occur at 11:20 a.m. today, \nwith no amendment in order to either amendment prior to that time, and \nthat the two votes occur in that order. I further ask that there be 2 \nminutes between the two votes for explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, if the Senator from Utah will yield, I \nwould like to have an opportunity, with the presentation of my \namendment, to speak for 10 minutes, if I might.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Colorado should certainly take the time \nto explain his amendment. The Senator from Nebraska has expressed a \ndesire to respond to the Senator from Colorado. I suggest that the time \nbetween now and the vote be equally divided between the Senator from \nColorado and the Senator from Nebraska, or should we say the Senator \nfrom Colorado have a little extra time because it is his amendment. \nHowever we work this out, I think we should make sure both sides get an \nopportunity to speak.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time is remaining until the next \nvote?\n  Mr. BENNETT. There is approximately 10 minutes remaining until the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is approximately 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil the vote be equally divided, with 5 minutes per speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah, and I \nappreciate his leadership.\n  The Government of Japan has maintained an embargo on U.S. beef for \nmore than 20 months. The beef industry is an integral part of the U.S. \neconomy. It is an integral part of the State which I represent, the \nState of Colorado, and is an integral part of Nebraska's economy, as we \njust heard from Senator Nelson about concerns that apply to his State. \nThis issue is particularly important for the southern and western parts \nof the United States.\n  Before the embargo, exports to Japan were approximately $100 million \na month. Today, the border closure has cost us over $2 billion. Since \nthe border closure, 10,000 U.S. meat packers have lost their jobs. To \naddress this we came to an agreement with the Japanese on what it would \ntake to open our borders to each other. The United States has worked \ndiligently to meet our end of the agreement and to assure that we can \nresume trade with the Japanese. Yet even with all of our efforts, \nJapan's border remains closed. The Japanese Government has made some \nprogress. Yet the process is becoming muddled underneath unnecessary \nbureaucracy on the part of the Japanese Government.\n  The United States has a long commitment to producing the world's \nsafest food, and they still continue to have that strong commitment. \nThe safety of U.S. beef is assured by sound science based on policy. I \nemphasize that U.S. beef is both safe and delicious. The time has come \nfor us to express our frustration as a collective body.\n  I, along with a number of my colleagues, met with the Ambassador from \nJapan to the United States a number of months ago and was assured they \nwere giving serious consideration to the embargo they placed against \nAmerican beef because of, at that point, one case of mad cow disease in \nthe United States. They were relatively assured that the process was \ngoing to move along. We told them at the time that we believed the \nprocess was being delayed. They assured us they would move it along.\n  They did move it along. Last week or so, we did get our decision back \nfrom this commission in Japan, and it was unfavorable as far as \nallowing U.S. beef to be imported into the country of Japan.\n  Japan has had a number of mad cow disease cases. We have had only two \ncases. Both of those have not resulted in any other outbreaks. They \nhave had upwards into the teens of cases of mad cow disease, and yet \nthey are using, in my view, the mad cow disease as a reason to impose \nan embargo against American beef.\n  We cannot stand aside and lose thousands upon thousands of jobs in \nthe beef industry as a result of this action. It is not based on good \nscience. We have extremely good meat processing procedures that protect \nhuman health in the United States, the best in the world as far as I am \nconcerned. I don't think we have anything to be apologetic for. Just \nbecause you recognize one or two cases of mad cow disease does not mean \nyou have a problem. It may mean you are doing a good job. I can think \nof countries that have not\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\nhad any cases of mad cow disease and may very well have it. It may be \nthey are not doing a good job, that they are not checking for the \ndisease, and if you don't check for it, you are not going to find it.\n  We have a very strict system of surveillance in this country. When we \nprocess beef, we hold suspected animals if they show any clinical signs \nat all, whether it is a temperature or that they show any signs of \nbeing uncoordinated that might suggest mad cow disease--if this is the \ncase we take them out of the processing lines until we have a \nconfirmation as to whether they are afflicted or not afflicted.\n  As a result of these frustrations, I offer this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution asking that the U.S. borders not be open to Japanese beef \nimports until the Japanese borders are open to us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I respect my colleague from Colorado and I certainly \nappreciate his support in working to reopen the borders with the \ncountry of Japan. I feel like somebody on a trip asking the question: \nAre we there yet? For 20 months we have been asking this question: Are \nwe there yet?\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution is perhaps a softer way of saying \nto Japan, finish this project as quickly as you can so this process \ndoes not go on another 20 months. The truth is I think it is time to \nmove beyond our soft talk to harder talk. Perhaps this will help the \nJapanese Government understand that we are very serious about this \ncontinuing nontariff trade barrier against United States beef. It is \nextremely important to the economy of the State of Nebraska. It is \nimportant to the economy of our country. What it boils down to is it is \nunfair. There is no sound science that justifies the action that has \nbeen taken. With two cases of mad cow detected in the United States, \none coming from Canada, statistically it is nonexistent in terms of the \nmillions of head of cattle that are sent to slaughter every year.\n  When you look at the situation, you have to ask yourself the question \nof why has it taken so long, 20 months, for this process.\n  Now, I am at times frustrated by our own bureaucracy, but I think on \nits worst day, our bureaucracy can't compete with this process that has \ncontinued to delay and delay and delay this whole effort to try to \nreopen the trade between the United States and Japan for cattle.\n  I suggest we can do both. We can pass a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which perhaps says in its own way that we need to reopen the \ntrade borders and knock down these trade barriers. But I think we also \nneed to say that we cannot move forward through the USDA until--not \nsuggest but say we cannot move forward until and unless the Japanese \nreopen their borders to our exports. I think you can do both. I think \none is a soft way, but the other sends a strong message. It is time for \nthat strong message. Everywhere I go across Nebraska, I hear people \nsay: How can this be? How can we continue to allow our trading partner \nto treat us this way? I think the answer is we cannot, and this is the \nway in which we stop it and we bring it to a head.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would ask the Senators if they would \nallow us to do the Allard amendment by a voice vote, given the fact \nthat the Senator from Nebraska has suggested he would be in support of \nthis, and would allow us to do both. Perhaps we could adopt the Allard \namendment by a voice vote and then move to the yeas and nays on the \nNelson amendment.\n  I would ask each Senator if they would respond to the Chair how they \nmight feel about that. I am happy to call for the yeas and nays on both \namendments if that is what they would like, but I have a sense that the \nAllard amendment is probably going to pass since the Senator from \nNebraska has indicated his position on it, and it may be we can save \nthe Senate some time by having only one recorded vote rather than two.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Nebraska \nis recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I have no objection to that \nprocedure. I think it would perhaps save time for the Senate. I believe \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution should be passed nearly unanimously \nby this body and it gives the opportunity for those who want to take a \nstronger position to be able to do it and be recorded as a yea or nay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Senator from Nebraska and myself are on the same \npage. We are both greatly disappointed that the negotiations from Japan \nhave not been progressing well at this particular point. I think we \nneed to recognize that the State Department has been working hard on \nthis issue as well as the Department of Agriculture. In fact, I have \nbeen told as recently as yesterday that the Secretary of State has had \ndiscussions with the Ambassador from Japan. I do think we need to do \nsomething on this floor to send a strong message to Japan about our \nconcerns about their continuing to apply an embargo against United \nStates beef. It is blatantly unfair and scientifically doesn't stand \nup.\n  As far as I am concerned, we can go ahead and adopt the Allard \namendment by a voice vote or unanimous consent, however the chairman \nwishes to proceed. Then these things perhaps can get refined better in \nconference committee when we work through this process in conference \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:20 \nhaving arrived, the vote is scheduled to occur in relation to the \nAllard amendment.\n  Without objection, the Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the Chair.\n  In fairness to both efforts, if we are going to adopt the Allard \namendment by a voice vote, is it possible then to adopt the Nelson \namendment by a voice vote as well?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I have no objection on this side, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I think there will be some who might want \nto vote against the Nelson amendment since the administration is \nopposed to it. Secretary Johanns has made the statement to that effect. \nSo for those who are not here who might want to be on the record, I \nthink we perhaps should have the yeas and nays with respect to the \nNelson amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, it is hard to believe people \nmight be inclined to vote against this amendment, but if that is the \nchoice, I would withdraw my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Allard \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1738) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, with respect to the Nelson amendment, I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question now is on agreeing to the \nNelson amendment. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 72, nays 26, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 236 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--72\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--26\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Salazar\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Corzine\n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 1732) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on Thursday of last week, when Senator \nKohl and I laid down the bill, I made the point that while there are no \ndirect emergency aid funds in the bill, there are funds for many of the \nprograms that would aid the victims of Hurricane Katrina and, frankly, \nprograms they badly need.\n  To point out some of the increases over the fiscal year 2005 level \nthat have impact on Katrina that are in this bill: $16.6 million for \nfood defense activities at FDA; $36.2 million for food safety \nactivities at USDA; nearly $250 million in loan authorizations for \nrural housing, including housing repair; $1.1 billion in rural utility \nloan authorizations for rural water and electric loans; $22 million for \nthe Women, Infants and Children feeding program; and $5.6 billion in \nfood stamps. These are all issues that affect the victims of Hurricane \nKatrina, and every State and every citizen will benefit from the \nprograms in this bill. So I hope we can move forward with it in an \nexpeditious fashion.\n  The USDA and FDA, the principal agencies funded in this bill, are \nworking under very difficult conditions to address the needs in the \nhurricane-affected areas. FDA has had to transfer 50 employees from \ntheir regional office in New Orleans to Nashville, and USDA has had to \nrelocate several hundred employees to keep its programs going.\n  So I hope we can do our best to effectively and quickly get this bill \nmoving. I urge those who have amendments to the bill to come to the \nfloor and help us with this bill.\n  We have one amendment which I understand has been cleared, and the \nSenator from Colorado has that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1737, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment No. 1737, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1737, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 93, line 9, before the period at the end insert the \n     following:``: Provided further, That the Secretary, through \n     the Agricultural Research Service, or successor, may lease \n     approximately 40 acres of land at the Central Plains \n     Experiment Station, Nunn, Colorado, to the Board of Governors \n     of the Colorado State University System, for its Shortgrass \n     Steppe Biological Field Station, on such terms and conditions \n     as the Secretary deems in the public interest: Provided \n     further, That the Secretary understands that it is the intent \n     of the University to construct research and educational \n     buildings on the subject acreage and to conduct agricultural \n     research and educational activities in these buildings: \n     Provided further, That as consideration for a lease, the \n     Secretary may accept the benefits of mutual cooperative \n     research to be conducted by the Colorado State University and \n     the Government at the Shortgrass Steppe Biological Field \n     Station: Provided further, That the term of any lease shall \n     be for no more than 20 years, but a lease may be renewed at \n     the option of the Secretary on such terms and conditions as \n     the Secretary deems in the public interest''.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, very briefly, what this amendment does is \nit just allows Colorado State University to lease land from the \nAgricultural Research Service. It is not a controversial provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Is there objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1737), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to reconsider the vote with respect to the Allard \namendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10214-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, one of the Senate's most important \nconstitutional responsibilities is to provide advice and consent with \nrespect to a President's nominations. The task is especially important \nwhen the nomination is an individual to be Chief Justice of the United \nStates. No one doubts John Roberts is an excellent lawyer and a very \naffable person. But at the end of this process, frankly, I have too \nmany unanswered questions about the nominee to justify a vote \nconfirming him to this enormously important lifetime position.\n  The stakes for the American people could not be higher. The \nretirement of Justice O'Connor and the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist \nhave left the Supreme Court in a period of transition. On key issues \naffecting the rights and freedoms of Americans, the Court is closely \ndivided. If confirmed, Judge Roberts, who is only 50 years old, will \nlikely serve as Chief Justice and leader of the third branch of the \nFederal Government for many decades.\n  The legal authority we will hand to Judge Roberts by this \nconfirmation vote is awesome. We should only vote to confirm this \nnominee if we are absolutely positive that he is the right person to \nhold that authority. For me, this is a very close question, but I must \nresolve my doubts in favor of the American people whose rights would be \nin jeopardy if John Roberts turns out to be the wrong person for this \njob.\n  Some say the President is entitled to deference from the Senate in \nnominating individuals to high office. I agree that deference is \nappropriate in the case of executive branch nominees such as Cabinet \nofficers. With some important exceptions, the President may generally \nchoose his own advisers. In contrast, the President is not entitled to \nmuch deference in staffing the third branch of Government, the \njudiciary. The Constitution envisions that the President and the Senate \nwill work together to appoint and confirm Federal judges. This is a \nshared constitutional duty. The Senate's role in screening judicial \ncandidates is especially important in the case of Supreme Court \nnominees because the Supreme Court has assumed such a large role in \nresolving fundamental disputes in our civic life. Any nominee for the \nSupreme Court bears the burden of persuading the Senate and the \nAmerican people that he or she deserves a confirmation to a lifetime \nseat on that Court.\n  First, I start by observing that John Roberts has been a thoughtful, \nmainstream judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, but he has only \nbeen a member of that court for 2 years and has not confronted many \ncutting-edge constitutional issues, if any. As a result, we cannot rely \non his current judicial service to determine what kind of a Supreme \nCourt Justice he would be.\n  I was very impressed with Judge Roberts when I first met him in my \noffice soon after he was nominated, but several factors caused me to \nreassess my initial view. Most notably, I was disturbed by the memos \nthat surfaced\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\nfrom Judge Roberts' years of service in the Reagan administration. \nThese memos raise serious questions about the nominee's approach to \ncivil rights. It is now clear that as a young lawyer, John Roberts \nplayed a significant role in shaping and advancing the Republican \nagenda to roll back civil rights protections. He wrote memos opposing \nlegislative and judicial efforts to remedy race and gender \ndiscrimination. He urged his superiors to oppose Senator Kennedy's 1982 \nbill to strengthen the Voting Rights Act and worked against affirmative \naction programs. He derided the concept of comparable worth and \nquestioned whether women actually suffered discrimination in the \nworkplace.\n  No one is suggesting John Roberts was motivated by bigotry or \nanimosity toward minorities or women, but these memos lead one to \nquestion whether he truly appreciated the history of the civil rights \nstruggle. He wrote about discrimination as an abstract concept, not as \na flesh-and-blood reality for countless of his fellow citizens. The \nmemos raised a real question for me whether their author would breathe \nlife into the equal protection clause and the landmark civil rights \nstatutes that come before the Supreme Court repeatedly. Nonetheless, I \nwas prepared to look past these memos and chalk them up to the folly of \nyouth. I looked forward to the confirmation hearings in the expectation \nthat Judge Roberts would repudiate those views in some fashion. \nHowever, the nominee adopted what I considered a disingenuous strategy \nof suggesting that the views expressed in those memos were not his, \neven at the time the memos were written. That is what he said. He \nclaimed he was merely a staff lawyer reflecting the positions of his \nclient, the Reagan administration.\n  Anyone who has read the memos can see that Roberts was expressing his \nown personal views on these important policy matters. In memo after \nmemo, the text is very clear. It is simply not plausible for the \nnominee to claim he did not share the views he personally expressed. \nFor example, there is a memo in which he refers to the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission as ``un-American.'' If Judge Roberts had \ntestified that this was a 20-year-old bad joke, I would have given the \nmemo no weight. Instead, he provided a tortured reading of the memo \nthat simply doesn't stand up under any scrutiny.\n\n  In another memo, Judge Roberts spoke about a Hispanic group President \nReagan would soon address and he suggested that the audience would be \npleased to know the administration favored legal status for the \n``illegal amigos'' in the audience--illegal amigos. After 23 years, \ncouldn't he acknowledge that was insensitive, that it was wrong? The \nuse of the Spanish word ``amigos'' in this memo is patronizing and \noffensive to a contemporary reader. I don't condemn Judge Roberts for \nusing the word ``amigos'' 20 years ago in a nonpublic memo, but I was \nstunned when at his confirmation hearing he could not bring himself to \nexpress regret for using that term or recognize that it might cause \noffense.\n  My concerns about these Reagan-era memos were heightened by the fact \nthat the White House rejected a reasonable request by committee \nDemocrats for documents written by Judge Roberts when he served in the \nfirst Bush administration. After all, if memos written 23 years ago are \nto be dismissed as not reflecting the nominee's mature thinking, it \nwould be highly relevant to see memos he had written as an older man in \nan even more important policymaking job. The White House claim of \nattorney-client privilege to shield these documents is utterly \nunpersuasive. Senator Leahy, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nasked Attorney General Gonzales for the courtesy of a meeting to \ndiscuss the matter and was turned down. This was simply a matter of \nstonewalling.\n  The failure of the White House to produce relevant documents is \nreason enough for any Senator to oppose this nomination. The \nadministration cannot treat the Senate with such disrespect without \nsome consequence. In the absence of these documents, it was especially \nimportant for the nominee to fully and forthrightly answer questions \nfrom committee members at his hearing. He failed to do so adequately. I \nacknowledge the right--indeed, the duty--of a judicial nominee to \ndecline to answer questions regarding specific cases that will come \nbefore the Court to which the witness had been nominated. But Judge \nRoberts declined to answer many questions more remote than that, \nincluding questions seeking his views of long-settled legal precedent.\n  Finally, I was very swayed by the testimony of civil rights and \nwomen's rights leaders against the confirmation. When a civil rights \nicon such as John Lewis, one of my American heroes, appears before the \ncommittee and says John Roberts was on the wrong side of history, I \ntake note. Senators should take notice.\n  I personally like Judge Roberts. I respect much of the work he has \ndone in his career. For example, his advocacy for environmentalists in \na Lake Tahoe takings case several years ago was good work. In the \nfullness of time, he may well prove to be a fine Supreme Court Justice. \nBut I have reluctantly concluded that this nominee has not satisfied \nthe high burden of justifying my voting for his confirmation based on \nthe current record.\n  Based on all these factors, the balance shifts against Judge Roberts. \nThe question is close, and the arguments against him do not warrant \nextraordinary procedural tactics to block his nomination. Nevertheless, \nI intend to cast my vote against this nomination when the Senate \ndebates the matter next week.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10215-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10215-S10227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n          RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1747\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for Mr. Inouye, for \n     himself, Mr. Akaka, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1748.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the use of funds made available to the Animal and \n                    Plant Health Inspection Service)\n\n       On page 101, line 10, before the period at the end insert \n     the following: ``: Provided further, That none of the funds \n     may be used to demolish or dismantle the Hawaii Fruit Fly \n     Production Facility in Waimanalo, Hawaii''.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I offer an amendment that would \nprohibit the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services, APHIS, from \nusing appropriated funds to demolish or dismantle the Hawaii Fruit Fly \nProduction Facility in Waimanalo, HI.\n  This amendment, which is cosponsored by my dear friends, Senator \nAkaka and Senator Finstein, is in response to a recent decision made by \nAPHIS to dismantle the Hawaii Fruit Fly Production Facility in \nWaimanalo, HI and would preclude the agency from carrying out this \ndecision until other alternatives have been articulated and analyzed. \nIn addition, this amendment would provide the agency and the many \nstakeholders with additional time to examine the issue, to seek a more \ncreative solution, and to have the Secretary recommend a plan that is \nacceptable to the agricultural representatives of the State of Hawaii, \nCalifornia, and other impacted States.\n  Releases of sterile insects have played a prominent role in the \nsuccess of most pest control or eradication programs. It is in this \ncontext that I have two main concerns with the agency's decision. \nFirst, relying solely on Guatemala as a source of sterile Mediterranean \nfruit flies places the United States at risk if the supply from \nGuatemala were curtailed for any reason. In these times of terrorist \nactivities and civil unrest, disruption is much more than an academic \ndebate. I have been assured by other states impacted by the APHIS \ndecision that they share my concern.\n  Second, from a Hawaii perspective the permanent closure of the \nfacility in Waimanalo does not bode well for the future of diversified \nagriculture in Hawaii. Unfortunately, Hawaii is infested with four \nfruit fly pest species--not just the Mediterranean fruit fly. Any hope \nof area wide control or eradication of these pests requires efficient \nrearing of all four species for sterile release programs. It is my \nintent to seek support for a multiple species rearing facility in \nWaimanalo to address this problem that is unique to Hawaii. While \nsuppression of all four of the fruit fly species in Hawaii is of great \nbenefit to our State, such activities may be among the best mechanisms \nfor avoiding inadvertent fruit fly infestations in other states where \nthese alien pests can survive.\n  Given these concerns, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment \nthat would prohibit APHIS from implementing its demolition decision and \nto provide additional time for the agency to work with all stakeholders \nin exploring and implementing a sound public policy on this issue of \ngreat importance to the State of Hawaii.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1748.\n  The amendment (No. 1748) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1749\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To insert provisions related to conflicts of interest among \n    members of advisory panels of the Food and Drug Administration)\n\n       On page 173, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7___.(a) Subject to subsection (b), none of the funds \n     made available in this Act may be used to--\n       (1) grant a waiver of a financial conflict of interest \n     requirement pursuant to section 505(n)(4) of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(n)(4)) for any \n     voting member of an advisory committee or panel of the Food \n     and Drug Administration; or\n       (2) make a certification under section 208(b)(3) of title \n     18, United States Code, for any such voting member.\n       (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a waiver or \n     certification if--\n       (1) not later than 15 days prior to a meeting of an \n     advisory committee or panel to which such waiver or \n     certification applies, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services discloses on the Internet website of the Food and \n     Drug Administration--\n       (A) the nature of the conflict of interest at issue; and\n       (B) the nature and basis of such waiver or certification \n     (other than information exempted from disclosure under \n     section 552 of title 5, United States Code (popularly known \n     as the Freedom of Information Act)); or\n       (2) in the case of a conflict of interest that becomes \n     known to the Secretary less than 15 days prior to a meeting \n     to which such waiver or certification applies, the Secretary \n     shall make such public disclosure as soon as possible \n     thereafter, but in no event later than the date of such \n     meeting.\n       (c) None of the funds made available in this Act may be \n     used to make a new appointment to an advisory committee or \n     panel of the Food and Drug Administration unless the \n     Commissioner of Food and Drugs submits a confidential report \n     to the Inspector General of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services of the efforts made to identify qualified \n     persons for such appointment with minimal or no potential \n     conflicts of interest.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Scientific Advisory Committee system \nat the Food and Drug Administration is meant to provide the Agency with \nunbiased, independent, professional advice on the safety and efficacy \nof drugs, devices, biologics, food, and veterinary medicine.\n  To protect the objectivity and the integrity of advisory committees, \nmembers have long been subject to a number of conflict of interest laws \nand regulations. Unfortunately, the Food and Drug Administration has \nroutinely granted waivers to scientists with financial ties to the \nmanufacture of the products under consideration or their competitors. \nThese waivers can compromise the integrity of this important advisory \nprocess. Let me give one example.\n  The February 2005 advisory panel considering whether painkillers, \nCelebrex, Bextra, and Vioxx, could safely be marketed to the public \nincluded 10 scientists who were granted conflict of interest waivers. \nTen of the thirty-two members--that is 31 percent--consulted for or \nreceived research support from Pfizer, which makes Celebrex and Bextra; \nand Merck, which makes Vioxx; or Novartis, which is seeking approval \nfor a similar painkiller.\n  Had the votes of those 10 scientists been excluded, the panel would \nhave favored withdrawing Bextra from the market and blocking the return \nof Vioxx.\n  As the New York Times pointed out in a March editorial:\n\n       Unless the FDA makes a more aggressive effort to find \n     unbiased experts or medical researchers start severing their \n     ties with the industry, a whiff of bias may taint the \n     verdicts of many advisory panels.\n\n  I, along with two of my colleagues, Senators Enzi and Kennedy, have \noffered this amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill, a bill \nwhich funds the Food and Drug Administration. It will increase the \ntransparency of the process. It will ensure the FDA has searched for \nexperts without conflicts of interest.\n  Specifically, our amendment requires the FDA to disclose any conflict \nof interest waivers on their Web site 15 days prior to the meeting of \nthe advisory committee. They must detail the nature of the conflict of \ninterest and the rationale for the waiver.\n  The amendment also requires the FDA to send a report to the Health \nand Human Services inspector general after each new advisory committee \nis convened. The report must detail the steps the FDA took to find \nscientists who were free from conflicts.\n  Finally, Senators Enzi, Kennedy, and I will request that the \nGovernment Accountability Office conduct an in-depth study of the \nwaiver process and provide recommendations on how it can be improved.\n  My amendment will increase the transparency of the waiver process and \nrequire the FDA to report to a third party about their efforts to \nidentify scientists without conflicts. I think this will create a \npowerful incentive for the FDA to find more scientists without the \npotential for bias.\n  Let me close by saying that, over the years, it has been my good \nfortune to work with this important agency, the Food and Drug \nAdministration. The American people don't know how much we rely on this \ntiny agency to decide that what is sold to us in drug stores and other \nplaces in our daily lives must be safe and they must be effective as \nadvertised. It is an arduous and important process, and they get it \nright so often, but occasionally they do not. We have to make certain \nthat we try to take out of this decision process any question that \nwould be raised about the integrity of the Agency or the means they are \nusing to reach their conclusions. I hope this amendment moves us in \nthat direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \ninitiative on this issue and congratulate him for the final product \nthat has been crafted. This could have been a very controversial and \ncontentious issue, but by compromise, conversation, and consultation \namong him and the other Senators he mentioned, we now have an amendment \nthat is virtually noncontroversial.\n  It is important that we do not enforce the conflict-of-interest issue \nwith such difficulty that ultimately the pharmaceutical companies are \ncut off from any opportunity of ever consulting with the best experts \nin the field because those experts want to also remain available to the \nFDA.\n  I think the compromise that has been reached is a sound one. I \nendorse the amendment and urge all Senators to vote for it.\n  I call for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the question is on agreeing \nto amendment No. 1749.\n  The amendment (No. 1749) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of appropriated funds to pay the salaries \n or expenses of personnel to inspect horses under certain authority or \n                              guidelines)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to pay the salaries or expenses of personnel to \n     inspect horses under section 3 of the Federal Meat Inspection \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 603) or under the guidelines issued under \n     section 903 the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform \n     Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 1901 note; Public Law 104-127).\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleagues, Senators \nByrd, Landrieu, Graham, Lott, Stabenow, DeMint, Feinstein, and \nLautenberg, to submit an amendment to the 2006 Senate Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  The goal of our amendment is simple: to end the slaughter of \nAmerica's horses for human consumption overseas.\n  I graduated from Colorado State with a degree in veterinary medicine. \nI have been concerned with animal welfare since my earlier days as a \nyouth and pursued those interests as a practicing veterinarian.\n  Our Nation's history and cultural heritage is strongly associated \nwith horses. George Washington is pictured many places with horses. We \nare reminded of the legend of Paul Revere's ride and the Pony Express \nin the West. The Depression era race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral \nraised the morale of our country during desperate times.\n  The owners who sell their horses at auction are often unaware that \nthose horses may be on their way to one of the three remaining horse \nslaughterhouses in America. These slaughterhouses--two in Texas and one \nin Illinois--are owned by French and Belgium companies. They slaughter \nAmerican horses almost exclusively for one purpose--exporting the meat \noverseas for human consumption.\n  Workhorses, racehorses, and even pet horses--many young and healthy--\nare slaughtered for human consumption in Europe and Asia, where their \nmeat is considered a delicacy. The profits, along with the product, are \nshipped overseas. These horses are slaughtered in America and shipped \nto Japan, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany for human consumption.\n  Last year, nearly 100,000 American horses were slaughtered for human \nconsumption overseas. Sixty-five thousand of these were sent to three \nslaughterhouses in the United States, and more than 30,000 were shipped \nacross our borders to Canada and Mexico for slaughter.\n  Our amendment effectively stops this practice. It restricts the use \nof Federal funds for the inspection of horses being sent to \nslaughterhouses for human consumption. Without these inspections, \nrequired under the Federal Meat Inspection Act, horses cannot be \nslaughtered, or exported for slaughter, for human consumption overseas.\n  Strong support for our amendment is reflected in the House of \nRepresentatives, where an identical measure was passed by a vote of 269 \nto 158 this past June.\n  We have several articles and editorials from around the country that \nhave been written in support of our amendment. Articles have appeared \nin the Washington Times, the St. Petersburg Times, the Charleston \nGazette, and the Louisville Courier-Journal, just to name a few. I ask \nunanimous consent to have these articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 15, 2005]\n\n                            Save the Horses\n\n       Most Americans would sooner starve than eat fillet of horse \n     with cranberry chutney, or however they do it in Europe. It \n     might then come as a surprise that 66,000 horses were \n     slaughtered for consumption in the United States last year, \n     and 20,000 more were exported abroad for the same purposes. \n     Even more so when one considers that nearly none of this \n     horse flesh ends up on American platters--and for that we are \n     thankful.\n       While cattle and poultry are bred specifically for food, \n     horses are not. Many of those sold to slaughterhouses are \n     privately owned or caught in the wild by the federal Bureau \n     of Land Management, which then tries to find adoptive homes. \n     When it cannot, the horses go to the highest bidder, in this \n     case either to one of the three Belgian- or French-owned \n     plants.\n       Fortunately, there is growing opposition in Congress to \n     this kind of thing. In June, the House passed by a bipartisan \n     majority an\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\n     amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill banning the \n     use of federal funds in the slaughtering of horses. The \n     Senate is schedule to vote on the amendment, sponsored by \n     veterinarian Sen. John Ensign, next week. We encourage \n     senators to support this ban.\n       Certain veterinary groups, rather ironically, oppose the \n     amendment. They claim that it is humane to put aging or \n     neglected horses out of their misery. But if anyone actually \n     saw how these noble beasts are slaughtered--strung up by \n     their hind legs and bled--they might think twice before \n     supporting such conduct. The only problem with attaching the \n     amendment to an appropriations bill is that it will expire \n     next year.\n       So, Mr. Ensign has also introduced independent legislation \n     that would ban the slaughter of horses entirely. Some critics \n     contend an outright ban is an abuse of congressional power. \n     But Cass Sunstein, the distinguished University of Chicago \n     law professor, conclusively addressed those concerns a few \n     years ago: ``A ban on commercial slaughter of horses would be \n     plainly within congressional authority, if accompanied by \n     reasonable findings that such slaughter is often or generally \n     a way of yielding products for interstate or international \n     sale, and therefore has a substantial effect on interstate or \n     international commerce.'' Few would argue that it doesn't.\n       We admit to a certain sentimentality in our appeal to ban \n     horse slaughter. The horse has always held a hallowed place \n     in our national identity, much like the bald eagle. And just \n     as no American would consider ordering up a bald eagle, if \n     only out of respect, so would none ask for a horse steak.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Sept. 13, 2005]\n\n                         Horse Sense in Senate\n\n       This week, the U.S. Senate may vote on an amendment to the \n     agriculture appropriations bill that would outlaw the \n     slaughter of horses for food. For most Kentuckians--in fact, \n     for most Americans--it's shocking that such a vote would need \n     to be taken. In this country, horses are raised to be \n     companion animals. Most folks don't know that in three \n     foreign-owned slaughterhouses within our borders, about \n     45,000 horses are killed each year.\n       The meat is then shipped to Japan and several European \n     countries, where horse is served for dinner. In the \n     international market, the meat of American horses is \n     especially coveted, since most of them have been well fed and \n     have received superior care.\n       This should be an easy vote for Sens. Mitch McConnell and \n     Jim Bunning. Horses are central to Kentucky's culture. Our \n     famous Bluegrass farms breed and raise them for higher \n     purposes than ending up on some dinner table overseas.\n       And no horse is currently safe from that fate. Ferdinand, \n     the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner, was killed in a Japanese \n     slaughterhouse when his stud services were no longer needed. \n     This past spring, 41 wild mustangs were slaughtered for food \n     in a Texas plant after being purchased through a program \n     meant to give them new homes.\n       That's why, in June, the U.S. House of Representatives \n     overwhelmingly passed legislation identical to what the \n     Senate is considering. Kentucky's own Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-\n     1st District, led the effort.\n       Now the Senate should do the same, with Kentuckians again \n     playing a leadership role.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the St. Petersburg Times, Sept. 13, 2005]\n\n                    Bring an End to Horse Slaughter\n\n       Horse slaughter has no place in the United States. The \n     House of Representatives confirmed that earlier this year by \n     passing an amendment to the agriculture spending bill that \n     would, in essence, stop the practice. Now it is the Senate's \n     turn.\n       Currently, horses that are no longer wanted are sold to \n     buyers who presumably seek them for recreation or as pets too \n     often end up in slaughterhouses or in the hands of exporters \n     who send them outside the country for slaughter. Sometimes \n     the buyers hide their true intentions and make a profit by \n     selling the horses for slaughter. Each year, nearly 100,000 \n     horses are subjected to a cruel end to their lives.\n       Horse meat for human consumption hasn't been sold in the \n     United States for decades and isn't even used in pet food \n     here. If a horse is near the end of its useful life, there \n     are more humane ways for an owner to get rid of it. Adoption \n     groups offer horses a peaceful retirement, and if the horses \n     need to be euthanized, it can be done painlessly and humanely \n     for a couple hundred dollars.\n       The Senate vote could come up in the next few days, so \n     those opposed to horse slaughter should contact their \n     senators and tell them to support the amendment, which would \n     deny the Agriculture Department taxpayer dollars for the \n     inspection of horse meat. Without such inspections, legalized \n     horse slaughter in this country will end. And good riddance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Charleston Gazette, Sept. 13, 2005]\n\n                 Save Horses--Bill Would Stop Slaughter\n\n       Around 90,000 American horses are slaughtered each year for \n     human consumption. Foreign-owned slaughterhouses on American \n     soil kill about 50,000 of them; the other 20,000 are sent \n     live to Mexico or Canada. Some are wild horses that still \n     wander ranges of the West; others are unwanted, disposed of \n     by their owners or unscrupulous dealers who promise they will \n     go to good homes.\n       Many of these creatures undergo extreme suffering en route \n     to their final destination. Transport law allows them to go \n     for 24 hours without food, water or rest, even if they are \n     badly injured or heavily pregnant.\n       West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd plans an amendment to the \n     Agriculture appropriations bill banning horse slaughter in \n     the United States. All three of the state's representatives \n     voted for a similar amendment in the House that passed, 269-\n     158.\n       There are alternatives to the slaughter of unwanted horses. \n     The recent auction of wild mustangs in Ronceverte resulted in \n     new homes for horses trucked in and sold for a nominal \n     amount. Many horse rescue operations work with retired \n     racehorses, many of whom have tragically ended at \n     slaughterhouses--even big-time steeds, including Kentucky \n     Derby winner Ferdinand. The rescue organizations retrain them \n     and find them new homes and careers. Horses that have truly \n     come to the end of their useful or comfortable lives can be \n     humanely euthanized, rather than having to endure the pain, \n     panic and trauma of a trip to the slaughterhouse.\n       The bond between horses and humans is as close as the \n     connection between dogs or cats and their owners. The \n     horsemeat industry is not a vital part of the American \n     economy. We hope the Senate will pass this humane amendment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              City of Kaufman,\n\n                                   Kaufman, TX, September 6, 2005.\n     Re Support Congressional efforts to end horse slaughter.\n\n       Dear Senator: As the Mayor of Kaufman, Texas, I am all too \n     well acquainted with an issue that has been getting plenty of \n     attention on Capitol Hill recently: horse slaughter.\n       Kaufman is ``home'' to Dallas-Crown, one of only three \n     slaughterhouses that continue to operate in this country (the \n     other plants are in Ft. Worth, TX and DeKalb, IL). Together, \n     the plants killed more than 65,000 of our horses last year \n     for human consumption abroad. All three plants, are foreign \n     owned, and all three are out of step with American public \n     opinion. Seventy-eight percent of Texans oppose horse \n     slaughter and polls from other parts of the country reflect \n     this sentiment. Both of the Texas plants operating in \n     violation of state law which prohibits the sale of horsemeat \n     for human consumption. And Dallas-Crown is operating in \n     violation of a multitude of local laws pertaining to \n     wastemanagement, air quality and other environmental \n     concerns.\n       When the District Attorneys in the two Texas jurisdictions \n     moved to prosecute under the state law, the plants filed suit \n     and the District Attorneys were prevented from proceeding. \n     Horses continued to be slaughtered while the case languished \n     in federal court. Recently, the judge ruled in the plants' \n     favor. The District Attorneys are considering an appeal.\n       When the city took action against the plant for releasing \n     pollutants into the sewer system far in excess of legally \n     acceptable limits, we ended up in court and are now forced to \n     mediate on an issue that can't be mediated. Meanwhile, our \n     municipal sewer system is overburdened, but we simply cannot \n     afford to refurbish the system so that it can tolerate \n     overload from Dallas-Crown. Nor should we have to.\n       Residents are also fed up with the situation. Long-\n     established neighbors living adjacent to the plant cannot \n     open their windows or run their air conditioners without \n     enduring the most horrific stench. Children playing in their \n     yards do so with the noise of horses being sent to their \n     deaths in the background. Landowners have difficulty securing \n     loans to develop their property. The residents have \n     petitioned the city council to take corrective action against \n     the plant. On August 15 the Kaufman City Council voted \n     unanimously to implement termination proceedings against the \n     plant.\n       But the ultimate remedy rests with the federal government, \n     which has the authority--and opportunity--to close this \n     shameful industry down. I urge you to cosponsor the American \n     Horse Slaughter Prevention Act when it is introduced by \n     Senator John Ensign, and to support the Ensign amendment to \n     the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year \n     `06 that will prohibit the use of federal funds to facilitate \n     horses slaughter.\n       As a community leader where we are directly impacted by the \n     horse slaughter industry, I can assure you the economic \n     development return to our community is negative. The foreign-\n     owned companies profit at our expense--it is time for them to \n     go. If I can provide you with further information, please \n     don't hesitate to contact me at 972-932-2856.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Paula Bacon,\n                                          Mayor of Kaufman, Texas.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Ensign-Byrd amendment also has strong \nsupport from some of the people most familiar with the slaughterhouses. \nPaula Bacon, the mayor of Kaufman, TX, which is home to the Dallas \nCrown Slaughterhouse, recognized the importance of ending this \nslaughter.\n  She stated:\n\n       My city is little more than a doormat for a foreign-owned \n     business that drains our resources, thwarts economic \n     development and stigmatizes our community. There is no \n     justification for spending American tax dollars to support \n     this industry.\n\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\n\n  That is Paula Bacon, mayor of Kaufman, TX, home to the Dallas Crown \nhorse slaughterhouse facility.\n  Members of the local community would like to see this slaughterhouse \nclosed, as well.\n  Concerns have been raised about what will happen if this slaughter is \nended. Many of these horses will be sold to a new owner. Some horses \nwill be kept longer by their original owner, others will be euthanized \nhumanely by a licensed veterinarian, and still others will be cared for \nby the horse rescue community. Efforts are underway to standardize \npractices for horse rescue organizations. Guidelines for this ever-\ngrowing sector have been developed by the animal protection community \nand embraced by sanctuaries.\n  Statistics do not support claims that this legislation will result in \nmore abuse and neglect of unwanted horses. In Illinois, the number of \nabuse cases actually dropped from 2002 to 2004, when the State's only \nslaughterhouse was closed due to fire. In California, there has been no \nrise in neglect cases since the State passed a ban on slaughter for \nhuman consumption in 1998.\n  Furthermore, it is illegal to ``turn out,'' neglect, or starve a \nhorse, so this amendment will not lead to more orphaned horses. If a \nperson attempts to turn his or her horses out, animal control agents \ncan enforce humane laws. These animals still can be euthanized and \ndisposed of by a veterinarian for about $225, a fraction of the cost to \nkeep a horse. That cost is not too big of a burden to bear when no \nother options are available.\n  Our amendment is good for horses. That is why it is supported by many \nanimal protection groups. The Humane Society of the United States, the \nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Doris \nDay Animal League, the American Humane Association, and Society for \nAnimal Protective Legislation--all support our legislation. We have \nalso received support from much of the horse industry and veterinarians \nnationwide. In fact, congressional measures to end horse slaughter are \nsupported by Veterinarians for Equine Welfare, the National \nThoroughbred Racing Association, Churchill Downs, Incorporated, and \ndozens of owners and trainers of champion racehorses, including \nKentucky Derby winners.\n  The time to end this slaughter is now. Please join my colleagues and \nme in supporting this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nbe recognized to speak as in morning business. We are under the \nAgriculture bill, and no one seems to be coming forward under the \nAgriculture bill, so I obviously have no objection, but I think, to be \nclear, it should be as in morning business; therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator be given the opportunity to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah for his \ngraciousness, and my colleague from Wisconsin as well. I appreciate \nthis opportunity to speak.\n  (The remarks of Mr. CONRAD pertaining to the introduction of S. 1730 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Winston Churchill said, ``when you are on a \ngreat horse, you have the best seat you will ever have.'' Indeed, \nthroughout the ages, the horse has carried mankind across continents, \nhelped forge civilizations, and has been that beloved beast of burden \nthat has borne the human race on its back.\n  In America, the horse was the primary source of transportation of our \nfounding fathers, the vehicle of our Revolutionary soldiers, and a \nsymbol of the majestic strength and character that this great country \nwas based upon. Our fledgling urban centers rose with the help of the \nhorse's brawn. Our American frontier expanded farther and farther west, \nwith families traveling by horse-drawn wagons across mountains and \nvalleys, the plains and prairies. The American cowboy, an indelible \nimage of the fierce and undying determination of the American spirit, \nwas never without his trusty four-legged companion.\n  But each year, 65,000 horses are slaughtered in this country for \nhuman consumption in Europe and Asia, where horsemeat is considered a \ndelicacy. Another 30,000 horses are shipped every year to Canada and \nMexico to be slaughtered.\n  These horses often suffer unnecessarily while in transit to \nslaughterhouses. Horses can be shipped for more than 24 hours without \nfood, water, or rest. They can be transported with broken legs, missing \neyes, or while heavily pregnant. The horses are kept in cramped \nconditions, in trucks with ceilings so low that they prevent the horses \nfrom holding their heads in a normal, upright position. The cramped \nnature of their transport often results in trampling, with some horses \narriving at the slaughterhouses seriously injured or dead.\n  Even more cruel than the suffering these animals endure while in \ntransit is their often injurious end. Improper use of stunning \nequipment at the slaughterhouse can result in the animal having to \nendure repeated blows to head, meaning that horses sometime remain \nconscious throughout the slaughter process.\n  The market for horsemeat is not an American market. Horsemeat is \nshipped abroad. The three slaughterhouses in the U.S. are foreign-\nowned. Thus, American horses are sold to a foreign company, killed for \nconsumption in a foreign market, and foreign-owned companies profit \nfrom the export of horse meat. Many Americans would be shocked to learn \nthat our animals suffer such a fate, all in order to satisfy the tastes \nof those living in Europe and Asia. Indeed, many individuals who sell \nhorses to slaughterhouses do so unwittingly. Slaughterhouses often send \nthird parties, called ``killer buyers,'' to auction to buy horses.\n  Senator Ensign and I have offered an amendment to stop the slaughter \nof horses for human consumption by preventing taxpayer dollars from \nbeing used to inspect the horses intended for slaughter. Without these \ninspections, which are paid for by the American taxpayer, it would be \nimpossible for these companies to slaughter horses in the U.S., or to \ntransport horses abroad for slaughter.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Ensign-Byrd amendment to end the \nslaughter of one of the most precious American symbols.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Hawaii has \nsome amendments to the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to approve for human consumption under the Federal \n     Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) any cattle, \n     sheep, swine, or goats, or horses, mules, or other equines \n     that are unable to stand or walk unassisted at a \n     slaughtering, packing, meat-canning, rendering, or similar \n     establishment subject to inspection at the point of \n     examination and inspection under section 3(a) of that Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 603(a)).\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to offer two amendments to H.R. \n2744, the Agriculture appropriations bill for FY 2006, that will help \nprotect the health of the American public. Amendment 1730, the downed \nanimal amendment, would prohibit the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nUSDA, from utilizing funds under this act to approve downed animals for \nhuman consumption.\n  Downed animals are livestock such as cattle, sheep, swine, goats, \nhorses, mules, or other equines that are too sick to stand or walk \nunassisted. Many of these animals are dying from infectious diseases \nand present a significant pathway for the spread of disease.\n  While I commend USDA and livestock organizations for their efforts to \naddress the issue of downed animals, I am still very concerned about \ndiseases such as BSE, more commonly known as mad cow disease, that pose \na serious risk to the United States cattle industry and human health. A \nfood inspection study conducted in Germany in 2001 found that BSE is \npresent in a higher percentage of downed livestock than in the general \ncattle population. USDA stated that downed animals are one of the most \nsignificant potential pathways that have not been addressed in previous \nefforts to reduce risks from BSE. Stronger legislation is needed to \nensure that these animals do not enter our food chain. My amendment is \nvery simple. It would prevent downed animals from being approved for \nconsumption at our dinner tables. This will allow USDA and other \nstakeholders to continue working on reducing and potentially \neliminating the risk of BSE or any other prions from entering our food \nchain.\n  Currently, before slaughter, USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service, \nFSIS, diverts downer livestock that exhibit clinical signs associated \nwith BSE or other types of diseases until further tests may be taken. \nHowever, this does not mean that downed livestock cannot be processed \nfor human consumption. If downer cattle presented for slaughter pass \nboth the pre- and post-inspection process, meat and meat by-products \nfrom such cattle can be used for human consumption. Routinely, BSE is \nnot correctly distinguished from many other diseases and conditions \nthat show similar symptoms. This was demonstrated by the surveillance \nof a similar inspection process in Europe, showing that the process is \ninadequate for detecting BSE. Consequently, BSE-infected cattle can be \napproved for human and animal consumption.\n  Today, USDA has increased its efforts to test approximately 10 \npercent of downed cattle per year for BSE. However, it is my \nunderstanding that USDA is looking to revisit this issue. I do not \nbelieve that now is the time to lower our defenses. While I am not \nasking the industry and Federal Government to test every slaughtered \ncow, I am asking the Federal Government to address and reduce the real \nrisks associated with BSE and similar diseases in the U.S.\n  Some individuals fear that my amendment would place an excessive \nfinancial burden on the livestock industry. I want to remind my \ncolleagues that one single downed cow in Canada diagnosed with BSE this \nyear shut down the world's third largest beef exporter. It is estimated \nthat the Canadian beef industry lost more than $1 billion as a result \nof the discovery of BSE and more than 30 countries banned Canadian \ncattle and beef. As the Canadian cattle industry continues to recover \nfrom its economic loss, it is prudent for the United States to be \nproactive in preventing BSE and other animal diseases from entering our \nfood chain.\n  We must protect our livestock industry and human health from diseases \nsuch as BSE. My amendment reduces the threat of passing diseases from \ndowned livestock to our food supply. It also requires higher standards \nfor food safety and protects human health from diseases and the \nlivestock industry from economic distress.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1729\n\n  Amendment No. 1729 is based on my bill, the Pet Safety and Protection \nAct, S. 451. It will protect family pets while allowing research on \ndogs and cats to continue in an environment free from scientific fraud \nand animal abuse.\n  This amendment prohibits Federal funds from being provided to a \nresearch facility that purchases animals from Class B dealers. Class B \nanimal dealers collect dogs and cats from ``random sources'' and \nroutinely violate the Animal Welfare Act. The Animal Welfare Act sets \nthe minimum standards of care for animals and requires accurate record \nkeeping on their acquisition and disposition. Dogs and cats are \nsubjected to abusive handling and exposure to the elements while kept \non the premises of Class B dealers. They are routinely denied \nsufficient food, water, and veterinary care before they are sold off to \nlaboratories.\n  Less than a month ago, one of the more notorious Class B dealers, \nC.C. Baird, pleaded guilty in a case before a U.S. District Judge. He \nhad violated the Animal Welfare Act because he transferred the dogs and \ncats to research facilities with false acquisition records. During the \nsearch, approximately 125 dogs were seized by Federal agents as \nevidence of various violations of the Animal Welfare Act.\n  I recently sent a letter to all my colleagues in the Senate \nrequesting support in passing the Pet Safety and Protection Act. On the \nfront were pictures of a hound dog, Buck, who was in terrible shape--\nskinny, his ribs sticking out, pieces of his ear torn off--after being \nheld by a Class B dealer.\n  There are only 17 Class B dealers selling random source dogs and cats \nfor research. However, there are hundreds of suppliers to these \ndealers. Random source animals are dogs and cats that may be obtained \nby fraudulent means, through ``free to good homes'' ads, false animal \norigin records, and stealing of pet dogs and cats from their owners. \nThe Department of Agriculture lacks the necessary resources to track \nthe interstate activities of Class B dealers to ensure that they comply \nwith Federal law. USDA cannot provide an assurance that illegal \nacquired pets are not being sold by Class B dealers. This is a problem \nthat is certain to grow in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina with the \nthousands of animals placed in shelters.\n  From a scientific research point of view, Class B-acquired animals \nhave not had standardized care nor is there any certainty of the \nhistory of the animals. These circumstances make them unsuitable as \nresearch subjects in any case, since they cannot be used as control \ncases or experimental animals. Valid scientific research relies on \ncontrolled experimental design and replicable results--two things \nhighly questionable when using animals with unknown history and \nbackground.\n  This simple amendment prohibits funding in this FY 2006 \nappropriations bill from going to research facilities that purchase \nanimals from a dealer that holds a Class B license under the Animal \nWelfare Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as near as I can tell, there is support \nfor these amendments on both sides of the aisle. I ask they be \nconsidered en bloc by a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments will be \nconsidered en bloc.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendments Nos. 1729 and 1730, en \nbloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1729 and 1730) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, unless the Senator has an additional \namendment----\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah and the \nranking member, Senator Kohl, for accepting these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Storage of Nuclear Waste\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, one of the issues that has occupied this \nChamber for some time and had a particular impact on those of us in the \nWestern States is the issue of the storage of nuclear waste. The \nquestion of where nuclear waste should be stored has been before \nvarious administrations and various Congresses literally for decades.\n  The original policy decision made by administrations past and \nCongresses past was that there should be a single repository for \nnuclear waste. After a study by the National Academy of Sciences and \nothers, the decision was made to put that repository in Nevada, in \nYucca Mountain. Ever since that time, construction has gone forward at \nthe Yucca Mountain facility.\n  All of that happened before I came to Congress. When I got here, the \ndebate was going on, and we had a particular point where we had to \nvote, once again, on whether to put nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain.\n  At that time, as I looked at the various alternatives, I decided that \nthe best scientific answer to the question of what to do with nuclear \nwaste was to leave it where it was. I was assured by the scientists \nthat it was safe in the dry cask storage that had been prepared for its \ntransportation, and that it could be safely transported across the \ncountry to Yucca Mountain.\n  My reaction to that was, if it is safe where it is and if it is safe \nto transport, why transport it at all? Why not leave it where it is?\n  It was very clear that the Congress was not going to accept that \nposition, that the President was not going to accept that position, and \nthat we were going to go ahead as a matter of public policy and have a \nsingle repository for nuclear waste.\n  So I said: If we are going to have a single repository for nuclear \nwaste, the most logical place for that is Yucca Mountain. And I voted \nin favor of Yucca Mountain.\n  Looking back on it, the keyword in that sentence is the word ``if.'' \nIf we are going to have a single repository for nuclear waste, it \nappeared that the logical place to put it was Yucca Mountain.\n  It is now clear that we are not going to have a single repository for \nnuclear waste. Yucca Mountain has been challenged on scientific \ngrounds. Yucca Mountain has been challenged in the court on legal \ngrounds. And as we look at the present state of our need for energy, \nYucca Mountain will be challenged on practical grounds because it is \nvery clear that we are going to need more, not less, nuclear power.\n  Nuclear power is here to stay. The nuclear plants that we have are \ngoing to be recommissioned and relicensed, and Yucca Mountain will be \nfull if we go ahead with the existing plans to send nuclear waste \nthere. We will still need storage in place even if Yucca Mountain \nopens. It doesn't make sense from a practical point of view to move the \nmaterial all across the country, store it in Yucca Mountain for the \npurpose of ending storage in place, and then have storage in place come \nback.\n  Those who saw this in advance--Senator Reid and Senator Ensign--have \nthe right to tell the rest of us, ``I told you so,'' as it now becomes \nclear that scientifically, legally, and practically, Yucca Mountain is \nnot going to become the single repository for nuclear waste. And we \nneed to start thinking about new strategies and new places to deal with \nthis issue.\n  I want to make it very clear that I am not opposed to nuclear power. \nIndeed, I am a strong supporter of nuclear power. I have supported \nSenator Domenici in his efforts in crafting the Energy bill to craft \nthe bill in such a way as to encourage America to build new nuclear \npowerplants. We are behind the rest of the world on this issue. Go to \nEurope and you will find the French have something like 80 percent of \ntheir power generated by nuclear power. The British have large amounts \nof nuclear power.\n\n  With the price of natural gas going as high as it is, it becomes \nincreasingly economically unwise for us to continue to build gas-\npowered electric plants. Nuclear power is something in which we should \nget involved in a big way in the future, and the Energy bill we passed \nprior to the August recess laid the groundwork for that.\n  The question is, of course, if we go in that direction, what do we do \nwith the nuclear waste? If Yucca Mountain is not going to be \navailable--and I am now convinced that it will not be--where should it \nbe put? There is a proposal that it should be put in the State of Utah \nat an interim storage site that has just recently been licensed by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  I put stress on the word ``interim'' because the whole idea behind \nthe proposed facility in Utah, in a place called Skull Valley, was that \nit would simply be a stopover for the waste on its way to Yucca \nMountain, and so it has been designed and it has been licensed as an \ninterim storage facility.\n  If it does not make sense for us to take this nuclear waste and put \nit in a permanent repository, which is what Yucca Mountain is, why does \nit make sense to put it in an interim repository that does not have the \nsafeguards that are built into Yucca Mountain?\n  Yucca Mountain would put the waste below ground. It would put the \nwaste in vaults that have been prepared for it. The interim facility in \nSkull Valley would leave the waste above ground. It would leave the \nwaste in the dry cask receptacles that were built for transportation. \nWhy ship it from its present site aboveground to another site \naboveground to say, well, this is an interim storage site until we put \nit in permanent storage?\n  The reality is, if you do that, you are creating a permanent storage \nsite because there will be no place to put it after it has been \ntransported to the interim storage site.\n  There are those who say: You just don't want it in Utah. And that is \ntrue, I don't want it in Utah. But there is another factor that drives \nthe reason I don't want it in Utah. This particular interim storage \nsite is at the portal to the Utah Test and Training Range. Even most \npeople in Utah have never heard of the Utah Test and Training Range, \nand they have no idea what it is. It is the largest land range for \nbombing practice in the United States. It goes all the way back to the \nSecond World War. The crew that flew the mission over Hiroshima in the \nEnola Gay trained at the Utah Test and Training Range.\n  Today, it is still in use. F-16s from Hill Air Force Base fly over \nthe Utah Test and Training Range and practice their bombing runs with \nlive ordinance. I have flown over the Utah Test and Training Range in a \nhelicopter and have been told: We have to get out of here because the \nF-16s are coming, and they are going to start bombing.\n  It clearly does not make sense to have an interim storage facility \nfor nuclear waste in an area where F-16s with live ordinance are going \nto be flying.\n  There are those who say: The F-16s can change their flight pattern; \nthey can go around this area; they don't need to pay attention to it.\n  One of the things we have learned from spending time with the BRAC \nprocess in determining which military facilities will be retained and \nwhich will not is that more military facilities have been closed by \nencroachment than have been closed by BRAC--encroachment being \ndevelopment or other activities that come close to the gate of the \nmilitary base that make it impossible for the people on the base to do \ntheir job, and they ultimately say: When we built this base, it was \nsurrounded by open spaces. Now activity has come in, development has \ncome in, encroachment has happened, and we are going to have to close \nthis base.\n  I do not want to see encroachment take away the last remaining large, \nland-based test and training range in the United States. We need to \nrethink this whole thing.\n  So, Mr. President, I am now making it clear that my support for Yucca \nMountain, however well intended it was at the time, in my opinion does \nno longer hold in the situation in which we find ourselves.\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\n  I also believe the proposal that was made at the time we approved \nYucca Mountain the last time, that of leaving the material in place \nuntil we can work out the economics and the technology of reprocessing \nit, is the right approach. That is what the future holds.\n  Right now people say: Reprocessing it is too expensive. But we know \nfrom past experience that technology will find a way around that. It \nwill become cheaper and cheaper the more we do it. We are already \ninvolved in reprocessing warheads from the former Soviet Union as we go \nthrough the process of reducing nuclear weapons and nuclear stockpiles \naround the world. As that reprocessing activity goes forward, we will \nlearn how to do it faster, we will learn how to do it cheaper, and \nreprocessing will be available for the nuclear waste that is currently \nbeing developed by our nuclear power facilities.\n  At that time, it would make sense for the nuclear waste that is \nstored onsite to be shipped to a reprocessing center, not to an interim \nstorage facility.\n  There is one other factor that needs to be stressed. At the present \ntime, the contract to take the nuclear waste and ship it to the interim \nstorage facility in Utah--which, by the way, has not been built; there \nis still $1 billion worth of investment that will have to go into \nthat--the process by which that will go forward will be under the \nownership of the utilities that run the nuclear plants.\n  The main difference between an interim storage facility and a \npermanent storage facility in the law has to do with titles. In the \ninterim storage facility, the utility that created the waste and ran \nthe nuclear plant retains title to the waste. While it is being \npackaged, while it is being shipped, and while it is in interim \nstorage, it is owned by the utility. Under the Yucca Mountain proposal, \nthe Federal Government would take title to the waste the minute Yucca \nMountain would open so the Federal Government would be responsible for \npackaging it, the Federal Government would be responsible for \nprotecting it while transporting it, and the Federal Government would \nbe responsible for the security on the site where it would be located. \nIf we leave it where it is while we work on the issue of reprocessing, \ntitle remains with the utility that produced it, but the security that \nthe utility has already built into its plant is already there. It is \nnot exposed to any terrorist attack while it is moving so that utility \ndoes not have to bear the expense of extra security in moving waste to \nwhich they retain title.\n  Then when we get to the point where we can move it to a reprocessing \nplant, once again the Federal Government may take title to it.\n  The Federal Government can provide the security during \ntransportation. The Federal Government can see that it is kept safe \nfrom terrorist attack and bring it to the reprocessing facility.\n  One last point. One of the reasons we want to be sure the Federal \nGovernment is in charge of all of the reprocessing is that the end \nproduct after reprocessing is not only additional energy created by the \nprocess, but the residue that is left is weapons-grade plutonium. We do \nnot want to run the risk of having weapons-grade plutonium in the hands \nof private entities. We want to be sure that the Government controls \nit.\n  What I think we need to do--``we'' being the collective word for the \nadministration and the Congress, generally--is to adopt some \nfundamental principles and then rethink the whole issue to come up with \nthe appropriate details. The fundamental principles that I would \nrecommend and that I embrace are, No. 1, we are in favor of nuclear \npower. We want more nuclear power in this country for all of the \nenvironmental reasons dealing with greenhouse gases, for all of the \ndemand reasons dealing with the increased necessity for electric power, \nand for all of the legal reasons having to do with the control of the \nownership of these facilities. So the No. 1 principle, I am in favor of \nnuclear power. No. 2, I am in favor of reprocessing. I think we should \nwork toward that technical solution for the question of waste. And No. \n3, while we are in the process of building new nuclear plants and \nworking toward reprocessing of the waste, we should leave the waste \nwhere it is. If, indeed, as I say, it is safe to transport and it is \nsafe to store in an interim facility someplace else, by definition, it \nis equally safe to store it where it is. That is cheaper, that is \nequally as safe, and that sets us up for the solution of our problem. I \nbelieve that if we rethink the whole issue as to how we are going to \nhandle it and what we are going to do, there may very well be a useful \npurpose for Yucca Mountain. We have spent, as a nation, billions of \ndollars preparing that facility. We should review the facility and what \nit offers and see how it might be used at some particular point in the \nfuture and see how we might retain some of the investment we have made \nthere.\n  I am not one who thinks we ought to fill Yucca Mountain up with dirt \nand walk away and leave it. There can be a win-win situation for all. \nNevada can get some value out of the investment that has been made in \nYucca Mountain if we think it through carefully. The Nation can get \nadditional power without the greenhouse gas effect that comes from \nfossil fuels, and we can ultimately solve the problem of nuclear waste \nwith reprocessing.\n  I have discussed this in general terms with Senator Domenici, who is \nthe chairman of the Energy Committee as well as the chairman of the \nenergy and water subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, and I \ncommend him for his original thinking of moving in directions that will \nmake sense for the future. However, much as the idea of a single \nrepository may have made sense decades ago, it is now clear, as I say, \nthat it does not make sense, and we need to move in some future \ndirection. To the degree that Senator Domenici will allow me to \nparticipate in trying to find logical solutions under the three \nprinciples I have described, I will be more than happy to cooperate \nwith him. To those who had the vision long ago who, as I say, have \nearned the right to say to the rest of us, ``I told you so,'' I say I \nwill be happy to join with you, too, in seeing how we can think this \nthing through and get the best solution for our Nation and all of those \nwho live in it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Ensign \namendment No. 1753 be modified to be drafted as a first-degree \namendment, provided further that the vote in relation to the Ensign \namendment No. 1753 occur at 4:45 today with no amendment in order to \nthe amendment prior to the vote. I also ask for the yeas and nays on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1726\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I believe that amendment No. 1726 is now \nthe pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. This is the managers' amendment that Senator Kohl and I \nintroduced last Thursday. It makes some technical corrections in the \nbill regarding conservation technical assistance for DuPage County, IL. \nIt also makes some technical corrections in the Rural Electrification \nAct of 1936. It has the approval of the authorizing committee, as well \nas the support of USDA, and there is no additional cost to the bill. \nSenator Kohl and I have taken the position that we will not offer any \nauthorizing legislation on this bill that does not have the approval of \nthe authorizing committee. And this one falls within that scope. So it \nhas been cleared on both sides of the\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\naisle, and I believe we are now prepared to pass it on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1726) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and ask \nthat that be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1763\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Talent], for himself and Mr. \n     Pryor, proposes an amendment No. 1763.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to close or relocate certain \n               local offices of the Farm Service Agency)\n\n       On page 173, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7___. None of the funds made available by this or any \n     other Act may be used to close or relocate a county or local \n     Farm Service Agency office unless or until the Secretary of \n     Agriculture has determined the cost effectiveness and \n     enhancement of program delivery of the closure or relocation, \n     and report to the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture \n     and Appropriations.\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, this amendment, which I am offering on \nbehalf of myself and Mr. Pryor, the Senator from Arkansas, is an \nattempt to address a development within the Department of Agriculture. \nThe Department is proposing closing about a quarter to a third of the \nFarm Service Agency's local offices around the country, including, as \nfar as we can tell, around 30 out of the 90 offices in Missouri, the \nobject, according to the Department, being to modernize and consolidate \nfunctions and to provide better service.\n  Certainly nobody is opposed to better service. But I want to \nemphasize something here. The key with regard to how we handle FSA \noffices has to be service to the agricultural community and to our \nproducers. The idea is accessibility. The idea is responsiveness. The \nidea is not necessarily somebody's planning in Washington about how \nthey would organize everything in the United States if they could do it \nexactly the way they wanted.\n  I am a little concerned about changing our FSA offices when, from \nwhat I am told back in Missouri, there has been little or no \nconsultation either with local FSA people or with producer \norganizations, more particularly farmers or the affected communities. I \ndon't know how we can do this in a way that emphasizes service, \nacceptability, and accountability without having to talk to the people \nwhom we are trying to serve.\n  The amendment basically says hold up on this until we have an \nopportunity for that kind of accessibility and that kind of \naccountability.\n  Again, I am not saying--and I don't think Mr. Pryor is saying \neither--that no consolidation is possible. I imagine it is possible in \nMissouri. We certainly want to look at how we can modernize these \noffices so we can perform better service. But we have to remember that \nthese are the offices our producers have to go to any time they want to \ndeal with any of the Government's various programs that affect them. \nSome of them in Missouri are already driving 30, 40 minutes, or more \nthan that, and if they drive and they don't have all the forms they \nneed, or they left something at home, they have to go all the way home, \nget it, and turn around and come back.\n  When you are proposing eliminating some of those offices when they \nare already difficult to access, in many cases, I think that is \nsomething we need to look at. I certainly believe we need more \nconsolidation, at least in Missouri, than we have had now.\n  That is all this amendment says. I appreciate very much the bill \nmanagers working with us. I understand they are going to be willing to \naccept the amendment. I appreciate that. I pledge to work with them in \nconference.\n  This language isn't necessarily the be-all and end-all with regard to \nthis issue. I think they see what Senator Pryor and I are driving at, \nand I think everybody would agree this is something we want to do with \nconsultation and discussions with the affected communities--in \nparticular the affected producer and producer groups. They are not \nopposed to making the Farm Service Agency work better. We all know the \nproblems that have sometimes occurred. But we have potentially disaster \nrelief coming down the pike, and I certainly hope so for producers who \nhave been affected negatively by the hurricane, or by drought. We have \nanother farm bill that is not that far away. We need to do this right, \nif we are going to do it. That is what the amendment says.\n  I appreciate the support of the Senator from Utah, and certainly \npledge to work with him and his ranking member in conference on this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I share the concern and frustration of \nthe Senator from Missouri with the proposal. We have had some of that \nsame concern and frustration in Utah. Charitably, I will say that the \nefforts to close these offices have been handled a little less wisely \nthan might otherwise have been the case.\n  I hope that between now and the conference we can learn more about \nthis proposal. I think the Senator's comments about getting information \nand input from those directly affected is very wise.\n  I pledge to work with all the Senators concerned on this issue \nbetween now and the time we get to conference. So knowing that this \nwill be the vehicle whereby we can get to conference, I am willing to \nproceed now to a voice vote and urge Senators to support it. I \nunderstand it has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1763) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1753\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as we are approaching the hour of 4:45, \nwhich has been set as the time for the vote on the Ensign amendment, I \nsay to my colleagues that Senator Ensign outlined the reasons for his \namendment. I have heard others who for one reason or another have \nalready been opposed to it. But so far, none of them have come to the \nfloor to express that opposition.\n  I make it clear to anyone who is following the proceedings that one \nof the reasons we have delayed the vote as we have and kept the \nafternoon as open as we have has been to allow those who may be opposed \nto the Ensign amendment the opportunity to present their proposals.\n  We now are at 4:45. I expect the time is far gone and the vote will \nproceed. I didn't want anyone thinking we had made any effort to \nprevent anybody from presenting a different point of view than what \nSenator Ensign laid out when he proposed his amendment this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been asked throughout the vote \nwhether that is the last vote of the evening. That obviously is not my \ncall. It is the responsibility of the leader to make that decision. At \nthe moment, I don't know of any amendment that would require a vote. I \nwould hope that our colleagues who have amendments would be aggressive \nin coming to the floor now and offering them. We could offer an \namendment now, lay it down for a vote in the morning.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have an amendment. I would like to offer it.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Kansas satisfies our request instantly. \nI am happy to yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1742\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have an amendment pending at the desk \nnumbered 1742. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1742.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the conditions under which the Federal Crop \n  Insurance Corporation may offer crop insurance to single producers)\n\n       On page 173, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7___. Section 508(a)(4)(B) of the Federal Crop \n     Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(a)(4)(B)) is amended by \n     inserting ``or similar commodities'' after ``the commodity''.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. \nIt has been cleared by both the chairman and ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee, and I have also received word that the Risk \nManagement Agency is supportive of this change.\n  Very simply, the amendment amends the section of the Federal Crop \nInsurance Act regarding the use of written agreements for commodities \nin counties where the crop has not yet been approved for crop insurance \npurposes.\n  The problem is that 3 years of cropping history is needed in order to \nissue a written agreement for coverage. However, producers cannot get a \nhistory of planting because the banker won't lend the money if they \ncan't get insurance coverage. Thus, it is an endless cycle.\n  We have many counties where coverage exists for sunflowers, and we \nwould like to use that data to expand coverage to canola. The Risk \nManagement Agency has indicated that this would be an acceptable \npractice. However, the current law says that data must be used from the \nsame commodity for which the policy is being issued. This amendment \nsimply changes that language to allow data from agronomically similar \ncrops to be used in providing written agreements.\n  The amendment has been given a score of zero by the CBO, and I urge \nmy colleagues to accept it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have no objection to this amendment and \nbelieve we should move forward on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the current \namendment?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask that we withhold from the vote, and \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are now prepared to proceed to a voice \nvote on the Roberts amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that I speak \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair. I also thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, in charge of the proceedings right now, for this \nopportunity.\n\n\n                    RESPONSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. President, it has been 3 weeks now since the levees failed in New \nOrleans, and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, on which I am a member, is tomorrow holding its second public \nhearing since those levees failed. The title of the hearing is, ``After \nthe London Attacks, What Lessons Have Been Learned To Secure U.S \nTransit Systems?''\n  That is a worthy topic. I don't question that. But in the context of \nwhat is occurring in the United States, it is not, and should not, be \nthe most pressing priority of that committee.\n  On this coming Friday, we are having the second hearing of that \ncommittee related to Hurricane Katrina. The witnesses, very \ndistinguished individuals to be sure, are a county judge from Harris \nCounty, Texas; mayor of Baton Rouge, LA; mayor of Brookhaven, MS; and \nthe mayor of Fayetteville, AR--no one from the administration with \nresponsibility for the rescue-recovery efforts in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. No administration official is appearing, as \nlast week when the hearing was held no one with any direct \nresponsibility for Hurricane Katrina and the response to it by the \nFederal Government or any other level of Government was present.\n  Some would say we should not disrupt the relief efforts in that \nregion, and I totally agree. I do not want any of us to be involved in \nany way that is disruptive. Lord knows, those relief efforts have been \ndisruptive enough and continue to be by all the goings on down there. \nBut last Sunday, Coast Guard Vice Admiral Allen, now in charge of the \nrelief effort, found time to appear on four of the five major TV talk \nshows. Two weeks before, Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff found \ntime to appear on all five of the major TV Sunday talk shows. If they \nare actually in Louisiana or its vicinity around the clock leading the \nrecovery efforts, let's hook up a closed television system, \ncommunications system, and let them appear before our committee in a \npublic session via that communication, but to appear before the \ncommittee which has, under the Senate authorizing resolution, the \nauthority, not subject to some subsequent decision by the majority \nleadership with concurrence by a sufficient number of Members of the \nSenate to establish a select committee, but right now, here and now the \nauthority and the responsibility to this body and more importantly to \nthe American people to be conducting oversight and what is going on \nthere, how the now over $63 billion this body has appropriated, and \nnecessarily so, with more requests to come soon, how that money is \nbeing expended, or not. These are vital questions that are relevant to \ndecisions that are being made every day in expending those billions of \ndollars and affecting the lives of those people in that region of the \ncountry.\n  We have the right, the responsibility to be asking questions in \npublic hearings and getting answers from those who are directly \nresponsible in the administration. That is long overdue, and I urge \nagain the leadership of the committee and the leadership of the Senate, \nmajority leadership, to make the insistence and to assure that we get \nthe proper witnesses at the highest levels of the administration who \nare responsible, and that we get answers in public settings.\n  Similarly, tomorrow we are informed that the Secretary of Defense, \nDonald Rumsfeld, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Richard \nMyers, will be appearing before Members of the Senate to discuss the \nsituation in Iraq and Afghanistan. Once again, that gathering is going \nto be in a closed setting, private, nonpublic, no press, and not the \nAmerican people. This is a pattern that has been continued repeatedly \nover the last 3 months by the administration in not being willing to \nhave its top people responsible for the war effort in Iraq and \nAfghanistan appear in a public setting before the Committee on Armed \nServices, of which I am also a Member.\n  The last hearing that the Senate Armed Services Committee held \nregarding oversight in Iraq was almost 3 months ago. It was June 30 of \nthis year. Since then we have had, again, private top secret classified \nbriefings but nothing in a public setting where we can ask questions \nand where we and the American people can hear the answers.\n  I call upon this administration and its responsible authorities, \nCabinet Secretaries, those to whom the President has delegated \nresponsibility to make these life-and-death decisions affecting our \nconstituents, affecting the brave men and women who are serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, affecting the brave men and women who are involved in \nthe rescue efforts down in Southern United States, who are making \ndecisions affecting the lives of those of our constituents and our \ncitizens, make those leaders available to us in public hearings \nstarting now. We deserve the answers. The American people deserve the \nanswers.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I send the following bill to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thune pertaining to the introduction of S. 1733 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                        pet identification tags\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that the House report on this appropriations \nmeasure includes language that directs the APHIS to adopt a particular \nstandard with respect to microchip identification tags for pets, but \nthat the present measure does not include this language.\n  As the ranking member of the authorizing committee that has \njurisdiction over this issue, I strongly disagree with this language \nbeing inserted in an appropriations report, and with a process that \nwould dictate a standard for these microchips without fully considering \nalternatives. It is my understanding that pet animals with chips that \nconform to the standard included in the House report are a small \nfraction of all the pet animals in the U.S. that presently have a \nmicrochip identification tag implanted under their skin. These ID tags \nplay a vital role in reuniting pet animals that have gone astray with \ntheir families.\n  Further, I understand that adopting this standard as directed would \ninterfere with ongoing intellectual property litigation over patented \ntechnology incorporated in the most widely adopted microchip standard \nin the U.S. I think it would be improper for Congress to take this \naction at this time.\n  I do not advocate any action in the current legislation, other than \nto ensure that the language unfortunately included by the House is not \nincluded in the conference report. I would ask the subcommittee chair \nand the ranking member whether, since the Senate report is silent on \nthis issue, this issue is preserved for our consideration as part of \nthe conference, and whether they agree with me that this provision \nshould be dropped from the conference report?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would tell the Senator that I share his concern \nregarding this provision in the House Report. The report on the Senate \nversion of this legislation is silent on this matter, but this matter \nwill certainly be preserved for consideration in conference.\n  Mr. KOHL. I share the concerns of the Senator from Iowa and the \nobservations of Chairman Bennett and look forward to working with both \nof them on this in conference.\n\n\nOceanic Institute (Hawaii) Finfish Hatchery Technology Development and \n                                Transfer\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senators from Utah \nand Wisconsin yield? I would like to discuss\n\n[[Page S10227]]\n\nwith them the tremendous potential of open ocean cage culture as a \nsustainable source of high protein seafood for the United States and \nthe world, and the issues associated with advancing open ocean cage \nculture.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am pleased to yield to the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. KOHL. I, too, would also like to join in on the discussion of \nthis matter.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my distinguished colleagues for yielding. Along \nwith the increased demand for seafood, we have also witnessed the \ndecline in natural fisheries. While we have, as a Nation, made great \nadvances with land-based aquaculture to address the widening gap \nbetween seafood demand and supply, we are beginning to see the emerging \npotential of open ocean cage culture as a way to bolster supply without \ndetrimental impacts on the marine environment. With the development of \na viable open ocean cage aquaculture industry, we will have a valuable \ntool to assist our efforts to manage wild fisheries and ensure that \nUnited States consumers will have access to a range of high quality, \nenvironmentally responsible seafood products. I am proud to say that \nproducers and the marine aquaculture research community in my State of \nHawaii are among the leaders in the development of this new industry. \nTo date, growers in Hawaii have demonstrated the commercial viability \nof open ocean cage culture for Hawaiian finfish and have small scale \nventures that supply Hawaii as well as some mainland markets.\n  To move open ocean cage culture to the next level requires the \nrefinement and transfer of finfish hatchery technology to the industry. \nThe Oceanic Institute in Hawaii has been the leader in developing this \ntechnology but recently has encountered problems in scaling hatchery \ntechnology to a commercial level. To overcome these problems, this \nresearch organization has recently expressed a need to remove the \nnutritional and other constraints in the raising of finfish fingerlings \ndestined for open ocean cages. This will involve some redirection of \nfunds provided by this committee for the Oceanic Institute of Hawaii \nfor a comprehensive aquaculture development research program. \nSpecifically, there is a need to shift funds from more general feed \nissues to the myriad problems associated with raising fingerlings on a \ncommercial scale for open ocean cages. I support such changes in the \nuse of funds appropriated for the Oceanic Institute of Hawaii and seek \nyour concurrence.\n  Mr. BENNETT. In developing a new industry, I fully understand the \nneed to be flexible and recognize that all issues cannot be anticipated \nduring the initial phases of a project. I fully concur with the request \nfor flexibility in the use of the funds provided by this committee.\n  Mr. KOHL. I concur with my colleagues from Hawaii and Utah and \nencourage the Agricultural Research Service to work closely with the \nOceanic Institute in utilizing funds appropriated for aquaculture \ndevelopment to specifically address finfish hatchery technology \nrefinement and transfer to the industry.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to describe my amendment to the \nfiscal year 2006 Agriculture appropriations legislation. My amendment \nwould extend the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, program for 2 years. \nIt is imperative that we extend this crucial program for our dairy \nfarmers that expires at the end of this month.\n  The MILC program provides a safety-net for farmers when the price of \nmilk falls below a set price per hundredweight, or 100 pounds of milk, \nroughly 11 gallons. Dairy farmers in Pennsylvania, and across the \ncountry, are an integral component of our rural economy. In \nPennsylvania alone, agriculture is our No. 1 industry with dairy being \nthe largest sector composing over 40 percent of the industry. We need \nto ensure that dairy farmers, like most farmers in America, have the \nprotection needed when the price they receive for their milk falls.\n  During the consideration of the 2002 farm bill, I coauthored this \nprogram to provide payments to dairy farmers when the price of Class I \nfluid milk falls below $16.94 per hundredweight. This program applies \nto all dairy farmers in the United States, from my former home State of \nKansas to Oregon to Georgia and all the way up to Maine.\n  When the milk prices are low, as they were in 2002 and part of 2003, \nthe MILC program partially supplements dairy farm income to bridge the \ngap until prices recover. When the milk prices are strong, the program \nis dormant. This was the case for most of 2004 and 2005. However, one \npayment of 3 cents per hundredweight was made in June.\n  However, dairy economists forecast that the price of milk will fall \nin 2006 below the set price established in the MILC program. Thus, \nthere is an urgency to extend this program to ensure that our dairy \nfarmers continue to have the safety-net of the MILC program. If prices \nfall and the MILC program is not in place, our farmers will suffer \ntremendous losses.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support this amendment and America's \ndairy farmers.\n\n\n                            notice of intent\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in accordance with rule V of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, I hereby give notice in writing that it is my \nintention to move to suspend paragraph 4 of rule XVI for the purpose of \nproposing to the bill, H.R. 2744, the Agriculture appropriations bill, \nthe following amendment:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1756\n\n       On page 173, after line 24, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7___.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 12th annual \nNational Public Lands Day that is set to take place on Saturday, \nSeptember 24, 2005. Across the Nation, nearly 100,000 people will come \ntogether on this day to get their hands dirty while protecting and \nimproving our Nation's public lands. And today I would like to offer my \nheartfelt appreciation to every man, woman, and child that contributes \nto this vital campaign.\n  In Nevada, where nearly 87 percent of our lands are managed by \nFederal agencies, the relationship between the people and our public \nlands is tangible and real. For ranchers, hunters, farmers, hikers, \nminers, and every Nevadan that has driven a lonely dirt road in search \nof solitude, our public lands represent an irreplaceable resource. That \nis why programs like National Public Lands Day--that remind us that we \nall reap the rewards of good stewardship, and that we suffer together \nwhen our lands are mismanaged or abused--are so important.\n  Those individuals that will rise early in the morning on the 24th of \nthis month to help with one of the more than 650 National Public Lands \nDay projects will be giving a gift of service to the local landscapes, \nto the local communities, and to people of the United States at large. \nI thank these volunteers, and the staff of the land management agencies \nwho are tasked with the responsibility of protecting, managing, and \nmaintaining these lands each and every day. Our public lands are one of \nthe most important national legacies that we leave behind for future \ngenerations. Working together--at places like Lake Mead, Mount \nCharleston, Red Rock Canyon, Lake Tahoe, the Ruby Mountains, and the \nBlack Rock Desert--we can make sure that this legacy is a strong one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10228-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10228-S10229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the first concurrent \nresolution on the budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2005 \nbudget through September 14, 2005. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2006 concurrent resolution on the budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is under the budget \nresolution by $1.922 billion in budget authority and over the budget \nresolution by $101 million in outlays in 2005. Current level for \nrevenues is $447 million above the budget resolution in 2005.\n  Since my last report dated July 28, 2005, the Congress has cleared \nand the President has signed the following acts that changed budget \nauthority, outlays, or revenues: the Surface Transportation Extension \nAct of 2005, Part V (P.L. 109-40); the Interior Appropriations Act, \n2006 (P.L. 109-54); the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58); the \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A \nLegacy for Users (P.L. 109-59); the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act to Meet Immediate Needs Arising from the \nConsequences of Hurricane Katrina, 2005 (P.L. 109-61); and the Second \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act to Meet Immediate Needs \nArising from the Consequences of Hurricane Katrina, 2005 (P.L. 109-62).\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2005.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, over the course of this entire month we are \ncelebrating National Drug and Alcohol Addiction Recovery Month, a time \nwhen we focus on the benefits of substance abuse treatment and \nhighlight the hope of recovery for those in the grasp of drug and \nalcohol addiction. And today, September 20, we are focusing on the men \nand women who help guide people to recovery as we recognize National \nAddiction Counselor's Day. These professionals are unsung heroes who \ndeserve our recognition, respect, and gratitude.\n  It is an unfortunate reality that substance abuse and addiction are \npervasive in our country. Last year, over 19 million Americans used \nillicit drugs, 55 million had engaged in binge drinking, and over 16 \nmillion were considered heavy drinkers. These are staggering \nstatistics. We have all known someone a family member, friend, or \ncoworker who has or has had a drug or alcohol problem. Many of us have \neven spent time trying to convince a loved one to seek treatment, \nconfident that a good treatment center and a qualified health \nprofessional would be able to restore hope to our loved one and help \nthem into recovery.\n  Left untreated, addiction is a devastating disease which has far-\nreaching consequences. It exacerbates social ills including crime, \ndisease, child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and a wide range \nof family problems. It costs society billions each year in health care \ncosts, lost productivity, and property damage. It also costs lives and \ncauses immeasurable amounts of grief and pain. But there is hope: drug \nand alcohol abuse are treatable problems. Addiction is a chronic \nrelapsing disease and, as with other chronic relapsing diseases such as \ndiabetes, hypertension and asthma, there may not be a cure but there \nare a number of treatments to control the disease. That means that \naddicts are not sentenced to living their lives out of control; they \ncan seek treatment with an addiction counselor or other health \nprofessional and take charge of their futures.\n  The people who treat this destructive disease are a dedicated, \nknowledgeable group of professionals who have committed themselves to a \nnoble cause. They are a critical part of our Nation's health care \nsystem. Today there are countless sober individuals living happy, \nproductive lives only because, in a moment-of-truth, a counselor was \nthere and made the difference. Not only do these counselors assist in \nrecovery but in prevention and intervention as well. Through training \nand experience, addiction professionals can help turn a life around and \noften even save it. And for the friends and family of a person \nstruggling with addiction, counselors are an answer to a prayer, \nguiding their loved one to a life in recovery.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the \npriceless contributions of addiction counselors, and giving them our \ngratitude. Their work to restore hope to shattered lives and broken \nfamilies is invaluable. I applaud their work and hope that on National \nAddiction Counselor's Day they know how much they are respected and \nappreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10229-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10229-S10230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             chief warrant officer two stephen e. shephard\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I would like to stand in honor of a \ngreat Oklahoman. CWO2 Stephen Shephard gave his life in the battle for \nfreedom in Iraq. Steven is a true American hero who joined the war \nagainst terrorism after he witnessed the September 11 attacks on our \nown country. He was truly an admirable soldier and a great man.\n  Chief Warrant Officer Shephard was born in Stillwater, OK, in 1974. \nHis family then moved to Purcell, OK, where Stephen attended Purcell \nschools until he graduated in 1993. Stephen played baseball and the \nsaxophone in high school. His baseball coach remembers him as \n``hardworking and dedicated.'' His friends remember him as having a \ngreat sense of humor. In high school, Stephen was voted ``most witty.''\n  Ever since he was a child, Chief Warrant Officer Two Shephard had a \nlove for aviation. He got his pilot's license before he even graduated \nfrom high school. His sister says that ``being a pilot was his lifelong \ndream.'' After graduating from high school, Stephen earned a bachelor's \ndegree in aviation from Oklahoma State University and then served as a \nflight instructor at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs and at \nKansas State University. Stephen was a wonderful teacher with patience \nand a sense of humor in the classroom. His students loved him and \nlooked up to him.\n  In 1998, Stephen married Meleah, who is also from Purcell. Like many \nother Americans, Stephen felt a call to duty following the September 11 \nattacks, and he joined the Army in 2002 in response to that call. \nStephen and Meleah were expecting their first child in September of \nthis year.\n  Stephen was assigned to B Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Aviation \nRegiment of the 3rd Infantry Division out of Fort Bragg, NC. He was \nkilled on June 27, 2005, in Tija, Iraq, when enemy forces shot down the \nApache helicopter he was flying. Stephen died doing what he loved--\nflying--and fighting for our freedom.\n  For this soldier from Purcell, OK, there is no deeper honor than the \nmemory he leaves behind. He gave of himself in life as well as in \ndeath, and stands out as an example to all of us. Today I honor a true \nhero, CWO2 Stephen Shephard.\n\n\n                  marine sergeant james r. graham, iii\n\n  Mr. President, it is a great but solemn honor to rise today in memory \nof a courageous young man who recently gave his life in defense of his \nNation and his fellow soldiers, Marine Sgt James R. Graham, III.\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\n  Sergeant Graham, 25, leaves behind a wife and two small children. He \nwas known for his kindness and willingness to help others, often \nplaying soccer with neighborhood children.\n  Sergeant Graham was assigned to 4th Tank Battalion, 4th Marine \nDivision, Marine Forces Reserve, an antitank unit based in Broken \nArrow, OK. He was deployed to Iraq with the 2nd Marine Division, II \nMarine Expeditionary Force to provide support in the ongoing \nreconstruction and security efforts. While serving there he was awarded \nthe Good Conduct Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and the \nSelective Marine Corps Reserve medal. On Monday, August 1, he was \nkilled as a result of a suicide bombing while conducting combat \noperations near Hit, a city about 85 miles northwest of Baghdad.\n  The soldiers, friends, and family who are left behind remember a true \nexample of professionalism and patriotism. Sergeant Graham died a true \nhero, worthy of the respect and gratitude of every American. None among \nus can dispute the tragedy of plans unrealized and ambitions \nunfulfilled, and our thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Graham's \nwife and family. Though we are all grieved by the loss of this soldier, \nwe will never cease to be proud of him. His sacrifice echoes across the \nworld and in our hearts. He was a true Oklahoman, and a true American--\nSgt James Graham, III.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10230-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OPERATION HOME DELIVERY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

A \nmajor component of this operation is the ``home in a box project.''\n  The plan is to ``pre-build'' the frame of a home. The house will be \nassembled to ensure the construction, and, then, the frame will be \ntaken apart and the components placed, along with other necessary \nconstruction materials, in a container and shipped to an area along the \ngulf coast or New Orleans where families, volunteers, and builders will \nrebuild the home.\n  ``Operation Home Delivery'' homes will mirror traditional Habitat \nhomes by being simple and affordable, providing approximately 1,100 to \n1,300 square feet of living space. The estimated cost of a house for \nthe gulf region is only $85,000. This includes all components to \ncompletely build the home and costs associated with transportation, \ndelivery, utilities and site preparation. The first project in \n``Operation Home Delivery'' will be this month in Jackson, MS.\n  I am asking each Senator to go back to your respective States and \nseek assistance for Habitat for this outstanding project. Designated \ndollars for ``Operation Home Delivery'' will purchase specific pieces \nof the house. For example, $35 will buy roof shingles or $100 will buy \na front door. These gifts will allow people not only to have a home but \nto begin to rebuild their lives.\n  Habitat for Humanity is working to provide hope for the future to the \nvictims of Katrina with this worthy project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10230-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On September 22, 2004, a 36-year-old man was stabbed several times \noutside his home by two men in New Orleans, LA. The apparent motivation \nfor the attack was the man's sexual orientation.\n  I would note that recently in the House, hate crimes legislation was \npassed in a bipartisan vote. I strongly believe that we must also move \nsimilar legislation in the Senate. In the months ahead I look forward \nto working with Senator Kennedy as we continue our work in passing a \nhate crimes bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10230-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ``SHOW-ME'' LEADERSHIP THAT SAVED LIVES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the tragedy that has befallen the gulf coast \nregion, its impact on families and communities, has been truly \nstaggering. Our thoughts and prayers are with each individual who has \nbeen affected by this hurricane. Yet even in our darkest hours and our \nmost difficult days once again we have seen the emergence of an \nAmerican spirit that takes pride in triumphing in the face of great \nadversity. The examples of this American spirit are too numerous to \ndocument. We have seen examples in every neighborhood, every city, and \nevery state in the nation as Americans all over the country have \nrallied around those who are most in need. In Missouri, we have opened \nour doors and welcomed displaced families to our homes, our \ncommunities, our churches, our schools, our health centers, and our \nhospitals.\n  Today, I would especially like to highlight the efforts to bring some \nof New Orleans' littlest victims to safety in Kansas City. Confronted \nwith no electricity, shortage of supplies and the growing security \nconcerns in the face of looters, the New Orleans Children's Hospital \nwas forced to evacuate and seek safer locations for all of their young \npatients. In the great spirit of the Show-Me State, the dedicated \nleadership and staff of Kansas City Children's Mercy Hospital didn't \nsit back and wait to be asked to help. Instead, Children's Mercy \nPresident and CEO Rand O'Donnell picked up the phone and called the CEO \nof the New Orleans Children's and asked how he could help. Children's \nMercy threw open their doors to make room for 24 of these children \nranging in age from 3 months to 23 years, from New Orleans Children's \nHospital. These patients are being treated for a variety of conditions \nincluding asthma, cystic fibrosis, leukemia, kidney failure, and broken \nbones.\n  With the help of the Missouri National Guard, two C-130 military \ntransport planes transported the patients and family members from New \nOrleans. The C-130 planes, part of the 139th Airlift Wing in St. \nJoseph, MO, were already in the region as part of national hurricane \nrelief efforts. Children's Mercy also sent a smaller, fixed-wing \naircraft capable of transporting two patients at a time. That plane and \nthe Children's Mercy crew were used to transport a critically ill child \nto another children's hospital. Children's Mercy and MAST ambulances \nhelped transport the children from the airport to Children's Mercy and \nChildren's Mercy South. About 30 parents and other family members \ntraveled with the patients. I am pleased to report that these children \nare doing well; in fact some of these children have already been \ndischarged from the hospital.\n  Missouri, no stranger to disaster, wasted no time in showing folks \nthat in difficult times we pull together, sending doctors, transport \nteams, supplies, and the National Guard to rescue these children and \ntheir families. Children's Mercy even arranged for lodging, food and \ntransportation to be provided for the parents and families during their \ntime in Kansas City. Thanks to the generosity and hospitality shown to \nthese families by both the hospital and the community some of these \nfamilies are considering a permanent relocation to the Kansas City \narea.\n  I rise today to salute the remarkable work of the staff at Kansas \nCity Children's Mercy and the Missouri Air Guard on behalf of some of \nthe hurricane's littlest victims and their families. In times of \ntrouble, people look for leadership. During a week of great \nuncertainty, you pulled together as a team and led people from chaos to \nsafety. Together you provided leadership and hope to those who \ndesperately needed it. You were an inspirational example to others \nseeking to provide help. I have never been prouder to represent you and \nthe State of Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10231-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n                                S. 1711\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while I do not make it a practice to \ncomment on every bill that has been introduced, I am moved to remark on \nwhat I consider to be a particularly misguided recent legislative \ninitiative--a bill allowing the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, \nthe very agency charged with protecting the public's health, to waive \nall laws under its jurisdiction--public health and environmental laws--\nduring the cleanup of hurricane Katrina. The bill, S. 1711, would even \nallow these waivers over local and State opposition.\n  People returning to areas devastated by the hurricane deserve to \nknow, among other things, that their water is safe to drink and that \nnew construction won't put them or their families in harm's way by \npolluting their air or by destroying wetlands that can provide valuable \necological services. Although the legislation calls for up to 18 months \nof waivers, given the long-term nature of the types of activities \ninvolved, the effects of these waivers could be long lasting.\n  The broad approach being pushed is completely unnecessary and puts \npeople and the environmental resources they depend upon at risk. While \nall of us want to help those affected by hurricane Katrina, there is \nsimply no valid reason to think that we need to erode established \nenvironmental and public health protections in order to do so. We \nshould be focused not on efforts that could harm the very people who \nhave already faced the unthinkable but on efforts that will safeguard \nthe health of the public and the health of the environment. Anything \nshort of this should be off the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10231-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEFEATING TERRORIST NETWORKS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, throughout the 4 years since the \nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on this country, it has been \nclear to me that our first national security priority must be combating \nand defeating the terrorist networks that seek to do us harm. Former \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke wrote a \nthought-provoking piece about the ideological battleground that is a \nvitally important part of our challenge, and about the importance of \npublic diplomacy efforts in our overall campaign. It was published in \nthe Washington Post on September 9, and I ask that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 9, 2005]\n\n                            Our Enemy's Face\n\n                         (By Richard Holbrooke)\n\n       Let us take a hard look at some extremely important words: \n     ``the global war on terrorism.'' Since Sept. 11, this \n     phrase--often reduced in Washingtonese to ``GWOT''--has \n     entered the English language, popularized by journalists and \n     administration officials. It is the way our highest national \n     priority is described by almost everyone.\n       But ``GWOT'' is not an accurate description of America's \n     enemy or of what we are engaged in. Unless people know whom \n     we are fighting, it will be virtually impossible to win the \n     war of ideas that is such a key part of this struggle. The \n     new undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, Karen \n     Hughes, who is charged with primary responsibility for this \n     part of the war, has a chance to fix the problem, but only if \n     she is willing to change some deeply ingrained rhetoric and \n     the political reasons behind it.\n       Stopping terrorists, using all necessary means, is vital in \n     protecting the Nation. We cannot win without the use of force \n     and first-rate intelligence. But suicide bombers are merely \n     the expendable, deluded cannon fodder of ruthless ideologues. \n     This has been true with terrorists throughout history. The \n     long-term battle is against the underlying ideas and leaders \n     behind these specific groups of terrorists.\n       Despite factionalism and fierce doctrinal disputes, our \n     enemies, broadly speaking, constitute a movement, with goals, \n     gurus, ideologues, myths and martyrs. They share a core set \n     of virulently anti-Western beliefs and have common goals: to \n     destroy the moderate (and still majority) wing of Islam, to \n     establish Islamist theocracies that look backward toward a \n     mythic ``golden age,'' to seek the destruction of Israel, and \n     to inflict maximum damage and human suffering through acts of \n     terrorism.\n       Among its leaders, there is one whose face is as \n     internationally recognized today as Adolf Hitler's was in \n     1941. He was responsible for Sept. 11. Yet the United States \n     has not made it a primary goal to expose Osama bin Laden as \n     the monster he is, something Roosevelt and Winston Churchill \n     did to Hitler, and American leadership did to communism \n     during the Cold War by demonstrating its moral and \n     intellectual bankruptcy. Bin Laden (unlike Saddam Hussein) \n     has been virtually ignored in public by official Washington.\n       Terrorism is not an end in itself; it is a tactic, just as \n     it has been for countless other movements throughout history \n     that sought to destroy or paralyze the established order, or \n     attract attention to their cause. Over 2 years ago, Zbigniew \n     Brzezinski, among others, pointed out that a ``war on \n     terror'' was like a ``war on blitzkrieg'' or a ``war on \n     war.'' For this important insight, the former national \n     security adviser was both attacked and ignored. During the \n     2004 campaign, I stumbled into a public dispute with senior \n     administration officials, including Vice President Cheney, \n     when, as a John Kerry surrogate, I told a New York Times \n     Magazine writer that the phrase could be considered a \n     metaphor and compared it to phrases such as the ``war on \n     poverty.'' For this both Kerry and I were assailed as naive, \n     and I was asked, in the sneering tones of certain cable \n     television interviewers, if I really thought we were at war \n     with a ``metaphor.''\n       Of course not. But despite the grand rhetoric, does anyone \n     think the United States is actually fighting ``terror'' or \n     ``terrorism'' globally? We may detest terrorism in Sri Lanka, \n     but we are not engaged in that civil war. Nor in Nepal, \n     northern Uganda, Aceh or countless places around the world.\n       By calling both Iraq and Sept. 11 part of the war on \n     terrorism, the administration has been partially successful \n     in linking public support for the less popular war in Iraq to \n     the universally supported fight against al Qaeda, even though \n     no convincing evidence has been produced connecting the two. \n     No other explanation has proved as valuable in keeping \n     Americans, albeit in declining numbers, behind our \n     increasingly controversial involvement in Iraq. ``GWOT,'' as \n     Dan Froomkin wrote on The Post's Web site last month, is \n     ``the metaphor that has consistently been [President Bush's] \n     most potent weapon in the battle for public opinion.''\n       The struggle against violent extremism will continue, of \n     course, long after bin Laden is eliminated by death or \n     capture. It will be a long conflict, with casualties and high \n     costs, just like the efforts against fascism and communism. \n     But fundamentally this is a war of ideas, and a more \n     aggressive, direct attack on those ideas, and the men behind \n     them, is necessary.\n       For starters, Osama bin Laden must be discredited, even if \n     he remains at large. He is not, as some argue, irrelevant \n     simply because his war will continue after he is gone \n     (although, of course, it will). He remains a folk hero to \n     millions of Muslims; youths wear T-shirts of him and children \n     are named after him throughout the Muslim world. The United \n     States should stop ignoring him and his henchmen; exposing \n     them must become a top priority. He is a false prophet who \n     incites mass murder, but he is clearly eloquent and \n     charismatic. His ideas, no matter how insane they seem to us, \n     appeal to many people. (Hitler had those qualities, too.)\n       Which brings us back to Karen Hughes. With her enormous \n     bureaucratic clout, derived from her closeness with President \n     Bush, the new undersecretary of state has a chance to make \n     history. To do so, however, she must change some fundamental \n     parts of our public message, and then devise better delivery \n     systems for it--precisely what she did so effectively for \n     Bush during so many campaigns.\n       Hughes should begin by revisiting what her own boss said on \n     Aug. 6, 2004, speaking without a text. ``We actually misnamed \n     the war on terror,'' the president said that day. ``It ought \n     to be the struggle against ideological extremists who do not \n     believe in free societies, who happen to use terror as a \n     weapon.'' He was, inexplicably, laughed at for this remark, \n     and rapidly retreated to safer rhetorical terrain. More \n     recently, when Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld tried to \n     replace ``GWOT'' with the ``global struggle against violent \n     extremism''--a somewhat more accurate phrase--the president \n     immediately overruled him and again linked GWOT closely to \n     Iraq during a series of public appearances.\n       But the president got it right last year. Words matter, and \n     we need better ones to explain to the world, and to \n     ourselves, who the enemy is. How about making it simple and \n     specific: something like ``the war against Osama bin laden \n     and his followers''? And then create an all-out, no-holds-\n     barred campaign to expose, ridicule and destroy everything he \n     and his ilk stand for--murder, horror, intolerance, \n     disrespect for human life and a false view of Islam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10231-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10231-S10232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF REVEREND DR. VAHAN H. TOOTIKIAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to a distinguished religious leader in Michigan, Reverend Dr. \nVahan H. Tootikian. Dr. Tootikian will be honored at a special \ntestimonial banquet on Sunday, September 25, 2005, in Troy, MI. The \ntribute will mark his retirement from active parish ministry and will \nrecognize his 30 years as pastor of\n\n[[Page S10232]]\n\nthe Armenian Congregational Church of Greater Detroit and his 46 years \nof Christian ministry. Since accepting his call to the ministry in \n1959, Dr. Tootikian has used his talents and unique skills to encourage \nand enlighten people around the world. He has earned the respect and \nadmiration of the Armenian and the greater religious community in \nMichigan, throughout North America, and around the world for his \npastoral leadership and his commitment and devotion to service.\n  Born in Kessab, Syria in 1935, Dr. Tootikian received his primary \neducation at the Armenian Evangelical schools in Syria and his \nsecondary education in Beirut, Lebanon. He simultaneously earned a \nbachelor of art degree with honors and a bachelor of theology degree \nwith honors from the American University of Beirut and the Near East \nSchool of Theology, respectively. He then served as pastor of Armenian \nEvangelical Churches in Syria and Egypt before coming to the United \nStates in 1965 to pursue religious studies at Hartford Seminary, \nHarvard Divinity School, and Andover Newton Theological Seminary. While \nserving as minister of the Armenian Memorial Church in Watertown, MA, \nDr. Tootikian earned a master of sacred theological degree in 1970, and \na doctor of ministry degree cum laude in 1973.\n  In 1975, Dr. Tootikian was welcomed into the pastorate of the \nArmenian Congregational Church of Greater Detroit. Under his spiritual \nguidance, the Church has flourished and undergone expansion, which has \nincluded a new Christian Education Building, the founding of an \nArmenian library, and the organizing of the Armenian Heritage Committee \nto preserve and perpetuate the Armenian Christian Heritage.\n  Over the years, Dr. Tootikian has also provided leadership to \nnumerous organizations, including the Armenian Evangelical Union of \nAmerica, Armenian Missionary Association of America, and the Armenian \nEvangelical World Council--AEWC. During his tenure with AEWC, the \n1700th Anniversary of Armenian Christendom was celebrated by all \nArmenian Evangelical Unions in Yerevan, Armenia, and the first Armenian \nEvangelical Pastors' Conference was held in May 2003 in Evian, France. \nAs a scholar and lecturer, Dr. Tootikian has provided instruction at \nthe University of Michigan and at the Lawrence Technological \nUniversity. Dr. Tootikian has authored 27 books, with 6 of them \ncurrently in use as college textbooks. In addition, he has been a \nfrequent contributor to many magazines and papers, and currently writes \nbilingual articles for 12 Armenian papers and periodicals. His efforts \nin support of various educational, philanthropic, religious and \ncultural organizations have been recognized through many awards and the \nestablishment of endowment funds in his honor.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Tootikian on his \nservice to the community, and on his many achievements in the pastoral \nministry. I am pleased to offer my best wishes to him on his \nretirement, and for many more years of good health, happiness, and \ncontribution to the spiritual well being of many people around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10232-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:39 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3649) to ensure \nfunding for sportfishing and boating safety programs funded out of the \nHighway Trust Fund through the end of fiscal year 2005, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1340.

    By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1729. A bill to extend the time during which persons affected by \nHurricane Katrina may appeal certain decisions of the Board of \nVeterans' Appeals that are rendered during the period beginning June 1, \n2005, and ending November 30, 2005; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I want to discuss one of the many \npotential problems that will face this Nation in the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina. We have all heard the stories of the displacement of \nthousands of citizens from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Many of \nthese people have lost everything--their homes and belongings \ndestroyed.\n  Undoubtedly, some of these people are veterans with claims they wish \nto appeal from the Board of Veterans' Appeals to the Court of Appeals \nfor Veterans Claims. Under current law, a veteran has 120-days to file \na notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. If a \nnotice of appeal is not filed within the 120-day window, the veteran \nessentially loses the right to appeal and might not receive benefits to \nwhich the veteran is entitled.\n  Given the current conditions in the gulf coast region, Congress must \nconclude that 120 days is not enough time for a veteran to file a \nnotice of appeal. The sheer stress of the situation and the possibility \nthat veterans and their advocates may not have access to the \nappropriate files makes 120 days for appeals unreasonable.\n  I have submitted legislation that extends the window for a notice of \nappeal from 120 days to 240 days for a veteran affected by Hurricane \nKatrina. This extension will provide appropriate relief to those \nattempting to rebuild their lives. Veterans should not be additionally \nburdened during these turbulent times.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and it \nis my hope that this legislation will pass the Senate in the near \nfuture. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1729\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF TIME FOR APPEAL OF CERTAIN DECISIONS \n                   RENDERED BY BOARD OF VETERANS' APPEALS.\n\n       (a) Appeal Period.--Notwithstanding section 7266(a) of \n     title 38, United States Code, a Hurricane Katrina-affected \n     person adversely affected by a final decision of the Board of \n     Veterans' Appeals, which is rendered during the period \n     beginning on June 1, 2005, and ending on November 30, 2005, \n     may file a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for \n     Veterans Claims at any time before the expiration of 240 days \n     after the date on which notice of such decision is mailed \n     pursuant to section 7104(e) of such title.\n       (b) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``Hurricane Katrina-\n     affected person'' means a person--\n       (1) who, as of August 28, 2005, resided in a county \n     identified as being adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina \n     in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, or Alabama by Federal \n     Disaster Declaration notice 1602, 1603, 1604, or 1605, \n     respectively (as amended), issued by the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency; or\n       (2) whose claim is under the jurisdiction of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs regional office in New Orleans, Louisiana \n     or Jackson, Mississippi.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1730. A bill to establish the Trust Fund Administration to invest \nin non-Federal Government debt instrument index funds all Federal trust \nfund revenues transferred to the Federal Government upon the issuance \nof special rate Treasury obligations to such trust funds, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Voinovich of \nOhio in introducing a new Social Security lockbox proposal, the Truth \nin Budgeting Act of 2005. For years, I have urged my colleagues to stop \nwhat I believe is the reckless practice of raiding Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses to pay for other things. By failing to save these \nsurpluses, we are putting future generations in the position of having \nto borrow trillions of dollars to make good on our Social Security, \nMedicaid, Medicare, and other commitments.\n  The legislation Senator Voinovich and I are introducing today would \nnot only take Washington's hand out of the Social Security cookie jar, \nit would literally take the cookie jar away. If our bill is adopted, \nSocial Security surpluses and other trust fund surpluses would no \nlonger be used to fund other functions of Government and to mask the \nsize of the Federal deficit. Instead, Social Security payroll taxes \nwould be used to provide future Social Security benefits, as they were \nalways intended.\n  Our bill would end the practice of spending trust fund surpluses. \nInstead, it would require those surpluses to be set aside and invested \nin a broadbased bond index fund that will be drawn on to finance our \nfuture obligations. In many ways, this legislation is a truth-in-\nbudgeting bill because it will force us to recognize the true size of \nour fiscal deficit. It is our hope this will force Congress and the \nPresident to work together to address not only our current budget \nimbalances but our long-term entitlement challenges.\n  Let me take a few minutes, if I could, to explain why I think this \nlegislation is so important.\n  Our budget situation has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Over \nthe last 5 years, we have gone from record surpluses to record \ndeficits. The 2005 deficit is now projected to be $331 billion, the \nthird worst in U.S. history. That is before Katrina. The increase in \ndebt this year will be far higher.\n  This is something that I find confuses the American people, confuses \nmy constituents, confuses the media, and perhaps even confuses our \ncolleagues: The advertised deficit--$331 billion before Katrina--is not \nthe amount the debt will increase by this year. The amount the debt \nwill increase by is much larger, approaching $589 billion,\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\nand that is before Katrina. Why the difference? Because in the deficit \ncalculation, borrowing from trust funds is ignored. It is not ignored \nwhen you consider how much the debt is increasing. It is ignored in the \ndeficit calculation.\n  But, for example, the $173 billion this year that will be borrowed \nfrom the Social Security trust fund and used to pay for other things, \nis not included in the deficit calculation. It is added to our debt. It \nhas to be paid back. It is not included in the deficit calculation.\n  There are $85 billion of other transactions, such as that one, that \nwill add up to a total of a $589 billion increase in the debt. Again, \nthat is before Katrina.\n  Looking forward, our current budget takes every penny of Social \nSecurity surplus over the next 10 years to pay for tax cuts and other \nspending priorities. Over the next 10 years, under the budget that has \nbeen passed here, every penny of Social Security surplus is being taken \nto pay for other things--$2 .5 trillion.\n  The reported shortfall in Social Security over the next 75 years is \n$4 trillion on a net present value basis. I, frankly, do not believe \nthat. I think that shortfall is significantly overstated. But if it \nwere real, if it were $4 trillion, look at the comparison here on this \nchart: We are taking $2.5 trillion in Social Security money over the \nnext 10 years, using it to pay for other things, when we say Social \nSecurity has a $4 trillion shortfall on a net present value basis. What \nsense does this make? We are digging the hole deeper before starting to \nfill it in.\n\n  I said something I want to go back to because I indicated I do not \nbelieve the projected $4 trillion shortfall in Social Security is \ncorrect. That is the estimate of the actuaries. I think they are wrong. \nWhy do I think they are wrong? Because their whole scenario is based on \neconomic growth for the next 75 years averaging 1.9 percent a year. \nOver the previous 75 years, the economy has grown at 3.4 percent a \nyear. If the economy were to grow in the future as it has in the past, \n80 percent of the Social Security shortfall would disappear.\n  Does that mean we do not have a problem? No. I wish it did. We have a \nhuge problem. The problem we have, I believe, is a budget problem. The \nproblem we have is, first, we are running very large deficits now \nbefore the baby boomers retire. No.2, the shortfall in Medicare is 7 \ntimes the shortfall in Social Security, approaching $30 trillion. There \nis the real 800-pound gorilla.\n  In Social Security, the problem is not so much the shortfall, at \nleast from my perspective. I think the problem is that the assets in \nthe Social Security trust fund--and there are assets there. Anybody who \ntells you there are no assets there is wrong. There are assets there. \nThey are special-interest Government bonds, backed by the full faith \nand credit of the United States, that are in the trust fund. The \nproblem is, those bonds have to be redeemed out of current income. That \nis the problem. Those bonds sitting in the Social Security trust fund \nhave to be redeemed out of current income.\n  We already have a circumstance in which we are running massive \ndeficits. We have this looming shortfall in Medicare. Oh, yes, we have \na problem. We have a big problem, and the sooner we get at it, the \nbetter. The first thing to do is stop diverting Social Security money \nto use for other purposes. As I have indicated, this increase in debt \nis happening at the worst possible time, right on the brink of the \nretirement of the baby boom generation. The number of Social Security \nbeneficiaries is projected to climb to 81 million people by 2050. This \nis not a projection. It is not a projection. The baby boomers have been \nborn. They are alive today. They are going to retire, and they are \neligible for Social Security and Medicare. That has enormous \nimplications for the future.\n  As stunning as it may seem, we are only 3 years away from the \nbeginning of the retirement of the baby boom generation. Social \nSecurity trust funds are running surpluses now. But starting in 2017, \npayroll tax revenue will no longer be sufficient to pay for benefits. \nThose bonds we are issuing to the Social Security trust fund will have \nto be redeemed out of current revenues at the time. At this point, as \nshown on the chart, the Social Security surpluses will turn into Social \nSecurity deficits--out here in 2017. When that happens, a serious \nbudget crunch will ensue, unless we find a way now to save those \nsurpluses.\n  Another way of looking at this is by looking at the total balances in \nthe Social Security trust funds, which are expected to peak at over $6 \ntrillion in 2026. As shown on this chart, this is the pattern of the \nSocial Security trust fund assets. You can see, right now we are at \nabout 2005, about right here, and we are still in the buildup phase. \nThere are massive surpluses being run in the Social Security accounts. \nBut instead of the money being used to prepay the liability or to pay \ndown debt, the money is being used to pay for other things.\n  So here we have it. We have this massive buildup. In 2026, roughly, \nthe trust fund assets peak at $6 trillion, and then they begin being \ndrawn down precipitously. We have a problem. It is a serious problem. \nIt is a problem that is inexorable. Unfortunately, our current budget \npolicy is contributing to the problem because it is taking the amount \nthat is in surplus every year and using it to pay other bills. That is \ncomfortable. That is easy. But it does not help us deal with the \nproblem.\n\n  In 2001, I urged my colleagues to set aside $900 billion of what was \nthen projected to be surplus to either prepay the liability or pay down \ndebt. For those who are advocates of personal accounts, the money could \nhave been used to establish personal accounts, not borrowing it but \nputting real assets behind it. For those who do not like personal \naccounts, the money could have been used to pay down debt to better \nprepare ourselves for the time when the baby boomers retire.\n  The chart I was showing before perfectly illustrates why this is no \ntime to permanently or continually divert Social Security and other \ntrust fund surpluses to other purposes. Failing to return to a fiscal \npath of saving trust fund surpluses will severely limit Congress' \nability to address the looming pension and health care needs of the \nbaby boomers and will shift a larger debt and tax burden on to future \ngenerations.\n  Any private-sector corporation that behaved like the Federal \nGovernment is behaving would find its chief officers on their way to a \nFederal institution, but it would not be the Congress of the United \nStates, it would not be the White House. Anybody who was running a \nprivate-sector entity that took trust fund assets, retirement fund \nassets of its employees, would be guilty of a Federal crime. They would \nbe on their way to a Federal institution. It would not be Congress; it \nwould not be the White House; they would be on their way to a Federal \npenitentiary.\n  What is happening here is a shell game, and it is a shell game with \nenormous consequences, not like a shell game where somebody bets on \nsome corner deal and loses $10 or $20. This is a shell game being \nplayed by society. I believe it is time to put a stop to this practice \nof borrowing against future commitments.\n  That is why I am proud to join Senator Voinovich to introduce a newly \ndesigned bipartisan lockbox bill to stop the raid on Social Security \nand other trust funds. This legislation says enough is enough. The raid \non Social Security and other trust funds has to stop. It is time to \nstart saving Social Security surpluses for Social Security and to stop \nraiding the Social Security piggy bank to pay for other priorities.\n  With this bipartisan legislation, Senator Voinovich and I intend to \nfinally put Social Security in a lockbox that works. Our bill takes a \nnew tack on the lockbox concept by fundamentally changing the way in \nwhich Social Security and other trust fund surpluses are invested. The \nlegislation would create a new Office of Trust Fund Administration at \nthe Treasury Department that would be charged with investing Social \nSecurity and other trust fund surpluses in safe, non-Federal debt \ninstruments, including State municipal bonds, corporate bonds, \nmortgage-backed securities, and bond index funds. These interest-\nbearing investments could only be used to meet the obligations of \nSocial Security and other Federal trust funds.\n  Under our proposal, trust fund surpluses would no longer be used to \nfund the general operations of Government, and the true size of the \nFederal deficit would be revealed, forcing us to tackle\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\nthese deficits head on. This bill, if passed, would force Congress, the \nPresident, and the public to recognize the true cost of Federal \nborrowing, and it would force the Federal Government to invest in real \nassets that could be used to finance future financial obligations.\n  I believe our Nation is in a precarious financial position. \nUnfortunately, our current budget policies have worsened our outlook by \ndriving the Nation further into deficits and debt. We need to begin by \nreturning to budget discipline and paying down debt.\n  It is time for us to take a new direction. I believe this legislation \nis an important first step.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Voinovich, for his work on this matter. \nHe has spent months pursuing the issue. I am honored to join him. I \nbelieve this is an important policy change for the country and for the \nCongress. I hope that my colleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE:\n  S. 1733. A bill to establish pilot projects under the medicare \nprogram to provide incentives for home health agencies to utilize home \nmonitoring and communications technologies; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as I traveled across my State of South \nDakota this August, I heard from many constituents about the high cost \nof health care. Concerns about the cost of health care are not limited, \nhowever, to the people of South Dakota. These concerns span across \nstate lines and across the minds of people of all ages.\n  There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the issues of access and \ncost of health care.\n  My State of South Dakota is rural. In South Dakota, 46 out of our 66 \ncounties are classified as medically underserved areas--areas that have \ninsufficient health resources, manpower or facilities to meet the \nmedical needs of the population. This poses a significant challenge in \nproviding health care to the 750,000 residents of South Dakota.\n  Providing high quality affordable health care will take the \ncooperation of both the public and the private sector. The use of \ntechnology in the delivery of health care has been a proven method in \nproviding quality care while reducing cost.\n  Telehealth uses telecommunications and information technologies to \nprovide health care services at a distance. It provides individuals in \nremote underserved areas access to specialists and other health care \nproviders through the use of technology. This means that when my \nconstituent in Gregory, SD, needs his skin examined by a dermatologist, \nhe does not need to travel the 185 miles to Sioux Falls.\n  The practice of telemedicine, however, has been underutilized and \nunderfunded despite numerous studies praising the ability of telehealth \nto deliver care to individuals in remote areas.\n  The adoption of telehealth has been hampered by legal, financial, and \nregulatory barriers.\n  My legislation, the Fostering Independence Through Technology Act of \n2005, takes a step in the right direction of breaking down the barriers \nthat prevent the adoption of telehealth. It provides incentives for \nhome health agencies to purchase and utilize home monitoring and \ncommunications technologies. My legislation is pro technology, pro \nquality, and pro savings.\n  Specifically, my bill requires the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to create demonstration projects that would \nencourage home health agencies to utilize remote monitoring technology. \nUtilizing technology in the home health setting would reduce the number \nof visits by home health aides while still providing quality care.\n  Each demonstration project is required to include a performance \ntarget for the home health agency. This target will be used to \ndetermine whether the projects are enhancing health outcomes for \nMedicare beneficiaries as well as saving the program money.\n  Each year, the home health agency participating in the pilot will \nreceive an incentive payment based on a percentage of the Medicare \nsavings realized as a result of the pilot project.\n  The demonstration projects would be conducted in both rural and urban \nsettings because medically underserved areas exist across the country. \nOne project, however, is required to be conducted in a state with a \npopulation of less than one million.\n  Technology is improving each and every day. I ask then, why one of \nthe biggest industries in our Nation--health care--is not utilizing \nthis technology to reduce costs and improve the quality of care \ndelivered. Breaking down the barriers that prevent wider adoption of \ntelehealth will improve our system of care and lower the cost of health \ncare for individuals across the country.\n  The practice of telehealth brings medicine to people, people who live \nin medically underserved areas and people who are too frail or too ill \nto leave the comfort of their homes.\n  My legislation answers the call for wider adoption of telehealth and \nprovides Medicare beneficiaries independence without sacrificing \nquality of care.\n  It is time for Congress to tackle the legal, financial, and \nregulatory barriers that are preventing the implementation of \ntechnology into the health care field. The legislation that I am \nintroducing today takes a giant step in this direction and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1734. A bill to establish the Valle Vidal National Preserve in the \nState of New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \npreserve a special place in my home state of New Mexico, the Valle \nVidal.\n  New Mexico is a State filled with natural wonders, so when you hear \npeople referring to the Valle Vidal as ``New Mexico's Yellowstone'' you \nhave to stop and take notice. Any visitor to the place won't find it \nhard to see what inspires such a grand comparison. The scenic and \nwildlife features of the Valle Vidal stand out, even in the spectacular \ncountry of northern New Mexico.\n  For decades the area was admired from afar by the public as a famous \nprivate hunting and fishing ranch, until it was finally taken into \npublic ownership in 1982. Since then, the Valle Vidal has become a \npremier destination for all manner of lovers of the outdoors. Whether \nyou are drawn to its beautiful aspen stands, its wide meadows and the \nspectacular views they afford, its abundant wildlife, or the \noutstanding camping opportunities that the Boy Scouts take advantage of \nevery year, there is much to cherish in the Valle Vidal.\n  As the home and crucial wintering ground of the State's largest elk \nherd the area is of iconic value to New Mexican hunters. The elk herd \nis so prized that the State only allows for a once-in-a-lifetime permit \nto hunt there. I am told those that do get a permit rarely return \nunhappy.\n  The Valle Vidal is also home to native Rio Grande cutthroat trout and \nwill play an important role in the State's plans to recover that \nspecies from its depressed numbers today.\n  The Forest Service has recognized the unique values of the Valle \nVidal and manages the area with a special emphasis on wildlife but they \nare required under current law to consider developing the eastern half \nfor coalbed methane production. They have completed their estimates of \nthe available gas resources under the Valle Vidal and any further \nanalysis would be the responsibility of the lessee. Based on the \nestimates the Forest Service has done it is clear that, although there \nis certainly money to be made drilling for gas in the Valle Vidal, the \namounts that could be produced are of no national significance. The \nForest Service has begun the process of amending their management plan \nfor the area and would later begin analyzing the potential conflicts \nthat drilling would encompass sometime late next year. This bill would \nremove the need for the second part of that process.\n  New Mexico has significant coalbed methane resources in both the \nRaton Basin, where the eastern half of the Valle Vidal is, and the San \nJuan Basin. In fact, the San Juan basin is one of the Nation's foremost \nnatural gas production areas, generating about 1 trillion cubic feet of \ngas each year. New Mexico is one of this country's foremost producers \nof oil and natural gas and we are proud of what we do for our Nation's \nenergy picture. But New Mexicans are also proud of our wild country. \nThe places we love define our character as much as the work we do.\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\n  The undefinable characteristic of being a New Mexican is shown the \nmost clearly in the places we cherish--the places that we recognize as \nso special that we want to set them aside for our children and our \ngrandchildren. This is particularly true when it is not an easy choice \nto set them aside. It would be easy to simply pursue resources wherever \nwe find them. We certainly need the energy and have shown remarkable \ningenuity in extracting oil and gas from places previously thought \nunreachable and with gradually lessening effects on the surrounding \nlandscape. But our essential character is revealed in making the harder \nchoice to slow down and recognize that some places are special and \nwarrant special treatment. The Valle Vidal is such a special place.\n  Even if there were significant gas resources under the Valle Vidal it \nwould be very difficult to risk turning it into an industrial zone. But \nwe don't really face that choice here. The eastern half of the Valle \nVidal comprises less than 1 percent of the gas-producing Raton Basin. \nAccording to the Forest Service, even with the most optimistic \nprojections the gas resources are less than one-half of 1 percent of \nthe Raton Basin resources. Using those same projections and even with \nintensive development we could only expect enough gas to come out of \nthe Valle Vidal over its 20 year development to meet our Nation's gas \nneeds for less than 3 days. In short, drilling the Valle Vidal wouldn't \nmake a dime's worth of difference in our national energy picture.\n  The Raton Basin will continue to be developed and I'm sure we will \ncontinue to find additional areas in New Mexico to meet this nation's \ngrowing energy needs but I hope we can set aside this place to meet \nsome of our other needs. Our need to get outside and experience the \nbest the natural world has to offer. By creating the Valle Vidal \nNational Preserve with this bill we can take the opportunity to \npreserve an essential piece of New Mexican character and demonstrate \nonce again that value is more than a question of dollars and cents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 1735. A bill to improve the Federal Trade Commission's ability to \nprotect consumers from price-gouging during energy emergencies, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Energy \nEmergency Consumer Protection Act of 2005. I want to thank the original \ncosponsors of this legislation, which include Senate Minority Leader \nReid, and Senators Durbin, Feinstein, Kerry, Feingold, Clinton, Kohl, \nSchumer, Stabenow, Dorgan, and Corzine.\n  This legislation would put in place a Federal law to prohibit \ngasoline price-gouging during national emergencies, and would institute \nnew protections for American consumers from manipulation of oil and \ngasoline markets.\n  Even before the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and its \ntragic aftermath, skyrocketing oil and gasoline prices were burdening \nAmerican families and our Nation's economy--with the notable exception \nof the oil industry, which continued to rack up record profits. Already \nin my home State of Washington, prices had reached 74 cents a gallon \nmore than last year before the storm hit. After the storm--though our \nsupplies were not directly affected--prices topped $3 per gallon in \nsome areas of my State, including some of the most rural and \neconomically challenged. And following that tragic storm, gas prices in \nsome areas of this Nation reached almost $6 per gallon.\n  The volatility in oil and gasoline prices shows few signs of abating. \nJust yesterday, we saw oil set the new record for a one-day spike in \nprices. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, those prices rose more \nthan $4 per barrel just yesterday, to close at $67.39. That's the \nlargest single-day price spike since oil started trading on the \nexchange, in 1983.\n  It's clear to me that we have a lot of work to do, if we're going to \nget serious about addressing one of the most important challenges \nfacing our generation of Americans: improving our Nation's energy \nsecurity. We need a long-term plan and national commitment to free us \nfrom our over-dependence on oil in general. We need to make the \nAmerican economy more fuel efficient, and position this Nation to \ncompete in the 21st Century economy. It is in our Nation's long-term \neconomic and national security interests to improve the fuel efficiency \nof American vehicles, provide consumers with the tools to make smart \nchoices, provide those same consumers with a broader array of fuel-\nflexible vehicles and transportation options, and expand our production \nof home-grown biofuels, in more diverse regions of this country. \nEspecially when it comes to fuel efficiency, this body has to date \nlacked the political will necessary to take the steps we must to \nbolster this Nation's energy and economic security. Along with my \ncolleagues who have been tireless champions on this issue for so long, \nSenators Feinstein and Durbin, I will continue to fight to put our \nNation on the right path when it comes to fuel efficiency.\n  But in the short-term, we also need to take a close look at the lack \nof transparency and increased concentration in the oil and gasoline \nmarkets, which has left us in a situation where the very few can set \nthe prices that impact the lives of so many. And we need to make sure \nwe have a national plan--triggered in cases of national emergencies--\nthat makes it clear profiteering at the gas pump will not be tolerated.\n  Right now, the oil companies know we don't have a plan to protect \nAmerican consumers. That's why we need a Federal law that's going to \nprohibit price gouging, and assess Federal penalties from those who \nexploit national tragedies to maximize their profits. That is why my \ncolleagues and I have come together today to introduce this \nlegislation.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, we have already heard gas station \nowners complaining that the big oil companies ordered them to raise \nprices. Investigating those claims should be the top job of federal \nregulators--and there should be harsh penalties for that kind of \nbehavior, profiteering in the midst of a national disaster.\n  Today, 28 States have anti-gouging laws on the books. Unfortunately, \nmy own State is not among them. But in crafting this legislation, I \nhave looked to those other state laws--focusing specifically on the law \nof the State of New York, where price gouging cases have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted in the past, related to natural disasters.\n  But I also want to remind my colleagues again that, while Hurricane \nKatrina exposed the underlying vulnerability of the American economy to \nsupply disruptions, average U.S. gasoline prices were already 75 cents \nmore than they were a year earlier--and many consumers had begun to ask \nwhy. While the oil companies have filled their coffers with record \nprofits over the past few years, our Nation's airlines, truckers, \nfarmers and small businesses across the board are struggling to make \nends meet because of skyrocketing fuel costs. Worker pensions are in \njeopardy, and families are already feeling the squeeze.\n  That's why this legislation also contains provisions to ban \nmanipulation in oil and gasoline markets, and institutes new market \ntransparency, investigation and enforcement mechanisms. These measures \nare based on provisions in the recently enacted bipartisan energy bill \nthat prohibited these practices in other sectors of the energy \nindustry. It provides for the same kind of anti-manipulation and \ntransparency rules as those with which electricity and natural gas \nindustries must comply. This legislation would apply the same sort of \nanti-manipulation and transparency standards to the oil industry that \nwe already apply to companies that sell other essential energy \ncommodities.\n  Already, these prices are impacting a diverse swath of the U.S. \neconomy and hurting hard-working Americans. According to the Department \nof Energy, Americans will spend over $200 billion more on energy this \nyear than they did\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\nlast year, totaling over one trillion dollars.\n  These energy prices are also costing us jobs. On average, every time \noil prices go up 10 percent, 150,000 Americans lose their jobs--based \non the calculations of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Federal \nReserve Board.\n  What's more, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, a 40 percent increase in gas prices this month will decrease \ntotal domestic consumption by 0.4 percent. And unless prices come down \nin the fourth quarter, our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will fall by \n0.9 percent. These energy price spikes are strangling economic growth. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, every time oil prices \ngo up by 10 percent for a sustained period of time, we lose somewhere \nbetween $80 billion and $160 billion in economic growth.\n  But while these prices are hurting the economy as a whole, they are \nhaving a particularly profound impact on our Nation's energy-intensive \nindustries. For example, they are hampering the American airline \nindustry. The airline industry estimates it will pay $9.2 billion more \nfor fuel in 2005 than in 2004, a 103 percent increase from 2001. As \nSouthwest CEO Steve Kelly told the Seattle Times just last week, ``We \nare now facing energy prices that no airline can make money at, at \nleast with today's [ticket prices].''\n  These prices are also making it impossible for our farmers to break \neven. Even during a good year, farmers operate on profit margins of \nonly about 5 percent, so fertilizer, fuel, and pesticide price \nincreases of 20 percent or more have made it very difficult to get by.\n  Other sectors of the transportation industry are also being \ndramatically impacted. Take, for example, the trucking industry. Diesel \nfuel accounts for a quarter of the trucking industry's operating \nexpense, or $85 billion in 2005. Each penny increase in diesel costs \nthe trucking industry $350 million over a full year.\n  And these prices are impacting essential services in this country. \nSchool districts and local governments are feeling the pain, as are \nfederal agencies themselves. Higher fuel prices are expected to add \n$300 million to the Postal Service's transportation costs nationwide \nthis year.\n  What about the pain these prices are causing, in other ways? Energy \ncosts are putting pensions at risk and requiring taxpayer bailouts. \nThat's particularly true when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of \nairline workers in this country. United Airlines has already \ntransferred $6.6 billion of its pension obligations to the government \npension agency. If Delta and Northwest terminate their pension plans \nfollowing their bankruptcy declarations, taxpayers would have to cover \nanother $12 billion.\n  And these prices are especially harmful to low-income Americans. \nHouseholds with incomes under $15,000--about one-fifth of all \nhouseholds in this country--this year will spend around 10 percent of \ntheir total income on gasoline alone.\n  And what's going to happen this winter? Heating costs for the average \nfamily using heating oil are projected to hit $1,666 during the \nupcoming winter months. This represents an increase of over $400 over \nlast winter's prices and $700 more than the winter heating season of \n2003 and 2004. For families using natural gas, prices are projected to \nhit $1,568, representing an increase of over $600 over last year's \nprices and $640 more than 2003 and 2004.\n  These alarming statistics lead me to question where is all this money \ngoing? The Congressional Budget Office wrote recently that increased \ngasoline prices are ``basically a temporary redistribution of income \nfrom consumers of gasoline to the stockholders of refiners.''\n  This is a situation that is causing gross inequities between \ndifferent industries themselves. Oil industry profits have nearly \ntripled over the last three years to roughly $87 billion last year--\nlikely to be even more this year--while the airline industry has lost \nover $32 billion over the last four years.\n  How is this happening? While we watch all of these economic impacts \ntranspire, our federal regulators have allowed the oil industry to \nstrengthen its choke-hold on American consumers and businesses. \nAccording to the independent Government Accountability Office, mergers \nand increased market concentration with the U.S. petroleum industry has \nled to higher wholesale gasoline prices in this country.\n  That's why it's time for this body to do something about it. The \nEnergy Emergency Consumer Protection Act is a common-sense approach to \nprotect American consumers from gasoline price gouging during national \nemergencies. And it begins to shine the spotlight on the marketing \npractices of the oil industry in general.\n  I thank my cosponsors for their support, and I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Cantwell in co-\nsponsoring the Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Act of 2005. This \nbill will, for the first time, give our Federal Government the needed \ntools to prosecute those unscrupulous individuals and companies that \nseek to take advantage of emergencies and disasters by price gouging \nconsumers in the sale of gasoline and other petroleum products. With \nthe tremendous suffering caused by Hurricane Katrina resulting in gas \nsupply disruptions, and with gas prices at record levels well in excess \nof $3.00 per gallon in many places throughout the Nation, the time is \nnow for passage of this essential legislation.\n  In the wake of the Hurricane Katrina disaster and the associated \ndisruptions to supply and distribution networks, the national average \nprice of gas is now at record levels. Allegations of price gouging and \ndrastic price spikes were unfortunately commonplace in the immediate \ndays following the disaster--including, for example, gas being sold at \n$6.00 per gallon in the Atlanta area. Many believe that the human \nsuffering caused by loss of life, housing, and employment, has been \ncompounded by some unscrupulous individuals and businesses who have \ntaken advantage of the emergency by gouging consumers. Yet, under \ncurrent law, the Federal Government has virtually no ability to \nprosecute such price gouging. Our bill will correct this critical \ndeficiency.\n  This legislation contains several important provisions. First, it \ngives the President the authority to declare an energy emergency during \ntimes of disruptions in the supply or distribution of gasoline or \npetroleum products. Second, the bill, for the first time, declares \nillegal under federal law selling gasoline or petroleum products at a \nprice unconscionably high or when circumstances indicate that the \nseller is taking unfair advantage to increase prices unreasonably in \ntimes of energy emergency. Those who violate this law face civil \npenalties of up to $3,000,000 per day and criminal penalties, including \njail terms of up to five years for individuals, as well. The bill also \nforbids market manipulation in connection with the sale of gasoline and \npetroleum products and empowers the experts at the Federal Trade \nCommission to write regulations setting forth specific conduct \nconstituting market manipulation. Additionally, our bill gives states \nAttorneys General the power to enforce these provisions as well.\n  These measures are an urgently needed deterrent to prevent all those \nwho would seek to profit from this enormous tragedy by price gouging \nconsumers in the price of gasoline. It will protect consumers--both \nthose who were the victims of the immediate effects of Hurricane \nKatrina and those around the country--who suffer every day at the gas \npumps from the real and growing economic pain caused by record high gas \nprices. As Ranking Member on the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, I \nbelieve that this legislation is necessary to prevent unscrupulous \ncompanies using the disaster on the Gulf Coast to justify uncompetitive \ngas price hikes. All of us can agree that profiteering and price \ngouging in the price of an essential commodity like gasoline is simply \nunacceptable. Such conduct violates every principle of free and fair \ncompetition. We must give the Federal Government the necessary tools to \nprevent such misconduct, and prosecute those who do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Energy Emergency Consumer \nProtection Act.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10240-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10240-S10241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 53--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   ANY EFFORT TO IMPOSE PHOTO IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR VOTING \n                           SHOULD BE REJECTED\n\n  Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Reid, Mr. Corzine, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Kerry, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \nDayton, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Salazar) submitted \nthe following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 53\n\n       Whereas the most fundamental right accorded to United \n     States citizens by the Constitution is the right to vote, and \n     the unimpeded exercise of this right is essential to the \n     functioning of our democracy;\n       Whereas historically, certain citizens, especially racial \n     minorities, have been prevented from voting because of \n     significant barriers such as literacy tests, poll taxes, and \n     property requirements;\n       Whereas the long and difficult struggle to remove these and \n     other barriers to voting resulted in the loss of life but \n     also led to the passage of the 15th, 19th, and 24th \n     Amendments to the Constitution;\n       Whereas in the face of persistently low voter turnout \n     relative to other industrialized democracies, exaggerated \n     fears of voter impersonation have led to calls for more \n     stringent voter identification requirements, including the \n     requirement of government-issued photo identification cards \n     as the only approved form of voter identification;\n       Whereas there has been no substantiated evidence of any \n     significant incidence of fraud due to voter impersonation, \n     and the more serious attack on ballot integrity has been the \n     discounting of millions of ballots, including an estimated \n     6,000,000 ballots lost in the 2000 Presidential election;\n       Whereas there is no evidence that photo identification \n     requirements address the few isolated instances of such \n     fraud;\n       Whereas 12 percent of voting-age Americans do not have a \n     driver's license, most of whom are minorities, new United \n     States citizens, the indigent, the elderly, or the disabled;\n       Whereas government-issued identification cards can cost as \n     much as $85 and are often unnecessary for the daily needs of, \n     or inaccessible to, many urban, rural, elderly, and indigent \n     voters who do not own cars;\n       Whereas the National Commission on Federal Election Reform \n     reported in 2001 that a photo identification requirement \n     would ``impose an additional expense on the exercise of the \n     franchise, a burden that would fall disproportionately on \n     people who are poorer and urban'';\n       Whereas an alarming number of States, including most \n     recently the State of Georgia, have passed proposals \n     requiring voters to produce government-issued photo \n     identification at the polls;\n       Whereas the State of Georgia no longer allows affidavits \n     affirming one's identity to meet the identification \n     requirement for voting, a change that will likely \n     disproportionately affect minorities, new United States \n     citizens, the indigent, the elderly, and the disabled;\n       Whereas 150,000 senior citizens in the State of Georgia do \n     not have a form of government-issued photo identification;\n       Whereas residents in the State of Georgia can obtain the \n     newly required voter identification card in only 56 places in \n     all 159 counties in Georgia with no such places currently \n     located in Atlanta, Georgia;\n       Whereas the State of Georgia permits the use of various \n     forms of proof of identity to obtain government-issued \n     identification that it does not accept in a similar manner \n     when its citizens attempt to exercise their constitutionally \n     protected right to vote;\n       Whereas the State of Georgia will charge United States \n     citizens at least $20 for voters to purchase 1 of the \n     government-issued photo identification cards required under \n     the new State law unless such citizens wish to endure the \n     potential humiliation of swearing to their indigency;\n       Whereas poll taxes are prohibited in Federal elections by \n     the 24th Amendment to the Constitution and in State elections \n     by a 1966 Supreme Court case;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State of Georgia has stated that \n     photo identification would not have resolved any instances of \n     voter fraud;\n       Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires that Georgia \n     and other States with histories of discrimination in \n     elections prove that election laws and practices do not \n     hinder minorities' ability to exercise the franchise, \n     including access to the polls, and that such States have such \n     laws and practices approved by the Department of Justice \n     before implementation;\n       Whereas the Department of Justice's approval of the Georgia \n     statute in August of 2005 was a troubling example of a recent \n     trend towards weakening voter protections and countenancing \n     voter suppression;\n       Whereas Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath have destroyed \n     or rendered unusable the official records of many State and \n     local government agencies in Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n     Alabama, as well as the documents of thousands of residents \n     in those states, which will significantly complicate the \n     ability of those residents to obtain photo identification \n     cards;\n       Whereas the residents of the Gulf Coast region, in \n     particular, those residents displaced by Hurricane Katrina, \n     have already suffered immeasurably in recent weeks and should \n     not be further burdened by losing their right to vote because \n     they cannot obtain photo identification cards;\n       Whereas the Carter/Baker Election Reform Commission \n     recommended that States implement mandatory State-issued \n     photo identification requirements for voting at the polls, \n     despite the lack of evidence that such identification will \n     address documented instances of voter fraud; and\n       Whereas an electoral system with integrity is one that \n     allows all eligible voters the opportunity to cast their \n     votes, and thus election reform must further democratic \n     empowerment, not disenfranchisement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a requirement that United States citizens obtain photo \n     identification cards before being able to vote has not been \n     shown to ensure ballot integrity and places an undue burden \n     on the legitimate voting rights of such citizens;\n       (2) the Department of Justice should--\n       (A) vigorously enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965; and\n       (B) challenge any State law that limits a citizen's ability \n     to vote based on discriminatory photo identification \n     requirements; and\n       (3) any effort to impose national photo identification \n     requirements for voting should be rejected.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \nexpress the Senate's strong disapproval of recent efforts to \ndisenfranchise Americans.\n  In the weeks since Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, our \ncountry has been awakened to the plight of the most vulnerable \nAmericans--the poor, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. And if we \nhave learned anything from this tragedy, it is that the Government has \ntoo often ignored the needs of these citizens in crafting national \npolicy. Whether it is homeland security or education or health care, \nthese Americans have consistently been left behind.\n  Now, we are in danger of proceeding down another path that disregards \nthe needs of our Nation's neediest--the right to vote. This is the most \nfundamental right protected by the Constitution and the right for which \nmany Americans have fought and died.\n  The last two Presidential elections were tainted by allegations of \nfraud and abuse. The complaints ranged from long polling lines to \nfaulty machines to confusing ballots. The rampant complaints have \nshaken people's confidence in our election system. And so it is all of \nour duty to work to restore and protect the integrity of the electoral \nprocess.\n  Unfortunately, in this new millennium, too many electoral reform \nefforts seem intent on limiting access to the ballot as opposed to \nexpanding it. In the mid-20th century, the poll tax was the preferred \nmeans of disenfranchising large minority populations, specifically \nAfrican Americans. Today, the poll tax is taking on a new form--a photo \nidentification requirement for voters.\n  According to the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, such \na requirement would ``impose an additional expense on the exercise of \nthe franchise, a burden that would fall disproportionately on people \nwho are poorer and urban.'' Nevertheless, a number of States, including \nGeorgia, have recently passed laws mandating government-issued photo \nidentification for voters at the polls.\n  In Georgia alone, at least 150,000 senior citizens do not have \ngovernment-issued photo identification, which can cost up to $85. \nNationwide, at least 12 percent of eligible drivers do not have a \ndriver's license. And Georgia has made it difficult for rural and urban \nfolks to obtain their voter photo identification. There are currently \nonly 56 places in all 159 counties where such identification is \navailable, with no places available in Atlanta. For people who already \nlack transportation, which may be why they do not have driver's \nlicenses, it is far-fetched to think that these same people could \neasily get to another county to obtain a voter identification card.\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\n  Earlier today, the Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform \nreleased its recommendations for improving the electoral process. While \nmany of the Commission's recommendations are worthy of consideration, \nits report recommends the implementation of a national voter \nidentification requirement, despite acknowledging that there is ``no \nevidence of extensive fraud in U.S. elections or of multiple voting.''\n  This past weekend, Afghanistan held its second successful national \nelection, and we have seen successes in Iraq's elections as well. If \nthese nascent democracies can commit themselves to bringing any and all \ncitizens to the polls, surely we can do the same.\n  Many of us both here in Washington and around the country have been \nasking questions over the past three weeks about our Nation's \npriorities and our commitment to helping our country's most vulnerable \ncitizens. But a major priority should be ensuring that these citizens \ncan exercise the most fundamental right in a democracy--the right to \nvote.\n  The resolution I am submitting today, along with Senator Dodd and \njoined by Senators Reid, Corzine, Clinton, Harkin, Feingold, Akaka, \nDorgan, Kennedy, Kerry, Mikulski, Lautenberg and others, expresses the \nSenate's strong disapproval of photo identification requirements for \nvoting. The resolution also urges the Department of Justice to \nchallenge any State law that limits a citizen's ability to vote based \non discriminatory photo identification requirements and urges the \nrejection of any national photo identification requirements for voting.\n  I am honored that Representative John Lewis, a civil rights icon who \nput his life on the line to fight for the right to vote, will be \nintroducing the same resolution in the House later this week.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/20/senate-section/article/S10241-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1736.
