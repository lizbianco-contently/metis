Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 590, S. 3850.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3850) to improve ratings quality for the \n     protection of investors and in the public interest by \n     fostering accountability, transparency, and competition in \n     the credit rating agency industry.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I support this important legislation to \nenhance competition and improve the Federal oversight of credit rating \nagencies--S. 3850, as amended, the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of \n2006.\n  I applaud Chairman Shelby for his strong leadership on this issue and \nam pleased to have worked closely with him on this legislation. The \nbill also reflects important contributions from Senators Menendez, \nSchumer, Enzi, and Sununu.\n  Credit rating agencies play an important and valuable role in the \ncapital markets by providing opinions to investors on the ability and \nwillingness of issuers to make timely payments on debt instruments. \nThese ratings can have significant impact. The Washington Post of \nNovember 22, 2004 wrote: ``they can, with the stroke of a pen, \neffectively add or subtract millions from a company's bottom line, \nrattle a city budget, shock the stock and bond markets and reroute \ninternational investment.''\n  Investors trust the agencies' impartiality and rely on their ratings. \nThe SEC created the designation of Nationally Recognized Statistical \nRating Organization, NRSRO, which it currently applies to five \nagencies. Many institutional investors buy debt only if it has been \nrated by an NRSRO. A Reuters article dated February 1, 2006 stated:\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\n``The SEC designation gives these firms a major advantage in competing \nfor business against other firms.''\n  Rating agencies earn their revenues pursuant to one of two business \nmodels: either by receiving a fee from an issuer to give a rating to \nthat issuer or by charging investors to subscribe for access to the \nratings of issuers who do not pay the rating agency. Some NRSROs or \ntheir affiliates offer other products and services to the companies, \nStates or other issuers they rate.\n  In recent years, concerns have been raised about some aspects of the \nindustry. In late 2001, the largest credit rating agencies maintained \nan investment grade rating on Enron debt after its major financial \nrestatements and until 4 days before Enron's bankruptcy. As a result, \nas Business Week reported on November 29, 2004, there was a ``barrage \nof criticism . . . that raters should have uncovered the problems \nsooner at Enron, WorldCom and other corporate disasters.''\n  In 2002, concerns about credit rating agencies were raised by \nSenators Bunning and Enzi and by Consumer Federation of America during \nthe Senate Banking Committee hearings which led ultimately to the \nenactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Their concerns prompted the \ncreation of Section 702 of that Act, which directed the SEC to conduct \na study of credit rating agencies. The SEC issued a report and, \nsubsequently, published a Concept Release and proposed a regulation to \ndefine the term ``NRSRO.''\n  Many observers feel that more competition would benefit the markets. \nTwo NRSROs, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, control 8 percent of market \nshare and a third, Fitch Ratings, controls an additional 15 percent. \nSome have also called for a more transparent and shorter application \nprocess for recognition to obtain the NRSRO designation. Others have \nraised concerns about conflicts of interest, including those involving \nissuers paying for their ratings, NRSROs having a director who holds an \nexecutive position in an issuer, and NRSROs that sell other products or \nservices to issuers they rate. Some have raised questions about alleged \nabusive practices involving ``tying arrangements, solicitation of \npayment for unsolicited ratings, and threats to modify ratings based on \npayment for related services.'' That is a letter from former SEC \nChairman William Donaldson to Congressman Paul E. Kanjorski dated June \n6, 2005.\n\n  Under Chairman Shelby's leadership, the Banking Committee has held \nhearings on credit rating agencies and received testimony from \nwitnesses representing the Securities and Exchange Commission, rating \nagencies, the bond markets, the mutual fund industry, labor, academics, \nand financial professionals. Witnesses testified about a number of \nissues including the NRSRO application process, conflicts of interest, \nbusiness practices, the appropriate level of Federal regulation and \ncommission authority.\n  The legislation before the Senate addresses these issues. Under it, a \ncredit rating agency can obtain the NRSRO designation unless the SEC \ndetermines that it lacks adequate financial and managerial resources to \nconsistently produce credit ratings with integrity and to comply with \nits stated methodologies and procedures. It creates a transparent \napplication process for becoming a NRSRO which requires a decision \nwithin a time certain. The application must describe procedures and \nmethodologies used to determine ratings, conflicts of interest, the \ntypes of ratings intended to be issued, organization structure, and \nother matters, and must include a code of ethics, certifications from \nqualified institutional buyers that have used the ratings for at least \n3 years and other items. Most parts of the application must be \ncertified annually and updated when there is a material change.\n  The legislation also requires the commission to adopt rules that \nprohibit unfair, coercive and abusive business practices; prohibit or \nrequire the management and disclosure of any conflicts of interest; and \nrequire NRSROs to establish policies and procedures designed to prevent \nthe misuse of nonpublic information.\n  The bill does not favor a particular credit rating agency business \nmodel.\n  Prior to its mark-up, the bill received strong support from a number \nof market participants and interested parties. Let me quote from some \nof their letters: The Bond Market Association said the bill creates ``a \nclear process using a credible standard for the designation of \nNRSRO's.''\n  The Investment Company Institution said it ``brings much needed \nsunlight to credit ratings by requiring disclosure of an NRSRO's rating \ncriteria, its methodologies and policies, how an NRSRO addresses \nconflicts of interest (as well as the conflicts themselves), and the \norganizational structure of an NRSRO.''\n  The AFL-CIO said it will ``protect the investing public against \nconflicts of interest within the credit rating agencies . . . [and] \nencourages in a responsible manner greater competition.''\n  The Association for Financial Professionals said the bill will \n``foster competition, impose accountability and provide the necessary \nSEC oversight to restore confidence in credit rating agencies and the \nratings they issue.''\n  Consumer Federation of America wrote that it will ``help ensure that \nonly high quality ratings will be used for economically important \nregulatory purposes'' and praised the bill's requirements for \n``certifications by Qualified Institutional Buyers . . . and [for] \ngiving the . . . SEC . . . authority to deny NRSRO status to rating \nagencies that lack the financial and managerial resources to produce \nratings of integrity.''\n  Financial Executives International said the bill ``will greatly \nenhance the accountability of rating agencies.''\n  Fitch said it ``represents a significant step forward to prudently \nenhance competition in the rating agency industry.''\n  Fidelity Investments said the bill ``will improve ratings quality by \nfostering transparency and accountability.''\n  The Banking Committee passed this legislation without objection on a \nvoice vote on August 2.\n  The managers' amendment to this legislation exempts the five existing \nNRSROs from the requirement that they include certifications in the \napplications they must file to become NRSROs under the new regulatory \nframework. This amendment also clarifies the role of Federal regulation \nin the registration, licensing and qualification of NRSROs, and that \nthe legislation would not regulate the substance of credit ratings or \nthe procedures and methodologies that NRSROs use to determine them, \nsubject to the Federal oversight required in various parts of the \nlegislation.\n  Once again, I commend Chairman Shelby on his leadership on this \nlegislation. In doing so, I also want to acknowledge the outstanding \nwork of Justin Daly on the Chairman's staff and Dean Shahinian on my \nstaff.\n  I support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do so as \nwell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5035) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 8, line 23, insert before the semicolon ``, except \n     as provided in subparagraph (D)''.\n       On page 10, line 3, strike ``(D)'' and insert ``(E)''.\n       On page 10, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(D) Exemption from certification requirement.--A written \n     certification under subparagraph (B)(ix) is not required with \n     respect to any credit rating agency which has received, or \n     been the subject of, a no-action letter from the staff of the \n     Commission prior to August 2, 2006, stating that such staff \n     would not recommend enforcement action against any broker or \n     dealer that considers credit ratings issued by such credit \n     rating agency to be ratings from a nationally recognized \n     statistical rating organization.''.\n       On page 14, line 15, strike ``the authority'' and insert \n     ``exclusive authority''.\n       On page 15, line 11, strike ``organizations,'' and all that \n     follows through line 15 and insert the following: \n     ``organizations.

Tomorrow, Saturday September 23--the first day of the \nmonth of Tishri on the Hebrew Calendar--Jewish people all over the \nworld will celebrate the holiday of Rosh Hashana. On the 10th of \nTishri, October 2 on the Gregorian calendar, will mark the holiday of \nYom Kippur--The Day of Atonement. These two days: one a spiritually \nimportant New Years celebration, the other an opportunity for solemn \nreflection coupled with a recognition of God's mercy, rank alongside \nthe weekly Sabbath as the most important holidays in Judaism.\n  The coming weeks bring two other important, joyous holidays: Sukkot--\na commemoration of the mercy of God that allowed the Israelites to \nsurvive while wandering in the desert and Simchat Torah, a celebration \nof the completion of the annual cycle of readings from the scriptures \nmost sacred to Jews.\n  In their observances, these holidays run the gamut. Jewish law \nrequires fasting on Yom Kippur while the celebration of Sukkot focuses \non festive meals eaten in a temporary shelter. All of them, however, \nhave a common thread: a focus on justice, on the Eternal, and upon \nimproving--healing--the world. On ethnical monotheism. All these are \nimportant traditions that Judaism transmitted to Christianity and \nIslam.\n  As we enter the Jewish holiday season, I urge all Americans to \nreflect on the need to heal the world, to work for peace, and to do \njustice.\n  And, on this, the day before Rosh Hashana. I wish all of my Jewish \nfriends and colleagues a Happy New Year. L'Shana Tova.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/22/senate-section/article/S10016-3", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 260.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Constitution of the United States grants to \n     Congress the power ``To define and punish . . .

[and] To \n     provide and maintain a Navy''.\n       (2) The military commission is the traditional tribunal for \n     the trial of persons engaged in hostilities for violations of \n     the law of war.\n       (3) Congress has, in the past, both authorized the use of \n     military commission by statute and recognized the existence \n     and authority of military commissions.\n       (4) Military commissions have been convened both by the \n     President and by military commanders in the field to try \n     offenses against the law of war.\n       (5) It is in the national interest for Congress to exercise \n     its authority under the Constitution to enact legislation \n     authorizing and regulating the use of military commissions to \n     try and punish violations of the law of war.\n\n     SEC. 103.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Terrorist Surveillance Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to \n     intercept communications between people inside the United \n     States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects \n     overseas.\n       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is \n     that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our \n     Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy \n     conventional law enforcement practices.\n       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most \n     directly responsible for protecting the United States from \n     attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an \n     enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.\n       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting \n     the United States against our enemies, the President does not \n     compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to \n     safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's \n     power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an \n     Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown \n     Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion \n     by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day \n     O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme \n     Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear \n     that a state of war is not a blank check for the President \n     when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi \n     v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).\n       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our \n     Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3 \n     branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This \n     helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not \n     infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at \n     the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers \n     and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and \n     protect our Nation from attack.\n       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her \n     plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \n     ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for \n     the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with \n     enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly \n     envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties \n     are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) \n     (citations omitted).\n       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his \n     Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to \n     an express or implied authorization of Congress, his \n     authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he \n     possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can \n     delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either a \n     congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely \n     upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of \n     twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent \n     authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. \n     Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence \n     may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not \n     invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility . \n     . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the \n     expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its \n     lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own \n     constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of \n     Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive \n     Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the \n     Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet & \n     Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J., \n     concurring).\n       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation \n     with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The \n     Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight \n     over national security and foreign policy, under article I, \n     section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which \n     confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--\n       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, \n     and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';\n       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';\n       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';\n       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of \n     the land and naval Forces'';\n       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute \n     the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel \n     Invasions''; and\n       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining \n     the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Service of the United States''.\n       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that \n     the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance \n     program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to \n     ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief \n     of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic \n     surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the \n     executive branch, by the article III court established under \n     section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence \n     committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is \n     appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the \n     constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that \n     may be directed at Americans.\n       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the \n     proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic \n     surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the \n     secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the \n     requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive \n     issues of national security.\n       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong \n     defender of executive authority, testified that in times of \n     conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range \n     electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence \n     surveillance court should be empowered to issue special \n     approval orders in these circumstances.\n       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and \n     pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-\n     established, longstanding practices.\n       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already \n     has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of \n     international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants \n     for surveillance of a particular individual under sections \n     104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).\n       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in \n     investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held \n     that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States when they relate to \n     complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises \n     like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts \n     recognize that applications for search warrants must be \n     judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the \n     courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature \n     and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal \n     organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.\n       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United \n     States v. United States District Court for the Eastern \n     District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that \n     the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may \n     not be applicable to cases involving national security. The \n     Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may \n     involve different policy and practical considerations from \n     the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should \n     be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security \n     cases. United States v. United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).\n       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress \n     enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our \n     national security, while also protecting the civil liberties \n     and constitutional rights that we cherish.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Chapter 47 of this title does not, by its terms, \n     apply to trial by military commission except as specifically \n     provided therein or in this chapter, and many of the \n     provisions of chapter 47 of this title are by their terms \n     inapplicable to military commissions.

A bill to establish procedures for the review of electronic \nsurveillance programs; read the first time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorist Surveillance Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     President Bush authorized the National Security Agency to \n     intercept communications between people inside the United \n     States, including American citizens, and terrorism suspects \n     overseas.\n       (2) One of the lessons learned from September 11, 2001, is \n     that the enemies who seek to greatly harm and terrorize our \n     Nation utilize technologies and techniques that defy \n     conventional law enforcement practices.\n       (3) The President, as the constitutional officer most \n     directly responsible for protecting the United States from \n     attack, requires the ability and means to detect and track an \n     enemy that can master and exploit modern technology.\n       (4) It is equally essential, however, that in protecting \n     the United States against our enemies, the President does not \n     compromise the very civil liberties that he seeks to \n     safeguard. As Justice Hugo Black observed, ``The President's \n     power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an \n     Act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'' Youngstown \n     Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952) (opinion \n     by Black, J.). Similarly, in 2004, Justice Sandra Day \n     O'Connor explained in her plurality opinion for the Supreme \n     Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld: ``We have long since made clear \n     that a state of war is not a blank check for the President \n     when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' Hamdi \n     v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (citations omitted).\n       (5) When deciding issues of national security, it is in our \n     Nation's best interest that, to the extent feasible, all 3 \n     branches of the Federal Government should be involved. This \n     helps guarantee that electronic surveillance programs do not \n     infringe on the constitutional rights of Americans, while at \n     the same time ensuring that the President has all the powers \n     and means necessary to detect and track our enemies and \n     protect our Nation from attack.\n       (6) As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor explained in her \n     plurality opinion for the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, \n     ``Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for \n     the Executive in its exchanges with other nations or with \n     enemy organizations in times of conflict, it most assuredly \n     envisions a role for all 3 branches when individual liberties \n     are at stake.'' Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) \n     (citations omitted).\n       (7) Similarly, Justice Jackson famously explained in his \n     Youngstown concurrence: ``When the President acts pursuant to \n     an express or implied authorization of Congress, his \n     authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he \n     possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can \n     delegate . . . When the President acts in absence of either\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n\n     a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only \n     rely upon his own independent powers, but there is a zone of \n     twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent \n     authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. \n     Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence \n     may sometimes, at least as a practical matter, enable, if not \n     invite, measures on independent presidential responsibility . \n     . . When the President takes measures incompatible with the \n     expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its \n     lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own \n     constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of \n     Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive \n     Presidential control in such a case only by disabling the \n     Congress from acting upon the subject.'' Youngstown Sheet & \n     Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 (1952) (Jackson, J., \n     concurring).\n       (8) Congress clearly has the authority to enact legislation \n     with respect to electronic surveillance programs. The \n     Constitution provides Congress with broad powers of oversight \n     over national security and foreign policy, under article I, \n     section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, which \n     confers on Congress numerous powers, including the powers--\n       (A) ``To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, \n     and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'';\n       (B) ``To raise and support Armies'';\n       (C) ``To provide and maintain a Navy'';\n       (D) ``To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of \n     the land and naval Forces'';\n       (E) ``To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute \n     the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel \n     Invasions''; and\n       (F) ``To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining \n     the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be \n     employed in the Service of the United States''.\n       (9) While Attorney General Alberto Gonzales explained that \n     the executive branch reviews the electronic surveillance \n     program of the National Security Agency every 45 days to \n     ensure that the program is not overly broad, it is the belief \n     of Congress that approval and supervision of electronic \n     surveillance programs should be conducted outside of the \n     executive branch, by the article III court established under \n     section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) and the congressional intelligence \n     committees. It is also the belief of Congress that it is \n     appropriate for an article III court to pass upon the \n     constitutionality of electronic surveillance programs that \n     may be directed at Americans.\n       (10) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is the \n     proper court to approve and supervise classified electronic \n     surveillance programs because it is adept at maintaining the \n     secrecy with which it was charged and it possesses the \n     requisite expertise and discretion for adjudicating sensitive \n     issues of national security.\n       (11) In 1975, [then] Attorney General Edward Levi, a strong \n     defender of executive authority, testified that in times of \n     conflict, the President needs the power to conduct long-range \n     electronic surveillance and that a foreign intelligence \n     surveillance court should be empowered to issue special \n     approval orders in these circumstances.\n       (12) Granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     the authority to review electronic surveillance programs and \n     pass upon their constitutionality is consistent with well-\n     established, longstanding practices.\n       (13) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court already \n     has broad authority to approve surveillance of members of \n     international conspiracies, in addition to granting warrants \n     for surveillance of a particular individual under sections \n     104, 105, and 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1804, 1805, and 1842).\n       (14) Prosecutors have significant flexibility in \n     investigating domestic conspiracy cases. Courts have held \n     that flexible warrants comply with the 4th amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States when they relate to \n     complex, far-reaching, and multifaceted criminal enterprises \n     like drug conspiracies and money laundering rings. The courts \n     recognize that applications for search warrants must be \n     judged in a common sense and realistic fashion, and the \n     courts permit broad warrant language where, due to the nature \n     and circumstances of the investigation and the criminal \n     organization, more precise descriptions are not feasible.\n       (15) The Supreme Court, in the ``Keith Case'', United \n     States v. United States District Court for the Eastern \n     District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297 (1972), recognized that \n     the standards and procedures used to fight ordinary crime may \n     not be applicable to cases involving national security. The \n     Court recognized that national ``security surveillance may \n     involve different policy and practical considerations from \n     the surveillance of ordinary crime'' and that courts should \n     be more flexible in issuing warrants in national security \n     cases. United States v. United States District Court for the \n     Eastern District of Michigan, 407 U.S. 297, 322 (1972).\n       (16) By authorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Court to review electronic surveillance programs, Congress \n     enables the President to use the necessary means to guard our \n     national security, while also protecting the civil liberties \n     and constitutional rights that we cherish.\n\n     SEC. 3.
