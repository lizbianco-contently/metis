Mr. President, this morning the President of the \nUnited States nominated Judge Samuel Alito of the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. We \nare beginning to learn that Judge Alito has an extremely impressive \ncareer. He is an alumnus of Princeton, where he was a member of Phi \nBeta Kappa. He graduated from Yale Law School where he was editor of \nthe Yale Law Journal, and he clerked for Judge Leonard Garth on the \nsame court where Judge Alito now sits.\n  Judge Alito has devoted his professional life to serving our country. \nHe served in the U.S. Army Reserves. He served as an assistant U.S. \nattorney in the appellate division and as a U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict of New Jersey. He served as an assistant to the Solicitor \nGeneral where he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court. For the last \n15 years he served as a Federal appellate judge on the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  As the President noted this morning, Judge Alito has in fact more \njudicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in the last 70 \nyears. Over the course of his outstanding career, Judge Alito has \nconsistently been praised for his legal acumen. In fact, one attorney \nwho appeared before him said that ``to describe Judge Alito as \noutstanding is to use understatement. He's the best judge on the \ncircuit, maybe the country.''\n  Judge Alito has also been praised for his calm, courteous, and \nthoughtful demeanor. I had a chance to experience that this morning \nmyself when I met with him.\n  Lawyers who have appeared before him describe him as measured and \njudicious. They have said he ``has a fine, nice demeanor . . . He \ncouldn't have a keener demeanor'' was one observation. Another said, \n``He is never discourteous or abusive.'' Another said, ``He is \nforthright and fair.'' Another said he ``reaches honest decisions.''\n  With his outstanding abilities, it is no wonder the American Bar \nAssociation gave Judge Alito its highest rating of unanimously well \nqualified, which means everybody on the committee found him well \nqualified. That is the highest ranking the ABA can give.\n  In supporting his confirmation to the Third Circuit, our former \ncolleague Senator Bill Bradley said of Judge Alito that as U.S. \nAttorney ``he had a\n\n[[Page S12060]]\n\nreputation of being tough but fair. Without a lot of fanfare, without \ncalling daily press conferences, he has inspired his office with a low \nkey sense of professionalism.''\n  Given his impressive abilities and his calm, thoughtful demeanor, it \nis also not surprising that the Senate has twice confirmed Judge Alito \nunanimously to important legal positions.\n  As the confirmation process goes forward, we will learn a lot more \nabout Judge Alito, but it appears the President has made a truly \noutstanding choice. I am confident the Senate will proceed on a \nbipartisan basis and in a thoughtful, measured way. We had a fair and \ndignified process for Chief Justice Roberts, and I am confident we will \nsimilarly have a respectful process for Judge Alito.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12060-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12060-S12061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF SAMUEL ALITO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Friday, the President formally withdrew \nfrom the Senate his nomination of Harriet Miers to be Associate Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court. Today, he announced his intention to \nnominate Judge Samuel Alito to that same position. To those who are \nkeeping count, this will be the third nomination to fill the seat \nvacated by the future retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor made by \nthe President.\n  Justice O'Connor is still there. Three people have been nominated to \nfill her seat. I am concerned that the nomination may be a needlessly \nprovocative nomination. Obviously, I will do as I have always done on \nnominees of both Republican and Democratic Presidents. I will make up \nmy mind based on the hearings. But the President had before him a \nnumber of names of people who would have gotten probably 95 or 100 \nvotes out of this Chamber, virtually every Republican and virtually \nevery Democrat. Such a nomination would have united, not divided, the \ncountry. It appears that instead of uniting the country through his \nchoice, the President chose to reward one small faction of the party \nand risked dividing the country. Instead of rewarding a small faction, \nwhich has put him under a great deal of pressure, I wish he would have \nrewarded the American people, all 280 million of us. There were many \nconservative Republican candidates who could have easily been \nconfirmed.\n  Just last week, the President succumbed to partisan pressure from the \nextreme rightwing of the Republican Party to withdraw his nomination of \nHarriet Miers. The pressure did not come from the Democrats. Actually, \nthe pressure did not come from the majority of Republicans. It came \nfrom one small, vocal wing of the Republican Party.\n  I believe the President abdicated his own role in the Constitution's \nprocess of selecting Supreme Court Justices and allowed his own choice \nto be vetoed by extremists within his party without hearings by the \nJudiciary Committee or a vote by the Senate.\n  Both the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Specter, \nand myself said, Why do we not have hearings and then make up our mind?\n  The Miers nomination became an eye-opening experience for the \ncountry, exposing for all to see what a vocal and virulent wing of the \nRepublican Party really wants. These are not the mainstream Republicans \nI know in my own State of Vermont, the party that has done so much for \nour green mountain State. This wing did not want an independent Federal \njudiciary. They want a rightwing litmus test, not the selection of \nJustices and judges who will be fair and impartial in applying the law. \nThey, in fact, demand judges who will guarantee the results they want.\n  With turmoil engulfing the White House, with no exit from the \ndisastrous and deadly occupation of Iraq, with an escalating Federal \ndebt, and with obscenely high profits that continue to pile up for the \nadministration's oil company friends, catering to an extreme wing of \none political party jeopardizes the vital checks and balances that \nprotect ordinary Americans.\n  It is a pity that the President thought his position was so weak that \nhe had to bend to a narrow but strident faction of his political base. \nThe Supreme Court is the ultimate safeguard of our system to protect \nthe fundamental rights of all Americans. I hope the White House is not \nusing this announcement today to try to distract the public from the \nscandals and failures that are mounting by the day for this \nadministration. Nor will the press be fooled into assuming this is the \nonly issue before America.\n  With the announcement of Judge Samuel Alito to fill the position to \nbe vacated by Justice O'Connor, the White House failed to follow \nthrough with its initial discussions and engage in meaningful \nconsultation. I regret the President has not chosen a clear path of a \nconsensus candidate to unite the American people and the Senate. \nActually, the Nation and the Senate would have overwhelmingly welcomed \nhis choice if he had.\n  Now, as I said, I am not forming a final judgment as to the merits of \nthis nomination, just as I did with now Chief Justice Roberts when he \nwas initially nominated to fill the Sandra Day O'Connor seat, a seat \nnot yet vacated. I said I would not make up my mind until after the \nhearing, and I will do that, but an initial review of Judge Alito's \nrecord suggests areas of significant concern for all of us. His \nopinions from the Federal bench demonstrate that he would go to great \nlengths to restrict the authority of Congress to enact protective \nlegislation to protect people in the areas of civil rights, consumer \nprotection, and the rights of workers, consumers, and women. Judge \nAlito has also set unreasonably high standards for ordinary Americans \nwho are victims of discrimination to meet before being allowed to \nproceed with their cases.\n  The Democratic leader of the Senate and I wrote to the President last \nweek. We urged him to pick one of the many qualified, mainstream women \nand minority candidates who could win widespread bipartisan support in \nthe Senate. Even more importantly, they would get the same widespread \npublic support in America.\n  We noted the unique circumstances that now attend this nomination and \nthat make it essential that Justice O'Connor be replaced by a \nmainstream nominee, not by an activist who would bring an ideological \nagenda to the Court.\n  The Court that serves America should reflect all America, but \nalthough President Bush declared in reference to filling Justice \nO'Connor's seat on the Court that he is ``mindful that diversity is one \nof the strengths of the country,'' with the nomination of Judge Alito, \nof course, he weakens that strength. Should Judge Alito ultimately be \nconfirmed, the Court will lose some of that diversity.\n  There were a lot of highly qualified women, highly qualified African \nAmericans, highly qualified Hispanics, and other individuals who could \nwell have served as unifying nominees while adding to the diversity of \nthe Supreme Court. I am one Senator who looks forward to the time when \nthe membership of the U.S. Supreme Court is more reflective of the \ncountry it serves.\n  As the grandson of Italian and Irish immigrants, I know that Italian \nAmericans, like all of my mother's family, and President Bush's guest, \nthe Italian Prime Minister, will be feeling pride today, but this \nnomination does not add to the diversity of the Supreme Court any more \nthan I add to the diversity of the Senate.\n\n  I imagine this announcement is a disappointment to many Hispanic \nAmericans who had expected the President to seize this historic \nopportunity given to him for a third time by nominating the first \nHispanic to the Court. I also imagine that all of the women in our \nNation's Capital today to honor Rosa Parks, the first woman to lie in \nstate in the Capitol Rotunda for her work in bringing racial justice to \nour Nation, are somewhat saddened that the seat of the first woman to \nserve on our Highest Court is not going to be filled by another woman.\n\n[[Page S12061]]\n\n  I do not expect Democrats to engage in the kinds of personal attacks \non this nominee that the rightwing used to force the President to \nwithdraw his nomination of Ms. Miers, whom he described as the best \nqualified person in the country to replace Justice O'Connor. I do \nbelieve we need to take the time necessary to examine the record of the \nnominee in the Reagan Justice Department and on the bench before we \nproceed with full and thorough hearings.\n  The stakes for the American people could not be higher with this new \nnomination. Justice O'Connor brought an open mind to the cases she \nreviewed. She served especially as a moderating influence on the Court. \nThe person who replaces her replaces a pivotal vote on our most \npowerful Court. That person has the potential to dramatically tilt the \nCourt's balance. Maintaining the stability of the Court is crucial for \nthe Nation, and that is going to be an important factor for me as I \nconsider this nomination.\n  At this critical moment and in light of the circumstances that led to \nthe withdrawal of the Miers nomination, all Senators should perform our \nconstitutional advice and consent responsibility, but we should do it \nwith heightened vigilance. The Supreme Court is the guarantor of the \nrights of all Americans.\n  I look forward to the hearings. I will, as I did before, work with \nSenator Specter, the chairman, to make sure they are open and fair as \nthey were for Chief Justice Roberts. Those were open and fair hearings \nbecause we had the time to prepare for them. I urge the President and \neven the leadership of this august body to allow the Judiciary \nCommittee to take the time to do it right. It is far more important to \ndo it right than to do it fast.\n  The appointment must be made in the Nation's interest, not to serve \nthe special interests of any partisan faction, even though today we \nhave one that is claiming credit for destroying the chances of Harriet \nMiers but for also in effect telling the President of the United States \nwho to appoint as his third nominee for this one seat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have some remarks about Rosa Parks and \nthe events of the day. I see the Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I \nknow we had the opportunity a few moments earlier to discuss Rosa Parks \nas we viewed her casket. It was indeed just a few hours ago, right down \nthis hall, that Rosa Parks' body lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, \nthe site where our Nation pays its highest respects to our most \nnoteworthy citizens. She was the first woman ever to be so honored.\n  How is it possible that a seamstress born in Tuskegee, AL, who had \nnever held elective office or any high political or military position, \nbe so highly recognized? Just 6 years ago, she was awarded the \nCongressional Gold Medal, which I was pleased to be a sponsor of in \nthis Senate. She was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  It is a story I would suggest that only divine providence could \nwrite. The theological concept is well known: His power and authority \nbeing made manifest by lifting persons of apparent low estate to great \nheights.\n  Certainly, the life of Rosa Parks produced an advancement of freedom, \nequality, and progress. These accomplishments rose from her steadfast \ncourage and strength that she found from above. As a result, she \nfulfilled her calling, and she met her challenge on that afternoon when \nshe came home weary from work, with dignity and integrity.\n  I was not yet 10 years old when these events happened in Montgomery, \nAL, 85 miles north of my home in rural Alabama. We did not even have a \ntelevision set that year. We got one a few years later. I have a \nrecollection of the events, the boycott of 382 days, and some \nunderstanding and recollection of the momentous court decisions that \nresulted.\n  Make no mistake, the races in the South in the 1950s were, for the \nmost part, openly and legally separate. That is the way it was. \nAlthough the mantra was ``separate but equal,'' the reality was \nseparate and unequal.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I join Arkansans in mourning the loss of \nRosa Parks, known throughout the Nation as the ``Mother of the Freedom \nMovement.''\n  As people line up to pay their respects to Mrs. Parks in the Capitol \nRotunda today, I cannot help but remember the incredible impact she had \non our Nation. Rosa Parks is the first woman to lie in the Capitol \nRotunda, which is a testament that her actions are just as significant \ntoday as they were in 1955.\n  Mrs. Parks once remarked that her show of defiance to move to the \nback of the bus was simply because she was tired of being humiliated, \ntired of following archaic rules forbidding her from sitting in the \nfront of a public bus or entering public buildings through the front \ndoor. But, history will remember Rosa Parks for shaking America's \nconscience and changing the course of our Nation for the better.\n  Mrs. Parks' courage to sit down for equal rights ignited others to \nstand up for theirs.\n  Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., stood up to call for equality and \njustice for all Americans, inspiring and organizing thousands of \nactivists to stand up with him. Four students in Greensboro, NC, sat in \nat a Woolworth's lunch counter, standing up for their right to be \nserved.\n  And, Daisy Bates led the Little Rock Nine to stand up for their right \nto an equal education. The Little Rock Nine taught America that \n``separate'' was not ``equal.'' Nine Black students--Ernest Green, \nElizabeth Eckford, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier, \nMinnijean Brown Trickey, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, Thelma \nMothershed Wair and Melba Pattillo Beals--defied hatred and threats to \nattend the all-White Central High School for a better education.\n  Of Rosa Parks' battle for equality, Minnijean Brown Trickey said:\n\n       I don't think until the bus boycott we had a sense of our \n     power. . . . The general feeling was if she could do it, we \n     could do it. She was really a heroine to us. She was an \n     ordinary woman and we were ordinary kids and it seems we had \n     a relationship.\n\n  As a former student of Central High, I can attest to the influence \nRosa Parks and the Little Rock Nine continue to have in the hallways \ntoday.\n  We know that Rosa Parks' inspiring story lives on in the pages of \nevery history textbook across America. Her legacy also endures at the \nRosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, which she \nfounded in Detroit. The center offers career training and encourages \nteens to stay in school and take advantage of the opportunities \navailable to them.\n  I am just one of millions of Americans who admired Rosa Parks' \ntenacity and life's work. She earned countless accolades and awards for \nher efforts in the civil rights movement, including the Congressional \nGold Medal Award--the Nation's highest civilian honor. In honoring Mrs. \nParks with the Medal of Freedom, President Clinton reminded us that:\n\n       Freedom's work is never done. There are still people who \n     are discriminated against. There are still people that \n     because of their human condition are looked down on, derided, \n     degraded, demeaned, and we should all remember the powerful \n     example of this one citizen. And those of us with greater \n     authority and power should attempt every day, in every way, \n     to follow her lead.\n\n  Although Rosa Parks served as a catalyst to get the wheels turning in \nthe civil rights movement, our journey is not completed. We can honor \nher memory by continuing her work to stand up for equality and justice \nfor all Americans.\n  Still, this was the reality of more than 100 years of history. Change \nwas not favored. It had been and would be resisted.\n\n[[Page S12062]]\n\n  Of course, while the South was open and notorious about its \nsegregation policies, research in recent years has shown that there \nwere places all over this great land that secretly or overtly \ndiscriminated against those of African decent. But in the South, \ndiscrimination was not only openly acknowledged; it was the law of the \nland. The fact was that in Montgomery, AL, on December 1, 1955, it was \nthe law of the city of Montgomery that ``colored'' persons on city \nbuses must sit in the back. As one who loves and admires his home state \nand her people--I believe there are none finer--this is painful to \nacknowledge, but facing the painful truth is essential for \nreconciliation and progress.\n  So, on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, refused to go to the back of the \nbus--a city bus--in violation of city law. And it sparked, and sparked \nis the right word, a nationwide confrontation--a confrontation between \nour American ideals, and our religious concepts, and the grim reality \nof that day.\n  Southerners were angry, embarrassed, resistant, introspective, \nhostile, and pained. They watched, much like I did in Hybart, the drama \nunfold and they were forced to deal with an ugly reality they would \nrather have ignored.\n  Rosa Parks' gumption resulted in a 382 day boycott of the city bus \nsystem let by a young 26-year-old preacher, new to town, at Dexter \nAvenue Baptist Church, a block from the Capitol--A Capitol building \nproudly known as the First Capital of the Confederacy. That young \npreacher, of course, was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And, there was a \nyoung attorney, Mr. Fred Gray, who had come back to Alabama after \nreceiving his degree from Case Western Reserve University determined to \n``become a lawyer, return to Alabama, and destroy everything segregated \nI could find.'' He would become a legend in his own right, being a part \nof some of the most historic cases in civil rights and American \nhistory. The young Federal trial Judge, an Eisenhower appointee, Judge \nFrank M. Johnson, would become perhaps the most courageous, clear, and \nauthoritative judicial voice for equal justice in America. And, the \nlawyer who argued the case for Rosa Parks in the U.S. Supreme Court--\nThurgood Marshall--who would later sit on that very court.\n  The very words, ``the back of the bus'' went to the heart of the \nproblem. Separate was not equal; it was not fair; it was discriminatory \nagainst a class of Americans solely because of the color of their skin. \nI knew Judge Frank Johnson. He was courageous and followed the law. He \ndid not believe he was an activist. He did not believe he was amending \nthe constitution. Judge Johnson believed he was simply being faithful \nto the plain words of the constitution--words that guaranteed everyone \n``equal protection of the laws.'' Sending someone to the back of the \nbus because of the color of their skin violated that principle he \nruled, and the Supreme Court agreed.\n  This simple act by a courageous woman, a seamstress, but one who was \nwell aware of the danger she faced, at 42-years of age, sparked the \ncivil rights movement and justly earned her the title ``Mother of the \nCivil Rights Movement.''\n  Today, in Montgomery, AL, there exists a museum--part of Troy State \nUniversity--that sits on the spot where she was arrested. It has a \nschool bus, like the one she rode that day, which has interactive \ncapabilities so that children can sit in it and get a better feel for \nthe events of the day. It has more exhibits, and I commend this fine, \nhistorical museum to any who would want to learn more of Rosa Parks and \nthe movement she sparked. I was pleased to sponsor legislation that \nthis Congress passed to provide funds to help establish the museum.\n  While there are many problems between the races today, the de jure, \nthe statutes and ordinances that enforced segregation are gone. And, I \nam proud that the people of Montgomery have come to see the positive \nbenefits of ending discrimination and that they have chosen to honor \nMrs. Parks in this way.\n  Everyone knows, virtually everyone, that as a result of the movement \nshe sparked, today's Montgomery is a different and better place. Today \nwe also look with pride on the historic Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, \nthat once heard the powerful sermons of a young Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. And we look with respect on the Civil Rights Memorial--a striking \nmonument of black granite and cascading water--which honors those who \ngave their lives in the pursuit of equal justice.\n  Thus, it is true: Ms. Parks' efforts helped spark the dynamic social \nchanges that have made it possible for positive and historical change \nfor Montgomery, Alabama, and America. But, in fact, Ms. Parks' \ncontributions extend beyond even the borders of our Nation. In his book \nBus Ride to Justice, Mr. Fred Gray, who gained fame while in his 20's \nas Ms. Parks' attorney, and as one of the early African-American \nattorneys in Alabama--he was a lead attorney in many of Alabama's other \nfamous civil rights cases--wrote--and I do not believe it is an \nexaggeration--these words:\n\n       Little did we know that we had set in motion a force that \n     would ripple though Alabama, the South, and the Nation, and \n     even the world. But from the vantage point of almost 40 years \n     later, there is a direct correlation between what we started \n     in Montgomery and what has subsequently happened in China, \n     eastern Europe, South Africa and, even more recently, in \n     Russia. While it is inaccurate to say that we all sat down \n     and deliberately planned a movement that would echo and \n     reverberate around the world, we did work around the clock, \n     planning strategy and creating an atmosphere that gave \n     strength, courage, faith and hope to people of all races, \n     creeds, colors and religions around the world. And it all \n     started on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, with Rosa Parks on \n     December 1, 1955.\n\n  For her courage, for her role in changing Alabama, the South, the \nNation, and the world for the better, our Nation owes a great debt of \nthanks to Rosa Parks. Placing her body in our Capitol's Rotunda, lying \nin honor, the first woman who has ever been so honored, is a fitting \nrecognition of her towering achievement.\n  And, as I conclude, I think it is important to note the recent death \nof another Alabamian who played a key role in the early civil rights \nmovement in America--Vivian Malone--who crossed the school house door \ninto the University of Alabama.\n  We must also celebrate that very special event that occurred two \nweekends ago when another native Alabamian, the Secretary of State, \nCondoleezza Rice, returned to Alabama, visited her family's church and \nunveiled the statue of the four little girls, one of whom she knew and \nplayed with, who were killed in a bomb attack at the 16th Street \nBaptist Church. It was also good, earlier today, to stand and discuss \nRosa Parks' life with Alabama native and U.S. Congressman John Lewis, \nwho, inspired by Rosa Parks, began a lifetime of leadership in the \ncivil rights movement culminating in his election to Congress. Alabama \nhas the highest number of African-American elected officials of any \nState in the country. We are proud of that. Progress has certainly been \nmade but we must work harder to ease divisions and tensions and promote \nprogress. Let us so pledge on this historic day. Let us allow the \nsteadfastness and peacefulness of Rosa Parks' life, which started the \ncivil rights movement on the basis of faith and morality, not violence, \nto be our guide in this century as we seek to further the gains she \nchampioned.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will Senator Sessions yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this morning I was in the Senate \nrotunda with Senator Sessions and Senator Levin from Michigan. As we \nstood in the Rotunda, in addition to paying honor to this great woman \nwhose body lies in State in the Capitol Rotunda, we spoke just a bit \nabout each of our recollections of what Rosa Parks meant to us and to \nour country.\n  I want to follow on the statement by Senator Sessions to say that as \nI was in the Rotunda this morning, I was thinking about what kind of \ncourage it must have taken for this woman, a 42-year-old seamstress, \ngetting on a bus at the end of the day, perhaps tired from working all \nday, understanding that there were then police dogs and fire hoses and \nclubs and beatings and a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble, I was \nthinking about the courage it would have had to take for that woman to \nhave done what she did. Her actions of sitting in that seat on that bus \nand refusing to move to the back of the bus were simple, elegant, \ndignified but also enormously courageous. I think that is a lesson for \nall Americans.\n  I couldn't have been more pleased when the Congress, the House and \nthe\n\n[[Page S12063]]\n\nSenate, did something that was unusual in the history of America. We \ntook action to have the remains of Rosa Parks lie in State in the \nRotunda of the U.S. Capitol Building, the first woman to be so honored \nin the history of the United States of America. I was enormously moved \nthis morning, standing with my colleagues, Senator Sessions and Senator \nLevin. I know most of our colleagues visited the Rotunda this morning \nas well. But I did want to follow on his comments about this \nextraordinary woman who will live forever in the history of this great \ncountry of ours.\n  Mr. SESSIONS Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his eloquent \ncomments. It was, indeed, a pleasure to be with Senator Levin--she was \nhis constituent when she moved to Michigan--and hear some of his \ninsights and hear him say that Michigan had bought the actual bus in \nwhich she rode on that day and has restored it and made it a museum.\n  So her life, indeed, continues to reverberate all over the country \nand, as Fred Gray said, the impact of her actions have spread \nworldwide. I thank the Senator for his comments and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12063-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12063-S12065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is much happening in Washington, DC, \nand in our country. Picking up the periodicals, Newsweek or Time \nmagazine, or the morning paper for that matter, you see stories of \nscandal and stories of controversy and all kinds of interesting things \nwith respect to politics and the economy and things that affect our \ndaily lives. I wanted to talk for a moment, once again, about the issue \nof energy because, while we will deal with a lot of things--this week, \nfor example, something called the reconciliation bill--most people will \ndeal this week with the challenge of pulling up to the gas pump and \nputting perhaps 16 or 18 gallons of gas in their tank and trying to \nfind $50 to pay for it. As the chill is in the air these days in our \ncountry, people will begin thinking about how they will pay for the \nincreased cost of natural gas to heat their homes, particularly in our \npart of the country where that will increase by 60 percent over a year \nago. They will wonder about how they will find the money to pay for \nthat cost because heating your home is not a luxury. Heating your home \nis a necessity.\n  I have spoken previously about a woman named Sarah Swifthawk. She was \na grandmother. She died in the United States of America--she froze to \ndeath. She was a member of the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. \nThis grandmother laid down to go to sleep on a cot in a home that had \nplastic where windows should have been. At, I believe, 30 or 35 degrees \nbelow zero that evening, others huddled together for body warmth in \nthat family, but this grandmother was laying on a cot, and the next \nmorning she was dead; frozen to death--in the United States of America, \nnot a Third World country, in the United States of America.\n  I point that out only to say this issue of the cost of shelter, the \ncost of energy, the requirement that we find ways to keep people warm \nduring cold temperatures can mean the difference between life and \ndeath. It did for Sarah Swifthawk.\n  Now the question is, in this month, October, and then November of the \nyear 2005, what do we do about the prices and the cost of energy now \nfor this winter? Perhaps it is not such a big problem for people who \nserve in this Chamber or in the House of Representatives. Perhaps they \ncan easily pay the monthly heating bill. But there are many in this \ncountry who cannot. The question is, What do we do for them?\n  The oil companies will say: This is about the free market system and \nthe price of oil, and therefore the price of gasoline and natural gas \nand home heating fuel, it is just a function of the free market system.\n  The price of oil is to the free market system like mud wrestling is \nto the performance arts. It has no relationship at all--none. Let me \ndescribe why. There are three things that happen with respect to the \nprice of oil. No. 1, we have this planet in which a substantial portion \nof the oil reserves are under the sand halfway around the world.\n  So oil ministries from those countries get together around the table \nand decide how much they are going to produce and how much that \nproduction should impact prices.\n  Second, the largest oil companies--much larger and bigger and \nstronger because of blockbuster mergers--decide how they are going to \nuse more raw muscle in the marketplace. And believe me, they have \nplenty, given the blockbuster mergers.\n  Third, the futures markets which are supposed to provide liquidity \nfor trading of commodities--in this case, oil--have become orgies of \nspeculation.\n  So you have these three issues that together tell us now that a \nbarrel of oil is worth $60 or $65.\n  Let me tell you the results of all of that. The oil companies are \nfilling up their treasuries, and the American consumers are emptying \ntheir bank accounts.\n  Let me give you some examples.\n  ExxonMobil last week said their profits were up 75 percent for the \nthird quarter--$9.9 billion. Conoco-Phillips--by the way, ExxonMobil \nused to be two companies, Exxon and Mobil. Then they fell in love. That \nis economic talk, I guess, about mergers and acquisitions. And they get \nmarried. Now it is ExxonMobil.\n  Conoco-Phillips used to be Conoco and Phillips, two companies. Now it \nis one company. They too had some sort of financial romance and got \nmarried, Conoco-Phillips, profits up 89 percent, third quarter to third \nquarter.\n  Last year--I am not talking about this year's prices--the world's 10 \nbiggest oil companies earned more than $100 billion on sales of over $1 \ntrillion. This year, of course, it is going to be much higher than \nthat. ExxonMobil last year had $25 billion net profit and spent almost \n$10 billion of it to buy back their stock.\n  BusinessWeek asked this question. This is not some liberal journal, \nthis is BusinessWeek. They asked:\n\n       Why isn't big oil drilling more? Rather than developing new \n     fields, oil giants have preferred to buy rivals, drilling for \n     oil on Wall Street. While that makes financial sense, it is \n     not a substitute for new oil.\n\n  Again, this is BusinessWeek. This isn't some politician, it is not \nsome liberal publication someplace.\n\n       Oil has been over $20 a barrel almost continuously since \n     mid-1990's. That should have been ample incentive for oil \n     companies to open new fields, since projects are designed to \n     be profitable with prices in the low- or mid-teens. \n     Nevertheless, drilling has lagged. Far from raising money to \n     pursue opportunities, oil companies are paying down debt, \n     buying back shares, and hoarding cash--\n\n  And drilling for oil on Wall Street.\n  Sixty-six million homes in this country are heated mainly with \nnatural gas and home heating oil. Their heating bills this winter are \ngoing up on average 48 percent. It is going be up over 60 percent for \nthose in my region of the country who are heating with natural gas.\n  What have I proposed with respect to that? I proposed that if the oil \ncompanies are not using this additional cash--unprecedented amounts of \ncash in the history of corporate America--to explore for more oil or \nbuild more refineries--and oh, by the way, they are the ones that have \nbeen closing refineries. I know it is fashionable during political \ndiscussions to talk about, It is the environmentalists' fault or Calvin \nCoolidge's fault or somebody else's fault that we don't have enough \nrefinery capacity. It is the energy companies that have themselves shut \ndown refineries. When they have mergers, they shut down refineries.\n  If they are not using these unprecedented gains in corporate America \nto explore for more oil or build additional refineries, then I believe \nthey ought to be recaptured with a windfall profits tax, the proceeds \nof which should be sent back to the American consumers in the form of a \nrebate.\n  I noticed last Friday that my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator \nJudd Gregg, indicated that he would support--he called it an excess \nprofits tax. He would use the proceeds, at least from the press \nreports, of an excess profits tax for the purpose of providing \nadditional low-income home heating fuel assistance, among other things. \nI believe we should provide additional low-income energy help for low-\nincome citizens in this country. We are going\n\n[[Page S12064]]\n\ninto a winter season. We don't have that adequately funded. Three times \nwe have tried on the floor of the Senate, and three times we failed. We \nshould try again--and we will. And this Senate one day will decide that \nperhaps keeping people warm in the winter is as important as providing \nmillionaires tax cuts on their yearly tax bills.\n  Someone will say that is class warfare. I don't mean class warfare at \nall. I just make the point that the last two tax cuts have produced $32 \nmillion a year in tax reductions for people whose incomes are over $1 \nmillion a year, and more. Perhaps we should capture a part of that $32 \nmillion. Surely those who are earning $1 million-plus a year could give \nup just a little of the tax cuts they have received, and we could \ndivert it to try to help those who are low-income folks going into \nwinter trying to figure out how they will pay a 60-percent increase in \nnatural gas bills to heat their homes, at a time, by the way, when the \nExxon Corporation and others are showing the highest profits in their \nhistory.\n  The American people who struggle to pay these bills, take a look at \nthese companies: ExxonMobil, Shell-BP, Chevron-Texaco, Conoco-Phillips.\n  By the way, Chevron-Texaco used to be two companies. There used to be \nExxon, and then there was Mobil; then there was Chevron, then there was \nTexaco; then there was Conoco and then there was Phillips. They all got \nmarried. So now we have just a few companies--75-percent increase, 68-\npercent increase, 89-percent increase. I am talking about increase in \nprofits.\n\n  At the same time this is going on, by the way, the American people \nare paying through the nose at the gas pumps, and we are setting them \nup to pay a dramatic increase to heat their homes this winter.\n  Once again, one group is filling their treasury, and the other group \nis emptying their bank accounts. Guess which is which. The oil \ncompanies are filling their treasuries, and average Americans are \nhaving to empty their bank accounts to pay the price.\n  Let me give you some numbers, if I might. In January of last year, \nthe price of a barrel of oil was $34.50 a barrel. At that price, the \noil companies had the highest profits in the history of the oil \nindustry. Now it is almost $30 a barrel above that. That is about $7 \nbillion more a month in profits.\n  The Shell report, which was received in my office about two months \nago talked about their financial performance in 2004. This is last \nyear, when prices averaged around $40 a barrel. The report says: We \nachieved the highest net income in our history, 48 percent higher than \nthe year before, as a result of higher oil and natural gas prices. It \ngoes on to say that these higher profits occurred even though the \ncompany produced less oil than the previous year. They produced less \nand saw a 50-percent increase in their profits. The same is true with \nother companies saying: We had higher profits, but we produced less.\n  As I indicated, my colleague, Senator Judd Gregg, has indicated \npublicly that he would support an excess--I call it a windfall profits \ntax. He would use it for the purpose of providing low-income energy \nassistance.\n  I personally believe that this money doesn't belong to the \nGovernment. I don't want to bring it in the Treasury. I want to capture \nsome of that which they are not using to expand our energy supply and \nuse it to give rebates to the consumers. They are, after all, the ones \npaying the price. Taking it from the consumers, putting it in the \nenergy companies' treasuries, and then bringing it into the Government \nmeans you have taken money from the consumers to Government. I would \njust as soon provide a rebate back to the consumers.\n  I know that when we talk about this, the oil industry has an \napoplectic seizure. They get all upset. I understand that. They are \nmaking more money than ever. I have been supportive of the energy \nindustry. I hope we find substantial new reserves. While I don't \nsupport opening ANWR, I believe that is one of those pristine areas \nwhich was set aside, not to be opened first, but to be opened last, if \never. I do support opening up Lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico. I hope \nwe can do that. I would like to see us vote on opening that lease area. \nWe have substantial proven reserves that exist there.\n  There are other things on which I do support the energy industry. \nPeople said: Well, if you think prices are too high, what about when \nthey are too low? I was one of those who supported an $18 price and did \nsupport a proposal for an $18 price, including tax credits to get to \nthat price for marginal wells. I have supported the energy industry in \nmany areas, but I cannot support, I don't think the American people \nsupport, and I don't believe the Senate should support these kinds of \nexcess windfall profits that far exceed anything that is reasonable and \nseeing these profits gathered at the expense of the American people \noften who can least afford it.\n  There are some who, as I said when I started, make the case, Well, \nthis is just the market system at work. This isn't the market system. \nThat is all nonsense. The market system is fine. I used to teach some \neconomics at college. I was able to overcome that afterward. I \nunderstand free markets and the market system. The free market system \nneeds a referee from time to time. Do you know that we pay one 7-foot, \n2-inch basketball player the equivalent of 1,000 elementary school \nteachers? That is the market system. Does that make sense? Probably \nnot; the market system. There is a judge on television, Judge Judy. It \nseems kind of out of sorts when I have been channel-surfing and I see \nher. I understand from a magazine article that she made $25 million in \na year. I think the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court makes $190,000. \nMarket system? Well, you know. You can take a look at the market system \nand see areas where there needs to be from time to time somebody who \nsays: This isn't fair, it doesn't make any sense. The market system is \nnot perfect. It is not the market system, however, that produces a $60-\nplus barrel of oil.\n  I mentioned before that there are three factors. I described OPEC \nministers with substantial control over the supply of oil; the larger, \nmore muscular oil companies made larger by mergers, exerting more \nmuscle in the marketplace; and the futures market becoming a \nspeculative bazaar, all of which then produce this remarkable price for \nenergy. It has an impact on every single American. Some perhaps don't \ncare. But the question is this: If we in this country are going to pay \nthese prices for a barrel of oil and, therefore, gasoline and natural \ngas, if we are going to pay these prices, should they result in more \nexploration in a greater supply of energy with greater energy security \nfor this country's future? Shouldn't they? That is not what is \nhappening. What is happening--I described BusinessWeek--is these \ncompanies more and more are buying back their stock. They are hoarding \nthe cash. They are drilling for oil on Wall Street where oil doesn't \nexist. That is not in the country's interest.\n  I take some hope from my colleague, Senator Judd Gregg's press \nstatements last Friday. I take some hope from the statements by the \nSpeaker of the House. He held a press conference suggesting that the \noil companies should be investing more in exploration. His remedy was \nthe equivalent of beating them over the head with a feather. But, \nnonetheless, he was speaking out about the need to produce more energy. \nIt is the case even with the majority leader of the Senate talking \nabout that. I think perhaps, if not seeing the light, at least there \nare people here who are feeling the heat from drivers, from people who \nare worried about heating their homes in the winter, who take a look at \nthe price and say it is unfair. The question isn't whether it is \nunfair; the question is, What do we do about it? Apparently the Speaker \nof the House, the majority leader of the Senate, and our colleague from \nNew Hampshire think it is unfair.\n  What do we do about it? We can sit around and mop our brow, we can \ngrit our teeth, wring our hands, and we can fret. We do that petty \nwell. I don't know of any body that does that better than the U.S. \nSenate. But that doesn't do much for those being hurt in this country.\n  What we ought to do, in my judgment, is employ and adopt a windfall \nprofits tax, gather from that windfall profits tax the revenue that is \nbeing taken from consumers unfairly, and use it as a rebate back to \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S12065]]\n\nMy proposal would be a windfall profits tax, the one I introduced with \nSenator Dodd and others; that is, if the energy companies are, in fact, \nsinking their profits back into the ground to explore for more oil and \nbuild additional refineries above ground, they wouldn't be paying an \nexcess windfall profits tax. That is not what they are doing with their \nmoney. Don't take it from me; take it from their own financial reports \nbecause that is not what they are doing with their money. I believe \nthey ought to be paying a 50-percent windfall tax for oil above $40 a \nbarrel, and that excise tax ought to be redistributed to the American \nconsumers who are the ones ultimately paying the bill. It ought to be \ndistributed to them as a rebate for those consumers. We will have more \nto talk about this week on this subject.\n\n  I took some heart on Friday to hear a Member of the Senate from the \nother side of the political aisle has come to the same conclusion I \nhave reached, and that is that these profits are far above that which \nis supportable or justifiable, profits far above that which would be \ncreated by a free market system; that the consumers are being treated \nunfairly. The Senate ought to do something about it. The question isn't \nwhether we should do it. Of course we should. The question is, which \nmethod or which strategy do we employ? Do we decide this money grab \ngoes to the Government--grab some of it and bring it here? Or do we \ndecide this money comes from the consumer and ought to go back to the \nconsumer in the form of the rebate?\n  I make a final point. We will again be confronted with this question \nof heating fuel assistance for low-income Americans. But it is not only \nlow-income Americans who are being injured, who will be hurt by these \nprices. There are a lot of working families who just get by and who \nwill look at this 60-percent increase in the cost to heat their home \nthis winter in my part of the country and wonder how on Earth will they \nbe able to do that.\n  I have described profits of the heads of the oil companies. Let me \nread total 2004 compensation for the chief executive officers: $33 \nmillion, $64 million, $4 million, $16 million, $8 million. These are \nsalaries and compensation packages for the folks who run the companies \nthat are charging these prices.\n  The people have a right to ask the question, how on Earth is this \nallowed? We will have more to talk about as we go along this week. I \nhope, finally, there might be some tipping point at which the Senate \nsays we must address this issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, in a few minutes, under the regular order, \nwe will proceed to the deficit reduction bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12065-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12065-S12073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DEFICIT REDUCTION OMNIBUS RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2005\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the previous \norder, the hour of 4 o'clock having arrived, the Senate will proceed to \nconsideration of S. 1932, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1932) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 202(a) of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2006 (H. Con. Res. 95).\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the presence \nand use of small electronic calculators be permitted in this Chamber \nduring consideration of S. 1932.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time spent in \nquorum calls requested during consideration of S. 1932 be equally \ndivided between the majority and minority managers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point we turn to what is one of the \nmore significant pieces of legislation to come before the Senate and \nthe Congress during this session of the Senate. We always hear that. \nWhatever legislation comes to the Congress, they always say, Well, it \nis a significant piece of legislation--and it is. There is very little \nthat he we do that cannot have that identification. But this one is a \nlittle unique because for the first time in 8 years under Republican \nleadership, this Congress will, if we are successful in passing this \nbill, conferencing it and then sending it on to the President, reduce \nthe deficit of the United States through addressing what is the most \nsignificant item of spending in the Federal budget--mandatory programs. \nThis is a major effort. As I said, it has not occurred in 8 years. The \nlast time it happened was in the mid-1990s, and it has not occurred \nbecause people did not want to do it. It did not occur because it is \nnot an easy thing to do. It is not easy to control the rate of the \ngrowth of the Federal Government, and it is not easy to control the \ngrowth of mandatory entitlement programs which is what this bill does.\n  So it is an important step in the direction of fiscal responsibility, \nand it is one which I am very proud to have the opportunity to bring \nhere to the floor as chairman of the Budget Committee.\n\n[[Page S12066]]\n\n  Let me explain quickly what the problem is so that people will \nunderstand the scope and concern of the issue of mandatory spending \nbecause it is going to impact not only America today but, more \nimportantly, it is going to affect our children and our children's \nchildren if we do not do something positive in the area of trying to \ncontrol Federal spending on mandatory programs.\n  Mandatory programs are programs which people have a right to. In \nother words, if you were in the military and are a veteran, you have \nentitlement to certain benefits. If you are at a certain income level \nin this country, you have a right to certain benefits. If you are a \nstudent going to college and you meet certain income levels, you have a \nright to certain types of benefits. If you are a senior citizen in this \ncountry today, you have a right to certain benefits under the Medicare \nProgram and the Medicaid Program, depending on your income level, and \nthose payments have to be made.\n  In other words, mandatory programs are programs where there is no \ndiscretion. The Federal Government has to pay out a certain amount of \nmoney because the law says that if a person meets a certain set of \ncriteria, then that person has a right to the support of that program.\n  Mandatory programs used to be a small percentage of the Federal \nGovernment, but today they have grown--and this has occurred over the \nlast 20 years, actually in the post-1970 period--to be the largest part \nof the Federal Government.\n  This chart reflects that. Back in 1975, mandatory programs \nrepresented a very small percentage. They are the orange bar here.\n  Discretionary programs--let me explain discretionary programs. They \nare programs which are funded every year. Those are the ones you think \nof relative to Government, such as national defense, education, \ncleaning up the environment. That is called a discretionary program. \nEvery year the Government makes a decision, under the appropriations \nbill process, that we are going to spend this much on foreign aid; we \nare going this spend this much on defending our country; we are going \nto spend this much on homeland security; we are going to spend this \nmuch on education.\n  That is a discretionary program. We can change that every year. \nNobody has a right to that money. Mandatory programs, as I said, people \nhave a right to the program. So as we see the orange bar, in 1985, it \nwas 45 percent of the Federal Government, discretionary being the \nbalance. So there was an equal split between discretionary and \nmandatory. But you see that by today's accounting, mandatory programs \nrepresent approximately 56 percent of the Federal budget, the largest \nitem in the Federal budget, and they are growing. In fact, this chart \nshows it rather dramatically. So that by the year 2015, they will be 62 \npercent of the Federal budget and essentially absorbing most of the \nFederal spending.\n  What is the practical implication of that? Well, it means that if we \nare going to discipline ourselves as a government, we have to be \nwilling to look at mandatory programs. The only way you can look at \nmandatory programs is through something called the reconciliation \nprocess. That is what we have in the Chamber today, a bill which \ncontrols the amount of spending the Federal Government does in the \nmandatory area and therefore reduces the debt if it reduces that \nspending.\n  Why is it important to do this? Well, I mentioned the major programs \nin the mandatory area involve mostly health care and people who are \nretired: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. And as a quirk of \nfate, there is this population group called the postwar baby boom \ngeneration, which is the largest generation in the history of our \nGovernment. This group has changed the country in every 10-year period. \nIt has impacted the way the Nation lives. In the 1950s, we had to build \na huge number of schools to meet the needs of this generation. In the \n1960s, this generation had a huge impact on civil rights and women and, \nof course, in the Vietnam debate. In 1970s and 1980s and 1990s, this \ngeneration has been the most productive generation in the history of \nour country because it is the largest and also the best educated over \nthat period and as a result has caused our country to obtain huge \nwealth, and we as a nation have been very prosperous as a result of \nthis generation putting its oars in the water.\n\n  But now this generation, the baby boom generation, is moving toward \nretirement and moving toward retirement rather quickly. By 2008, \nmembers of this generation will start to retire, and by 2030 this \ngeneration will, for all intents and purposes, be retired. And the \neffect of this huge generation retiring is it is going to put massive \ndemands on people who are working; in other words, our children, my \nchildren, children of the baby boom generation, and their children are \ngoing to have to pay taxes to support the retirement benefits of this \nmassive generation.\n  To try to put it into perspective, in 1950, there were about 16 \npeople working for every 1 person retired. Today, there are about 3\\1/\n2\\ people working for every 1 person retired. By the time we hit the \nyear 2030, there will only be 2 people working for every person \nretiring in this country because the baby boom generation is huge.\n  What is the impact on our Federal Treasury but more especially on the \ntaxing of our children and our children's children when this happens?\n  This chart, in red, shows it most dramatically. These are the three \nprograms in the Federal Government--Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid--and the spending they absorb.\n  Now, historically, Federal spending, the amount spent by the Federal \nGovernment, has averaged about 20 percent of the gross national product \nfor a long time. That is the blue line here. And you can see that back \nin 1980, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid took up about 8 \npercent of the gross national product, and the balance was taken up in \nthe Federal spending on national defense and other items.\n  Today, that number has gone up so that it represents about 10 percent \nof the gross national product being absorbed by Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. But as you can see from this chart, by about \nthe year 2030, when this baby boom generation is fully retired, these \nthree programs alone--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--will use \nup all the revenues of the Federal Government--all of them. They will \nrepresent, in spending, 20 percent of gross national product.\n  The practical implications of that are that you will have no money \navailable for national defense, for education, for environmental \ncleanup, for all the different things you would like to do--for \nveterans affairs--because these three spending programs--Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid--will essentially be absorbing 20 \npercent of the gross national product, unless--unless--you want to \ndramatically increase the taxes on our children so that they actually \nend up paying more than 20 percent of gross national product in taxes \nor you are willing to slash programs and the benefits going to seniors.\n  Neither of those options are very attractive, to say the least. If \nyou look in the outyears, you see that these programs continue to \naccelerate even faster, so that by the year 2050, these programs are \nactually absorbing almost 30 percent of the gross national product. So \nwe have to address this.\n  Well, it is similar to that old television ad that used to be aired. \nThere was an oil filter ad that said: You can pay me now or pay me \nlater, and if you pay me later, it is going to cost a heck of a lot \nmore. You can replace the oil filter today for $14 or a year from now \nor in 6 months you are going to have to replace the engine in your car \nfor $2,500. You have the choice.\n  We can act now and do some constructive and conscientious things to \ntry to bring under control the rate of growth of entitlement spending, \nmandatory spending, that red line there, or we can bury our heads in \nthe sand and say those are our children's problems, and they are going \nto have to pay our retirement benefits; we are not going to worry about \nthem.\n  Well, the Republican Congress and the President have decided it is \nnot good policy to pass this problem on to our children and it is not \nfair and it is not right. So we produced a budget this year which, as I \nmentioned, for the first time in 8 years has moved into the sacred \nground of trying to address controlling the rate of growth of mandatory \nspending and thus reducing the size of the Federal deficit. It has been\n\n[[Page S12067]]\n\ncomplicated, it has been difficult, but we have made progress, and we \nnow have in the Chamber this bill which does some very constructive \nthings in this area.\n  The bill itself represents about $71 billion, in gross terms, in \nreducing deficit spending over the next 5 years. However, because we \nfelt there were some initiatives which needed to be taken in moving \nforward to make these savings and to accomplish this deficit reduction, \nbecause we felt there should also be initiatives to move forward, the \nnet number in this bill of actual deficit reduction is about $29 \nbillion.\n  You may say, and some of our commentators have said: Well, it is not \nenough. This is small potatoes. Let me begin by saying, in New \nHampshire, $39 billion is not small potatoes. I don't think it is \nanywhere in the United States, except in Washington. And more \nimportantly, if you don't move forward with this attempt, you are \nessentially doing nothing, which means you have made no effort in the \narea of deficit reduction and no effort in the area of getting our \nspending under control.\n  Now, why do we net out about $30 billion of new spending in this \neffort? As I mentioned, the total bill is about 71 and the spending \nreduction is about 39. Well, there are two major initiatives in this \nbill which account for most of the initial spending. The first is that \nthe majority of the money from each one of the subcommittees--I should \nexplain this quickly. Each committee in the Congress was asked to save \na certain amount of money in their area of responsibility. The Finance \nCommittee was asked to save $10 billion, the Agriculture Committee was \nasked to save $3 billion, the Education and Labor Committee was asked \nto save $13 billion. The Education and Labor Committee, in reaching its \nsavings target, decided to reduce corporate subsidies that benefit \npeople who lend money to students. Basically, they took a policy \nposition that the corporate subsidies were too high in this area.\n  In doing that, they felt that some of the savings from reducing those \ncorporate subsidies should flow to students. So under the leadership of \nChairman Enzi, there is essentially a major new push for funding \nprograms that assist low-income students, low-income students who need \nassistance to go to college. That is good policy. We know that our \ncountry, if it is going to be competitive as we move into this century, \nhas to be smarter, brighter, and more capable than the rest of the \nworld, and the way you do that is by giving people the opportunity to \ngo to college, no matter what their income levels are, and we give them \nan incentive to do that so they can be creative, imaginative, better \neducated and thus pursue better careers. And that is what we want, \nbetter careers for people. It creates jobs and opportunity throughout \nthis country when we do that. So the HELP Committee--Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee--came back with a program which had the \n$13 billion of savings in it, most of it through reducing corporate \nsubsidies, lender corporate subsidies, and at the same time put a \nsignificant amount of new dollars, about $11 billion, into helping \nstudents, low-income students especially, go to college.\n  The second major initiative is in the area of trying to keep doctors \nengaged in the Medicare Program. We know we have a lot of doctors who \ndon't believe they are adequately compensated under Medicare and, as a \nresult, are less inclined to see patients.\n  The most important thing a patient needs if they are on Medicare is \nto see a doctor. That is fundamental to Medicare. There was a \nglidepath--it wasn't a glidepath; I guess it was a glidepath, it was \ncoming down--to cut by 4.5 percent the salaries of doctors \nparticipating in Medicare. The chairman of the Finance Committee, \nChairman Grassley, in a very foresighted decision, said that is not \ngoing to work because that means patients won't have access to doctors \nbecause doctors won't be treating patients if they have that sort of \nfinancial detriment placed on their back.\n  Basically, in his bill, he has saved significant dollars in the area \nof health care. He has put a considerable amount of those dollars into \nthe effort to keep doctors whole. There is no big increase in here for \ndoctors, but basically they are at a freeze level. I guess it is a 1-\npercent increase, in fact, and that means we will have more access for \npeople, patients will have more opportunity to see people they need to \nsee when they are sick. That is an important initiative.\n  All the spending--almost all the spending; I can't say all--almost \nall the spending programs in this bill, to the extent there are \nspending programs in this bill, are focused on low- and moderate-income \npeople--in fact, almost entirely low and moderate efforts to give \npeople more access to health care and students more access to college \neducation.\n  That being added up, we now have on the floor a $35 billion deficit \nreduction package. That is a major step forward. On top of that, there \nare major initiatives in this bill to address the pension issue. We \nknow we have a serious problem coming at us in these areas: Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security, but running right along with that, as \none might expect, is a huge problem coming at us in the private pension \narea.\n  The pension guarantee fund, which essentially is a fund for when a \ncompany goes bankrupt--and we certainly are hearing a lot about that \nrecently with our airlines--rather than allowing that company to \ncompletely wipe out that pension plan and all the people who worked for \nthat company all their lives wake up one morning and find out they \ndon't have a pension, even though they paid into it for years, this \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation guarantees a certain percentage of \nthat pension will be paid--not all of it but a percentage of it. \nBecause there have been so many bankruptcies and because we have had \nsuch a huge pressure on old-line industries in this country who had \ndefined benefit plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is \nlooking at a $30 billion to $50 billion deficit, which means it cannot \nmeet its liabilities, which means, once again, at risk are even the \nslimmed-down pensions which come to people who find their pensions in \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  So in this bill there is an attempt to move toward solvency in that \ncorporation, and that is good policy. Again, that came out of Senator \nEnzi's proposals, and he should be congratulated for it. His committee \nended up with the largest lift, so to say, in this effort, and they did \nan excellent job in meeting that requirement.\n  This is a very balanced bill, the bottom line of which is very \nsimple: We are going to reduce the deficit by $35 billion in 5 years \nand that, quite honestly, translates--this is a big delta into the \noutyears--even into significantly more money as we move into the next 5 \nyears.\n  This is a significant step forward in the area of fiscal discipline. \nIt is something that needs to be done in this country, and it is \nsomething this Republican Congress has been willing to step up to try \nto do.\n  How has the other side reacted? We are going to hear a lot of people \non the other side say this is a terrible bill because it cuts spending \non the poor while it cuts taxes for the rich. That is the theme on the \nother side. It is a little hard to defend that position, quite \nhonestly, in light of what this bill actually does.\n  First off, this bill does not cut spending to the poor. To the extent \nthere is new spending in this bill, it actually assists especially low-\nincome students. The Medicaid changes are focused primarily on \npharmaceuticals and, in addition, are designed to give Governors much \nmore flexibility.\n  I will tell you right now that a Governor who is worth his or her \nsalt is going to be able to expand--expand--their care to low-income \nindividuals under these proposals because they will have more \nflexibility. You give a good Governor more flexibility and they will \nneed less dollars to do what they know is right. Because the \nstringencies of the Federal Government are so extraordinary, they waste \na tremendous amount of money trying to meet the obligations. But there \nare no reductions in this bill toward low-income individuals. The \nreductions are focused on the pharmaceutical side. They are focused on \ntrying to get the Medicaid system under control using good practices of \nmanagement, something which I know the other side resists. But that is \nthe way it works.\n\n[[Page S12068]]\n\n  Then there is this concept of there is a tax cut for the rich in \nhere. First off, this bill has no tax cut in it at all. None. There is \nno tax relief in this bill. I wish it did have tax relief, but it has \nno tax relief. It cannot have tax relief, and I think this point needs \nto be made, and later on I will ask the Parliamentarian for his precise \ndescription of this point. But under this bill, if it has tax relief, \nit would mean the second reconciliation bill on tax relief could not be \nundertaken, as I understand it, and, therefore, this bill has been \nscrubbed of any tax relief activity.\n  But the other side continues to say it is a tax bill. It is not. This \nis an opportunity--an opportunity--for the other side to vote to reduce \nthe deficit by $39 billion--that is all it is--and to do it in a \nresponsible way where we expand patients' access to health care, where \nwe expand student loans, and where we get under control, finally, to \nsome extent, some of these major entitlement programs, especially in \nthe pension area, in the education area, and in the Medicaid area--\nwhich leads me to my other point.\n  We are hearing a lot of crying of wolf from the other side on the tax \nrelief issue. We are going to hear over and over the refrain: If you \nlook at the tax bill that is going to come next, $70 billion, there is \nactually a net loss to the Treasury of $30 billion or so because this \nreduces spending by $39 billion, but the tax bill puts in tax relief of \n$70 billion. The next bill, hopefully, will put in tax relief of $70 \nbillion, but let's go to what the items are on that list.\n\n  The next bill, the tax bill, is going to have in it a series of items \nthat expire this year and next. What are the items that expire this \nyear the other side appears to be opposed to because they say they are \nopposed to tax reconciliation? There is this alternative minimum tax. \nIf we don't put in place relief for the alternative minimum tax, I \nthink it is something like 8 or 9 or maybe even 20--the number is \nhuge--million people, middle-income people, will suddenly pay taxes \nthey did not pay before. It is a tax increase. The other side wants the \nincreased taxes on those people, I guess. They want to raise the taxes \non 8 to 9, 20 million people.\n  Next is the research and experimentation tax credit. This is one of \nthe most important tax credits at the Federal level because it \nencourages companies to be creative and, as we know, the reason we are \ncompetitive as a nation is because we create better products and we \nhave better research, R, and that is what creates jobs and careers in \nthis country. I guess the other side of the aisle wants to eliminate \nthe R tax credit. They want to raise taxes on entrepreneurship and on \ncreativity.\n  The next tax that will expire in the next 2 years is the deduction \nfor teachers' classroom expenses. This is the deduction we give to \nteachers who are good enough to, out of their own pocket, buy crayons \nfor their classrooms; buy books for their classrooms, something they \nthink their kids need. We decided teachers should have that type of \nhelp.\n  Not the other side of the aisle. I guess they want to raise taxes on \nteachers who do that. They want to raise those taxes.\n  The deduction for qualified educational expenses, once again, that is \ntied to the teachers' classroom expenses.\n  A deduction for State and local sales taxes--I have to admit, I am \nnot sympathetic to letting the State and local taxes be deducted \nbecause New Hampshire doesn't have a sales tax. We also don't have an \nincome tax. If you want to live where somebody knows how to handle \ntheir money, come to New Hampshire. But most of the high-tax States in \nthis country--Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, \nIllinois, and California--and let me see, how many Republican Senators \nare from those States? I can't remember. I don't think there are any. \nIn all of those States, the sales tax is a huge portion of their \nrevenue. Yet the other side of the aisle, I guess, does not want people \nin those States to be able to deduct their sales tax because they do \nnot want the next tax reconciliation bill to come through here. Very \nironic. I think it shows the hypocrisy, maybe, of the other side of the \naisle when they come in here claiming they are opposed to the \nreconciliation bill when, in fact, the beneficiaries of this \nreconciliation bill are going to be the high-tax States, most of whom \nare represented by Democratic Members in the Senate. The list goes on.\n  I hope people, when they hear this constant refrain in grand, large \nterms, will ask specific questions: What is that tax you want to raise \non people? What is the tax increase you want to stick people with? Do \nyou want people to have to pay more because they cannot deduct their \nsales tax? Do you want people to pay more because they are stuck with \nthe alternative minimum tax? Do you want people to pay more because the \nteacher bought crayons for the classroom? Those are the questions you \nneed to ask.\n  So this proposal coming from the other side is really a straw dog, \nand it is a lot of hyperbole. But if you look behind the hyperbole and \nask the substantive question, What are they really proposing, you see \nquickly they have no substance to their argument, and that, in fact, \nthis is their opportunity, if they wish to try to reduce the deficit, \nto vote for this bill which cuts the deficit by $39 billion.\n  We can also ask, Where is the Democratic budget that gives us an \nalternative? Have we seen a Democratic budget that has given us an \nalternative? We were on the floor for 50 hours, but we never saw a \nbudget from the Democratic Party. Never. And we are going to be on the \nfloor for 20 hours with this reconciliation bill. Are we going to see \nan alternative bill? I don't think so.\n  In fact, we put together what the Democratic proposal has been since \nwe started with the budget program, how much they have proposed in new \nspending. You cannot read this. There is so much spending, we couldn't \nput it in big letters. We ended up with little letters. You can't read \nit because there is so much spending. But it adds up to almost $500 \nbillion of new spending that has been proposed by our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle since January 1, just this year, $500 billion \nalmost.\n  So maybe that is their proposal. They never really fleshed this out \nin specifics, so we went back and asked-- clearly, if they had their \nway, they would probably want to increase spending--what is their \nspecific proposal to reduce the deficit? What is that specific \nproposal? We went back and found out what it was, and here it is. This \nis the specific proposal of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle for reducing the deficit: A blank page. A blank page.\n\n  There is going to be a lot of hyperbole in the next few days about \nhow this bill doesn't do this or how it doesn't do that, but what this \nbill does is it reduces the deficit by $39 billion over the next 5 \nyears. That cannot be denied. And the one major vote, the one \nopportunity people are going to have in this Senate as a result of the \nhard deficit is going to occur when we have final passage of this \ndeficit reduction bill. We are going to be debating it for 20 hours, \nand then, hopefully, we will go to a vote.\n  I, again, congratulate all the chairmen of all the different \ncommittees who were able to hit this target in what is a very difficult \ntime and a very difficult task.\n  I yield the floor to one of the architects of this bill who did an \nextraordinary job, Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I very much thank Senator Judd Gregg, \nchairman of the powerful Budget Committee, for his leadership and for \ndoing what has not been done in this Senate, it is my understanding, \nsince 1997: We have a budget reconciliation bill that will reduce the \ndeficit by changing programs that are either appropriated or on \nautomatic pilot that tend to never get reviewed as often as they should \nin order to watch the taxpayers' money wisely.\n  Senator Gregg's commitment to fiscal discipline has informed and \ndefined this process, and I am grateful for his efforts.\n  As he just did, I congratulate the chairmen of seven other \nauthorizing committees whose titles of this bill, along with the \nFinance title that I am going to talk about, comprise this giant \nlegislation that we call reconciliation that Senator Gregg successfully \nreported last week.\n\n[[Page S12069]]\n\n  I know that it was not easy for the chairmen of these eight \ncommittees to reach consensus and to move their titles forward. These \nchairmen and the members of their committees have every right to be \nproud of the work they have done achieving savings but also \nimplementing policies that will help American workers.\n  Today, we have saved nearly $40 billion over 5 years--to be more \naccurate, $39.1 billion over 5 years--and that is $4.1 billion more \nthan Congress even directed these committees to do back in April when \nthe budget was adopted. Considering the 8 years since this has been \ndone, this is a significant accomplishment and one of which we ought to \nbe proud.\n  Many of the proposals in my committee's title, as well as the other \ntitles of this bill, have bipartisan support. Some of them have been \nproposed by the administration in its budget which came out last \nFebruary. While I am hopeful that during the debate this week, we will \nbe able to persuade a number of Democrat Members to vote in favor of \nthis bill, I recognize that the budget process is often a partisan \nexercise and that we will be able to count on few, if any, votes from \nthe Democrat side of the aisle.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee made very clear with \nhis chart that was blank, we have not seen a Democrat proposal. Why? \nBecause they do not want to bite the bullet and do what is hard to \nsuggest from their point of view--how to reduce the deficit--unless it \nmight be by raising taxes because often that is their solution, whereas \nI myself have never come to the conclusion that the American public is \nundertaxed. I never have my taxpayers telling me that they are \nundertaxed. The problem of the budget deficit is that Congress \noverspends.\n  In developing my part of this budget reconciliation proposal, I \nattempted to address a number of bipartisan priorities. These efforts \nwere acknowledged by my colleagues during last week's Senate Finance \nCommittee markup, and I want those members of the Finance Committee to \nknow that I appreciate their kind words. Rather than having their kind \nwords, I would rather have had those Democrats vote for this bill \ncoming out of my committee rather than having it come out on an 11-to-9 \npartisan vote.\n  The Finance Committee portion represents nearly a year's worth of \nwork on behalf of members of my committee and the staffs of the \nrespective members, as well as committee staff.\n  The Senate Finance Committee title achieves a net of $10 billion in \nsavings from Medicare and Medicaid by reducing wasteful spending and by \nclosing loopholes. The Finance title also targets resources to \npreserving and improving Medicaid, the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, and Medicare. In particular, the Medicaid provisions \nin the title will also produce additional resources for States in \noperating their Medicaid Programs. In so doing, this bill protects \nMedicaid benefits for the most vulnerable of our society.\n  The Senate Finance Committee title cracks down on Medicaid fraud and \nabuse by encouraging States to aggressively pursue Medicaid fraud by \nimplementing in the respective States, beyond the 13 that have done it, \nState false claims acts, which in comparable legislation at the Federal \nlevel is the single most important tool that U.S. taxpayers have to \nrecover the billions of dollars stolen through fraud every year. In \naddition, my Finance Committee title requires suppliers that do \nbusiness with Medicaid to have a false claims act education program so \nthat those with evidence of fraud against Medicaid know they may pursue \nthese claims on behalf of the Government and help to recover stolen \nfunds. In order to fight Medicaid fraud, the Senate Finance Committee \ntitle dramatically increases resources to fight fraud and abuse in \nMedicaid. This then will protect State and Federal budgets and generate \nsubstantial savings from this investment.\n  My committee's title also achieves savings by helping State Medicaid \nPrograms obtain millions in payments owed by third-party payers each \nyear. It also produces savings by ending drug manufacturers' gaming of \nthe system by closing the authorized generic loophole so that \nappropriate rebates are paid to the States.\n  The Senate Finance Committee title helps preserve services to \nbeneficiaries by ending overpayments to pharmacies, by reforming the \nbroken system used to reimburse pharmacists for prescription drugs, \nwhich is based on the flawed average wholesale price formula, costing \ntaxpayers lots more money than it should. There have been 13 reports in \nthe last 5 years dealing with an average wholesale price formula done \nby the Congressional Budget Office, the Inspector General's Office, and \nfrom the Government Accountability Office, all calling for reforming \nthe Medicaid pharmacy payment formula and ending overpayment for \nprescription drugs. These overpayments have been costing the States, as \nwell as our Federal Government, billions of dollars needlessly.\n  The bill also includes provisions to protect rural pharmacies and \nencourage greater use of cost-saving generic drugs. In addition, my \nportion of this reconciliation bill balances the savings derived from \npharmacy payment reforms with an increase in the rebate paid to State \nMedicaid Programs by drug manufacturers from 15.2 percent to 17 \npercent.\n  On the Medicare side, the Finance title calls for the phaseout of the \nbudget neutral modification to the MedicareAdvantage risk adjuster. \nThis provision will help ensure that the health status risk adjuster \nrequired by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 meets its objective of \nproviding accurate payment to plans based on their enrollees' health. \nThe title also repeals the MedicareAdvantage regional stabilization \nfund.\n  There are concerns about these provisions, and some people have \nargued that we should not touch the MedicareAdvantage Program. In \nresponse, I point out that the phaseout of the risk adjuster was \nannounced three times: first in February in the President's budget; \nsecond, with the 2006 rates; and again in the September CMS factsheet. \nSo plans submitted their bids knowing full well that the phaseout was \ngoing to happen.\n  When we worked on the Medicare Modernization Act--and that was in \n2003--the idea was that if the funds were not needed, then the dollars \nwere to be returned to the U.S. Treasury. We have strong regional \npreferred provider organization participation. Regional preferred \nprovider organizations are in 21 out of the 26 regions into which the \ncountry has been divided. Regional preferred provider organizations \nhave several other safeguards to make sure they are available.\n\n  The base MedicareAdvantage rates have been fixed. There are risk \ncorridors, network adequacy requirements, the essential hospital fund, \nand a moratorium on local PPOs. The title does not affect any of these \nsafeguards, so we feel this money going back to the Federal Treasury \nunder this bill is the right thing to do.\n  The Finance Committee title of this bill also preserves access to \nhealth care for seniors in Medicare by providing a 1-percent payment \nupdate to all providers paid under the Medicare physician fee schedule. \nThis replaces a 4.4-percent payment cut that physicians are scheduled \nto receive in 2006 under the existing formula. So we change that \nformula to make sure that the 4.4-percent cut does not go through. On \ntop of that, there is a small increase for our physicians.\n  The Part B premium is affected due to changes included in the title \nthat affect Part B spending. While some provisions lower Part B \nspending, other provisions increase the spending. However, there is no \neffect on the Part B premium paid by our seniors until the year 2007. \nIt is also important to keep in mind that the Part B premium increase \ndoes not affect low-income beneficiaries. In fact, I worked hard to \nextend the QI Program so that Part B premiums would continue to be \ncovered for these individuals.\n  Avoiding the physician payment cut has strong support in the Senate. \nIn July of this year, 89 Senators from both sides of the aisle sent a \nletter to the White House Office of Management and Budget calling for \nthe removal of Part B drugs from the physician payment formula. This \nchange, which the administration has the authority to make, would \npermit Congress to address the longstanding programs with the Medicare \nformula for reimbursing physicians.\n\n[[Page S12070]]\n\n  Certainly, we are all concerned about any impact on Part B premiums, \nbut this Senate is almost unanimous in its support of addressing this, \nas evidenced by the 89 signatures calling for changes in the formula \nthat were sent to the administration. To be clear about this, the \nchanges in the physician fee called for in that letter would also \nincrease Part B premiums to our senior citizens. It is important that \nwe take steps to maintain access to physician services in the Medicare \nProgram. The benefits in Medicare are not worth much if beneficiaries \ncannot find a doctor when they need one.\n  Another important area addressed by the Senate Finance Committee is \nlong-term care costs. Recognizing that long-term care costs account for \nsignificant spending in the Medicaid Program, this bill makes key \nprovisions in long-term care for seniors and the disabled. Consistent \nwith a proposal put forth by President Bush, this bill includes a \n``money follows the person'' rebalancing demonstration program. This \nprogram would direct grants to States to increase use of home- and \ncommunity-based services rather than institutional care, and it would \neliminate barriers that prevent or restrict the flexible use of \nMedicaid funds so that individuals may receive support for long-term \nservices in a setting of their choice. This is empowering people.\n  The title also provides new options for private coverage of long-term \ncare through the long-term care partnerships and promotes the \navailability of programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly in rural \nareas.\n  The Finance Committee title also addresses a number of Medicare \npriorities while also achieving savings in other areas of Medicare. To \nbegin, being mindful of the unique needs of rural residents and the \nfacilities that serve them, the title protects access to Medicare \nservices for rural beneficiaries.\n  First, the title would extend the hold-harmless provisions for the \nsmall rural hospitals and sole community hospitals from implementation \nof the hospital outpatient prospective payment system.\n  Second, it would expand coverage of additional preventive benefits \nunder the Federal qualified health centers.\n  Third, it would extend the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program, which \nprovides financial protections to rural hospitals with less than 100 \nbeds that have greater than 60 percent of their patients coming from \nMedicare.\n  Another issue I suspect we will hear a good deal about during this \ndebate over the next few days is the impact that Hurricane Katrina had \nwhen it devastated hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans.\n  The title would provide for a much needed downpayment to those States \nthat have suffered as a result of Hurricane Katrina. I am committed to \nensuring that the families who have suffered so greatly as a result of \nthis national tragedy receive the services they need to rebuild their \nlives, and the States which have been affected are made whole.\n  The Finance Committee title of this bill also provides funding to \nstrengthen and improve the Medicaid and State Children's Health \nInsurance Program. As my colleagues know, as many as 23 States are \nprojected to experience shortfalls in the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram over the next 2 years. The national total of these State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program shortfalls is near $1 billion. The \nSenate Finance Committee title includes temporary provisions that will \nstem these State shortfalls and ensure that States are not forced to \ncurtail or end their Children's Health Insurance Program coverage for \nvulnerable low-income children.\n  In order to continue to improve the Medicaid and Children's Health \nInsurance Programs, the Senate Finance Committee title in this \nreconciliation bill also includes outreach and enrollment efforts so \nthat children eligible for public health assistance receive that \nassistance.\n  This legislation also addresses a fundamental flaw in our current \nMedicare payment system. Right now, Medicare payment policies do not \nencourage high-quality care. In other words, doctors get the same \nreimbursement and hospitals get the same reimbursement whether they are \ndoing the highest quality of care or whether they do not care, and \npeople are always going back into the hospital because the job is not \ndone right the first time. So we have come to the conclusion that we \nneed to reward quality and we need to provide incentives to invest more \nin health care information technology and other efforts that will \nimprove health care quality.\n  This reconciliation bill does just that. This bill implements \nrecommendations from the Institute of Medicine and also from the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission. These provisions are based on the \nbipartisan Medicare Value Purchasing Act, which is S. 1356, introduced \nby me and my Democratic colleague, the leader on the other side of the \naisle of the committee, Senator Baucus of Montana. The legislation \ncreates quality payments under Medicare for physicians and other \nproviders, including hospitals, health plans, skilled nursing \nfacilities, home health organizations, and end stage renal disease \nfacilities.\n  Finally, the Senate Finance Committee title includes the Family \nOpportunity Act. The Family Opportunity Act was motivated by the \ncircumstances of individual families--the Melissa Arnold family of Iowa \nand the Dylan Lee James family. You could say they are representative \nof hundreds of thousands of families. Both are families we use as an \nexample of those who relied on Medicaid health services for their \nchildren with disabilities, and both families ended up risking \neligibility for Medicaid as a result of financial eligibility rules \nthat continue to create disincentives for parents to work and stay \nworking and even improve their employment opportunities.\n  Acute need persists for the Family Opportunity Act. It is just as \nimportant today as it was over the past several years that I have been \nfighting to get the Family Opportunity Act law. I have heard from a \nnumber of families in Iowa and across the country, speaking of the \nimperative to enact the Family Opportunity Act. They tell me about \ntheir son or daughter or grandchild, and how much they love their child \nor grandchild and how important it is to tell their story. They tell \nabout the illness or disability that their families have been \nstruggling with for years.\n  Then they describe how dad and mom could comfortably support their \nfamily but must remain poor, even unemployed, in order that their child \nreceive the health care coverage they need. These parents want to work \nand provide for their families but must put the health care of their \nchild first.\n  If we are able to successfully pass the legislation--we have been \nable to pass this legislation in the Senate, but it did not get through \nthe House of Representatives. If we are successful again, we will \nachieve important savings that help put our fiscal house in order as \nwell as preserve benefits and ultimately expand access through the \nFamily Opportunity Act for families in Iowa and across the Nation.\n  The Finance Committee title of this bill achieves significant savings \nin Medicare and Medicaid by reducing wasteful spending and closing \nloopholes. It then directs much of these savings to make improvements \nin these programs that expand access to health care services, protect \nhealth care coverage for kids, and protect access to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  But the bottom line is more than $10 billion in savings in existing \nprograms or additional money being recouped from fraud or money coming \nin from fees. The bottom line to the Federal deficit is $10 billion.\n  I have two summaries of the Finance Committee title. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Summary of Title VI\n\n       Title VI of the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation \n     Act of 2005 achieves significant budget savings, slashes \n     wasteful spending, and targets resources to preserve program \n     integrity, improve access to health care, and preserve and \n     protect Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\n                          spending reductions\n\n                                medicaid\n\n                   prescription drug payment reforms\n\n       Redefines average manufacturer price (AMP) to reflect \n     discounts and rebates available to retail pharmacies and then \n     uses that definition for payments to pharmacies and for the \n     calculation of the best price.\n\n[[Page S12071]]\n\n       Defines weighted average manufacturer price (WAMP) as the \n     basis of a new payment system for these drugs and for a new \n     federal upper limit for multiple source drugs.\n       Clarifies nominal price definition to ensure that sales \n     made at a nominal price are appropriately included in AMP \n     calculations.\n       Creates a new federal upper limit for payments to states \n     for covered drugs that goes into effect January 1, 2007 (with \n     a later transition for states without '06 legislative \n     sessions) of AMP+5% for single source drugs and WAMP-15% for \n     multi-source drugs.\n       Includes language that requires states to provide \n     appropriate dispensing fees to pharmacists and sets factors \n     upon which they should be based.\n       Creates an interim payment policy for 2006 capping the \n     current federal upper limit at 125% of the July 1, 2005 AWP, \n     WAC, or direct price levels.\n       -$4.595 billion / 5 years\n\n\n         reform of medicaid asset transfer rules and loopholes\n\n       Closes loopholes in current Medicaid law concerning \n     transfer of assets to limit the circumstances under which \n     persons may intentionally shelter assets in order to qualify \n     for Medicaid.\n       This section includes the following provisions to close \n     other loopholes that exist in current law:\n       Requires states to apply partial month penalties.\n       Requires states to accumulate transfers in computing the \n     period of ineligibility.\n       Requires that annuities are treated the same as trusts \n     under current law.\n       Requires that certain notes and loans are considered \n     countable.\n       Requires private annuities be based on actuarial life \n     expectancy.\n       Limits transfers to purchase life estates.\n       States would be required to provide a notice of the undue \n     hardship waiver process to any individual applying for \n     Medicaid who would be subject to a penalty period so they may \n     request a waiver of the penalty period.\n       States would be required to provide for a timely process \n     for determining whether an undue hardship waiver will be \n     granted, and a process for appeal of an adverse \n     determination.\n       -$335 million / 5 years\n\n\n                         fraud, waste and abuse\n\n       Enhancing third party recovery. The section creates useful \n     new tools for existing third party recovery programs: (1) \n     clarifies that PBMs must respond to claims; (2) clarifies \n     that self-insured plans must turn over eligibility data; and \n     (3) clarifies that states can recover claims for up to three \n     years from the date of service.\n       Limitation on use of contingent fee arrangements. The \n     section gives the Secretary authority to implement standards \n     for states in their use of contingent fee contracts.\n       State False Claims Act. Creates an incentive for states to \n     implement state False Claims Acts by providing them with an \n     enhanced FMAP for any settlements reached through a state \n     False Claims Act.\n       False Claims Act employee education program as a condition \n     of participation. Requires employers that do more than $1M \n     business with Medicaid to have a False Claims Act education \n     program for their employees.\n       Prohibition on payments to States for prescriptions drug \n     claims that have already been submitted and paid. This \n     section clarifies in statute that pharmacists cannot bill \n     Medicaid for drugs that have been paid for previously and \n     restocked.\n       -$512 million / 5 years\n\n\n                      State Financing of Medicaid\n\n                        MCO Provider Tax Reform\n\n       This provision would treat managed care organizations the \n     same as other providers for purposes of applying current law \n     on provider taxes. This section permits states that have a \n     Medicaid-only managed care provider tax to keep it.\n       -$75 million / 5 years\n\n\n                    Targeted Case Management Reforms\n\n       The Targeted Case Management provision clarifies the \n     definition of case management services. The provision \n     specifies that ``case management services'' include: \n     assessment activities, the development of a specific care \n     plan, referral and related activities to help an individual \n     obtain needed medical, social educational and other services, \n     monitoring and follow up activities.\n       Further clarifies that ``case management services'' do not \n     include the direct delivery of medical, educational, social \n     or other services, such as: research gathering, assessing \n     adoption placements, recruiting or interviewing potential \n     foster care parents, serving legal papers, homes \n     investigations, and transportation.\n       -$760 million / 5 years\n\n\n                   Drug Rebate and Related Provisions\n\n                   Close Authorized Generics Loophole\n\n       Improved regulation of authorized generic drugs.

This policy would equalize the SNF bad \n     debt payment rate making it consistent with the bad debt \n     payment rate for hospitals.\n       -$250 million / 5 years\n\n\n Prohibit Physician Self-Referrals to Physician-Owned Limited Service \n                               Hospitals\n\n       Prohibits new physician-owned limited service hospitals \n     from having any ownership or investment interest by \n     physicians who refer Medicare or Medicaid patients to the \n     hospital. Confirms that the ``whole hospital'' exception \n     would not apply to any new physician-owned limited service \n     hospital effective June 8, 2005.\n       Physicians are generally prohibited from referring Medicare \n     and Medicaid patients to facilities in which they have a \n     financial interest, unless they have an ownership or \n     investment interest in the whole hospital and not merely a \n     subdivision of the hospital.\n       In 2003, Congress established that the ``whole hospital'' \n     exception would not extend to physician-owned limited service \n     hospitals (hospitals that are primarily engaged in cardiac, \n     orthopedics or surgical care) for an 18-month period.\n       Allows existing physician-owned limited service hospitals \n     to continue operation with certain restrictions.\n       -$22 million / 5 years\n\n\n                                 PART B\n\n                DME Payment and Maintenance Fee Reforms\n\n       Part B of Medicare pays for certain pieces of durable \n     medical equipment (DME) under a capped rental method. \n     Medicare currently pays 120% of the purchase price over 15 \n     months.\n       Suppliers can bill Medicare for maintenance and servicing \n     (usually 10% of the purchase price) 6 months after the 15 \n     month rental period ends and once every 6 months thereafter. \n     Suppliers are allowed to bill even if maintenance is not \n     provided.\n       This provision would require DME rentals to be purchased \n     after the 13th month, which would eliminate payments for 2 \n     months and eliminate payments for maintenance and servicing \n     unless otherwise necessary.\n       This would reduce the price Medicare pays suppliers from \n     120% to 105% of the purchase pnce.\n       -$910 million / 5 years\n\n\n                                 Part C\n\n       Eliminate Budget-Neutrality Modification to Risk Adjusted \n     Payments to Medicare Advantage Plans\n       This provision would codify the Administration's proposed \n     phase-out of its budget neutral modification that undermines \n     the Medicare Advantage risk-adjusted payment system.\n       Permits true comparisons based on health status of \n     beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage to beneficiaries \n     enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare.\n       Ensures that underlying BBA-mandated health status based \n     risk adjusted payment system will produce accurate payments \n     for a beneficiary with a particular health status who enrolls \n     in Medicare Advantage.\n       This provision is consistent with a June 2005 MedPAC \n     recommendation.\n       -$6.460 billion / 5 years\n\n\n      Eliminate Regional Medicare Advantage PPO Stabilization Fund\n\n       Repeals fund established to promote plan entry and \n     retention in Medicare Advantage program.\n       In an August 2005 Fact Sheet on the Medicare Advantage \n     program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     indicated that the program has ``stabilized and flourished.''\n       As of January 1, 2006, regional Medicare Advantage plans \n     will be available in 21 out of the 26 Medicare Advantage \n     regions, indicating that plans are experiencing fewer than \n     anticipated challenges in entering regions.\n       Does not affect any other provisions to promote regional \n     PPOs such as risk-corridors, local PPO moratorium, essential \n     hospital fund, and network requirements.\n       This provision is consistent with a June 2005 MedPAC \n     recommendation.\n       -$5.440 billion / 5 years\n\n\n                             OTHER MEDICARE\n\n                          Pay for Performance\n\n       Requires the Secretary of Health and Human

Principles for Medicare value-based purchasing include:\n       Building upon existing system and involving all relevant \n     stakeholders.\n       A two-phased implementation that first ties Medicare \n     reimbursement updates to the reporting of quality measures, \n     and then creates a quality pool to reward providers for \n     meeting certain thresholds of quality improvement and

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Ruby Jubilee of \nthe Crisis Call Center in Reno, NV. For 40 years, volunteers have \nprovided intervention, prevention, referral, and education services to \nthe people of Nevada. The center has been a lifeline for countless \nindividuals. While its volunteers know how valuable their efforts are, \nwe will never know how much pain they have prevented or the full extent \nof the healing they have promoted.\n  The Crisis Call Center was founded in 1966 at the University of \nNevada, Reno to combat the high rate of suicide. However, its scope \ngrew over time. Now an independent nonprofit, the Crisis Call Center \noffers support to all individuals in crisis, including victims of \nsexual assault and child and elder abuse and neglect. It is still the \nleading community organization working to end suicide in Reno.\n  Additionally, the Crisis Call Center runs outreach projects for youth \nand seniors, groups that are at high risk for depression and suicide. I \nam particularly impressed by The Senior Connection, a specialized \nhotline to provide advocacy, support, and education to seniors. \nUniquely, the services are provided by seniors for seniors.\n  The Crisis Call Center is one of the oldest continuously operating \ncrisis centers in the country. It has provided a model for the many \nthat followed and its innovative approaches ensure that it will be a \nleader for many years to come. I hope that you will join me in \ncelebrating this milestone and in looking forward to the important work \nthe Crisis Call Center will perform in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12073-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL OF S. 1803\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious \nconcern about and opposition to the Senate budget reconciliation \npackage.\n\n[[Page S12074]]\n\n  The bill we are considering today contains harmful program cuts that \nwould fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable in our society. \nAnd though its sponsors claim it is fiscally responsible, it is part of \na budget reconciliation package that adds to the deficit rather than \nreducing it.\n  This legislation cuts funding for health care provided through the \nMedicaid Program, which provides health insurance to poor children, \npregnant women, and elderly. My colleagues on the other side of the \naisle argue that we must cut waste and fraud in the Medicaid Program. I \nagree with that. But, what I don't agree with is taking money out of \nthis critical safety net program--without which millions of Americans \nwould be uninsured--and using that money to pay for tax cuts for people \nwith high incomes. This amounts to a direct transfer of benefits that \njust doesn't make any sense.\n  In addition, much of the reduction in Medicaid spending comes not \nfrom reducing costs but from shifting them to States. The Federal \nGovernment can make its books look a little prettier, but one way or \nthe other, taxpayers are still paying the same bill. Some of the cuts \nalso come from reducing important services. For example, under this \nbill, my home State of New Jersey would lose critical Federal resources \nthat it relies on to provide health insurance to parents of children \nenrolled in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. And, \nthe State would be prohibited from using any SCHIP funding to expand \ncoverage to other adult populations. In fact, my State has estimated \nthat it will lose $44.6 million in Federal SCHIP funding. As usual, the \nmost vulnerable in our society will feel the most pain from these cuts, \nwhile reaping the least benefit from the associated tax breaks.\n  The reconciliation bill also includes authorization for oil drilling \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which I strongly oppose. It is \nsimply unacceptable that the majority is using the protection of \ndeficit-reduction procedural rules to enact controversial, \nenvironmentally damaging policy. In fact, the language opening the \ncoastal plain does not even afford ANWR the same environmental \nprotections afforded to every other wildlife refuge or public land that \nis currently open to oil and gas development.\n  The cost to our environment is too great to bear and will not improve \nour energy independence. Drilling in ANWR, by nearly all credible \npredictions, is expected to yield only marginal amounts of oil that \nwill have little or no effect to reduce our Nation's dependence of \nforeign oil.\n  Adding insult to injury, not one cent of the savings achieved from \nthe cuts in this legislation will be going towards reducing the \ndeficit. Instead, they will be used to pay for barely half the cost of \nthe package of tax breaks that will be considered next in the \nreconciliation process. So it would be wrong to pat ourselves on the \nback and misrepresent today's legislation as ``fiscally responsible'' \nbecause that only tells part of the story.\n  Our Nation faces serious challenges right now, with the war in Iraq, \nthe war on terror, and the need to rebuild the gulf coast region \ndevastated by Hurricane Katrina. We must keep our economy strong by \nkeeping our workforce competitive and investing in our human and \nphysical capital. Now is not the time to be cutting important benefits \nfor those in need.\n  If we intend to seriously confront these issues, we need to stop with \nthe irresponsible fiscal policies that have driven us deep into \ndeficit. We need to stop with the wasteful tax cut giveaways. And we \nneed to stop forcing the most vulnerable members of our society to pay \nfor the costs of our irresponsibility.\n  This legislation before us today accomplishes none of these goals, \nand so I cannot support it. Mr. President, we can do better than this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12074-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

As a husband of a two-time breast cancer survivor, I \nam deeply committed to supporting this campaign and to finding a cure \nfor this awful disease.\n  I understand that finding out that a loved one has breast cancer is \nfrightening news and one of the most difficult experiences any family \ncan encounter. Unfortunately, far too many families face these \nchallenges each year. In fact, according to the American Cancer \nSociety, one in three women is diagnosed with breast cancer. Yet \ninitiatives, such as the National Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, are \nworking to help to decrease these numbers by educating women about the \nimportance of preventive efforts such as self-exams and mammograms.\n  Even though we have the most advanced medical technologies and \nexperts in the world, we have continued to face increases in the \nprevalence of breast cancer in recent years. In fact, research has \nshown that breast cancer rates have increased progressively since 1998. \nThough the national rate of breast cancer mortality has fallen since \n2002, still approximately 24 percent of South Dakota women diagnosed \nwith breast cancer do not survive.\n  One of the best ways to decrease the breast cancer mortality rate is \nthrough early detection and treatment, which is the fundamental goal of \nthe National Breast Cancer Awareness campaign. Recognizing this goal, \neach year my wife Barbara and I sponsor a mammogram van at the South \nDakota State Fair. This mammogram van, provided by a local health care \nfacility, offers two days of free mammograms for uninsured, low-income \nwomen. We are proud to sponsor such an important service. As we learned \nwith Barbara's case, early detection and treatment is key in beating \nthis disease and that is why women must have access to mammogram exams.\n  Because of the work of the American Cancer Society, scientists, \nresearchers, and the National Breast Cancer Awareness Month campaign, I \nlook forward to the future when women and families do not have to hear \nthe words ``breast cancer.'' And until that day comes, I will continue \nto show my support for the goals of this critical campaign for women's \nhealth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12074-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor SFC (Ret.) \nFelipe Trujillo Roybal and to recognize his lifelong service to this \ncountry. His dedication and commitment to this country is to be \ncommended.\n  Mr. Roybal served 33 years in the U.S. Army and is a veteran of \nVietnam, The Korean war and World War II. Mr. Roybal will be honored \nfor his heroic service to our Nation when his name is registered in the \nNational World War II Memorial.\n  Mr. Roybal joined the Army in 1937 and served in World War II as a \nparatrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. During World War II he \nparticipated in the Normandy drop and received a Purple Heart for \nbravery, Parachute Wings, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Merit \nAward, and the European Command Badge. He then served in the Korean war \nand received his second Purple Heart after becoming a prisoner of war, \nlater escaping. He enlisted his services as a Green Beret in the \nSpecial Forces Division in the Vietnam war. Mr. Roybal was assigned to \ncritical defense duty due to his elite training in the Special Forces \nand was praised for his immense dedication to our country.\n  Mr. Roybal and his wife, Bertha Morales, are native New Mexicans and \nhave been married for 57 years. They are the proud parents of three \ndaughters and the grandparents of two grandsons. All who have had the \nopportunity to know them have been touched by their kindness and \ngenerosity. So today it is with great admiration that I pay tribute to \nMr. Roybal\n\n[[Page S12075]]\n\nand his courageous service to this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12075-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOEL STUBBLEFIELD\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlife of Joel R. Stubblefield, president and chancellor of the \nUniversity of Arkansas at Fort Smith. For over 22 years, Joel made \nimmeasurable contributions to education in Arkansas, serving the \nstudents and citizens of Fort Smith with passion and dedication.\n  Following his studies at Ouachita Baptist University and Syracuse \nUniversity and his military training at the Army Command and General \nStaff College, Joel dedicated his life to improving education \nopportunities for others. He strengthened programs and increased \nfaculty at UA Fort Smith and established the Western Arkansas Technical \nCenter for high school students who sought to take college courses to \nget ahead.\n  With his vision and leadership, Joel elevated UA Fort Smith from a 2-\nyear to a 4-year institution. He increased enrollment by more than 100 \npercent, while simultaneously improving the quality of the curriculum \ndramatically. As president and chancellor, Joel raised nearly $60 \nmillion in private donations for new buildings, equipment, and \nscholarships. Yet as willing as Joel was to raise money for the school, \nhe was just as eager to donate his own funds. Joel was known to use \npersonal resources to pay students' tuition and he refused a salary \nincrease for 5 years because he was unable to raise faculty salaries. \nJoel once even bought a bicycle for a student who did not have \ntransportation.\n  Earlier this summer, Joel shared with me his latest goals for higher \neducation in northwest Arkansas. He loved the University of Arkansas at \nFort Smith and dedicated himself fully to its continued improvement. We \ncan honor Joel's memory by applying the same commitment and generosity \ntoward improving educational opportunities for Arkansas \nstudents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12075-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE WOMEN OF VFW AUXILIARY UNIT NO. 60\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary Unit No. 60 from Humboldt, SD, \nfor their many years of devoted service to the Humboldt community.\n  In late November of 1929, the Humboldt VFW Auxiliary No. 60 began \nwith only 10 members. Seventy-six years later, Unit No. 60 boasts 68 \ndevoted and patriotic members, all from the Humboldt community and \nsurrounding areas.\n  Each year, Unit No. 60 participates in numerous community activities. \nIn addition to volunteering at the Sioux Falls VA hospital and donating \nmoney for personal care items, coffee, and other products on the VA \nwish list, the women of Unit No. 60 also help coordinate Bingo Night, \nthe VA Halloween party, and a variety of Christmas activities. During \nthe holiday season, these caring and patriotic ladies also distribute \ngifts while visiting shut-ins and veterans residing in nursing homes. \nEach December, they send stamps to community members serving in the \nmilitary, and also buy postage for local groups wishing to send care \npackages to soldiers overseas. Additionally, during Scholarship Week, \nheld every November at the West Central School District, these \naltruistic women bring apples to all the teachers, aids, janitors, \nmembers of the kitchen staff, and administration.\n  For the past 14 years, members of the Humboldt VFW have been fixtures \nat the annual Threshing Bee held every August. For 3 days, they prepare \nbreakfast and sell their famous homemade pies from their familiar \ncanvas tent. In turn, funds they raise support community projects. This \nyear, Unit No. 60 graciously donated to numerous local charities and \norganizations, namely: West Central Future Farmers of America, \nCommunity Club Fund, Volunteer Firemen, Volunteer Ambulance, Buddy \nWalk, Special Olympics, and Creative Arts for Veterans, in addition to \npurchasing dictionaries that were distributed to third-grade students \nat West Central Elementary.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars Auxiliary Unit No. 60 for their outstanding \nand compassionate service. Their commitment to our Nation's veterans \nand to furthering and enhancing the education of elementary school \nstudents is admirable. I strongly commend their years of hard work and \ndedication, and I am very pleased that their substantial efforts are \nbeing publicly honored and celebrated. It is with great honor that I \nshare their impressive commitment to civic duty with my \ncolleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12075-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI, ON \n                          ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \nto celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Associated Students of the \nUniversity of Missouri.\n  Recognizing the need to establish a means by which students could \nbecome involved and impact the political process, the Associated \nStudents of the University of Missouri, ASUM, began in June of 1975. \nWhile their first chapter opened in Columbia, ASUM has grown and \nextended to include student representatives from every branch of the \nUniversity of Missouri system.\n  As the student voice in State and Federal government, ASUM works \ndiligently to encourage the student body to participate in the \npolitical process. Through their student advocacy, ASUM has achieved \nmany accomplishments over the last 30 years including the establishment \nof the Bright Flight Scholarship Program, the appointment of a student \nrepresentative to the Missouri Board of Curators, sales tax exemptions \non textbooks, and loan forgiveness programs for teachers and medical/\nveterinary doctors who serve in high-need areas of Missouri. It has \nbeen my pleasure to work with the ASUM specifically on the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  I congratulate the Associated Students of the University of Missouri \non their first 30 years of political advocacy for students and look \nforward to working with them for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/31/senate-section/article/S12075-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 420.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain real property in the Dixie National Forest in the State of \nUtah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today along with my cosponsors \nSenators Bennett, Reid, and Ensign to introduce a very simple piece of \nlegislation. The bill would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to \nconvey, at fair market value, 112 acres of property in the Dixie \nNational Forest to Mr. Kirk Harrison. Let me explain why this \nlegislation is necessary.\n  Mr. Harrison's family settled in southern Utah's Pinto Valley in \n1860. The family was among the first to locate to the area. The \nHarrison family established their property boundaries by constructing \nfences that are still standing today. The family cleared, irrigated, \nand settled the property in question and continued to plant and harvest \ncrops, raise livestock, maintain fences, and otherwise work the land \nfor more than 150 years. During that time, the family exercised \nunrestricted use, relying on those boundaries established in 1860.\n  In 1885, the Harrison family applied for and was granted a patent to \nthose lands. Subsequent surveys in 1881 and 1905 found no discrepancies \nbetween the boundaries asserted by the Harrison family and the actual \nboundaries of the adjacent Forest Service lands.\n  It was not until 1984, when the Forest Service employed an \nindependent firm to perform a survey, did any inconsistency arise. The \n1984 survey found that the land occupied by the Harrison family was in \nviolation of the boundary established in the 1885 patent.\n  The 1984 survey was flawed for two principal reasons: First, a rock \nsurvey monument used in the 1881 survey is 37 feet away from a \ndifferent rock monument used in the 1905 survey, creating significant \nconfusion. Neither of these monuments could be located or used during \nthe 1984 survey. Next, the 1984 surveyors did not accept an historic \n``rock mound'' monument, despite the fact that other surveyors had.\n  The Harrison family has used this land for nearly 150 years. Mr. \nHarrison wants nothing more than to be able to continue to use the land \nthat his family settled and has used for so long. While Mr. Harrison \nhas worked to resolve this issue with the Forest Service for nearly 15 \nyears, the parties have not been able to agree upon a viable solution. \nThis legislation offers a fair, commonsense answer to the problem.\n  The bill would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to sell Mr. \nHarrison 112 acres at fair market value. This represents slightly more \nland than the Harrison family's original property to satisfy the Forest \nService's requirement that boundaries be uniform. The Forest Service \nstipulates that its national forest boundaries must be straight and \nmanageable, and the purchase of additional acreage will fulfill that \nrequirement. The bill also would ensure that the Secretary uses the \nproceeds from the sale of the land to purchase other acreage for the \nDixie National Forest. In my view, this legislation is the easiest and \nmost effective way to resolve this longstanding dispute.\n  I am aware that some concerns have been raised about this bill in the \npast. For example, some have expressed concerns that this legislation \nwould restrict sportsmen's access to the Dixie National Forest, prevent \nlandowners from obtaining water, and allow for the subdivision of the \nland. However, since those concerns were raised, the plan has been \ncleared by the Washington County Commission, the State hunter \ninterests, and the majority of landowners in the Pinto Valley. Only \nafter receiving assurances that these groups did not oppose this \nlegislation did I decided to move forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2345.
