Mr. President, pending before the Senate is a bill that \nwill allow us to drill in areas of the Gulf of Mexico that currently \nare not being explored for oil and gas. There is some controversy \nattached to this proposal--whether this is an environmentally sound \ndecision to go into these areas. The fact is in many parts of the Gulf \nof Mexico there is currently exploration and drilling for oil and gas, \nso it is not the same as the debate on the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge in Alaska, where the administration was proposing that we drill \nin areas that have been protected for over half a century.\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\nThis area of the world and off the coast of the United States has been \nexplored for quite some period of time, and oil and gas have been \nbrought out of it.\n  It is going to be an interesting debate and a legitimate debate over \nwhether this is the appropriate amount of exploration and whether it is \nenvironmentally responsible to do it in this fashion. But we should \nnever believe that this debate is about creating America's energy \npolicy. Sadly, America today--with gasoline prices going through the \nroof, with no certainty about our future when it comes to energy--does \nnot have a national energy policy.\n  This administration, for 6 years now, has had an opportunity to come \nforward with a proposal that would move America away from dependence on \nforeign oil, but the administration has not done so. The only proposals \nwe have received from them relate to very isolated, narrow issues. One \nof them I referred to earlier, whether the United States should now \nstart drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  The House and the Senate have rejected that idea on a bipartisan \nbasis. Their belief, which I share, is that we have reached a rather \ndesperate moment in American history if the only way we can look \nforward in terms of energy self-sufficiency is to start drilling in \nsome of the most environmentally sensitive places in America. That is \nwhy I have opposed drilling in ANWR in Alaska. That is why it has been \ndefeated. The majority has felt this is not the way we should go.\n  This is a different issue. This is about drilling in the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  We will debate it this week and vote on it next week. But we should \nnot believe that passage of this bill is the creation of a national \nenergy policy. The fact is if we pass this bill next week, it will have \nliterally no impact on gasoline prices today and no impact on our \ndependence on foreign oil. If we are going to address that, we have to \ndo it in a larger context. On the Democratic side of the Senate, we \nhave proposed a bill that will move us forward, looking at the national \nenergy picture and moving us toward breaking our dependence on foreign \nsources of energy in the future. That is important for us to do.\n  Today we are so dependent on foreign sources of oil that we are at \nthe mercy of the OPEC cartel, and at the mercy of the major producers \nwe are doing business with in countries around the world buying their \noil and gas--and these countries are virtually our sworn enemies. There \nare many countries in the world that we send billions of dollars to as \nwe buy their oil and gas that turn around and use the money we send \nagainst us in the war on terrorism. That is as horrifying as I can \nthink of at the moment, that we would send American dollars to these \ncountries to subsidize terrorist activities. Yet it is happening \nbecause we are so dependent on these foreign sources.\n  What can we do? What should we do? First, we should look at the \nobvious. Sixty percent of all the oil we bring into the United States \nof America is used for our cars and trucks. All of us are burning that \noil as we drive around America. Sadly, the vehicles we drive in are \nless fuel efficient and get less fuel economy every single year. The \nvehicles are heavier, less fuel efficient, and we burn more gallons of \ngasoline each year to travel the same number of miles we went last \nyear. I am speaking on average. There are some people who have fuel-\nefficient vehicles, but by and large, when you look at cars and trucks \nin America, that is the story. It doesn't have to be this way.\n  In 1975, we faced long lines at gasoline stations with the prospect \nthat OPEC was going to cut off oil to the United States, and our \nGovernment made a decision that the first thing we needed to do was to \nhave more fuel-efficient cars and trucks. At that moment in time, the \naverage fuel efficiency of the fleets across America was about 14 miles \na gallon. The Government mandated that over the next 10 years \nmanufacturers had to have an average fleet fuel economy of cars that \nwould virtually double to almost 28 miles a gallon in 10 years. The \nmanufacturers of cars and trucks--particularly those in the United \nStates--said it was an impossible goal which we could never reach, and \nthat if we did, it would compromise the safety of the cars we would \ndrive and would invite importation of automobiles into the United \nStates. We did it anyway. We imposed the standard to increase fuel \nefficiency in America. Between 1975 and 1985 the average fuel economy \nof cars in America went from 14 miles a gallon to 27.5 miles a gallon. \nWe achieved our goal. We did it without all of the terrible outcomes \nthe opponents had suggested.\n  What has happened in the 21 years since then? What has happened since \n1985 when we reached an average of about 28 miles a gallon for cars in \nAmerica? Sadly, the fuel efficiency of cars in America has gone down \nprogressively. Now it is around 22 miles a gallon, or 21 miles a \ngallon, meaning we are driving less fuel-efficient cars today than we \nwere 21 years ago. And, of course, there was the truck loophole. We \nsaid when it came to fuel economy we would make an exemption for \ntrucks. Someone invented the concept of a sports utility vehicle, SUV, \nand we called it a truck. It escaped the requirements of fuel \nefficiency. We all know those SUVs we are glutting the used car lots in \nAmerica with, have some of the worst fuel efficiency of any vehicles we \ndrive. They have helped to drive down our efficiency in America and \ndriven up our dependence on imported oil.\n  A national energy policy has to include more fuel efficiency and fuel \neconomy of cars and trucks we drive--and it can do it.\n  Recently, my wife and I made a decision about a car. We wanted to buy \nAmerican and we wanted a hybrid. So we bought a Ford Escape hybrid. It \nis a good car, clean burning. We get about 28 miles a gallon, which is \ngood but not great. I think we can do a lot better. Many of the cars \nthat are coming in from overseas manufacturers get much better mileage. \nThe people who make cars in America tell us there is no appetite for \nfuel-efficient cars in the United States. How wrong can they be? Toyota \nis about to come out with a Camry with a hybrid engine which will get \nbetter fuel mileage than most cars in the United States, and there is a \n10-month waiting list to buy their cars. It tells me there is an \nappetite for obvious reasons. People understand gasoline is extremely \nexpensive. If they can reduce their consumption of gasoline, they not \nonly save money, but I think they know intuitively it is a good thing. \nIt reduces the pollution and the greenhouse emissions.\n  Our failure to have a national energy policy leaves us in a position \nwhere we have foreign automobile manufacturers making fuel-efficient \ncars and hybrid cars and bringing them into the United States and \nselling them to American consumers who are anxious to buy their \nproducts.\n\n  The obvious question is, Why don't we have the leadership in \nWashington on a bipartisan basis that would create standards for fuel \nefficiency and fuel economy that would move the United States in the \nright direction on national energy policy? That is an important \nquestion. It is not addressed by this bill.\n  If we are talking about a national energy policy, this bill is not a \nnational energy policy. There are other things which we should do as \nwell. We have a situation in the United States where the oil companies \nare making outrageous profits. You can always tell when they have \nstepped over the line because when you open the morning paper, there \nwill be a full-page ad where the major oil companies are explaining \nthat they warrant that profit. Really?\n  ExxonMobil's second quarter profit jumped to the second highest level \nfor any company in the history of the United States. ExxonMobil said \ntoday that it earned $10.36 billion in the second quarter, the second \nlargest quarterly profit ever recorded by a publicly traded U.S. \ncompany. The earnings figures were 36 percent above the profit it \nreported 1 year ago. High oil prices, according to this Associated \nPress story, helped boost the company's revenue by 12 percent to a \nlevel just short of a quarterly record.\n  Think of this when you go to fill up at the gas pump. You reach into \nyour pocket, pull out your wallet or your purse and pull out the credit \ncard to pay for the gasoline, and the money that is coming right out of \nyour checking account is going to record profits of the oil companies \nacross America.\n  What has been done in Washington to try to contain these profits, to \ntry to\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nsay that the oil companies are going too far by creating burdens and \nhandicaps on individuals and families and businesses across America? \nThe answer is nothing. Nothing has happened informally. The President \nhas not called in the leaders of these oil companies and said it is not \nhealthy for America's economy for you to be taking so much money out of \nthis economy, driving up inflation, making the cost of business go up \nso that they have to lay off employees and can't expand if they would \nlike to, and making the burdens for families who have to drive on a \nregular basis unbearable. The President has not done this. Other \nPresidents in history have. This President refuses to.\n  When it comes to the more formal means of turning to those Federal \nagencies that have the power over these oil companies, they have been \nvirtually silent as Americans and consumers are fuming over what is \nhappening at their gas stations.\n  I would say to my colleagues in Congress when they go home over this \nAugust recess to take some time and talk to the people they represent. \nGasoline prices, frankly, are one of the biggest issues that trouble \nthe people across America.\n  ExxonMobil's report of earnings comes a day after ConocoPhillips said \nit earned more than $5 billion in the quarter at a time when many \ndrivers in the United States are paying $3 a gallon for gas--and more. \nExxonMobil, the world's largest oil company by market cap, said \nearnings amounted to $1.72 a share in the April-June quarter compared \nwith the profit of $7.64 billion or $1.20 a share a year ago. These \nresults top even Wall Street's expectations. The oil companies are \nraking in this money at the expense of consumers and businesses across \nAmerica.\n  If we want a healthy business climate in this country, we cannot \nallow one industry--the oil industry--to make outrageous profits at the \nexpense of other businesses as well as the families and individuals \nacross America.\n  I think what we have before us is a bill that is worthy of debate \nabout drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. It is something we will debate, \nbut we shouldn't believe at the end of the day, even if it is passes, \nthat we have addressed the most serious challenge facing America. We \nstill need a national energy policy.\n  We should remember two numbers as we engage in this debate. The \nnumbers are 3 and 25. If you look at all of the energy available in the \nworld, the United States has access in the continental United States \nand offshore to 3 percent of the energy reserves of the world. Yet \nevery year the United States economy consumes 25 percent of the energy \nthat is produced in the world.\n  We cannot drill our way out of this situation. We have to have \nenvironmentally responsible exploration and production, but we also \nhave to deal with conservation and efficiency. It is not just a matter \nof reducing costs and reducing consumption. There is not another issue \nthat is as important as energy. It is the issue of the environment. We \nhave to understand that as we burn energy, as we destroy this energy \nfor our economic purposes--carbon fuels, for example--we are releasing \nemissions into the environment. Carbon dioxide, for example, which \nultimately form a cloud over our globe, this greenhouse effect which \ncaptures the heat of the Sun and warming the planet we live on to the \npoint where we are seeing dramatic climate change in America and around \nthe world. We are finding from those in the private sector who look at \nthis in cold economic terms that decisions are made which suggest we \nare facing serious problems if we don't do something about it.\n\n  When the major insurance companies announce they are not going to \nwrite property insurance for many businesses on the gulf coast of the \nUnited States because of the severity of the hurricanes we have seen in \nthe last few years, it is a wake-up call to America. When we know that \nthe glaciers are melting, when we know the temperature is going up on \nthis globe we live on, when we know species such as the polar bear are \ndoomed to extinction if we don't make some serious changes, we have to \ncombine this debate on a national energy policy with the national \nenvironmental policy that sets a standard--that says to the world \nengage us in this effort to protect the planet on which we live.\n  S. 3711 is an interesting and important bill. I am glad we are \ndebating it. But make no mistake; it is not a national energy policy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing my speech and the speech of the Senator from Georgia, Senator \nChambliss, that Senator Cornyn be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson and Mr. Chambliss pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. Res. 541 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the Senate is now taking up a very \nimportant piece of legislation that would open a huge area in the Gulf \nof Mexico for deepwater exploration for oil and natural gas. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of this important legislation and believe it is long \noverdue.\n  At the same time, I am amazed when I hear our friends on the other \nside of the aisle. The Democratic whip this morning said this was an \ninteresting proposal and he hoped we would have a good debate. I agree \nwith both of those things. What he said I disagree with is that this is \nnot about a national energy policy. He criticized the Federal \nGovernment not having a national energy policy.\n  This is about a national energy policy. This is about eliminating the \nmoratoria we have created ourselves that have prevented the United \nStates from relying more on domestic production of oil and gas and \nrelying less on imported energy from places in trouble, regions of the \nworld such as the Middle East.\n  As the current occupant of the chair knows, she and the senior \nSenator from Alaska have been fighting for years to open the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge for exploration and development. This is \nsomething that not only do Alaskans support but that would provide a \ntremendous boom to the United States in terms of our ability to develop \ndomestic energy resources.\n  However, time and time again, for countless years, our friends on the \nother side of the aisle have said no, we cannot do that because it will \ndamage the environment, it will disturb the flora and the fauna in that \nregion of the world.\n  The fact is, it is possible for us to explore and develop domestic \nenergy supplies in an environmentally sound way. Modern drilling \ntechniques and production techniques are entirely compatible with \npreserving the environment and avoiding the kind of calamities that \nsome want to scare the American people into believing would be routine.\n  I suggest this bill is all about developing a national energy policy. \nIt is important to reducing our dependence on imported energy. In fact, \nit is estimated when lease 181 is developed, it will produce 1.26 \nbillion barrels of oil, oil that is now selling for $75 a barrel on the \nopen market.\n  We all know Congress can pass a lot of laws. We can repeal a lot of \nlaws. But the one law we cannot repeal is the law of supply and demand. \nIn a booming economy in the United States, and countries such as China \ngrowing at a rate of 10 percent, we know the demand for oil and gas has \nincreased. The problem is, the supply has not. This would pinpoint the \nsolution at the only way we know we can deal with this in terms of \nsupply, and that is increase it by 1.26 billion barrels of oil and--\nthis is significant, too--5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  Natural gas is not only important because it is relatively clean \nburning, but it also is feedstock in a number of critical manufacturing \nindustries in the United States. It is critical for our farmers and \nranchers, but the price of natural gas has gone through the roof--\nagain, because of huge demand and limited supply.\n  So it is absolutely critical to our ability to reduce our dependence \non imported energy to both improve our national security and improve \nthe prospects for our economy that we pass this legislation.\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\n  My colleague from Illinois, the distinguished Democratic whip, also \nsaid the answer is not to open places such as ANWR, it is to pass \nmandates from Washington on more fuel-efficient vehicles. I am all for \npeople having the choice to buy vehicles that give them extended gas \nmileage, but I am against Washington, DC, mandating through some \ndirective that says to my constituents in Texas, you can only drive a \ncertain kind of car. I believe we ought to have the freedom of choice \nand that Congress should not be in the business of mandating what kind \nof cars we drive in my State or any State.\n  Finally, he mentioned that big bugaboo we hear and read so much \nabout, global warming, another scare tactic that is used often to \nconvince people that, no, we can't develop our domestic energy supply, \nwe can't contribute more to the production of CO2 in the \natmosphere because it will exacerbate global warming. We are all \nworried about global warming. The fact is, there is some debate in \nscience about what the causes of the current warming of the atmosphere \nare, whether they are periodic and we are seeing a spike now, a small \nspike now, but it will work out.\n  The main problem with the solutions that have been offered to address \nglobal warming is that most of the proponents penalize the United \nStates and damage the American economy by subjecting us to onerous \nregulations that would not apply to some of our major competitors in \nthe world, countries such as China and India that would not be subject, \nfor example, to the Kyoto Treaty that was overwhelmingly rejected by \nthe Senate the last time we considered that issue.\n  Rather than saying no, rather than blocking and blaming, what S. 3711 \ndoes is enormously positive. It has done a great job. I have to give a \nlot of credit to the Senator from Louisiana who has helped shepherd \nthis bill to this point so far. This is a bipartisan bill which is the \nway we should do things more often, but this provides a very real \nsolution to a very real problem. It is true we cannot rely on \ndeveloping more oil and gas supply, but that is certainly what we have \nto do in the near term to midterm. We cannot rely solely on \nconservation.\n  I am all for conserving our energy supply, avoiding waste that can be \navoided. I also think we ought to look for alternative fuels such as \nethanol. They make a lot of sense as part of an overall energy \ndiversity program. I think energy diversity should be our national \npolicy because if we rely on one type of fuel or if we rely on one \npolicy, such as conservation, we cannot hope to get ahead of the curve \nwhen it comes to the growing demand not just in the United States of \nAmerica but countries such as China that are growing at the rate of 10 \npercent a year, and other competitors in the world economy.\n  So we have to look at conservation. We have to look at additional \nsupply. We have to look at alternative forms of fuels, renewables. \nTexas just moved ahead of California in terms of production of wind \nenergy. That certainly has a lot of promise. It is not the only \nsolution, but it is a part of the overall solution. Then, of course, we \nhave to look at developing nuclear energy in this country. France, \nhardly a model that I would hold up in some areas, is a model when it \ncomes to dealing with nuclear energy. America produces about 20 percent \nof our electricity from nuclear power. France, on the other hand, \nproduces 80 percent of their electricity using nuclear power. They have \nfigured out that one way to address the environmental concerns but also \nproduce the kind of energy that a growing economy needs is nuclear \npower.\n  Thank goodness in the Energy bill we passed last year, we have now \nthe prospect of nuclear energy taking over more and more of the demand \nfor our energy supply in the United States.\n  So I believe this is an enormously important piece of legislation. It \ndoes provide a part of the solution to our overall challenge. It will \nhave a very direct impact on the prices that consumers pay at the gas \npump because most of the cost of gasoline is related to the price of \noil. We know that is not the only cause of high gas prices. Another \nproblem is we have seen some block the development of refinery \ncapacity, and we have had no new refineries which are what transmute \nthe oil into gasoline. We have not had any new refineries built in this \ncountry since the early 1970s, although we have seen a recent expansion \nof existing refining capacity which has helped.\n  But, here again, America is no longer the principal consumer of \nenergy in the world. We are just one of a number of large competitors \nfor the same scarce supply. So it is absolutely critical we undertake \nmeasures such as this as part of our national energy policy. So I would \ndisagree respectfully with my colleague from Illinois, the \ndistinguished Democratic whip. This is all about a national energy \npolicy, and it is a part of what we must do if we are going to keep our \ncommitments to the American people to try to help them keep more of the \nmoney they earn and let them spend it as they see fit and not have to \nspend it on rapidly escalating gasoline prices and other energy prices \nthat not only hurt consumers but also make America less competitive in \nthe global economy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, we are on a subject that is \nnear and dear to the heart of the Senator from Florida--both Senators \nfrom Florida. It is a subject of which, a year ago, in bringing up an \nenergy bill, there was an attempt to drill off the coast of Florida, \nand this Senator had to start his first filibuster. We were able to \nresolve that with the help of the distinguished senior Senator from New \nMexico, Mr. Domenici, who, true to his word, let the Energy bill go on \nwithout bringing up the portions with regard to drilling off of Florida \nwhen it went to conference with the House of Representatives. And I \nhave thanked Senator Domenici many times on this floor for being a man \nof his word.\n  I must say, in the negotiations that have brought this legislation to \nthe floor now, I give great credit to the senior Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu, in looking out for the interests of her State \nin receiving revenue--what would come from new drilling that this \nlegislation addresses not only for Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, but \nespecially for Louisiana. It addresses those revenue needs that the \nState needs since it is losing all of those wetlands. We saw the \nresults of that in the great tragedy of Hurricane Katrina a year ago. \nSo I give great credit to Senator Landrieu.\n  But I also give great credit to Senator Landrieu because she knew the \ninterests of Florida had to be protected in order for her to get an \nagreement because both Senators from Florida were willing to filibuster \nany legislation that threatened the interests of Florida. To her great \ncredit--Senator Landrieu's--she worked with the two Senators from \nFlorida. She also worked with the other gulf coast Senators. And what \nhas been crafted is a piece of legislation that addresses just the Gulf \nof Mexico.\n\n  Now, you might wonder: Why does Florida not want its waters off the \ncoast of Florida to be drilled? Well, this Senator is going to explain \nthat. Certainly, there are economic interests with a $57 billion a year \ntourism industry that depends on pristine beaches. Certainly, there is \nthe delicate environment--the 10,000 Islands, the Big Bend area, the \nbays and estuaries, Apalachicola Bay--all of these environmental areas \nthat are so delicate to the ecology of the oceans where so much marine \nlife is spawned.\n  But there is another big reason that most people do not understand, \nand it is right here as shown on this chart. Most people do not realize \nthat the entire Gulf of Mexico off of Florida is restricted airspace. \nWhy? Because this is the largest testing and training area in the world \nfor the U.S. military. All of this area has restricted air use and \nnaval use.\n  You wonder: When the U.S. Atlantic fleet training in Vieques--the \nlittle island off the eastern end of Puerto Rico--when it was shut \ndown, why did most of that training come to Florida? It is because you \ncan do combined air-sea exercises and land exercises from Eglin Air \nForce Base, Pensacola NAS--Naval Air Station Pensacola. Squadrons of \nNavy F-18s come down and spend 2 weeks, 3 weeks at a time, and are \nstationed there because when they lift off out of Key West NAS, within \n2 minutes they are over restricted airspace where they can go about \ntheir training.\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\n  So here is a large part of the reason--as shown right here on the \nchart--why there is no drilling off the west coast of Florida in the \nGulf of Mexico. The importance of what is called the Eglin Air Force \nBase Gulf Test and Training Range has been emphasized in the letter \nthat was received by the Senate Armed Services Committee, signed by the \nSecretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld. That letter was delivered to the \ncommittee last November, in which he says: You cannot have oil and gas \nrigs out here where we are testing and training sophisticated weapons \nsystems, and where we are training our pilots--Air Force and Navy \npilots--and where we now will have the F-35 all-pilot training for the \nnew Joint Strike Fighter, the F-35 for all branches of service, all out \nhere because of that restricted space. So Secretary Rumsfeld made it \nvery clear: You cannot have oil and gas rigs.\n  I remember the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, one day said: Why \nshould Florida be protected? Here, this is the reason. This is the \nhistorical reason, in addition to the reasons of the environment, as \nwell as the economy of Florida in protecting our tourism industry.\n  So this is what we are dealing with, as shown on this chart. All of \nthe yellow on this chart off the State of Florida is going to be \nprotected until the year 2022. That is three planning periods of 5 \nyears each. That is 15 years after the planning period of 2007 kicks \nin. All of that area--which is 125 miles from Fort Walton, it is 100 \nmiles from Perdido Key, 100 miles off of the Alabama coast right here. \nThen it comes around, and it then follows this critical line, this \nblack line that is called the military mission line, a military mission \nline that was established in 1981 by the Department of Defense in that \nthey said they wanted no drilling east of that line. Therefore, that \nline becomes the critical line, of which you see that most of the area \nof Florida, then, is protected from drilling. And that is all the way \nthrough the year 2022.\n  That area, by the way--from this point off of Clearwater, which is in \nthe Tampa Bay area--is 235 miles due west of the Tampa Bay area \nbeaches. For Naples, it is in excess of 300 miles. No drilling. So you \ncan see the protection for Florida also happens to be the protection \nfor the U.S. military in these ranges.\n  Now, we have had people come to the floor and say they are concerned \nabout this going down to the House. The House-passed bill basically \nlifts the moratorium for drilling off the Outer Continental Shelf of \nthe entire United States--the Pacific coast, the Atlantic coast, and so \nforth.\n  I want to speak about the assurances I have been given when this bill \nwill leave here and go to the House of Representatives. But let me tell \nyou why this bill only deals with the Gulf of Mexico. From Florida's \nstandpoint, from the military's standpoint, from the Nation's defense \nstandpoint, we do not want to lift the moratorium and have drilling off \nthe east coast of Florida and the rest of the southeastern United \nStates because, look right here on this chart. Here is another major \nAir Force and Navy training area off the northeast coast of Florida and \noff the east coast of Georgia. In addition, right there is a place \ncalled Cape Canaveral. The Cape Canaveral Air Force Station is where we \nlaunch our rockets to put all of our satellites, our defense \nsatellites, into equatorial orbit.\n  You can't have oil rigs out here where you are dropping the first \nstages of the expendable booster rockets that are putting our highly \nsophisticated and highly classified defense payloads into equatorial \norbit. Just to the north of Cape Canaveral is a place called the \nKennedy Space Center. It happens to have launch pad 39A and launch pad \n39B from which we launch the space shuttle and, after the year 2012, it \nis estimated we will launch the new space vehicle called the Crew \nExploration Vehicle. You can't have oil rigs out here where we are \ndropping the solid rocket boosters from the space shuttle when we \nlaunch, those two big candlesticks on either side of the external tank \nof the space shuttle. After they have expended their fuel 2 minutes \ninto flight, they separate from the space shuttle and parachute back \ninto the Atlantic Ocean. They are then brought back in, refurbished, \nand reused. You can't have oil rigs out here.\n  So as people talk about wanting drilling off the east coast of \nFlorida, which this legislation in front of us does not address but the \nHouse bill does address, you can't do that out here with an interest of \nthe Nation at stake--the military preparedness plus the defense of this \ncountry, with the important payloads that we are launching out of the \nCape Canaveral Air Force Station, as well as the Kennedy Space Center. \nWhen people say that this legislation we are passing in the Senate does \nnot address protections of the east coast, the east coast isn't a \nthreat. Right now the east coast is under a moratorium until the year \n2012. That is not where the threat is. The threat is here in the Gulf \nof Mexico. That is why we have the legislation before us that we do. \nThat is why this Senator is coming to the floor to announce my support \nfor this legislation, which I have helped craft and on which I have \nwaited until today, until I had assurances that this legislation was \nnot going to be in any significant way changed when it leaves this \nChamber and goes down to the House.\n  What are those assurances? I have been authorized to say from the \nmajority leader, Senator Frist--and I am reading from an e-mail to me. \nThis is a quote Senator Frist sent to me today--\n\n       The Senate bill is a carefully crafted compromise and I \n     believe it represents what is achievable in the Senate this \n     year. I will not bring a bill back before the Senate that \n     does not provide adequate protections to the State of \n     Florida. I look forward to working with both Florida Senators \n     to achieve this goal.\n\n  Yesterday, I spoke personally to Senator Frist on the telephone. He \ntold me he would do everything within his ability to keep it to the \nSenate version when the bill returns to the Senate. That is a pretty \ngood assurance for this Senator to protect the interests of Florida.\n  I went to our leader on this side of the aisle, the Democratic \nleader, and Senator Reid has written a letter to me:\n\n       Dear Senator Nelson:\n       It is my expectation that the House of Representatives will \n     accept S. 3711 as passed by the Senate without amending it \n     and without modifying it in a conference committee. If the \n     House does not accept the Senate bill as passed, I will join \n     other Senators and Senator Nelson and produce the votes to \n     sustain a filibuster to prevent the passage of the bill when \n     it would return to the Senate.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from Senator Reid's letter.\n  Around here, you have to take a man at his word. I accept the word \nand the assurances of the two great leaders of our two great parties in \nprotecting the interests of Florida. I am prepared to come and support \nthis legislation and to thank the leadership on both sides as they have \nworked with the two Senators from Florida to try to do what is right \nfor the country.\n  In the legislation that addresses the drilling, there is another \nimportant component for Florida; that is, there are a few leases out in \nthis area from years past, decades past, that have never been drilled \nbecause they have never gotten the permits because of all that we have \nbeen going through, keeping these waters protected in a moratorium. \nSenator Landrieu has crafted a portion of the bill that revenue will go \nto four Gulf States from the revenue generated to the Federal \nGovernment from new leases. The interest of Florida, since there won't \nbe drilling, is to get rid of the ancient leases that are never going \nto be drilled. So there is a provision in the legislation that will \nallow the swapping of these leases by their value for new leases in the \narea that can be drilled in what is called lease sale 181, and other \nleases in the central and western Gulf of Mexico, new leases that we \nwant to be drilled where a swap would occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. People say that is voluntary for the oil \ncompanies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the minority has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. You would ask, if it is voluntary, why would \nthey do it? Because there is a financial incentive for oil companies \nwho want to pay for new drilling in 181 or elsewhere\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\nin the central or western gulf, not to pay that by swapping out their \nfinancial interest in these ancient leases that are still here. They \nare of minor value compared to the entire value of the leases elsewhere \nin the Gulf of Mexico, but nevertheless that is there.\n  Why it is important that we keep the Senate bill intact and not \nexpand it with any version of the House is because the House-passed \nlegislation works for the Gulf of Mexico, but the House-passed version \nlifts the moratorium for the entire country and allows, with State \nlegislative approval, drilling to come up to 3 miles off the coast of a \nState. Of course, Atlantic seaboard Senators, Pacific Ocean Senators, \nwould be violently opposed to that, and then the Senators who start \nrealizing that it starts getting into their military- restricted areas, \ntheir defense-restricted areas, would find that enormously \nobjectionable. That is another reason we need to keep this legislation \nintact as it goes to the House and then comes back to the Senate.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Martinez, has made several \nstatements on the floor--and it is my understanding that he will \nagain--that he is given assurances that the protection of Florida will \nbe there when this legislation comes back from the House. It is the \nprivilege of this Senator from Florida to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am glad to hear the remarks of the \nSenator from Florida, and I am glad that he feels able to support this \nlegislation. It is something I have worked on for quite a number of \nyears and supported as a Senator from Alabama. We have a lot of oil and \ngas right off our coast. We believe this could be done safely and be \ngreat for the country economically. I am pleased that the distinguished \nSenator believes he can support this bill. We do have to work with the \nHouse of Representatives. They do have input in the legislation. But, \nhopefully, when all that is settled, we will have something we can \npass. It is critical for our economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sessions are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we are on the Gulf of Mexico energy \nsecurity bill, a bill that has been very carefully crafted in a \nbipartisan way. It has been our approach from the outset. One of the \nreal challenges we have is taking a bill which is delicate, in the \nsense that it has been carefully crafted, vetted, and addressed for the \nlast year--and there are many other people who would like to add other \nenergy amendments or bills to this single, focused step, this being \nbuilt upon the comprehensive energy bill, a bipartisan bill that was \npassed a year ago this week. So it is a challenge to keep the body \nfocused on this issue. In doing so, there are procedures here shortly \nthat are important to accomplish delivering as many as a billion \nbarrels of oil to the American people and over 5 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas, enough gas to heat or cool 6 million homes for 15 years. \nWe have it within our grasp.\n  We had a good vote yesterday morning in terms of getting on the \nlegislation, which we are on, and now, from a leadership standpoint, we \nhave to stay focused on this bill, even though there are a lot of other \ngood ideas out there, and complete this step and our action in the \nSenate. Thus, I will go through a series of steps here, and we will \nhave comments on that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4713\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4713.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end insert the following:\n       The effective date shall be 2 days after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4714 to Amendment No. 4713\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4714 to amendment No. 4713.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On line 1, strike ``2 days'' and insert ``1 day''.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the cloture motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 529, S. 3711: A bill to enhance the \n     energy independence and security of the United States by \n     providing for exploration, development, and production \n     activities for mineral resources in the Gulf of Mexico, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, Pete Domenici, Richard G. Lugar, Mitch \n           McConnell, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Jim Bunning, Trent \n           Lott, Christopher S. Bond, Tom Coburn, Wayne Allard, \n           David Vitter, Mel Martinez, Thad Cochran, Jim DeMint, \n           John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the live \nquorum be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, this cloture vote will occur on Monday. \nWe have not set the specific timing, but I anticipate that vote would \nbe at 5:30. We will set the exact time later today.\n  This will be a very important vote, and it is critical that Senators \nbe here, and they should prepare to be here at 5:30. We will announce \nthe specific time later today. I ask them to adjust their schedules \naccordingly. In all likelihood, we will be voting on Monday. I hope \nthey have adjusted their schedules accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have expressed to the majority leader my \ndisappointment in not allowing amendments on this bill. We had agreed \nto just have five, with time agreements on each of those. The leader \ndecided not to do that. I think that is unfortunate. I hope that, \nmoving beyond that, we can have a better idea of what we are going to \ndo for the rest of the work period.\n  The majority leader indicated to me that he has a very important \nmeeting shortly after lunch, and he will indicate to me at that time \nmore of a direction as to what we can expect this afternoon, tomorrow, \nand the rest of the work period before the August recess.\n  I also want the record to reflect, as I said yesterday, that I \nappreciate the cooperation of Senator Bingaman. Without his agreement, \nthis parliamentary situation we find ourselves in would not have \noccurred until late this evening. This will allow us this afternoon the \npossibility of doing other work. So I appreciate very much Senator \nBingaman being his normal cooperative person. He has strong feelings \nabout this legislation. He expressed them to me personally and on the \nSenate floor. But he is always someone who works for the good of the \nSenate. I appreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, while the majority leader is still \nhere, I understand the procedure he has followed, and that is to do \nwhat we refer to here as ``filling the tree'' with amendments so that \nother amendments cannot be offered.\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so \nthat I may be able to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, reserving the right to object, filling \nthe tree is the procedure I have used in order to accomplish what is a \nvery important next step in building on, as I said, the comprehensive \nEnergy bill the managers worked for last year, which has been \ntremendously successful as we look at alternative energy, such as \nethanol or, in the future, nuclear and biomass, looking at the supply \nside and the consumption side of the equation. What is challenging in \nfloor management is being able to now build upon that bill from last \nyear and take one step at a time.\n  As we are commenting on this now, there are so many good proposals, \nsubstantive proposals, that would help our dependence on foreign \nsources of oil. We are 60 percent dependent today on foreign sources of \noil. We have to change that by lessening our energy dependence with \nhomegrown energy. That is what we will be able to do on the floor today \nin this carefully crafted, focused, very discrete bill that looks at \nthe Gulf of Mexico, which has revenue sharing that has been carefully \nworked out with Members in this body for the last 6 to 7 months in \nterms of the specifics. With that, we will be able to deliver this bill \nto the American people and address the squeeze we know they are feeling \ntoday when they are filling up the tractor or the car or preparing to \ngo on vacation or air-conditioning their homes or heating their homes \nat other times of the year.\n  With that being the approach, I will object to setting aside the \namendments because it would mean actually trying to decide among many \ngood proposals that would come to the floor--and it is not that they \nare not good or they won't be addressed in the future. We are going to \nkeep this bill focused, tight, and clean.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Hearing objection, I wish to take a few minutes and \nexplain the amendment I was intending to offer so that Senators will \nunderstand what the alternatives are that we could be considering \ntoday.\n  Madam President, just to pick up on the point the majority leader was \nmaking, I certainly want to build on the good work we did in this body \nlast year with the passage of the Energy Act of 2005. I believe very \nstrongly that the way to do that is to have an open process, allow \nMembers to offer amendments, allow those amendments to be voted on, and \nsee what the will of the Senate is. Unfortunately, that is not the \nprocess which is being used in connection with S. 3711.\n  I stated extensively yesterday the substantive reasons I think S. \n3711 is not good legislation, and I will repeat a few of those points.\n  Let me talk about the amendment I wanted to offer this morning. The \namendment I was going to offer consists of the text of S. 2253, which \nis the legislation we reported out of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on a bipartisan basis in March. My amendment would \ntake that language and it would modify it to add the so-called 181 \nsouth area for leasing.\n  Let me put up a chart so everybody knows what is involved here. The \nwhite area on this chart, the box there, is the area that we proposed \nin our Energy Committee bill that we reported to the floor to open for \nleasing. That thatched area to the right of that, to the east of that \non the map, is an area which would be open with the consent of the \nSecretary of Defense or under appropriate circumstances and conditions \nwhich would be specified by the Secretary of Defense. That is what our \nbill called for.\n\n  As I say, I would propose in this amendment, if I were able to offer \nit, to add the yellow area below that which is now being referred to as \n181 south.\n  The legislation we came out of committee with and I would desire to \nhave us consider on the floor today would require that the lease sale \nbe conducted within a year. It would provide that leasing in the 181 \narea south be done as soon as practicable after the date of enactment.\n  Overall, the amendment I would like to have been able to offer would \nmake available 7.37 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.58 billion \nbarrels of oil. These are substantially more energy resources than the \n5.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the 1.26 billion barrels of \noil made available under the pending legislation; that is, S. 3711.\n  At the same time, the legislation we came out of committee with and \nthat I wish we were able to consider on the floor would provide there \nwould be no leasing closer than 100 miles from the Florida coast at any \npoint and leasing east of the military mission line under the bill, as \nI indicated, could only occur with the prior consent and agreement of \nthe Secretary of Defense.\n  The 1-year timeframe for conducting the lease sale in this 181 area \nis intended to allow for full compliance with all environmental laws. \nThe amendment does not impose any new leasing moratorium, such as the \npending bill would. Also, it does not divert revenue from the Federal \nTreasury to four coastal States, as the pending bill proposes to do.\n  Earlier this year, I was pleased to work with Senator Domenici to \ndevelop and introduce S. 2253. That is the basis of the amendment I am \noffering. We had a hearing on the bill in committee. We reported the \nbill with a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  However, after the committee reported its legislation, several \ncolleagues indicated they had problems with this bill, in particular my \ncolleagues from Florida, who sought a new long-term moratorium off the \nFlorida coast, which has been agreed to by those who are now advocating \nthe pending legislation--this is a 16-year moratorium in a very large \narea--and my colleagues from other Gulf Coast States have insisted upon \na provision that cedes to their States Federal revenues for oil and gas \nproduced in the Federal Outer Continental Shelf off their coasts. Thus, \nS. 3711, which was written by Senators Domenici, Landrieu, and others, \nincludes significant new provisions that I believe undermine the goals \nof our original bill.\n  I am disappointed we did not have a chance to vote on the bill which \nwas reported out of the committee. I believe the Senate would have \nacted favorably on that bill had it been given an opportunity to do so.\n  S. 2253 is good energy policy; it is responsible fiscal policy. S. \n2253 would have resulted in oil and gas being produced without locking \nup vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf and without raiding the \nFederal Treasury at the same time.\n  As I stated in the Senate yesterday, because S. 3711, which is the \npending bill, locks up these vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf \noff the coast of Florida, and because the bill provides for the sharing \nof billions of dollars in Federal revenues, I must strongly oppose it.\n  The pending bill, S. 3711, expands areas under moratoria and sets \nprecedence for imposing new long-term congressional moratoria.\n  This next chart is the one many Senators have been using to make many \ndifferent arguments on the Senate floor, but the point is very clear \nwhen one looks at this chart. There is a vast area, the yellow area on \nthe chart, that is being put off limits to oil and gas development for \na very substantial period, 16 years, longer than virtually any of us \nare likely to be in the Senate.\n  The Department proposed, as I understand it, in return for gaining \naccess to 2.76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over what the \nInterior Department proposed--this bill currently pending in the Senate \nputs 21.83 trillion cubic feet of natural gas off limits until 2022. I \nthink that is a mistake. I think it is a bad deal for America.\n  Two of these areas within the original 181 lease sale area that are \nmore than 100 miles off the Florida coast would be offered for lease \nunder my amendment. And most importantly, my amendment would not impose \nany new moratoria on Outer Continental Shelf leasing.\n  Likewise, the amendment I would offer would not include the ceding of \nFederal revenues to the four Gulf Coast States.\n  Let me make it very clear: I recognize there are needs to protect the \nwetlands along the gulf coast, and I recognize that the Federal \nGovernment should provide assistance to these\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nStates to accomplish that wetland restoration and protection work. But \nI believe very strongly that should be money that comes out of the \nFederal Treasury. We should not be taking a stream of revenue that has \nhistorically always gone into the Federal Treasury--that is, royalty \nfrom production in the Outer Continental Shelf--we should not take that \nstream of revenue and divert a substantial portion of it directly to \nthose States. We should, instead, bring those funds into the Federal \nTreasury, determine what the needs are for those States and for other \ncommunities in the country, and then appropriate the funds \nappropriately to meet those needs.\n\n  That is my strong view. That is what the amendment I would have \noffered would contemplate, that is what current law contemplates, and \nthat is what the Supreme Court has always said was the appropriate \ncourse. Of course, I cited former President Truman and his strong \nposition, which is consistent with the position I am advocating today.\n  In summary, the amendment I would like to have offered this morning, \nif the majority leader had not blocked our ability procedurally to \noffer amendments, would open this area called 181 south and also a \nlarger portion of the 181 area originally than the pending legislation \nproposes to do. There would be an additional 1.5 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas made available. There would be an additional 300 million \nbarrels of oil made available for our Nation over and above what is \nbeing made available under S. 3711.\n  The amendment would accomplish this in a manner that protects \nFlorida's coast without imposing new leasing moratoria. It would also \ndo so in a manner that protects the fiscal interests of our Nation. I \nregret I am not able to offer the amendment today for consideration.\n  Moreover, the amendment would achieve greater oil and gas production \nwithout setting dangerous precedents. I think one of the most \ndisturbing things about what the Senate is preparing to do, if it goes \nforward and adopts S. 3711, is that we are setting precedents, both for \nputting areas off limits to production for long periods of time--a 16-\nyear statutory moratorium--for areas that have not been subject to \nstatutory moratorium, in some cases at all. I think that is a big \nmistake. I think the precedent we are setting with regard to so-called \nrevenuesharing or ceding of revenues, Federal production revenues and \nroyalties to coastal States is also a very major mistake, and it sets a \nvery bad precedent which will come back to haunt us.\n  I know very well that the other Senators who represent coastal States \nwill in the future come to this Senate floor and insist, as the \nSenators from these four Gulf Coast States have insisted, that if \nproduction is going forward off their coasts, their States are entitled \nto Federal revenue as well.\n  This is bad policy. This is bad energy policy. It is bad fiscal \npolicy. It is a course of action that I believe the Nation will regret \nin future years if we go forward with it.\n  I am disappointed that there is no place in this debate for us to \noffer amendments to correct the policy. I am also disappointed that \nthere is no place in this debate for us to address other important \nenergy-related issues. We should be proposing amendments to this \nlegislation with regard to energy efficiency. We should be considering \nthe legislation that Senators Obama and Lugar have proposed with regard \nto vehicle fuel efficiency. We should be considering a variety of \nbills--S. 2747, the Enhanced Energy Security Act, which tries to put in \nplace a variety of provisions that would add to the efficiency with \nwhich we use energy in this country. All of those are legitimate issues \nwe should be able to address by amendment to the Energy bill on the \nSenate floor.\n  In fact, if we were building on the Energy Policy Act work this \nCongress did last year in the first session of this Congress, we would \nbe, in fact, allowing those other very meritorious amendments to be \nconsidered as part of our debate as well.\n  I regret that. I regret the decision of the majority leader to deny \nus the right to offer amendments.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent my amendment be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 3711, \nand I specifically rise in strong support of the majority leader's \nactions to ensure that we have a focused debate on the carefully \ncrafted provisions of S. 3711 and not be thrown off track by numerous \namendments about all sorts of ancillary energy and other issues because \nI rise in support of actually doing something, not merely talking about \neverything, as the Senate so often wants to do, and at the end of the \nday doing nothing. That is the choice we have.\n  The choice is what we so often do: Talk about everything under the \nSun, have wide-ranging debates. This body is a great debating society, \nbut at the end of the day does nothing. The other choice is focusing on \nthe carefully crafted provisions of S. 3711, having a fair debate on \nthose provisions and passing it into law, doing something concrete, \nreal, meaningful, that will have an impact soon on people's wallets, on \npeople's pocketbooks, on our energy future.\n  That is what this choice is all about, and I stand strongly for doing \nsomething and not just talking a good game. What is it we would be \ndoing, Mr. President?\n  Well, S. 3711 would be doing more to secure our supply of domestic \nenergy than anything we have done in a long time. It is not everything \nunder the Sun, it is not a silver bullet, it is not a magic wand, but \nit is a major, concrete, specific step forward that would help secure \nour energy future. What is that? It is 8.3 million acres of area in\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nthe gulf opened to exploration and production for the first time ever; \n1.26 billion barrels of oil, brandnew production; and 5.83 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas, brandnew production. That is doing \nsomething, and that is doing something that will have an impact on our \nenergy future--not in 20 years, not in 10 years, but very soon.\n  We will see this production in a few years and we could see its \nimpact on prices even sooner than that. As folks in the energy industry \nrecognize that we are opening this brandnew area to both oil and gas \nexploration, we could see a positive impact, bringing prices down even \nsooner than the production would begin.\n  So I am in support of doing something strong, concrete, and \nmeaningful--not just talking a good game and, at the end of the day, \ndoing nothing.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Mexico made some points in \nopposition to this proposal. He said it was very regrettable that he \nand others were not completely open to propose any amendment with \nregard to this bill. Let's not kid ourselves. Let's understand what is \ngoing on here. The distinguished Senator is absolutely flat out against \nthe central provisions of this bill. His effort is to gut this attempt \nat moving us forward in terms of energy independence. He would take out \nof this bill one of its most central and important components: royalty \nshare.\n  It is easy for him to take this position. His State of New Mexico \ngets enormous Federal revenue from production onshore on Federal land. \nEverything that is produced on Federal land in his State--as in any \nother State--his State gets 50 percent of that royalty. So it is very \neasy for him to take the position that offshore should be a completely \ndifferent situation; offshore should be zero. That doesn't affect his \nconstant revenue stream for States such as his in New Mexico or for \nStates such as Wyoming, where 50 percent of the revenue from onshore \nmineral production royalty is going directly to his State coffers.\n  In addition, if you look at the 50-percent Federal share, most of \nthat goes to a Federal fund that goes back to the States in terms of \nland reclamation as well, so that all told, 90 percent of that royalty \nproduced on Federal land in his State essentially goes back to the \nStates. So he has a very convenient situation in his State which has \nbeen that way for years. It is very easy for him to protect that but, \nat the same time, block coastal States from having a similar situation.\n  But there is no good reason we should do that. We should equalize the \nplaying field. We should make Federal policy equal and right. Look at \nlast year, 2005. Federal offshore production yielded, in terms of \nFederal revenue, $6.32 billion. Of that enormous total--$6.32 billion--\nonly $75 million went to the States in terms of a royalty share. \nCompare that to the situation of the Senator from New Mexico. Federal \nonshore revenue for that same year yielded $3.5 billion of royalties, \nand half of that went to the States--$1.75 billion went to the States \nof New Mexico and Wyoming and many other States.\n\n  So, of course, it is easy for the Senator from New Mexico to protect \nwhat he already has but try to deny it to coastal States. The fact is \nthe impacts are the same, and the impacts are dramatic. He talked about \nthem himself, the dramatic negative impacts with regard to coastal \nerosion and other impacts on the Louisiana coastline and all of the \ncoastlines of the Gulf States. That is one of the primary reasons we \nhave royalty share at the heart of this bill, which the Senator from \nNew Mexico would strip out with his amendment.\n  But that is not the only reason we have that royalty-sharing \nprovision in the bill. The predominant reason is the overarching \nnational reason, the reason that will promote our energy independence \nin the future, and that is simple. If we allow coastal States to share \nin the royalty obtained from production off their shores, we can change \nthe dynamics dramatically. That will change the not-in-my-backyard \nattitude of so many coastal States and usher in more domestic \nproduction in the future. That is the model we are building with S. \n3711, the positive model that will do, over time, even more than what \nthis bill alone does, opening up 8.3 million acres, 5.83 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas, and 1.26 billion barrels of oil. That is what the \nbill itself does. That is significant. That is concrete and positive. \nBut when we put this model in place of sharing royalties with the \nappropriate coastal States, then we open possibilities in the future \neven more. That is why this royalty-sharing provision is so central and \nso important to this bill. It is a new model to get us to greater \nenergy independence, to get us away from the pervasive not-in-my-\nbackyard mentality that has gripped virtually every State around the \ncountry and has shut off area after area after area to offshore oil and \ngas production.\n  This bill will do all of those things in a fair and reasonable way. \nIt will open new areas of land to production, it will open enormous new \nenergy assets, and it will create this model that we can build on in \nthe future to create more energy independence for our Nation. That is \nwhat we so desperately lack.\n  As I said at the beginning, this body is very good at debating, at \ntalking, endlessly sometimes, about every proposal under the Sun, but \nso often at the end of the day we do nothing after those endless \ndebates. This is an opportunity to do something real and concrete, and \nto create a model that will provoke even more action in the future. \nBecause we can have endless debates in this Chamber about securing our \nenergy independence, and every Senator here in the context of this \ndebate will likely come to the floor and talk about his or her \ncommitment to securing our energy independence, what are we going to do \nabout it? If we don't change the dynamics of our energy policy, the \nnot-in-my-backyard mentality, which has put a stranglehold on us for \nyears, will continue to survive. But if we change the model, if we \nallow coastal States to share in the royalties produced from production \noff their own shores, give them the decision and give them some of the \nbenefits, then we will change the dynamics and, in my opinion, over the \nnext 10 years open significant new areas to offshore oil and gas \nproduction and significantly increase our energy independence.\n  That is why S. 3711 is so important. It does something real and \nmeaningful and concrete right away. We are acting, not just talking. \nEven more importantly, we are building a model for the future, a \npositive model that will promote our energy independence by allowing us \nto go after those resources, including offshore, where the vast \nmajority of our energy assets are in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could inquire of my colleague from \nWashington--and I have my colleague from Alabama who seeks \nrecognition--maybe we can get some order set up here. I have a 15-\nminute presentation. I believe my colleague from Alabama is seeking \nrecognition, if I could inquire.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, 5 minutes would allow me to complete \nremarks I began earlier this morning when the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader appeared.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would inquire of my colleague from Washington a \ntimeframe she would want, in an effort to establish some order.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want 15 minutes as in morning business. \nWe could go back and forth. I think we could accommodate that quite \neasily if the Senator from Kansas wants to speak. I ask unanimous \nconsent that following the Senator from Kansas, if I could have 15 \nminutes in morning business, and then go back to the other side.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If my colleague from Washington would be willing to \nallow 5 minutes for my colleague from Alabama to finish up his \ncomments? Is that asking too much? I don't want to press it too far.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator modify her unanimous consent \nrequest to be that following your remarks, the Senator from Alabama \nwould be recognized?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Following my remarks, if the Senator from Alabama wants \nto go, I would be happy to agree to that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think what the Senator from Kansas was \nasking is if I could sort of utilize his time for 5 minutes to complete \nmy remarks and then go to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I revise my request and ask that \nfollowing\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\nthe remarks of the Senator from Kansas for 15 minutes, the Senator from \nAlabama for 5 minutes, and then I would be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my colleague from Washington in particular for \nallowing us to do this. It is very much appreciated.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Kansas to yield \nfor a unanimous consent request that I be placed in line after the \nSenator from Kansas and the Senator from Washington to speak on this \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator yields, can I then make that proposal?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized after the \nSenator from Kansas and the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I believe I am to be recognized for 15 minutes. If the \nPresiding Officer will notify me when 2 minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending business \nbefore the Senate, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Act, S. 3711. I \nwholeheartedly support this bill. We face a dire situation in this \ncountry regarding our energy dependence.\n  I believe this debate is about two numbers and those numbers are 3 \nand 75--$3-a-gallon gasoline and $75-a-barrel oil. That is what this \ndebate is about, 3 and 75.\n  We are reminded about this every day. There are probably places in \nthis country paying well over $3 a gallon for gasoline. The price of \noil hit $75 this past Friday. There is a good possibility it will even \ngo up from there. We need more domestic drilling to take place. We must \nreduce our foreign dependency, our dependency on foreign oil. In the \nfuture and in the near term as well we have to reduce our dependency on \noil.\n  Things are striking. In the United States we burn 10,000 gallons of \noil per second. The United States uses four times more oil than any \nother nation. Relative to economic output, the United States consumes \n7.5 gallons of oil for every thousand dollars of GDP. Oil imports cost \nus--this is a 2003 number, so they are higher now--oil imports cost us \n$10 billion a month, as a nation. Those are 2003 numbers.\n  Energy economists estimate that since World War II, oil price spikes \nhave cost the economy 15 percent growth and $1.2 trillion in direct \nlosses. There is a $7.4 billion increase in the U.S. oil bill per year \nfor each $1 increase in the price of oil. Imagine what that adds up to \nwhen you push $75-a-barrel oil. A $1 increase in the price of oil costs \nU.S. companies and consumers about $828 million in trucking costs each \nyear.\n  In addition to these facts, we get a large amount of our oil from \nregions that are unstable at best and unfriendly at worst; 65.3 percent \nof the world's proven oil reserves are in the Middle East. The Middle \nEast OPEC States already supply the United States with 2.5 million \nbarrels per day, 25 percent of our daily imports.\n  Further, every day, 26 million barrels of oil flow through two \npoints. One of those points is the Straits of Hormuz in the Persian \nGulf. We know the instability that can happen there. A few targeted \nstrikes against one of these two states or against oil facilities in \nSaudi Arabia, which holds a quarter of the world's oil reserves and \nessentially all spare capacity--if you can consider any of the capacity \nspare today--it could take several million barrels of oil off the \nglobal market every day for months and send oil prices soaring.\n  These facts, coupled with the increases in demand that are taking \nplace in countries such as China and India, do not bode well for our \nnational and economic security.\n  There will be very difficult if not potentially disastrous \nconsequences to our economy if we do not reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil and, in the future, oil period. If we remain so dependent \non foreign oil, we court disaster.\n  Currently, we have these two mega numbers, 3 and 75; $3-a-gallon \ngasoline and $75-a-barrel oil.\n  This bill, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Act, will help lessen the dire \nsituation we are currently in. It opens up 8.3 million acres of the \nGulf of Mexico for oil and natural gas exploration. It is something we \nneed to do, we must do now to be able to help reduce our demand for oil \nproducts, for foreign oil.\n  I want to also talk about the midterm of what we need to do. This is \nsomething we have to do now to mitigate the situation we are currently \nin. We really need to do it. But on a midterm basis, we have to reduce \nour dependence on oil, period. That is why a bipartisan group of 28 \nSenators has put forward the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for America \nSecurity Act, S. 2025. I urge my colleagues to look at cosponsoring \nthis legislation. I think it is the most bipartisan and comprehensive \nenergy legislation pending in front of the Senate today.\n  We filed it as an amendment on this bill, but as I understand the \nprocedural situation we are in, it is unlikely this is going to come up \nnow. It is still important that we look at this legislation and others \nto reduce our long-term dependence on oil. It is appropriate Members of \nCongress from every region of the country and every political stripe--\nconservative, liberal, everything in between--have all arrived at this \nsame point. For our national security and our economic security, we \nmust reduce our dependency on oil.\n  It is common sense to reduce our oil consumption, and it is doable. \nThis bill uses new ideas and does not visit old debates or fights. We \nknow the edges of this debate where we divide this body. This doesn't \ngo there. It says what areas can we agree upon, and let's press forward \nthere. For too long our foreign policy has been dictated in part by our \nneed for foreign oil. It is in the interest of America's security for \nus to look at ways of lessening our dependence on foreign oil, and it \nis also in the interests of our economy. The pocketbook of every \nAmerican is affected when the price of oil goes up.\n\n  We can create market incentives to use the technology available today \nto deal with the problem that we are facing right now. We don't have to \nwait for any new inventions. We can start solving the problem today \nsimply by sending the marketplace the correct signals. There is broad \npublic support for reducing our oil consumption.\n  This, to me, is one of those American-type problems. We have a \nproblem and it needs to be addressed and we can do it with good, old-\nfashioned American ingenuity. It exists. The great thing about this \nbill, S. 2025, is that our 10-year goal is for reduction in oil \nconsumption of 2.5 million barrels per day. That is roughly 10 percent \nof our total oil consumption and the same amount we import daily from \nthe Persian Gulf region.\n  How do we do it? Ethanol and renewable fuels must play a clear role \nin this fight. They are homegrown. We need to be more dependent on the \nMidwest than the Middle East. Therefore, this helps keep the money at \nhome. We ventured down this road before, but we have never fully \ncommitted as a nation to renewable fuels. Now is the time to do it.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that so many people are literally buying \ninto ethanol today, and into biodiesel--soybean-based diesel fuel. Bill \nGates has invested over $100 million of his own money into ethanol. \nRichard Branson of the Virgin Empire, famous for his success in venture \ncapitalism, is investing in ethanol. These are great signs for the \nfuture of renewable fuels, as it is an industry that needs capital \ninvestment.\n  As a government and as a people, we need to fully commit to make \nrenewable fuels a viable alternative to petroleum-based fuel. As long \nas oil remains above $70 a barrel, the economics of renewable fuels \nmakes good sense. It makes sense for us to continue to push its \ndevelopment, and it makes clear sense regarding our foreign policy and \nsecurity needs.\n  Biodiesel is another renewable fuel option and is a farm success \nstory. After Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s, soybean farmers \nwere struggling to maintain profitability. I was the Secretary of \nAgriculture in my State of Kansas at that time. Because\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\nof high energy prices and low commodity prices, the farmers were \nstruggling. The soybean farmers started investments in the development \nof biodiesel. It was a priority for farmers eager to contribute to our \nenergy supply and develop a new market for soybeans. Farmers invested \nmore than $50 million of their check-off dollars. These are dollars \nthey tax themselves to be able to promote their industry. They did this \nto be able to conduct research and development in biodiesel.\n  As a result, the biodiesel industry has shown slow but steady success \nsince the early 1990s. However, in the past 2 years it has grown \nexponentially. In 2004 there were approximately 25 million gallons of \nbiodiesel sales. That increased to 90 million gallons in 2005, and \ncurrently it is on track to exceed 150 million gallons this year.\n  Likewise, we went from 22 biodiesel plants in 2004 to more than 60 \nbiodiesel plants currently, and there are over 40 more plants currently \nunder construction.\n  Congress has, and continues to put in place, policies that enhance \nour Nation's energy security. Renewable fuels are playing a significant \nrole in helping to achieve this objective while providing economic \nbenefits to farmers and rural communities.\n  Another key element to freeing ourselves from our foreign oil \ndependency is to introduce electricity as a transportation fuel option. \nRecently, I and many of my colleagues in the House and Senate test \ndrove plug-in hybrid vehicles on Capitol Hill. These cars drive \nexclusively on electricity for the first 30 miles of every trip. After \n30 miles, these cars switch to a normal combustion engine. Over 50 \npercent of all Americans drive less than 30 miles each day. That means \nwe could have over half of our drivers in America driving exclusively \non electricity, not using any oil at all.\n  The good news is that our electricity generation is produced here in \nAmerica, whether it is coal, natural gas, nuclear, or renewable sources \nsuch as water power and wind. We would be fueling a majority of our \ntransportation sector with American sources of energy as opposed to \nforeign oil. Plugging in your car during offpeak hours when power is in \na surplus and cheaper would soon just become part of the modern daily \nroutine like plugging in your cell phone before you go to bed. Offpeak \nelectricity can be the equivalent of 50-cent-a-gallon gasoline.\n  The car I sat in, and other Members drove, went 100 miles a gallon by \nusing the plug-in technology, the hybrid technology in the car, and \nfuel in a combustion engine--100 miles to the gallon, a car available \ntoday.\n  This was a modified Prius. I don't want to tell everybody that this \nis broadly available. But the people who have modified it to include \nplug-in technology were using this hybrid vehicle.\n  Not only will we be sending out money to countries that dislike us, \nbut we will be buying American-made power instead.\n  Another great bit of news is that we already have the infrastructure \nin place to produce electricity as a transportation tool. All you will \nneed is an extension cord and a wall outlet. We can't drill enough \ndomestic oil to break our addiction to foreign oil.\n  However, this bill takes an innovative market-based approach to solve \nthese problems. We can provide tax credits for the production and \npurchase of advanced technology cars. We expand the renewable fuels \ninfrastructure through a variety of means. We also expand research and \ndevelopment in critical areas such as light-weight materials and \ncellulosic ethanol. This ethanol, instead of being made out of grain, \nis made of plant fibers or out of woodchips. We amend the Federal fleet \nrequirements to reduce oil consumption by allowing electric drive \ntechnology to qualify under the EPA act.\n  We require 30 percent of the Federal fleet requirements to be met by \nadvanced diesel, hybrids, or electric plug-in hybrids by 2006.\n  We also provide tax credits for companies that have fleets of 100 or \nmore vehicles to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  We are all solidly behind the ideas in this bill. It has 28 \ncosponsors, and we look forward to moving these ideas forward because \nit is critical for our national and economic security and our economy \nand our future that we do so, plus it is just good old American \ningenuity that we would do something like this and lead the world in \nmoving toward an important electric renewable source fleet of vehicles \nfor our consumers.\n  Clearly, if we are to continue to live freely in this country, we \nmust figure out a solution to our rising dependency on foreign oil.\n  That is part of my support for S. 3711. Near term, we have to do more \nproduction. Longer term, we have to reduce our dependency and our \naddiction to oil, period. Here is a bill and a way we can do it. As we \nobserve what is taking place in the Middle East--even today we can see \nvolatility in that region. As we observe what is taking place in our \nmarketplace, I believe you can see a yearning for vehicles that get \nhigher mileage and we can use with plug-in technology.\n  I think we have to pass S. 3711, and then in the future let's move \nthis car fleet to be based more on renewables and to be based on plug-\nin technology using electricity.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to be able to accomplish \nthat. I urge us in the near term to do what we have to do--pass this \nbill which is before us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would be happy to yield during the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 minute \nto ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I chair the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  First, I thank the Senator for supporting this measure. It is vitally \nimportant that we tell the American people that the price of natural \ngas rose dramatically today again. There is a big demand.\n  I think it is exciting to see some Senator like yourself, who has a \nvision for other things besides this, saying let's do this because we \ncan do it now.\n  That is a point I want to make as chairman. Let's do this because it \nwill break the mold, break the precedent of moratoria of no deepwater \nmining, deepwater drilling, and get on with great production. But I \nwant to say to the Senator that I am aware of his bill. I am aware of \nsome of the great ideas in it. I heard him mention it. We had a hearing \non parts of it, as he probably knows.\n  I think it is fair to tell him that the truth is, with this short \nsession, in this Senator's opinion--I really worked hard to get energy \nlegislation passed and was able to pass a comprehensive bill that did \nsome terrific things. He knows that--ethanol, even in the area of cars \nhe is speaking of. We made some giant strides with that Energy bill--I \ndon't believe we could start with the Energy bill this late in the \nsession with the Senator's bill or somebody else's bill without doing \nnothing and just getting bogged down. I thought: Let's take what we can \ndo and do it. But I don't want the Senator to think the great ideas \nthat he has have been forgotten.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n                 GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have waited day after day in the \nSenate on political issues when we should be taking the Senate's time \nto make America more secure.\n  Last week, the majority leader mentioned port security in a long list \nof issues to be debated before the August recess.\n  While Senator Frist continues to pay lipservice to this important \npriority, I remain concerned that with only a week left before the \nAugust recess we have no firm schedule or commitment to bring this bill \nto the floor.\n  I am worried that while the majority says it wants to act, it refuses \nto put any action behind that rhetoric.\n  And here's the bottom line--if God forbid there is an incident at one \nof our ports--the fingers will point to this Chamber.\n  And people will want to know: Why did the Senate sit on a bill that \npassed\n\n[[Page S8340]]\n\nthe full House and passed the Senate Homeland Security Committee? Why \ndidn't we make these ports secure when we had the chance?\n  The only thing keeping the GreenLane bill from protecting us is the \nSenate's failure to take it up. We have to bring up and pass this bill \nbefore it's too late.\n  I am here today because nearly 5 years after 9/11 our country is \nstill vulnerable to a terrorist attack.\n  Just this week, an article in the Seattle Times showed us that our \nports are not secure.\n  A reporter was able to enter two West Coast ports simply by hiding in \ntrucks that were entering those ports.\n  The reported walked around cargo containers in areas that are \nsupposed to be secure.\n  In this case, the security gaps appeared to be on the ``land side,'' \nbut as the article notes--an incident at any port--whether from the \nland or sea side--could shut down all of our ports. Time is not on our \nside.\n  Each year, 6 million cargo containers enter U.S. seaports. And that \nnumber is expected to quadruple in the next 20 years. These cargo \ncontainers carry the building blocks of our economy.\n  But without adequate security, they can also provide an opportunity \nfor terrorists to deliver a deadly one-two punch to our country.\n  The first punch would create an untold number of American casualties.\n  The second punch would bring our economy to a halt.\n  Today, we are not doing enough to keep America safe. Standing in this \nChamber, it can feel like the dangers at our ports are a distant \nconcern. But given that our ports are connected to our Nation's \ntransportation system and are often close to major population centers, \nthe threat is never far away.\n  A recent example makes this threat crystal clear. On March 21, a \ncontainer ship called the Hyundai Fortune was traveling off the coast \nof Yemen when an explosion occurred in the rear of the ship.\n  About 90 containers were blown off the side of the ship, creating a \ndebris field 5 miles long. Thankfully there were no fatalities, and the \ncrew was rescued. Fortunately, this incident does not appear to be \nterrorist-related.\n  Now I want to imagine this same burning ship sitting just a few feet \nfrom our shores--in New York harbor or Puget Sound, off the coast of \nLos Angeles or Charleston, Miami, Portland, Hampton Roads, the Delaware \nBay, or the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Now imagine that we are not just dealing with a conventional \nexplosion. We are dealing with a dirty bomb that has exploded on \nAmerica's shores.\n  Let me walk through what would happen next. First, there would be an \nimmediate loss of life. Many of our ports are located near major \ncities. If a nuclear device exploded at a major port, up to 1 million \npeople could be killed.\n  If this was a chemical weapon exploding in Seattle, the chemical \nplume could contaminate the rail system, Interstate 5, and SeaTac \nAirport, not to mention the entire downtown business and residential \ndistrict.\n  At the port, there would be tremendous confusion. People would try to \ncontain the fire, but it's unclear who--if anyone--would in charge.\n  Then--when word spreads that it's a dirty bomb--panic would likely \nset in. There would be chaos as first responders try to react, and \nresidents try to flee.\n  Next, our government would shut down every port in America to make \nsure there weren't other bombs on other containers in other cities.\n  That shutdown would be the equivalent of driving our economy into a \nbrick wall. It could even spark a global recession. Day by day, we \nwould feel the painful economic impact of the attack. American \nfactories would not be able to get the supplies they need. They would \nshut their doors and lay off workers. Stores around the country would \nnot be able to get the products they need to stock their shelves. \nPrices for these goods would spike, as demand began to outweigh the \nsupply. And consumers would not be able to afford the items they rely \non every day.\n  In 2002, we saw what the closure of a few ports on the west coast \nwould do. It cost our economy about $1 billion a day. Imagine if we \nshut down all our ports.\n  One study concluded that if U.S. ports were shut down for just 9 \ndays, it would cost our economy $58 billion.\n  Next, we'd realize we have no plan for resuming trade after an \nattack--no protocol for what would be searched, what would be allowed \nin, and even who would be in charge. There would be a mad scramble to \ncreate a new system in a crisis atmosphere.\n  Eventually, we would begin the slow process of manually inspecting \nall the cargo that's waiting to enter the U.S. One report found it \ncould take as long as 4 months to get them all inspected and moving \nagain.\n  Finally, we'd have to set up a new regime for port security. And you \ncan bet that any new, rushed plan would not balance strong security \nwith efficient trade. Unfortunately, the scenario I just outlined is \nnot the stuff of fantasy. Rather, it is a realistic portrayal of events \nthat could happen tomorrow.\n  Nearly 5 years after September 11, we still have not closed a major \nloophole that threatens our lives and our economy. Time is not on our \nside. We must act, and we must act now.\n  I approach this as someone who understands the importance of both \nimproving security and maintaining the flow of commerce. My home State \nof Washington is the most trade-dependent State in the Nation. We know \nwhat's at stake if there were an incident at one of our ports.\n  That is why I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce to help us \nfind where we're vulnerable and to evaluate the best security \npractices.\n  It is why I have worked to boost funding for the Coast Guard and have \nfought to keep the Port Security Grant program from being eliminated \nyear after year.\n  Right after 9/11, I started talking with security and trade experts \nto find out what we need to be doing to both improve security and keep \ncommerce flowing.\n  Last year, I sought out Senator Collins as a partner in this effort. \nI approached Senator Collins because I knew she cared about the issue, \nI knew she had done a lot of work on it already, and I knew she was \nsomeone who could get things done.\n  Since that day, we have worked hand-in-hand to develop a bill and \nmove it forward. I am also grateful to Senators Lieberman and Coleman \nfor their tremendous work.\n  We know we are vulnerable. Terrorists have many opportunities to \nintroduce deadly cargo into a container. It could be tampered with \nanytime from when it leaves a foreign factory overseas to when it \narrives at a consolidation warehouse and moves to a foreign port. It \ncould be tampered with while it's en route to the U.S.\n  And there are several dangers. I outlined what would happen if \nterrorists exploded a container, but they could just as easily use \ncargo containers to transport weapons or personnel into the United \nStates to launch an attack anywhere on American soil.\n\n  In fact, in April, 22 Chinese stowaways were found at the Port of \nSeattle. They had reached the United States inside a cargo container. \nIn that case, they were just stowaways. Imagine if they had been \nterrorists sneaking into our country.\n  The programs we have in place today are totally inadequate. Last \nyear, thanks to the insistence of Senators Collins and Coleman, the \nGovernment Accountability Office found that C-TPAT, the program in \nplace, was not checking to see if companies were doing what they \npromised in their security plans. Even when U.S. Customs inspectors do \nfind something suspicious in a foreign port, they cannot force a \ncontainer to be inspected.\n  We have a very clear and very deadly threat. We know today that \ncurrent programs are inadequate. What are we going to do about it? We \ncould manually inspect every container coming into this country, but \nthat would cripple our economy.\n  The real challenge is to make trade more secure without slowing it to \na crawl. That is why Senators Collins, Coleman, Lieberman, and I have \nbeen working with all the stakeholders and the experts to strike the \nright balance. The result was the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security \nAct. It provides a comprehensive blueprint for how we can improve \nsecurity while keeping our trade efficient.\n  At its heart, this challenge is about keeping the good things about \ntrade--\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\nspeed and efficiency--without being vulnerable to the bad things about \ntrade--the potential for terrorists to use our engines of commerce.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield for a minute without her \nstatement being interrupted?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to do that if I can have additional time to \nanswer the Senator's question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask that following the remarks of the Senator, \nSenator Hutchinson of Texas be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is already part of the order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And that I, the Senator from New Mexico, follow her for \nup to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent request, \nthe Senator has already been recognized, but no specific time amount \nwas set for the Senator from Texas. Following the Senator from Texas, \nthe Senator from New Mexico will be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the GreenLane Maritime Security Cargo Act \ndoes five things.\n  First of all, it creates tough new standards for all of our cargo. \nToday, we don't have any standards for cargo security.\n  Second, it creates the GreenLane, which provides an even higher level \nof security. Companies have the option to follow those higher standards \nof the GreenLane, and their cargo--those companies which agree to \nthat--will be tracked and monitored from the moment it leaves a factory \nfloor overseas until it reaches the United States. We will know where \nthat cargo has been, we will know every person who has touched it, and \nwe will know if it has been tampered with. The GreenLane will simply \npush the borders out by conducting inspections overseas before cargo is \never loaded onto a ship bound for the United States. And we will \nprovide incentives for companies to use those higher standards of the \nGreenLane.\n  Third, our bill sets up a much needed plan to resume trade quickly \nand safely to minimize the impact on our economy.\n  Fourth, our bill will secure our ports at home by funding port \nsecurity grants at $400 million. That funding will help our ports and \nour port operators to develop and implement security plans. They can \nuse this funding to strengthen their perimeter of security, which would \nhave helped prevent a number of security lapses that were highlighted \nthis week in the Seattle Times article.\n  Finally, our bill will hold DHS accountable for improving cargo \nsecurity. The Department of Homeland Security is long overdue in \nestablishing cargo security standards and transportation worker \ncredentials. We need to hold them accountable. The bill we have written \nprovides the infrastructure to ensure accountability and coordination.\n  I take a minute to thank Senator Collins for her tremendous \nleadership on this critically important issue. I thank Senator Coleman \nfor his leadership and work as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations. Senator Coleman has helped expose our \nvulnerabilities, and he has worked with us to develop solutions. I also \nthank Senator Lieberman for his leadership on this issue. I commend all \nthe other cosponsors of our bill: Senators Feinstein, Snowe, DeWine, \nSalazar, Santorum, Graham, Cantwell, Durbin, and Byrd.\n  We are seeing tremendous progress on the House side with the Safe \nPort Act. I thank Representatives Dan Lungren and Jane Harman for their \nbipartisan leadership.\n  Finally, I thank the numerous Federal, State, and local officials as \nwell as all the industry representatives for their tremendous \nassistance in crafting this legislation. Those people truly are the \nfront lines of securing our Nation's ports. I have been very proud to \nwork with all of them.\n  Right now, today, we have a choice about how we deal with cargo \nsecurity and the challenges facing us. If we wait for a disaster, our \nchoices are going to be very stark. We should make those changes now on \nour terms before there is a deadly incident.\n  Let's protect America before an image like this hits our television \nscreens. Let's not wait until a terrorist incident strikes again to \nprotect our people and our economy.\n  Earlier this year, the American people woke up and spoke out when \nthey heard that a foreign government-owned company could be running our \nports. That sparked a critical debate. Now we need to set up a security \nregime that will actually make us safer. Until we do, none of us should \nbe sleeping well at night. A terrible image like this, a burning \ncontainer ship with a dirty bomb in one of America's harbors, could be \non our TV screens tomorrow.\n  This Congress needs to act today. We have heard the majority leader \nsay we need to address port security, but words will not protect us \nfrom terrorists, words are not going to help us find a bomb that is \nhidden in a cargo container, and words won't help us tell which \ncontainers could be holding a group of terrorists who are trying to \nsneak into our country. We need more than words. The Senate needs to \ntake up and pass the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act. We only \nhave a few days left before we can do this. We need to act. I urge the \nleadership, before the August break, to finally bring up and pass the \nGreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. I was very encouraged \nby the strong vote to proceed to debate on this bill. I hope we can do \nthis for the people of America to begin to see the energy prices in \nthis country start coming down.\n  I am a cosponsor of this bill. It is a compromise and reflects much \nhard work from all of the gulf coast producing States, including \nFlorida. I especially want to mention Senators Landrieu and Vitter from \nLouisiana, who have pushed for a long time for this kind of proposal.\n  The people of America are not interested in political rhetoric. They \nwant Congress to take action on the rising energy costs in this \ncountry. This is a potential near-term solution for a long-term \nproblem.\n  For too long, we have neglected our own resources in this country, \nincluding those in the Gulf of Mexico. This bill will bring access to \nmore than 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and natural \ngas, with the production in leases 181 and 181 south. It will provide \naccess to over 1.26 billion barrels of oil in these areas.\n  To put this in perspective, the average annual fuel consumption for \ncars and light trucks, according to the Federal Highway Administration, \nis 14.5 barrels of gasoline; that is, 607 gallons. This 1.26 billion \nbarrels of oil is enough energy to fuel approximately 87 million \nvehicles for a year.\n  We cannot afford to stand by and allow our import costs of oil to \ncontinue to increase. Since 2001, those prices have gone up 150 \npercent. Additionally, the bill will provide access to 5.8 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas.\n  To put that figure in perspective, it is six times the amount of LNG \nwe import every year, three times the amount of gas currently in \nstorage, and enough natural gas to serve 107 million households.\n  America's yearly natural gas bill has risen from $50 billion to $200 \nbillion over the last 6 years. This increase impacts farmers, ranchers, \nbusiness owners and households. We must continue to discover and \nsupport alternative energy proposals. Congress has done that. Congress \npassed a bill last year, signed by the President, that focused on other \nsources of energy besides oil and gas. We gave credits for solar power, \nbiofuel, ethanol, wind energy, all of which are renewable sources of \nenergy that are safe and environmentally clean. That has made a \ndifference. Even wind energy has now become almost 10 percent of the \nelectricity used in my home State of Texas. We know if we put together \na number of different kinds of renewable sources of energy such as corn \nand soybeans, it can be an alternative that takes a tremendous burden \noff oil and gas, which has been the largest supplier.\n  I am also encouraged that some of our largest integrated oil \ncompanies are moving toward those kinds of alternative fuels. I opened \na biodiesel plant\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\nin Galveston, TX, a couple of weeks ago. That is a step in the right \ndirection. It was being opened by Chevron. We are doing some good \nthings.\n  The global demand for oil and natural gas is rising at a rapid rate. \nThat is what is causing the prices to go up. We have to look to our own \nresources. One of those major resources is the Gulf of Mexico. I also \nhope we eventually will look at other resources, such as Alaska, which \ncontains comparable resources to that of the Gulf of Mexico.\n  We can do something ourselves with the resources of our own country \nif we combine the research and new emerging sources of energy as well \nas the old standard oil and natural gas sources we also have. If we \ndon't act, we are jeopardizing our economic and national security.\n  This bill also helps the States that are allowing drilling to \nmitigate the costs this production brings to their States. In my State \nof Texas, we have 367 miles of coastline which has sustained impacts \nfrom production. Texas has helped finance and support much of the gulf \ncoast production. The entire Nation has benefitted from lower fuel \ncosts due to these investments. This production, however, has had an \nimpact on my State and the coastal areas of my State. This bill will \nbegin to help mitigate those impacts. It provides the gulf producing \nStates, beginning in 2007, with 37.5 percent of revenues. Fifty percent \nwill go to the U.S. Treasury, and the rest, 12.5 percent, will be \nshared among all the States of our country. Every State is going to \nbenefit from passing this legislation.\n  Today, a barrel of oil is selling above $74.\n  Every American is feeling the impact. This is a piece of legislation \nthat can have a very positive impact very quickly. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation. Let's send it to the President. Those \nleases will soon be ready for bid. It is our responsibility to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, fellow Senators.\n  First, Mr. President, and fellow Americans, for those who have \nwatched the Senate over the last couple days, it must have been a \npretty enjoyable time because Senator after Senator came to the floor--\nmaybe 12 or 15 versus 2 or 3 opposed--12 or 15, all positive and for \nsomething, for a change, sending a signal here in the waning days of \nthis session before we go home for a recess when it is hot out there \nand the price of natural gas is going up. The people know it, and they \nare hearing rumors that pretty soon we are going to be importing \nnatural gas from all over the world, where we used to be a totally \nself-reliant country on natural gas.\n  We have made a mistake. In the last 17 years, every new powerplant we \nbuilt--because we were frightened to death of nuclear power--we built \nfor natural gas. We took this fantastic ingredient, this beautiful \nproduct of nature--natural gas--and we poured it into the powerplants. \nAnd we are still doing some. I did not think we were, but we are still \nbuilding a couple. Rather interesting. I do not want to even insinuate \nby saying where, but we are building some.\n  In the meantime, millions of American homes have done what everybody \nthought was right, and that was to hook on to natural gas. Then across \nthis land we built a manufacturing base, huge in size, made up of, for \nexample, the chemical industry. I assume the occupant of the Chair \nknows about industries like that. Many Senators do, and they probably \nhave been contacted by their industries--the fertilizer industry, the \nplastics industry, involving thousands of workers. What raw product do \nthey use for manufacturing so they can employ and sell products? \nNatural gas.\n  So what happened? We used it up. All of a sudden, we had a big \nproblem in the gulf and the price went through the roof. And we had \nsome rigging and a few other things occurring that we found out about \nwith that Houston company. But, in any event, what happened is the \nprice of natural gas skyrocketed and the supply produced by Americans \nfor Americans became insufficient to meet our needs, and we began to \nsay: We are going to have to go buy natural gas around the world.\n  What a frightening thing. We just got through this huge problem of \ngradual dependence upon foreign crude oil to where we are more than 60 \npercent dependent, and there is nothing we can do about it. We cannot \nproduce sufficient crude oil to change that equation, the crude oil \nneeded to run America's transportation needs.\n  And when we complain, remember the old idea of Pogo: ``We have met \nthe enemy and he is us.'' The transportation needs are 70 percent of \nthe oil used. And that is your cars, ladies and gentlemen, your SUVs, \nthe trucks and buses. That is 70 percent of the oil.\n  Now here we grow dependent for that. And here in America we grow more \nand more dependent upon natural gas. And here sits--while all of this \nis happening--along the seaboard of America a giant sea of natural gas \nand crude oil which has been taken off the market by what have been \ncommonly called moratoria or moratoriums, saying: Do not touch that \nbecause it is off the sea coast of California; do not touch that \nbecause it is off the coast of New Jersey. In this case, we have a \nsmall piece of Federal real estate. I am not going to put the maps up \nagain today, but it is 8.3 million acres. Sounds like a lot, but, \nbelieve me, when you look at the coast, it is small.\n  We are looking in this bill at 8.3 million acres, which we cannot put \nout to bid for American companies, large and small, to go drill for \nwhat is known to be there. What is known to be there? Oil: 1.2 billion \nbarrels. What else? Natural gas, that thing I just talked about that \nbuilds an industry, that builds a manufacturing base, that keeps the \nprice down. Right? It makes supply more rational.\n  There sits 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in that property. \nWell, that does not sound like anything except it is enough energy to \ntake care of 6 million houses for 15 years. That is pretty good if you \nlook at that as an average American.\n  So what we decided was: Yes, we surely, last year, passed a great \nenergy bill--which I will talk about in a moment--but we couldn't get \nthis one done, so let's get this one done this year for the American \npeople. I regret to say we were moving forward with, again, locked arms \nwith my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to get this done \nwhen we had to break. We had to break paths because I decided to stand \nfor the past would get us the fruits of the past, which would be \nnothing, so that if we did not share some of the revenue with the \nsurrounding States, we would still get no oil and gas, we would still \nbe in moratoria, and we would get no revenue for the Treasury and no \nrevenue for the States. But, most importantly, that beautiful product, \nnatural gas, and the crude oil that is there with it would still be \nthere and nobody could touch it.\n\n  So with that in mind, we worked and we worked and we worked, with the \nhelp of the great Senator, Mel Martinez, from Florida, who was \ncourageous, and we protected his State sufficiently, I think admirably, \nfor him to say yes. Today I understand his co-Senator said yes. Thank \nyou, Senator. Thank you very much, Senator Nelson. He came here and \nsaid yes. Four coastal States said yes. They had been saying no more, \nand now we have an opportunity.\n  We do not need to wait around and say: Let's add 20 other items for \nthe American people. You cannot add 20 more items. They still have to \ngo to the House. They do not have 20 items waiting around. So whatever \ngreat ideas are pending, we cannot pass them, first, because if you \nkeep adding them, it means you will not pass this bill, and, secondly, \nthey do not go anywhere.\n  So let's do this one for the American people. And if this happens, it \nsays, put that land out to the American drilling companies now, and a \nbig portion of it will be available within a year--within a year.\n  Now, I will respond to Senator Bingaman's points in opposition.\n  I do believe that every point he made in opposition is refutable, and \nI will refute them later. But I want to say the simple fact is we had \nto go our own ways for one simple proposition. Both of us understood we \nneeded to go ahead and deepwater drill this land, although with the \npassage of negotiations beyond the time that he and I--Senator\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\nBingaman and I--had reached accord, we added substantial property to \nthis arrangement. But the point of it is, we broke on the proposition \nof: Shall we bring a bill to the floor with no revenuesharing with the \nStates--which I concluded will never pass; we will not get it done, and \nwe will be right back where we were--or do we do what we have done here \nand say the abutting surrounding States get a portion?\n  Now, let's get this straight: The Federal Government still gets the \nmajority. They get 50 percent straight up of the royalty. And 12.5 \npercent is for the Statewide Land and Water Conservation Fund. And then \n37.5 percent over time--which is not much in the beginning, but over \ntime is substantial--is shared with the States that abut so they can \nsay: We are sharing in the burdens while we are joining in sharing in \nthe wealth.\n  We believe the precedent will flow, once this is done, and we will \nbegin to look to other States, such as the State of Virginia, perhaps \nthe Carolinas, perhaps Georgia, et cetera, and say: What about similar \narrangements later? But right now let's give the people a gift of what \nis theirs now by passing this measure.\n  Now, there is one very positive thing that is happening that is big \non the scene for the American people that is hard to appreciate because \nit takes time. That is the impact of the Energy Policy Act that is a \nyear old this August. The energy policy bill is beginning to take hold. \nI regret to say the higher the price of crude oil, the more \nbreakthroughs will occur on the part of innovators and technologists \nand companies that are making breakthroughs in terms of new kind of \ncars, new kinds of technology, because the price of crude oil is saying \nto them it is worth the investment and the risk in something new.\n  So the high price is bringing on new things. But the act we passed is \nbringing on huge results. We are in a renaissance period on nuclear \npower. I wish I could come here and show you the dedication of the next \nplant, but that takes a while. But 25 applications have taken place \nsince that act, 25 applications for nuclear powerplants. So the \nSenators who come down here and say: Why do this bill; why don't we do \nmore things; we did more things in this huge bill we passed. We created \na nuclear renaissance in the United States.\n  Second, we have a revolution in biomass which is going to change \nrural areas into a more vibrant and diverse economic rural America \nbecause we are going to use farm products to fill our gasoline tanks \nwith ethanol instead of crude oil. That is all in the Energy bill. The \ntargets are set. The huge mandate is set. And we are rolling with 29 \nnew plants having been built.\n  One of our Senators implied we should not be so narrow and take just \nthis bill. Just this bill? Just this bill is pretty much--the one we \nare talking about, right? It is big. It was said: We should not do \nthis. We should do many other things. We did the other things. I am \ntrying to tell you, we did many of them, and we probably should start \nwith a second round next year. But if we start trying to get more \ninstead of this, we will get nothing for the American people, nothing \nfor natural gas supply, nothing for our consumers to rely upon in terms \nof bringing the price of natural gas down. And that is what I want to \ndo and want to get done.\n  So the Energy Policy Act did what I have described, and many more \nthings, some of which I will describe later. But I am very proud that \nin the period of 12 months we will have passed an energy bill that has \ndone all these significant things. They are moving along.\n  Right now we are wondering about the reliability of electricity on \nthe grid. I can tell you that in the Energy Act the studies are just \nabout completed. Within a month to 2 months they will be ready. And \nthey will tell us how to fix the grid so it will be totally reliable, \nand the exchanges between the various portions of the electricity \ndistribution system will all be made reliable so you will not have the \nkind of blackouts we talk about.\n  That is because of the Energy Act. But you cannot do it immediately. \nIt is in the mill. That is happening, too. So when you look at it, \nCongress has done some important work in the energy field. Hybrid cars \nare coming on in large quantities because of the credit, plus the high \nprice of crude oil.\n  We can continue, but in a nutshell this bill is good for the people \nwho are burdened with the high cost of natural gas, the high cost of \noil. It is their property. We ought to develop it and do it now. So it \nhas been my privilege, having served here for quite some time, to be \nthe leader in this particular area. Of that I am very pleased, proud, \nand grateful.\n  I remind everyone, while natural gas was taking a little bit of a \nback seat to the rising costs of energy, it has now joined a parade of \nincreases. Today, my staff informs me that the price of natural gas \nreached a 5-week high, just in time for us to remind you that you \nbetter put this piece of property on the development table so that it \ncan be rendered a productive piece which will, in fact, cause that \nprice to continue to stop rising and to abate over time.\n  Mr. President, I have said on a number of occasions that passing this \nbill is the most important thing that we can do in the short term to \nmove toward correcting the supply and demand imbalance of natural gas. \nI would like to take the time to refute some of the specific criticisms \nmade against this bill by a handful of people.\n  First, I would tell you that if we do not develop our resources \ndomestically, this revenue sharing question will be moot--because we \nwill not have revenues to share. The capital will be spent overseas for \nforeign exploration and development and we will continue the cycle of \nsending our American dollars abroad for our energy sources for use here \nat home. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act begins to address this \nproblem.\n  Now, it is argued by a few that this bill is not worth doing because \nthe Minerals Management Service is proposing to open parts of the 181 \narea in its recently published 5-year plan. Critics argue that since \nthe administration has announced intentions or plans to open parts of \n181 equal to 2 million acres--containing approximately 620 billion \nbarrels of oil and 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas--it is not \nworth passing this bill which opens over 8 million acres with 1.26 \nbillion barrels of oil and almost 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. \nEven if I were to entertain that logic as being sound, let me tell you \nthe pitfalls of assuming that the administration lease sale will go \nthrough as planned.\n  It starts with the very point that the critics make. In November \n1996, the MMS announced and approved a 5-year plan that included an \nintention to offer 6 million acres known as the original lease sale 181 \narea for oil and gas leasing. The decision to include this area was the \nculmination of extensive consultation between the Federal Government \nand the State of Florida. However, in 2001 when the Department of the \nInterior went to lease this 6 million-acre area, the administration \nreduced the lease sale to 1.5 million acres. So recent past tells us \nthat if we hang our hats on the draft plan as critics seek today, we \nwill be disappointed. Critics say--trust the very process that \ndisappointed us a few years earlier in the very same area. I say--in \nthis bill--direct the Secretary to lease the area. I say--make it \nclear, make it direct and we will get all the resources, and there will \nbe no doubt.\n  I ask this to those who would rely on a draft plan as a certainty. \nSince the time you were in school, have you ever written a draft that \nwas the exact same as the final product? A draft is just that--a draft. \nIt represents what could be opened, not necessarily what will be \nopened. History shows us the peril of assuming that a draft plan will \nbe followed out to completion.\n\n  Furthermore, we should not assume that coastal states will sit by and \ngo along with leasing without the compensation needed to fix the energy \ninfrastructure and coastal environment that is so critical to our \ndomestic energy survival. Last week, the State of Louisiana filed suit \nin Federal district court to block the upcoming lease sale 200 off of \nLouisiana. They did so because they claim that our flawed policies were \ninconsistent with their State coastal plans. This should be a warning \nto all of us. Today marks the beginning of the end of the days of \nturning our backs on our coastal States while we turn our energy \ndollars over to hostile regimes.\n  The critics of this bill will also say that we took too much property \noff the table in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\nget the resources in 181 and 181 south. They point to the areas east of \nthe military mission line off the Florida coast and say that we have \ngiven up access to 21 trillion cubic feet of natural gas off of \nFlorida's coast. But this argument is illusory.\n  We do not have access to these areas currently. With or without this \nbill these areas are under executive moratorium--that has been set \nforth by two Presidents, one Republican and one Democrat--through 2012, \nand these areas have been under this executive withdrawal since 1990. \nFurthermore, for each of the past 16 years, Congress has placed an \nadditional moratorium on these areas without a whisper of challenge. To \nsay that this bill locks up these areas is not forthright.\n  These areas are locked up until 2012 and ultimately, under the \nauthority granted to the President over 50 years ago in the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act, the President can continue this moratorium \nat any time. The current executive moratorium expires in 2012 in the \nEastern Gulf of Mexico. This bill extends this time on certain areas to \n2022. Does anyone assume that the moratorium will be removed anytime \nsoon? Does anyone see a viable path toward lifting this moratorium in \nthe Eastern Gulf of Mexico off Florida in the near term? The answer, \nfor the time being, is unequivocally--no.\n  Furthermore, Secretary Rumsfeld is on record as saying that, while \nthe Department of Defense is fully supportive of the national goal of \nexploration and production of oil and gas offshore, the Department of \nDefense believes that any such activities east of the military mission \nline would conflict with essential military activities. Critics say \nthat it is my bill that locks up these areas when in fact, these areas \nare deemed essential to our Nation's military needs. Until the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and both Houses of Congress render a \ndifferent decision about this area, it is specious to suggest that this \nbill is locking up these areas to production.\n\n  Unquestionably, this bill opens up 8.3 million new acres to \ndevelopment of nearly 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.26 \nbillion barrels of oil. The proof of the substantive merits of this \nbill lie in its broad support around the Nation from America's \nagricultural community, manufacturing community, producers of chemicals \nand plastics, the textile industry, the utility sector, and small \nbusinesses. Literally, thousands of consumer groups representing \nmillions of Americans and millions of American jobs say the same \nthing--that S. 3711 provides the much needed relief for the American \npeople. I know that I only addressed a few of the criticisms of this \nbill, but I dismissed them, because they are not real. If I had all day \nto myself, I would continue to dismiss the criticisms one by one. I \nwill leave that to my many distinguished colleagues who support this \nmeasure.\n  But I will say this--the criticisms are not based in fact, but rather \ncling to a flawed philosophy of the past. Over the next couple of days, \npeople will trot out quotes, cases, statutes, and general precedent \nfrom years gone by. Mind you, all of this data and precedent will come \nfrom a time when we did not import 13.5 million barrels of petroleum \nper day from unstable regions of the world. All of this data and \nprecedent will come from a time when we did not consume 22.2 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas and pay more than 3 times the price for it \nthat nations competing for our jobs pay. All of this data will come \npre-Katrina and Rita, when our Nation's energy coast that hosts nearly \n50 percent our refining infrastructure was ravaged by natural disaster. \nI ask the critics to rethink their policy of the past, to reexamine \nthis precedent in light of the facts as they exist today, not as they \nwould wish for them to exist.\n  This compromise agreement is the best thing that we can do now in the \nshort term, to relieve the cost burden on the American consumer. \nAmerica is watching.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today proud to be \npart of a Republican majority that is working to build a future of hope \nby securing our homeland, securing our prosperity, and securing our \nvalues.\n  This week, we are debating a bill that will lower the cost of living \nfor all Americans by cutting the cost of gasoline, natural gas, and \nheating oil. By opening additional oil and natural gas reserves in the \nGulf of Mexico, this legislation will secure our homeland by reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil and securing our prosperity by providing \nreal relief to millions of Americans who are struggling to keep up with \ntheir rising cost of living.\n  Unfortunately, while there are some Democrats who are working with us \non this bill, most are threatening to obstruct this important \nlegislation even though it would help lower energy costs for American \nfamilies and increase our energy independence. We cannot allow a few \nextreme environmental lobbying groups to continue to hold our country \nhostage.\n  American businesses, both large and small, are feeling the pinch. \nRecent estimates show that since the year 2000, 3.1 million high-wage \nmanufacturing jobs have been eliminated or moved overseas, where energy \nsupplies are plentiful and costs are lower.\n  American families are also struggling to make ends meet. In a recent \nsurvey, nearly 80 percent thought the rising cost of energy was hurting \nour economy and threatening jobs; 90 percent of those polled said high \nenergy costs were impacting their family budget. Despite having been \nthrough the warmest winter on record, heating bills for homes that are \nheated with natural gas and oil went up nearly 25 percent. Last year, \nthe percentage of credit card bills 30 days or more past due reached \nthe highest level since the American Banking Association began \nrecording this information in 1973. The ABA's chief economist cited \nhigh gasoline prices as a major factor.\n  We recently had good news that Republican tax cuts continue to \nproduce strong economic growth and have helped to create 5.4 million \nnew jobs since 2003. But even as the economy grows and wages rise, \nfamily checkbooks still feel the pressure. If you get a $25-a-week \nraise but you have to spend $50 a week more than you did before for \ngas, food, or medical care, you are still $25 worse off than you were \nbefore. It is no wonder that Americans' optimism about their economic \nfuture has faded as concern over their cost of living has increased.\n  There is no quick fix to this dilemma, but there are many things that \nwill work together to secure our economic prosperity. We can address \nrising health care prices by making health insurance more affordable \nfor small businesses and individuals and by returning control to \npatients by ensuring that every American has a health plan they can \nafford, own, and keep.\n  Unfortunately, so far this year the Democrats have succeeded in \nobstructing these key things which would lower the cost of health care.\n  We can also invest in the flexibility and choice necessary to train \nthe best workforce in the world, so that we can attract the best jobs \nin the world.\n  Our goal as Republicans is maximum wage, not minimum wage. \nUnfortunately, again, the Democrats are obstructing ways that we can \ncreate more alternatives and choices to improve the quality of our \nworkforce and the amount of pay people earn.\n  We can also work to increase our natural gas and oil supplies and to \nreduce the cost of gas, increase America's supply of energy, while we \nencourage conservation and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  The good news is that Republicans are working--one step at a time--to \nsecure our prosperity. We understand the American people need real \nsolutions, not more Democrat obstruction.\n  Some say there has been no coherent Democratic energy strategy since \nearly in the Clinton administration. Well, I disagree. They have a \nstrategy; it is just the wrong one. As you can see from the chart \nbehind me, the Democratic energy ``policy'' is built on two key \nprinciples: raise taxes and block real solutions.\n  The Democrats, back in 1993, attempted to raise the taxes on gasoline \nby 7.5 cents a gallon. They were unsuccessful there. But with the \nDemocratic majority and President Clinton in the White House, they were \nable to add 4.3 cents a gallon to gasoline later in 1993.\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\n  The Democrats have blocked energy solutions by refusing to write a \nnational energy policy of their own during the whole 8 years of \nPresident Clinton's administration. They have tried to block President \nBush's comprehensive national energy policy, and they succeeded for 4 \nyears. As we heard from our chairman, last year, we were able to pass \na comprehensive energy bill despite Democratic obstruction. The \nDemocrats have continuously opposed our developing oil supplies in \nAlaska.\n\n  Let's look at one chart to show what happened over the last couple of \ndecades. This makes the point about what this does to energy prices. \nOur graph shows the increase in gas prices since 1991. At every point \nalong the way is when we voted to expand our oil supplies from Alaska, \nand at every point along the way the Democrats have blocked this and \nobstructed it and attempted to blame Republicans when gas prices \ncontinued to go up.\n  Let's go back to the other chart. The Democrats have blocked \nexpanding our refinery capacity, which we know is a key element in \nincreasing the cost of gasoline. We look at boutique fuels, which are \nthe regulation that has required refineries to produce different fuel \nblends for a number of different States. That raises the price. When we \ntried to change that, they blocked it.\n  Coming up to today, the Democrats have blocked energy solutions that \nwould lower the cost of gasoline for Americans and then they attempt to \ncome down here on the floor of the Senate to blame President Bush and \nthe Republicans when it doesn't get done. It is clear that active \nDemocratic obstruction has escalated the American energy crisis and \nincreased the cost of gas.\n  Republicans recognize that our energy problems didn't occur overnight \nand they won't be fixed overnight. But we understand that if we fail to \naddress rising American energy costs, we will create yet another \nincentive for businesses to locate overseas and leave American workers \nbehind.\n  To keep the United States competitive, we must transform our energy \npolicy to meet pressing short-term supply needs, while exploring new \nalternative solutions to meet the long-term needs for abundant, \naffordable, emission-free energy.\n  In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, we did just that, despite \nDemocratic obstruction. Now, our natural gas capacity has expanded by \n1.34 billion cubic feet a day, and 25 new nuclear facilities are being \nplanned. If these 25 plants are built, experts estimate that 15 million \nhouseholds will be powered by this zero-emission source of energy, and \n120 new, clean, coal-based facilities are in various stages of being \nplanned.\n  These are a lot of facts and figures to be sure, but the bottom line \nis that all these numbers translate into real savings both now and in \nthe future for American families.\n  But we must do more. To address the short-term issue of constantly \nfluctuating energy prices, we must eliminate Government-imposed \nregulatory roadblocks in order to increase our energy supply and get \nthese resources to consumers quickly and affordably. We can unshackle \nAmerican entrepreneurs--the best in the world--and allow them to fully \ndevelop our natural resources and still protect our environment.\n  Our long-term energy policy must focus on creating a diverse energy \ninfrastructure that includes new technologies such as hydrogen, fuel \ncells, and other alternative forms of energy. Many of these \ntechnologies--currently in early stages of development--have shown \ngreat promise and can revolutionize the way we fuel our cars, homes, \nand businesses.\n  Mr. President, energy costs are on the rise and the ball is in the \nDemocrats' court. For years they have complained about high energy \nprices and then blocked the very solutions that would lower them.\n  Republicans have real solutions on the table, such as the deep sea \nexploration in the gulf that we are debating today. We know it would \ndiversify our energy infrastructure, and it would increase our supply \nof affordable, abundant, and environmentally friendly energy. Most \nimportantly, it would reduce the cost of living for Americans and \nstretch their paychecks all the way to the end of the month.\n  I ask my Democratic colleagues to reject their leaders' tired \nstrategy of blocking real solutions and then blaming Republicans for \nthe problems that remain. Working together, we can bring down the cost \nof living for all Americans by reducing the cost of gas, increasing \nAmerica's supply of energy, encouraging conservation, and reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join the discussion \nabout the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, and I want to say at the \noutset that I support legislation to open up lease sale 181 as reported \nout of the Senate Energy Committee, and I support new environmentally \nresponsible energy exploration in the gulf.\n  Obviously, this legislation before us differs from what we passed out \nof the Energy Committee, and we are still looking at the various \nimpacts of this particular legislation. Some of my colleagues have come \nto the floor to talk about the larger energy debate, and I wanted to \nmake sure I came down and expressed my concerns and comments about what \nwe need to do to move forward on not just having a piece of energy \nlegislation come to the floor that only has one particular provision in \nresponse to our energy needs, but what we can do for a broader energy \nstrategy.\n  Many of my colleagues may have also turned on the television and seen \nthat oil companies continue to report astronomical profit, and the \npublic has a right to ask why. I hope that next week, when we take up \nthe legislation dealing with the reauthorization of the Commodities \nFutures Trading Act, we might be able to discuss the issue of price \ngouging and what we can do to protect the public from those kinds of \nactivities. I know many people in America are shocked to see, again, \nquarter profits from companies like Exxon jump 36 percent, and that is \nover last year's $10 billion record profit. So a lot of people in \nAmerica want to know what we are going to do not only in the short \nterm, but also in the long term on this energy issue.\n  I know that while we are only discussing this particular proposed \npiece of legislation on one issue, this Senator thinks it is very \nimportant to bring up a broader global context to the challenges that \nthe United States faces in this energy crisis and why it is imperative, \nwith everything going on in the Middle East, that we continue to be \nvery aggressive about a U.S. energy policy that will get us off of our \nfocus on oil and get us on to being a leader in the world economy not \njust in the United States on energy technology but around the globe.\n  Earlier this month, I spoke to the Washington Council on \nInternational Trade. That is in Seattle. It happened to coincide with \nthe 33rd anniversary that Senator Magnuson had taken a trip to China to \nvisit with the Foreign Minister. Maggie led that congressional \ndelegation after President Nixon opened up the door to China, and he \nhad a 2-hour meeting with the Foreign Minister there. It is interesting \nbecause there are notes from that meeting in which Senator Magnuson \nsaid he was going to talk about everything from the Pacific Northwest \nto energy issues, but he happened to scribble a little phrase on a \npiece of paper that is still recorded in history, which says that China \ncan no longer be an island in the world. I certainly believe that China \ncan no longer be an island in the world. Three decades ago, this policy \nwas correct, but it is even more important today as it relates to our \nglobal energy needs and the United States and China working together.\n  It is no surprise that China's influence has come to the forefront of \nthe global economy debate and that everybody realizes that we are tied \ntogether in so many ways. President Hu was recently in Seattle, and we \ndiscussed a variety of issues between the Pacific Northwest and, \nobviously, we have a great economic relationship in selling airplanes, \ncoffee, software, and a variety of agricultural products to China. We \ncontinued those discussions.\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\n  What we see today is that the global energy issues are prevalent in \nour trading relationship with China, and they are also important to our \nnational security issues and, obviously, to our environmental issues. \nThat is why I believe it is time for us to take up and establish a \nformalized, high-level dialog between the United States and China on \nenergy policy. There are various accidents of geology in this world, \nand I think I have said many times on the Senate floor that the United \nStates only has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. So when it comes \nto that situation, basically, China and the United States have landed \nin the same boat; that is, neither one of us can drill our way to \nenergy security within our borders. But both of our economies have \ngrown increasingly susceptible to these global energy spikes, and we \nneed to act aggressively together to address these issues from a global \nsecurity perspective.\n  As a result, I think it is in our mutual interest not to view \nourselves as competitors for scarce energy resources but as global \npartners in the race to move beyond the petroleum dependency. \nEstablishing a sustained cooperative relationship with China on energy \npolicy will open up new markets for new American technologies and \ncompanies that we can help create and foster with our energy policy \nhere.\n  Recently, Thomas Friedman wrote that you can, with these new markets, \n``turn Red China into green China,'' providing America with economic \nopportunity and a long-term environmental benefit.\n  But here are some of the facts: Today, China accounts for 40 percent \nof the increase in oil demand. The number of passenger vehicles on the \nChinese roads have more than tripled since 2001 and may equal the \nUnited States by 2030. So China faces a massive transportation \ninfrastructure modernization. We know there are still 30 million \nChinese who didn't, in 2004, have electricity. So trying to keep pace \nwith the growing demand, China is essentially adding a huge 1,000-\nmegawatt coal-fired plant to its grid each week. That is like adding \nthe capacity every year to serve the entire country of Spain.\n  These new coal plants have created problems such as widespread \npollution. Sixteen of the world's 20 most air-polluted cities are in \nChina.\n  Even with the influx of plants and patchworks to the grid, there are \nvarious areas of the country that still have uncertain access to power. \nIn 2004, China had a power shortage in 24 of its 31 provinces. They are \nstruggling with the mammoth task of trying to keep pace with their \nenergy needs. Since 2001, their consumption has grown at a rate 1\\1/2\\ \ntimes the growth of its overall economy. So we see that China, because \nit was poorly endowed with natural resources--except for coal--has \nincreasingly become dependent on oil imports.\n  Now China relies on the Middle East for half of its oil, which is \nsimilar to our circumstances. Beijing has been racing around the world \ntrying to lock in production for oil and gas in Canada and Saudi \nArabia, and they are looking at suppliers for a variety of energy \nneeds. Unlike the United States, they are looking in places such as \nSudan, Angola, Burma, and Iran. As one of our distinguished \ninternational national security experts, Henry Kissinger, has \nsuggested, energy resources may cause international conflict in the \ncoming years.\n  So what do we need to do about that? I believe we need to get serious \nabout this effort here and that the United States and China share \nconcerns about high oil prices. We have a common interest in working \ntogether to mitigate global supply shocks and resulting price spikes.\n  Both nations need to work harder to increase energy efficiencies and \nto achieve continued economic growth. There is no reason the United \nStates and China should not work together on the same side in virtually \nall international energy negotiations.\n  Currently, this is far from the case. Today, China views the United \nStates as a competitor in these energy markets, and we look at them the \nsame way.\n  The congressionally chartered U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission warned of a ``petroleum collision course well before the \nworld's aggregate petroleum supply is exhausted.''\n  I think they are saying that because they realize this collision \ncourse could be avoided if we work aggressively.\n  This Senator believes we must take three concrete steps that will put \nus on a proactive path for engagement and cooperation.\n  First, President Bush should work with President Hu to convene a \nU.S.-China energy summit.\n  Second, we should put at the top of our agenda an effort to establish \na U.S.-China working group with Cabinet-level leadership from the \nadministration. Establishing such a group was one of the major \nrecommendations of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission in a report to Congress in 2005.\n  Specifically, this proposal reinvigorated a 1995 U.S.-China energy \nefficiency and renewable protocol which I think we should get back to.\n  At the time, over 30 U.S. firms were involved in activities and \nprograms which were designed to strengthen the bilateral cooperation \nand advance the role of the private sector by the United States in \nChina's energy development.\n  A permanent working group would also be necessary to oversee any kind \nof joint R effort and could serve as an arbiter and negotiator for \ntechnology transfer issues.\n  And, third, I believe, in addition to the bilateral engagement, we \nshould work to bring China into a membership of the International \nEnergy Agency.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has thought a great deal about energy \nissues, energy cooperation, and protocols. The International Energy \nAgency is an intergovernmental organization with 26 different member \norganizations which prepares and seeks information about how to \nmitigate global supply and shocks.\n  In recent years, this organization has served as a clearinghouse for \ninformation on global energy prices and technologies. With China's \nmembership in this organization, I believe we would see a lot more \ncooperation and information that could help us mitigate some of these \nspikes.\n  Some people have looked at China's energy policy and called it \n``mercantilistic'' as they go around and buy up these resources at the \nwellheads in various regions of the marketplace. Encouraging them \ninstead to be involved in the IEA would move Beijing to be a more \nconstructive player in the global energy marketplace.\n  Clearly, these initiatives--a Presidential summit, establishing a \ndirect U.S.-China working group, and promoting China's engagement in \nthe International Energy Agency--are just a few steps down a very long \nroad to a complicated energy security issue.\n  But it is clear that the economies of the United States and China are \nnow intertwined, and our energy security should be considered with a \ncommon purpose.\n  This issue will color our relationship with China for decades to \ncome, but if we are direct and proactive in our engagement, there is \nalso opportunity, and an opportunity for the United States in meeting \nChina's energy needs is key to their domestic stability and economic \ngrowth. Improved cooperation between our nations could have significant \neconomic benefits for both countries.\n  Let me talk about that innovation for a second.\n  The reason I am raising this issue within the context of today's \ndebate is because we are missing an opportunity today. Rather than \nsimply focusing on drilling, we should be debating what is going to \ngive America and American companies the lead in 21st century energy \ntechnology.\n  Because there is an opportunity on the horizon in China and other \ngrowing economies, there is a huge opportunity to export American \ntechnologies and products, but we need to seize the technology lead to \ndo so.\n  Earlier, I spoke about the challenges China faces with its incredible \ngrowth in demand. Modernizing China's domestic energy infrastructure \nwill require a $35 billion investment. That is every year for the \nforeseeable year--$35 billion in investment every year for the \nforeseeable future.\n  So we must work to open up these Chinese markets to grid management \nsoftware, smart metering technology, new transmission technology, \nbiomass and biofuels, and related innovations. These things are \nemerging technologies in the United States, which we\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\ncould further accelerate not just for our domestic benefit, but also as \na supplier for that growing, demanding Chinese market.\n  Given the evolving nature of China's energy industry from its \ncomplete state-controlled entities into more hybrid models, we can help \ncrack open these markets, I believe, overnight, and gaining entry, once \nagain, requires us to be very proactive and engaged, with a sustained \ncommitment. I believe whoever develops these technologies that break \nthrough to these economies will hold the key to the 21st century. I \nwant the United States to be the technology leader there, and I want us \nto continue to look for these huge market opportunities to do so.\n  Essentially, China today has a 20-percent more fuel-efficient target \nthan we do. The 2005 renewable energy law mandates that 15 percent of \nChina's energy comes from renewables by 2020, and the plant also sets a \n20-percent savings standard for new appliances and other technologies.\n  Consistent bilateral involvement with U.S. counterparts through a \nU.S.-China energy working group could help foster the changes that we \nwould like to see with U.S. technology companies and could help us grow \nthose businesses and opportunities.\n  Figuring out how to navigate these barriers, as I said, I believe \nrequires greater cooperation and greater administration involvement in \nmaking sure there is a U.S.-China relationship.\n  The International Energy Agency estimates that China will spend $2.3 \ntrillion over the next 25 years to meet its growing energy demands, and \nthat just modernizing its electricity grid would require $37 billion \nannually, a figure that I referred to a few moments ago.\n\n  So these are great opportunities for U.S. markets. They are great \nopportunities to show that we can work together to be effective. For \nexample, already some organizations on the west coast are working \ntogether with private foundations and public-private partnerships. For \nexample, last year the State of California signed a pact with a sister \nprovince in China to provide technical assistance to work together on \ndemand-side technologies. The agreement came in large part due to the \nwork of the U.S.-China Efficiency Alliance, a nonprofit group that \ncounts as its founding members and leaders various State officials, \nacademics, environmentalists, and, obviously, some of the large \nutilities.\n  The reason China is a huge market for these kinds of opportunities \nand that this is taking place, obviously, from the west coast \nperspective is because the west coast has already had an aggressive \ntrade relationship with China and also has been aggressive about these \nclean energy technologies. So this is happening to a certain degree \nalready on the west coast, but it is a great economic opportunity for \nour entire Nation if we continue to accelerate it.\n  The question I have in mind today is, why are we ignoring this larger \ndebate and opportunity? Why are we not debating a larger energy bill \nfor the 21st century in which we continue to promote the energy \ninnovation that can lead to a cleaner environment, better energy \nsecurity, and certainly greater national security?\n  Fourteen years before he went to China, Senator Magnuson told the \nSeattle PI newspaper that failing to trade with China was basically \n``pretending 700 million people in the world don't exist.''\n  Thirty-three years later, it is about time that the United States \nreally understand that phrase. It is time that we understand the \ninternal transformation and opportunity to work together on energy \npolicy to solve some of our common problems and realize some of our \ngreat economic opportunities.\n  I hope next week we will continue to discuss various energy policies. \nI hope we will continue to open up this legislation to further \namendments so that we can get to other issues that will really help the \nUnited States succeed in addressing our energy challenges.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have come to the floor again today to \nspeak about the bill Senator Domenici and many of us have brought \nbefore the Chamber. The Presiding Officer has been a great leader in \nthis effort to fashion a bill that has many fine points and good points \nand needed points for the country.\n  One, it would provide us with a new source of oil and gas that will \nhelp us increase supply in hopes of reducing and stabilizing the price \nof oil and gas in this country. The other fine and wonderful point of \nthe bill is that it takes a portion of the revenues that are now going \ninto the Federal Treasury--but future revenues--and dedicates them to a \nconservation royalty, because Mother Nature every now and then needs \nits share, too. Being from Tennessee, Mr. President, and a leader in \nthe environmental area, you most certainly can appreciate the value of \nthat.\n  Of course, the great point for Louisiana, the gulf coast--not that \nthose two points aren't very exciting to us as well--is the chance to \nhave a new source of revenue to actually reverse decades of loss of \nprecious and valuable wetlands. These wetlands not only protect the 10 \nto 15 million people who live along the gulf coast from Texas to \nAlabama, but also that will restore the wetlands, which we in Louisiana \ncall America's wetlands because it is the mouth of the greatest river \nsystem in North America. So many of these wetlands help the industries \nof trade, commerce, oil, gas, fisheries, and the general environment \nfor the whole Nation.\n  But today I wish to speak a little bit more about the history of how \nwe got where we are today and then talk about the value to the Nation \nof taking such a positive step forward, a big step, a positive step and \na step absolutely in the right direction. Yesterday, Senator Domenici, \nthe chairman of the committee, and I spent some time clarifying the \nrecord regarding President Truman. The fact is, this was not Mary \nLandrieu's idea, as much as I would like to take credit for it; this \nwas Harry Truman's idea: to establish a partnership with the States \nwhen oil and gas was first discovered, knowing it would take a strong \npartnership to sustain this effort over time, and an interest on the \npart of the Federal Government, the local government, and the State \ngovernment to engage in the technology necessary and the financial \nwherewithal necessary to pursue this frontier, basically, whether it \nwas the frontier of the West or the frontier on the Outer Continental \nShelf, to get the natural resources to make this country great.\n  Now, of course, President Truman, having come from the experience of \nthe Second World War, really understood what he was talking about \nbecause although our military and the allied forces were quite \nspectacular in winning that war, sometimes I think we forget that it \nwas the steel workers and the iron workers and the shipbuilders and the \nboat builders and the women and the families who sacrificed at home, \nsaving their pennies to send every spare item we could for the \nmachinery necessary to win a war. Yes, it takes bravery. Yes, it takes \nmen and women in uniform. But it also takes a lot of steel, a lot of \nsupplies, a lot of petroleum, and a lot of natural resources to win a \nwar. America won that war in large measure because we had the natural \nresources and the military might combined to provide the strength to \nthe allied forces to win the great war.\n  It was America's oil production--America's oil production--that \nWinston Churchill said made him transfer the British fleet from coal-\npowered to oil. Here is a nation literally under siege, and a great \nleader makes a strategic decision. He would rather depend on American \noil than maybe his supplies of coal in Europe to give him the staying \npower to sustain that war. In the Second World War, German tanks \nstalled for lack of fuel, and Japan had to cut the operations of her \nfleet. It was America's natural resources that propelled our allies to \nvictory.\n  I think perhaps sometimes in this world in which we live, where \neverything seems so automatic and you just turn on a switch and the \nlights come on, you plug in your computer and it\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\ngets booted up, you turn your coffee on in the morning and it \nautomatically smells beautiful in your house, it takes a lot of effort \nto produce the energy which is necessary to make our lives the most \ncomfortable the world has ever known and perhaps will ever know. But in \nthe Second World War, they understood they needed lots of things to win \nthat war, and one of them was the natural resources of oil and gas. We \ndidn't know too much about the environmental aspects of it back then \nbut, frankly, all we cared about was getting our troops home, beating \nthe Germans, winning the war, and saving the world for democracy, which \nwe did.\n  Then, through the 1950s and 1960s, we got smarter, just as you should \nif you are growing all the time and you learn, and we understood better \nabout the environment. Then something went wrong in the 1960s. \nSomething happened in the 1960s. We forgot where we came from. We \nforgot the sacrifices that had been made. We had a very dramatic spill \noff the coast of California--not a pretty picture. The country was on \nfairly good financial footing, and we just sort of started backing up. \nIn my mind, we have been backing up ever since.\n\n  We need to get in a forward gear with a proper mindset to move this \ncountry back in the direction of natural resource production, with all \nthe benefits of the new technology, with all the benefits of knowing \nthe mistakes we made--no turning our back on them--not pretending the \nspills didn't happen, and not pretending oil and gas isn't a dangerous \nbusiness at times.\n  I can remember seeing on television one night--I think it might have \nbeen on the Discovery Channel, which is a wonderful channel my family \nenjoys watching--they were talking about how we first designed hot \nwater heaters. Of course, we take hot water coming in our house, clean \nwater in America and hot water, for granted. It happens so frequently, \nwe don't think about it. But when I was watching this on television, \nthe story was saying we didn't always have hot water in our houses and \nit was quite a feat to try to get hot water heaters.\n  In the beginning, when people had them--and I am sorry I can't \nremember the year--they kept blowing up, and they would just blow \npeople's houses up and people got hurt and people died. But nobody \nsaid: Oh my gosh, we just can't have hot water. We pursued and \ndeveloped the technology, and now we take for granted the most amazing \nthing which is in almost every house in America: you can turn on the \nfaucet--not in New Orleans, where you can't get any water pressure \ntoday, but in most places you turn on the faucet and get clean hot or \ncold water, to the temperature of your choice. But it didn't happen \nbecause there weren't accidents or problems, but we learned and we \nperfected the technology. You can say a thousand times how that \nhappened in America, but for some reason we got stuck on this natural \nresource issue and can't get off of it.\n  We have an opportunity this week to move past the 1960s and 1970s and \nto be responsible at a time when our country needs more gas and oil. \nNow, we are going to move beyond petroleum. We are going to develop new \ntechnologies. If Senator Domenici has his way, he would have the 15 new \nprograms we authorized in the last Energy bill funded to actually \ninvest in new technologies.\n  We are good in this Chamber about talking about things, but actually \nwe don't put the money to them. So we sort of pretend we are doing \nthings. But even saying that, we are making progress. I would support \nmore investments in alternative energies and real money for real \nprojects to move in that direction. But until we do and as we are doing \nthat, we need to drill for oil and gas where we can.\n  I want to show you here in America what the pipeline systems look \nlike today. This is the pipeline system: an extraordinary network of \nprivate sector--with government support--pipelines that bring gas from \nCanada, that bring gas in from the northwest part of Canada, bring a \nmultitude of riches from the gulf, the gas connections that move up \nthrough your State, Mr. President, all the way up to the Northeast. And \nthen you can see another in north Texas, in Dallas, Oklahoma gasfields, \nbecause, of course, Oklahoma and Texas understand gas. They have a lot \nof it. It is shallow in large measure, but they are producing a great \namount of gas for the Nation. This is what it looks like now.\n  This is the area which we along the gulf coast understand is rich in \nnatural resources, and we have almost perfected the technology to \nreduce the footprint, to drill far down into the floor of the ocean, \ndeep into the coastal areas here that are abundant in resources and \nprovide the gas necessary to keep people cool in the summer, warm in \nthe winter, and to keep the manufacturing sector of this country \ncompetitive because we have competitors now, big competitors--China and \nIndia--and if we don't want to lose every manufacturing job in America, \nand we are on track in some measure to do that, we better find some gas \nand oil somewhere here.\n  But in the 1960s, as I said, we got stuck in a place that has been \ndangerous for this country and went from being a net exporter to win \nthe greatest war ever fought. But in the 1960s, the situation flip-\nflopped and the United States became a net importer of oil, a situation \nwhich has deteriorated to the point where today we import 60 percent of \nour oil. It would be bad enough if we were importing that oil from \nfriends because when you deal with friends, maybe they would give you a \ngood price and maybe, even if it was tough for them to produce it, they \nwould still give it to you because they are your friends. But we are \nimporting oil from places in the world that are not friendly, that are \ndangerous. When the price goes up, they are happy if it goes up higher \nbecause they know we are dependent on it. I don't know if Americans \nfeel as strongly as I do, but I know people in Louisiana do. We are \nhappy to have a mutual dependence, I guess. We don't think we live on \nan island, but we don't like to feel dependent. We like to feel strong. \nWe like to have choices. When you owe people a lot of money or you get \nyour oil and gas from people and can't get it yourself, it puts you in \na dependent position--not a good place to be most of the time. That is \nthe place we are in right now in America. So one of the reasons this \nbill is so important is that it reverses 30 years of drift, 30 years of \nnot clear thinking about what dependency really means, and we have to \nmake the change.\n  I would like to see this bill be a little broader in its scope, but \nit has been a compromise, and that is the nature of our political \nsystem. This is not a dictatorship, it is a democracy. We on the gulf \ncoast have worked out a system that seems to work pretty well, \nprotecting Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, and respecting our \nfriends in Florida who have chosen a different path for this time, and \nthat is just the situation we are in right now.\n  I think as we open this 8 million new acres here and we can see more \nof the benefits for the whole Nation, that perhaps, as some of us \ncontinue to speak and travel the country and speak about the benefits \nof being less dependent on foreign oil and gas and more independent, \nmore self-sufficient, and developing alternatives and conserving where \nwe can as well, maybe the situation will change. But this is the step \nwhich needs to be taken.\n  Some people say: Oh my goodness, there is just not enough oil and gas \nhere. I want to tell you how much there is. It contains enough natural \ngas to heat and cool 6 million homes for 15 years. It holds six times \nthe amount of liquefied natural gas imports we are importing today. It \nrepresents more oil than we import from Saudi Arabia, and it will \nproduce more oil than found in the reserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma \ncombined. So I know when you look at the whole country and you see just \nthis little 8,337,000 acres, people say: Oh my goodness, that is not \nvery much. But it is more than the reserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma \ncombined. This is a very rich area, and Americans deserve to benefit \nfrom the natural resources that belong to them.\n  Believe me, people around the country, some people think: Well, they \nmust not care about their environment.\n  I do not have a statistic about this, but I bet people in Louisiana \nand Mississippi and Alabama and parts of Texas spend more time in the \nwater than anywhere else because we are hot most of the time and we \nlike to swim. We swim in our bayous and we swim in\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nour lakes and we swim in our gulf water, and we swim all year because \nit is warm all the time. Our temperatures are good throughout the year.\n  I do not have statistics on it, but I bet you we fish more per \ncapita. We have more fish than we know what to do with. I laughed when \nI told my children--I took them out fishing in the West--not to be \ncritical of the West. It is beautiful, of course. But we fished in a \nstream, and the rule was, after you caught three fish, you had to throw \nthem back. My son, who is 10 years old, said: Mother, I have never been \nto a place where you have to throw the fish back, because where we \nfish, we have limits, but they are pretty good limits. You can catch 30 \nredfish, lots of trout, and you keep them and then you eat them that \nnight. This would be a sad world if you had to throw back every fish \nyou caught. It is a matter of managing your resources. We do that very \nwell.\n  People look at me, and they think: Mary, you are not saying the \ntruth. But I am. The best fishing is around the rigs. The best fishing \nis around the rigs. And when you are on these rigs--these big \nplatforms--you can look down, and you can see the fish. I do not need \nto read this in a statistic. You can see the fish around the rigging. \nWhy? Because it acts as an artificial reef, and it creates a food \nsupply, and the fish naturally gather there. So we have been doing this \na long time in Louisiana. We would not suggest it.\n  We do have beaches. We do not have the same kind of beaches as \nFlorida, but we have a proud and beautiful wetlands. We are concerned \nabout our environment, and we know that while there every now and then \nare mistakes, the technology is getting better and better and better, \nand we can get American gas so we do not have to talk to Iran, if we do \nnot want to, we do not have to send our troops to Iraq unless there is \ngood reason, and we can keep our business right here in America.\n  I want my colleagues to know how appreciative I am, and Senator \nVitter, for the help and support for this bill and what it will mean to \nthe gulf coast and for Louisiana to save our wetlands. But I also want \nto say that for the Nation, as a Senator, I know this is the right \nthing. And it is long overdue. We have to open up resources in this \nNation and use the technology.\n  Now, I do not know when we got off this track. I do not know when it \nhappened. I do not know if it was gradual. But we have to be confident \nin our ability to move forward and to not be afraid but to be bold and \npress this technology so we can have the independence and energy we \nknow we must have.\n  I look forward to the day when I do not think my children will have \nto be dependent on either China for financing or the Mideast for oil \nand gas, that they can be like my parents' generation: pretty darn \nindependent. We better get back to that independency in this country. \nWe can make friends when we want to, but we do not have to when we do \nnot need to or do not want to.\n  In addition, I say to the Presiding Officer, because you have been so \ngood about this issue, I want to say something about a program. There \nis a program--we have tried to make it a trust fund. We did not \nsucceed. But in 1965 some very bold, progressive-thinking individuals \ncreated the Land and Water Conservation Fund because they knew the \nAmerican population was going to grow exponentially.\n  We now have almost 300 million people in this country, and many \npeople around the world who want to come and live here, as you know. So \nwe created the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a little program \nrelative to the billions of dollars we spend up here--only $450 million \nfor the State side and $450 million for the Federal side--to try to \nprovide some--in the scheme of things, it is pennies--to provide for \nparks and recreation and the expansion of bike trails and walking \ntrails and to preserve the great outdoors.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you have been a great leader on the \noutdoors. When you think about the beauty of the Smoky Mountains and \nyou think about the beauty of the Rocky Mountains in the West, you \nthink: Please, God, don't let us ruin that. Let us keep it.\n  Well, the way you keep it is not by wishing for it but by paying for \nit. And the way you pay for it is to put it in your budget. We tried \nthat, but it did not work. So in 1965 we spent $10 million in the whole \ncountry. In 1982, we spent nothing because it got zeroed out. Then, in \nthe 1980s, it went back up. You can see basically the high point was in \nthe late 1970s, at $350 million. One time, 1 year, we sent $350 million \nout to all the States, which is not very much money per State, to help \nthem with parks and recreation. Even though this was not much, I will \ntell you what this money did. It built thousands of parks and thousands \nof ballparks for our kids to play in and helped shore up the urban \nparks in New York and New Orleans and Memphis. It saved the redwoods. \nIt helped to establish the great wilderness in the Smoky Mountains. You \ncould go on and on with what this little money has done because it got \nsent to the States. They stretched those dollars, and they made it \nwork.\n\n  In this bill, we have a plan to fund this gradually until it will go \nup to, hopefully, $450 million out of new revenues. So it does not \ncontribute to the deficit. It does not take one penny against any other \nprogram. But it helps us to build the parks and recreational areas so \nmy children and grandchildren can continue to swim in those bayous, can \ncontinue to enjoy Lake Pontchartrain, and whether they are in an urban \narea in a little pocket park or in the great Smoky Mountains where they \ncould walk for days without seeing a person and only a few bears--\nwherever they are, they can enjoy it.\n  So that is a great thing this bill does. I hope it survives the \nconference and the negotiations because sometimes Mother Nature does \nnot have the advocates she needs here in Washington. This bill we have \npresented is not only good energy policy--because we need more \nproduction--it is good environmental policy, and it is good economic \npolicy.\n  One final argument I would make for the bill is this: I know anytime \nyou bring a bill to the floor, everybody has an important amendment. I \nhave several other amendments. People could not believe it, but I want \nto have several other amendments on this bill. I know my colleagues \nhave some great ideas. And they say: Well, why can't we debate all \nsorts of other things? Why do we have to debate the focus of this bill?\n  I have an answer for that. Because we debated, for the last 6 years, \nan energy bill. We debated for 6 years--day after day, month after \nmonth, for 6 years--up until a few months ago an energy bill. We had \nCAFE amendments. We had alternative fuels. We had reliability \namendments. We had nuclear power. We had amendments about how to \ndistribute the waste from nuclear power. Should we use electricity? We \ndebated and debated everything about it.\n  So I do not want people to be left with the impression that those of \nus who are on the Energy Committee provided no opportunity for people \nto debate. We literally took 6 years to pass--10 years--10 years, \nexcuse me, to pass the last Energy bill. So 10 years we debated. We do \nnot have 10 years. We have until August. We have until September. We \nhave to limit the debate. I know it is unusual, but we have to take, in \nmy view and in Senator Domenici's view, a positive step forward. We \nhave time again to debate CAFE. We debated it for the last 10 years, \nand we will debate it again.\n  But right now let's take this time to remember our history, to \nremember the great strength natural resources are for the country, to \nnot think of this as helping the gulf coast, which most certainly needs \nhelp, but that it is the right thing for America at the right time for \nAmerica, and in a way that honors the spirit of this body, which is \nopen to debate. We do many debates, and will continue, but for this \nbill, let's pass it. Let's send a signal to the American people that we \nare changing course.\n  Today's debate is focused on 8.3 million acres of submerged land in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, but it is really about something much broader and \nmuch more important. It is about our country's future.\n  It is hard to believe today, given the complete turnaround in \ncircumstances, but the energy reserves of this country were once the \nsecurity blanket for Western democracies.\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\n  When Winston Churchill, as First Lord of the Admiralty, transferred \nthe British fleet from coal power to oil, he did so knowing that it was \nAmerican oil production that he would rely upon in a crisis.\n  In the Second World War, as German tanks stalled for lack of fuel, \nand Japan had to cut the operations of her fleet, it was American \nnatural resources that propelled the allies to victory.\n  U.S. energy production was a strategic asset that allowed our economy \nto hum in the 1950s and become the envy of our competitors during the \ncold war.\n  Yet sadly, we allowed this great strategic advantage to slip away.\n  Economics played its part. At the same time as U.S. energy resources \nbecame more scarce, readily accessible oil from the Middle East started \nto come online.\n  By the 1960s the situation had flip-flopped. The United States became \na net oil importer--a situation that has deteriorated to the point \nwhere the United States must import 60 percent of the oil, making us \nthe largest consumer of energy in the world.\n  The truly frightening thing is that this country is bracing to allow \nthe same circumstance in natural gas. With seemingly no one guiding our \nstrategic energy direction, this Nation is now preparing to double the \namount of natural gas imported into this Nation by 2014. The country is \nfaced with 45 planned or proposed liquified natural gas terminals. \nWhile it is obvious we need them, we must also acknowledge that we are \nbuilding the infrastructure of dependence.\n  So one of the reasons this bill is so important, is that it reverses \n30 years of drift, 30 years of policy avoidance masquerading as an \nenergy policy. We are sending a signal to the American public and the \nworld that we are serious about regaining the strategic initiative in \nenergy.\n  We are in a hole that took a long time to dig, so we must understand \nit is going to take us a while to dig ourselves out.\n  But we are not going to allow American security to be crippled by \nthis strategic weakness any longer. The idea that we can do this by \nadditional exploration and drilling alone is false on its face. But it \nis equally false to say that the step we take today will not help.\n  For the first time in 20 years, America is taking approximately \n6 million acres of land that is currently under moratoria out of \nmoratoria. That is a signal that we are getting serious. Furthermore, \nwe are opening up a resource-rich region of the coast. It contains \nenough natural gas to heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 \nyears. It holds six times the amount of our annual LNG imports. It \nrepresents more oil than we imported today from Saudi Arabia. It will \nproduce more oil than found in the reserves of Wyoming and Oklahoma \ncombined.\n\n  That is an important step, and it sends an important signal to the \nworld.\n  A couple of months ago, I hosted a group of French Senators who are \ninvolved in energy issues for their nation. When I showed them a map of \nthe coastal resources that we have put off limits in this country, \ntheir mouths dropped. They could not believe that we would place so \nmuch of our security in foreign hands, while tying the hands of \nAmerican production behind its back.\n  We have taken an attitude that somehow drilling and tourism are \nincompatible no matter the distance involved. Do you know that our \ncolleagues in France are drilling for oil on the outskirts of Paris? \nNow that is making energy independence a priority.\n  Richard Holbrooke is well known to Members of this Chamber and has \nengendered real respect in the foreign policy community. He stated that \nour failure to reduce our dependence on foreign oil is the greatest \nfailing of this country over the last 25 years. I agree.\n  We can only wonder what an American foreign policy not hobbled by \ndependence on foreign oil would look like. I promise you this, everyone \nin the world would sleep a little safer.\n  Iran derives 50 percent its revenue, and almost all of its hard \ncurrency, from the sale of oil. We know where those revenues go. They \ngo to Katushka rockets, they go to Hezbollah terrorists, they go to a \ncovert nuclear weapons program.\n  It is fine to say that the United States does not buy oil from Iran. \nBut oil is a global market. It does not matter if it is Americans who \nbuy the oil from Iran or the Chinese. If demand is high, Iran will \nderive huge revenues.\n  The truly sick piece of this policy is that the American public pays \ntwice. First, they pay at the gas pump, and then they pay taxes so that \nour Government can spend billions of dollars trying to undue the evil \nthat Iran propagates around the world. It is like giving money to the \nneighborhood burglar so that he can buy a gun.\n  It is time that our country retake the high ground and the strategic \ninitiative on energy. This is only the first step of many. \nConservation, alternative energy, nuclear power must also all receive \nconsideration and attention from Congress. But this is a step that we \ncan take today.\n  It took the Congress a decade to pass an energy bill--we did it with \nbipartisan leadership last year. Imagine the signal we are sending by \npassing another important piece of energy legislation within a year of \nthat effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 3711, the Gulf \nof Mexico energy bill which is before the Senate.\n  At the outset of my remarks, I say I come to the Senate today to \nspeak about this particular bill with a heavy heart. It is a heavy \nheart because the approach which the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources has taken over the last year and a half has been a \ngood template for how we ought to do the business of our country; that \nis, bringing Republicans and Democrats together to try to work out an \nagenda in the best interests of America.\n  In this particular circumstance with this bill, with the opening of \nthe gulf coast of Mexico, we did have a bipartisan bill that emerged \nfrom the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \nUnfortunately, from the time it came out of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee until today, it has been changed in some \nsignificant ways.\n  The concerns that have been raised by ranking members are legitimate \nconcerns for several reasons. One is a reason related to the \nrelationships in this Senate and how we get along with each other to \ntry to come up with solutions to face the common problems we face in \nAmerica today. We were able last year in the Senate Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to put together \nthe kind of broad bipartisan coalition that emerged in a good bill. It \nwas not a perfect bill, but it was a good bill.\n  I hope the relationships that carried us to a successful conclusion \nwith the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will be more the norm around here \nthan the exception. I am hoping, as we work our way through this \nparticular legislation, that those positive relationships will also be \nrestored.\n  From my point of view, when we worked on the national Energy Policy \nAct of 2005, I saw that as an effort, as a Democratic and Republican \neffort to build a house of energy independence\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\nfor America. I saw the house of energy independence being built on \ncornerstones that are important for us to achieve energy independence.\n  We knew then and we know today that we could do much better with \nconservation. The experts at the Department of Energy tell us in the \nSenate, oftentimes in our Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, that we waste 62 percent of the energy we consume in America \ntoday. We in America can do better. We can do a lot better with \nconservation.\n  The experts also say we are at the dawn of a whole new revolution \nwith respect to biofuels. There are many Members of the Senate who have \nworked to advance the cause of biofuels over the last several years. \nThat renewable energy future for America has great potential to help \nbuild this house of energy independence.\n  Third, a key cornerstone is the new technology being advanced and \nexplored throughout our country, including the possibility of looking \nat things such as coal gasification. We know coal for the United States \nis no different for us than oil is to Saudi Arabia. We have vast \nresources of coal. The only problem we have with coal is when we burn \nit, there are environmental problems created. As we have the \ntechnological breakthroughs in coal gasification, we can take advantage \nof one of the greatest natural resources we have in our Nation. So \ntechnology is one of the cornerstones, one of the keys that will help \nget us to energy independence.\n\n  Finally, the development of our natural resources is very important. \nFor instance, on the gulf coast or mountain lands of my State of \nColorado, it is important that we develop those natural resources in a \nway which is sensitive to the environmental impacts created from that \ndevelopment.\n  As we move forward and look at the possibility of the increase in the \nmodest production which will come from the opening of lease 181 and the \narea to the south, we ought to look at other issues relating to energy \nand energy independence.\n  With gas prices over $3 a gallon and with growing instability in the \nMiddle East and a deepening dependence on foreign oil, today should be \nthe day in the Senate where we are talking about the broad array of \nideas relating to energy independence. We ought not to be so narrowly \nfocused on a very small development in the Gulf of Mexico--an important \ndevelopment, but nonetheless, in the grand scheme of getting us to \nenergy independence, it is simply a small step in that direction.\n  Now is a time for this Nation to embrace new ideas with regard to \nenergy. Now is a time for a real discussion of energy in this Senate. \nIt is time for a new direction for America as we look at the future of \nenergy for this country and for our world.\n  Gas prices today have jumped 25 percent in just a little over a year. \nAnd let's not forget they have doubled in the last 3 years. Today we \nare paying twice as much for gas at the pump as we were 3 years ago.\n  Second, we remember, at the near anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, \nthe great disruptions that were caused across America because of \nHurricane Katrina, those disruptions showed the vulnerabilities of our \noil and gas infrastructure.\n  Third, today we are facing a deepening cycle of violence and \nconfrontation in the Middle East, making it a stark reminder to all of \nus that our overdependence on foreign oil brings grave risks and \ndangers to America's security.\n  The American people and a large bipartisan group of Senators in the \nSenate share a vision for an energy-independent America. That vision is \none which is powered by renewable energy. It is a vision which \nrecognizes the new generation of clean coal and energy-efficient \ntechnologies. Unfortunately, because we are not allowed to amend this \nbill, we will not have the chance to have that discussion about these \nideas which have been generated by many of the Senators in this \ninstitution. We should allow those ideas to come.\n  I will highlight four ideas I believe we should be considering in the \nSenate today.\n  First, we should create a national renewable electricity standard. We \npassed a renewable portfolio standard less than 2 years ago in \nColorado. It is a modest standard. It was not a standard that required \n30 or 40 percent; it required 10 percent of the power the utility \ncompanies deliver to come from renewable resources by the year 2037. \nThat forward-thinking initiative has already spurred a boom in \nrenewable energy production in our State, creating jobs and \nrevitalizing rural economies. You see them in the wind farms in Logan \nCounty. You see it in the solar energy utility farms now being built \nacross my State. We can do the same thing on a national level. In fact, \nSenator Bingaman's renewable portfolio standard that passed in the \nSenate last year but was rejected in a conference with the House was a \nstep in the right direction. We should have that kind of a standard, or \nperhaps we could try flexible renewable electricity standards that \naccount for regional differences in our country. There is no doubt that \na renewable electricity standard would usher in a new era in renewable \nenergy production across the country. That would, in turn, reduce our \ndependence on fossil fuels.\n  Second, we should establish aggressive goals for reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil. We should employ the full force of our \npolicies in our Nation to achieve them. S. 2025, the Vehicle and Fuel \nChoices for American Security Act, which has 25 sponsors, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, establishes achievable goals of saving 2.5 million \nbarrels of oil a day by the year 2015, 7 million barrels a day by 2026, \nand 10 million barrels a day by the year 2030. We should be having a \ndebate on S. 2025 in the Senate today.\n  Third, we know we must do a lot more with biofuels. We must also do \nmore to put biofuel-powered vehicles on the road. Right now, the United \nStates consumes about 20 million barrels of oil a day. Two-thirds of \nthe oil we consume is for transportation. We need to substitute that \noil with biofuels, biofuels grown right here in America, on our farms \nand in our fields. To do this, we need to bring more gallons of \nbiofuels to the market. We need to give consumers access to alternative \nfuels at filling stations.\n  We need to retool America's vehicle fleet to run more efficiently and \non alternative fuels. S. 2025 does this, and we should bring to the \nfloor that legislation so that we can have a discussion about the \npositive contribution that would make on our road to energy \nindependence.\n  Finally, we should have a candid discussion of how we can improve the \nfuel economy of our vehicles. A number of proposals are circulating in \nthis Chamber that would, for example, raise CAFE standards or implement \na ``feebate'' program. Last week, Senator Coleman, along with Senator \nObama, and others, introduced a bill that takes a somewhat different \napproach to raising fuel standards--one that moves us in an honest \ndirection to have a much more efficient national vehicle fleet for \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, there are many other great energy legislative \ninitiatives circulating in this body. You see them in the Clean EDGE \nAct, the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act, the \nEnhanced Energy Security Act of 2006, the Alternative Energy Refueling \nSystem Act, and other bills that have yet to receive appropriate \nattention. We should bring them forward to the floor. It is not as if \nthey belong to one party or the other. The Roman philosopher Seneca \nonce wrote: ``The best ideas are common property.''\n  We ought to be thinking about energy independence, not as Democratic \nor Republican ideas. We should be thinking about them as American \nideas. The question is, How do we as an institution, as the Senate, \nmove forward in a new direction to get us to energy independence?\n  It is time that we write an additional chapter in the energy future \nof America that takes the building blocks of the Energy Policy Act of \n2005 and moves forward with the great ideas that have been developed by \nso many Senators over the last year.\n  Mr. President, may I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I see my colleague from New Jersey. \nThrough the Chair, may I ask the Senator how long he will be?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, recognizing that our colleague from \nthe other side is here, traditionally, we\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\nswitch sides on recognition. I ask that after our colleague from \nWyoming speaks, that I have 20 minutes to make mine.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nSalazar finishes his remarks, and Senators Thomas and Lautenberg \nfinish, I may speak as in morning business. I will revise that. I ask \nunanimous consent that after Senator Salazar is done and Senator Thomas \nis done and Senator Lautenberg is done, that I may speak, unless \nanother Republican comes to the floor, and that if another Republican \ncomes to the floor, that I be allowed to speak after that in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I think that order \nmakes sense as we proceed with the discussion and debate.\n  I want to make a point about the contributions of my State of \nColorado to oil and gas development for our country. We know natural \ngas prices are spiraling out of control, hurting families and farmers \nall across this country. Colorado farmers, for whom natural gas is an \nessential ingredient for their fertilizer, are already suffering under \nthe weight of very high gas and diesel prices. Now they are also having \nto pay record prices for fertilizer. Needless to say, they are \nstruggling to make ends meet.\n  Colorado is doing more than its fair share, much like Wyoming, to \nhelp our country produce more natural gas. There are currently some \n29,000 producing natural gas wells in Colorado, and industry estimates \nproject that between 24,000 and 27,000 new domestic gas wells will be \ndeveloped every year to meet the growing natural gas demand in our \ncountry.\n  I am proud that Colorado is home to such a wealth of resources and \nthat we can help our country through this energy crisis. But we have \nalso paid a price for these contributions. We know the development must \nbe done in an environmentally responsible way, but the rapid pace of \nexploration and development is having a huge impact on Colorado's land, \nwater, and communities. The vast open spaces of the Rocky Mountain West \nare home to pump jacks, pipelines, roads, and compressor stations. Many \ncommunities are very concerned. Hunters and anglers are seeing habitat \nloss and wildlife depletion. Local communities are fighting to protect \ntheir watersheds from lease sales that could jeopardize the safety of \ntheir drinking water.\n  While I am proud that Colorado can help satisfy the Nation's energy \nneeds, we should also be pursuing balanced production of our resources \nin the Gulf of Mexico. As much as possible, the country should share \nthe benefits and burdens of our energy production, including the \nproduction and revenues from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n  As I have said before, S. 3711 will make modest additions to our oil \nand gas supplies with additional leasing in the Gulf of Mexico. It is \nnot, however, a perfect bill.\n  I deeply respect the concerns that Senator Bingaman and several other \ncolleagues have made about the fiscal implications of this bill. The \nnew areas being opened for leasing, they point out, come at a high \nprice. These leases will be on Federal submerged lands on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, which belong to the taxpayers of all 50 States. Yet \n37.5 percent of the revenues from those leases will be paid directly to \nonly four Gulf Coast States--Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, and \nMississippi.\n  I appreciated hearing Senator Bingaman's thoughtful presentation on \nthe fiscal repercussions of this revenue distribution, and I applaud \nhis work on the OCS issue, both in this debate and in the consideration \nof S. 2253, which was a bipartisan bill that emerged from the Energy \nCommittee.\n  As I said, this bill is not perfect, but it does, for the first time, \nestablish direct funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nstateside grant program. It is truly historic that we are finally \ncreating an honest to goodness conservation royalty for offshore \nleases. I appreciate Senator Lamar Alexander's work on this initiative.\n  In 1964, Congress passed the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, \nwhich said that if we are going to drill for oil and gas in the OCS, we \nshould be reinvesting a part of those revenues in parks, trails, and \nopen space for the use and enjoyment of the American people.\n  President Kennedy's vision and Congress' vision was a bold one in the \nearly 1960s. They authorized $450 million a year for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund stateside grants program to be provided to States and \nlocal communities as matching grants, to help them build ball fields \nand trails, to help protect wildlife and open spaces across America.\n  Unfortunately, what was envisioned as a conservation royalty has been \nsubject to the budgetary whims of Congress. This meant that the program \nhas been consistently underfunded. Year after year, Congress has \nappropriated far too little money--an average of $94 million over the \nprogram's 42-year history. In the last 2 years, the President has \nproposed eliminating the program down to zero.\n  With this bill today, we finally create a permanent funding \nmechanism--a conservation royalty--that Congress envisioned in 1964. \nThis is a new chapter in the history of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund. It is the first step--only the first step--toward securing full \nand permanent funding for this overwhelmingly successful program.\n  As it is drafted, this bill does not provide the level of funding for \nLWCF stateside that the program needs.\n  I want to point to this chart, Mr. President, which indicates with \nthe red bar on the left side that the authorization amount for the LWCF \nprogram stateside is $450 million. It averaged about $94 million. About \n98 percent of the counties of America benefited from the grass from the \nstateside program. The amount of money projected to be supplied in the \nLWCF through this legislation is only $15 million a year. When you take \nthat $15 million a year and divide it among the 50 States, every State \nwould get approximately $300,000 per year on average. That is not a \nsignificant contribution relative to the historic amounts that have \nbeen made available to the States through the assistance of the \nstateside Land and Water Conservation Fund program. So it is important \nthat, as we look at this issue and this legislation, we recognize that \nwe should not be taking away the historic appropriations that have been \nmade to the stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund. I am hopeful \nthat we can ensure that those higher levels of funding for LWCF can, in \nfact, be made.\n  Mr. President, the prospect for LWCF stateside funding after 2017 is \na little less clear. Because spending after 2017 is outside the budget \nwindow, it is not included in CBO's score of the bill. But based on \navailable estimates of revenues and direct spending under the bill, it \nis likely that, beginning in 2017, stateside LWCF will receive at least \n$125 million per year. Indeed, it appears likely that beginning in \n2018--12 years from now--stateside LWCF will receive additional funding \nfrom ``new receipts'' from the area 181 and 181 south.\n  Mr. President, Senator Alexander and I introduced legislation, S. \n3562, that would fully fund the stateside LWCF. I have prepared an \namendment that echoes that. It would provide at least $125 million per \nyear of funding for the stateside LWCF program beginning in 2007 and at \nleast $450 million per year beginning in 2017. My amendment would \ndirect revenues from the renegotiation of leases issued for the \nproduction of oil and gas from the OCS that provides royalty relief \nwithout the necessary price thresholds.\n  The Federal Treasury is owed billions of dollars for those leases. \nThose leases mistakenly have provided royalty relief without these \nprice thresholds. My amendment, with its $125 million annually between \n2007 and 2016 and up to $450 million per year beginning in 2017, would \nensure that stateside LWCF will be adequately funded.\n  Mr. President, I wish we were having a larger debate on the energy \npolicy for our country. I wish we were bringing some of the new ideas \non energy legislation to the floor. I believe the American people \ndeserve a great public debate on our energy future and they deserve a \ncomprehensive forward-thinking energy policy. But for now, we must \nsatisfy ourselves with what is at hand: a bill that includes modest \nincreases in production in the Gulf of Mexico and, I am proud to say, a \nconservation royalty.\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Pryor be the next \nDemocrat to speak following Senator Wyden, with the understanding that \nwe will go back and forth to a Republican Senator in between them if a \nRepublican Senator is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have had a long and important \ndiscussion about energy. Indeed, there is nothing more important to \nthis country than to proceed with that. I am proud to say we have an \nenergy policy that is quite broad. Of course, our challenge now is to \nimplement that policy.\n  I rise today in support of S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act. I begin by saying that the economy is doing well; that we \nrequire greater supplies of energy is proof of that fact. There is more \ndemand than there has been in the past because our economy is strong. \nThis is not to say that Americans are not struggling with the costs of \nenergy. Of course, they are. We are. The price of gas, the cost of \nheating and cooling their homes, the need for electricity provides for \ndifficult problems. This is true in Wyoming, where we must drive long \ndistances, and we have cold winter seasons. We know how to solve the \nproblem. We need to increase our supplies.\n  The bill we are discussing today will provide 1.26 billion barrels, \n5.8 trillion cubic feet of American oil and natural gas.\n  There are, of course, many other things we must pursue. I understand \nas well as anyone that we cannot drill our way out of the energy \nproblems we face. We must support alternative fuels, renewable energy, \nclean coal plants, new nuclear capacity, and increased efficiencies.\n  Many of these efforts will take place over the longer term. Hydrogen \ncars, FutureGen, and the next generation of nuclear plants will take \ntime. There are plenty of good ideas to look for in the future. It is \nimportant, however, that we be realistic about what we can and should \ndo to provide for our needs in the meantime.\n  Many of my colleagues have their own energy proposals. I have \nintroduced a bill that would reduce the cost of energy for Americans, \nand it would do so comprehensively by addressing production, refining, \ninfrastructure mileage standards, and other conservation measures.\n  We need to pass the measure before us today, however. The bill we are \ndebating is a delicately crafted compromise. Chairman Domenici is to be \napplauded for his hard work on the measure.\n  The bill we are debating today will increase domestic supplies of oil \nand gas. It will do so in a way that is sensitive to the environment. \nIt will make us more secure and strengthen our economy, and that, of \ncourse, is the goal. It represents an agreement between the States that \nare most directly impacted by the gulf coast production.\n  The timing of this debate coincides with the release of second \nquarter financial statements. We heard this morning from the \ndistinguished minority whip about energy company profits. I feel \ncompelled to respond to the issue.\n  As I said before, there are many Members who have energy proposals. \nSome of them are bad ideas. Among the bad ideas is a windfall profits \ntax, and that is one of the worst. It does not work. I raise this \nbecause the idea or the notion of punishing companies is a knee-jerk \nreaction we deal with every time another fiscal quarter comes to an \nend. It should go away.\n  As we talk about the massive profits energy companies reap, we need \nto remember these are massive companies. It is inaccurate and \nmisleading to look at the dollar amounts. A more accurate measure is to \nlook at how the energy industry is doing relative to other sectors of \nthe economy. Let's take a look at the second quarter of the last year \nas an example. In terms of cents earned per dollar sales, the average \nacross the U.S. industry was 7.9 cents per dollar. Oil and natural gas \nearned 7.6 cents on the dollar, a reasonable return on investment. \nInsurance companies earned 10.7 cents on the dollar. Software companies \nearned 17 cents on the dollar. Pharmaceutical companies earned 18.6 \ncents on the dollar.\n  If we are going to talk about placing punitive taxes on successful \nbusinesses that bring so much prosperity to my State, that is fine. \nPlease know that I will ensure the inclusion of Connecticut's insurance \nfirms, California's software industry, and New Jersey's pharmaceutical \ncompanies in that discussion as well.\n  Energy companies are making massive investments. Drilling rigs, \npipelines, refineries, exploration, and other business requirements are \nnot cheap. They do profit from having made these investments, but it is \nnot out of proportion to other industries that operate in our global \neconomy. That is the truth.\n  Unfortunately, this sort of talk is not only part of our discussion \nthat must be further clarified.\n  When we talk about reducing prices for consumers in the short to \nmidterm, it is clear that increasing supplies is the effective way to \ndo so.\n  It is troublesome that those who complain most loudly about energy \ncosts are the same ones who stand in the way of responsible and \neffective measures to do something about it.\n  Wyoming has been doing its part in the national supply of energy for \na good long time. We need other States to follow. If you are not part \nof the production solution, don't stand in the way of States that are.\n  It is in fashion to oppose new development, for some reason. People \ndo so under the auspices of protecting the environment. We can produce \nenergy with very minimal impacts. We do it every day in my home State \nof Wyoming. It would be possible in places such as ANWR, too, if a \nminority of Members would not stand in the way.\n  We talk about NIMBY, the ``not in my backyard'' mentality. Now we are \ngoing to be told that it can't happen in someone else's backyard. We \nshould respect that in much the same way we are respecting the concerns \nof Florida in this bill, and we should respect the other Gulf States \ndesiring to allow development off their coasts.\n  Yes, they stand to benefit from the revenues generated by new \nproduction under this bill. I understand this production happens as far \naway as 50 miles from their shores. These energy products have to make \ntheir way onshore at some point, however. That requires infrastructure \nand ship traffic to maintain the rigs. There are impacts associated \nwith that. We ought to help States with those impacts if they are \nwilling to produce energy for our country.\n  These States are host to a significant amount of offshore \ninfrastructure as well. The 4,000 offshore platforms in the gulf are \naccompanied by dozens of refineries and countless production, \ntransportation, and marketing facilities.\n  Personally, I would like to see the revenues from offshore production \nused to reduce the national debt. We must base these decisions on the \nrealities that exist, however. We must recognize the burdens to be \nshouldered by the producing Gulf States. They provide nearly 30 percent \nof our oil and 20 percent of our natural gas. If we act in good faith \ntoward them, I am hopeful other States will recognize the value and \nbenefits of taking part in offshore production as well.\n  There are 19.3 billion barrels of oil and 83.5 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas in the ocean that are completely off limits right now. This \ndoes not make sense. We need those resources.\n  But what we need more right now is a bill on which we can agree. We \nneed something that can make a difference in the short term. This bill \nachieves that goal. It recognizes the value of increased production and \nstrikes the necessary balance to make those activities a reality.\n  I look forward to the passage of this bill, to move it forward to \nhave more production, to increase production and reduce the costs to \nAmerican users.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today we heard some interesting news. \nI would have used the term startling, but based on the news we are \nseeing from the various war fronts, it is hard to find anything more \nstartling.\n  The reference I make to this news is brought about by a report. I \ncome out of the corporate world, so I am interested in corporate \nperformance in this\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\ncountry. I saw the report. If you watch television or read the papers--\nExxonMobil, I would say, had a pretty good year. Their profit for this \nquarter was $10.4 billion--for the quarter. That is up from $7.65 \nbillion the same quarter last year.\n  That is pretty stunning news. It is the largest quarterly earnings of \nany corporation in America, save one. That is in the history of this \ncountry. In the history of this country, ExxonMobil, the quarter just \nended in June, was the second highest in the history of the country.\n  If they were selling widgets or some product, we would say: OK, that \nis a pretty good job. But when they are selling a commodity that people \nare literally begging for by way of availability, it is a different \npicture.\n  This oil and gas is so much a part of our life that it is almost like \nthe air we breathe or the water we drink. It is incredible.\n  That then spurred my curiosity. I am, going to file an amendment to \nthe Energy bill. I send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Is there objection to setting \naside the pending amendment?\n  In my capacity as a Senator from the State of Florida, I object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am sorry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nFlorida, I object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am not offering the amendment, Mr. President. I am \nsimply filing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was not clear. The Senator may \nsubmit an amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  This amendment is to change the bill's title, to call it the ``Lee \nRaymond Oil Profitability Act.'' I propose that we rename the Energy \nbill to reflect Mr. Raymond's profitability courtesy of ExxonMobil.\n  It is quite a thing. As we look at the turmoil this country is going \nthrough while people struggle at minimum wage jobs and we see the kinds \nof profits that are being made off the backs of working people, it \nstruck me, as I dug further into the history of the company--it is a \npretty well-run company, but it is so profitable because Americans are \ngoing to the pump and buying gasoline at over $3 a gallon typically. I \nhave seen it as high as $3.35 a gallon. People who work in these gas \nstations can't even afford to buy the gas they are pumping. That is how \nextraordinary this pricing is.\n  I come from the corporate world and I ran a very successful company. \nThe company is called ADP. It has been in business 50 years. I started \nit with a couple of other fellows, and we watched our profits \ncarefully. So I know how to read a financial statement.\n  When I see this, while people are stuck at minimum wage of $5.15 for \n9 years--I am going to detail some of the extraordinary results Mr. \nRaymond got as a result of his leadership in that company. The profits, \nI think, are unconscionable. I don't understand where Board of \nDirectors' conscience is, as I read his benefits program. There is no \nconscience, and there is no soul at all.\n  At the end of 2005, Mr. Lee Raymond retired from the chairmanship and \nCEO position of ExxonMobil. He was working and got a decent week's pay. \nI think his salary was running about $500,000 a week. That permits a \nlot of things to be acquired. But he also then held $151 million in \nstock options and holdings. His total compensation for 2005, including \nsalaries, stock options, and pension, totaled $140 million. He made \n$140 million running a gasoline company where prices typically have \ngone, since January 2002, from $2.24--and any of the audience that sees \nthis should mark it in their mind--it was $2.24 at the beginning of \nthis calendar year; it is now $3. That is the average price. So it has \nrisen some 36 percent I think is what the number works out to be.\n\n  It is incredible that during this period of time, while the average \nworking person is struggling and things are getting harder and harder, \nthe cost for gasoline, which is a requirement for virtually every \nfamily in this country--whether they have a car or are using fuel oil \nin their homes--it is outrageous that Mr. Raymond, in addition to those \nthings I just mentioned, has seen his package of stock ownership and \nstock options go from $151 million in this period of time--$151 million \nhe had at the end of 2005--to $250 million now, so it is a $100 million \nboost. Remember, he made $25 million in salary. But the absurdity of it \nall and the offensiveness of it all, is that Exxon's board also agreed \nto pick up Mr. Raymond's country club fees so he could make sure he \ncould buy enough golf balls for a round of golf. Country club fees, use \nof the company aircraft, and still pay him another $1 million to stay \non as a consultant for another year. Where is their conscience? I don't \nunderstand it.\n  So that is why my amendment would rename this bill the ``Lee R. \nRaymond Oil Profitability Act.'' That is what it ought to be called, so \neverybody knows what is happening in this country of ours. People are \nstruggling for a living with a $5.15 minimum wage, which has been in \nplace for 9 years. Those people are making $206 a week, if they are \nworking at minimum wage, and they haven't had a raise in 9 years. That \ndoesn't matter. Big business is the interest served by this Government \nand by the Bush administration. It is incredible.\n  When President Bush took over, gas was $1.06 a gallon. That was back \nat the end of 2000: $1.06. Now it is over $3 a gallon. Two years ago, \nPresident Bush threatened that if John Kerry was elected President of \nthe United States, he would tax gasoline. Look at this: From $2.24 up \nto $3, this year alone. There is no limit. But that doesn't bother the \nconscience of the board members of ExxonMobil, and it doesn't bother \nthe conscience of Mr. Raymond. If he asks for country club dues to be \npaid on top of everything else, to have an airplane for his private \nuse, he feels entitled to it. These are company expenses, and because \nthey are company expenses, they are tax deductible. It is shameful, I \nthink, and I hope we will do something about it.\n  I rise to speak against this so-called energy bill. The bill is \nsimply another gift to the oil industry. It is dressed up as some kind \nof benefit to consumers. I know the media likes to talk about who is \nwinning the debate on this issue or that issue. But you don't see these \ncommentators saying: Let's look back at the effects of legislation \nafter it is passed. So here we are considering a second Republican \nenergy bill. We should ask: What was the effect of the first Republican \nenergy bill? My colleagues across the aisle said of the first energy \nbill that it would lower gas prices as it goes into effect. Well, here \nis what we have seen happen in just this year alone: up by 36 percent.\n  A few months after President Bush signed the first Republican energy \nbill, gas prices started to soar. So now we know what happens when you \ntake care of the oil companies: Tax breaks and subsidies, and everyday \nAmericans get charged more, pay through the nose, as we say, and now we \nare ready for a repeat performance.\n  Will this bill help get gas prices over $4 a gallon? Think about \nthat, for the average family. Spend 80 bucks to fill up your gas tank. \nRight now you have to spend over $60 to fill up a 20-gallon tank. We \nhave to do a reality check about who is writing these bills. President \nBush and Vice President Cheney are both former oil company executives. \nThey focus on helping their friends in the oil business. Big oil \ncompanies want to open up our coastline to oil drilling, to platforms, \npipelines, and tankers.\n  Everyone jumps to attention in the Cabinet room there and they say: \nYes, sir, as they do here on the Republican side of the aisle. And the \noil companies' profits continue to explode.\n  Just this week, BP announced its largest quarterly profit in their \nhistory: $7.27 billion. BP is a piker compared to Exxon, which made \nover $10 billion. This was 30 percent more than the same period a year \nago.\n  I remember hearing in the Commerce Committee when we asked about \nprice gouging and so forth, and the oil company executives denied it: \nOh, we don't price gouge, no. Well, somebody is making a heck of a lot \nof money while people who struggle for a living have to pay more than \nthey can afford just to buy gasoline. Other big oil firms continue to \nenjoy record profits as well. Royal Dutch announced second quarter \nprofits of $7.3 billion, almost $2 billion more than the same quarter a \nyear ago. While Shell's profits increased 40 percent, its total revenue \nincreased less\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\nthan 1 percent. So look what has happened. Their profits increased 40 \npercent, but their revenues increased less than 1 percent. I would like \nto hear an economist or an accountant explain how wonderful their \nmanagement is, how good management must have been to pull that trick. \nIn other words, sales were relatively constant, but profits jumped \nsignificantly.\n  Then there is our favorite, the poster company, ExxonMobil. In 2005 \nExxonMobil raked in a record $36 billion in profits. That translates to \nalmost $100 million a day in profit and more than $4 million every hour \nin profit for one oil company. And while all of these oil companies \nprofit, consumers pay.\n\n  Now, as this Congress winds down its work for the year, the majority \nand the administration have proposed nothing that will lower gas prices \nat any time in the near future. They have nothing to offer in the way \nof a serious idea or a plan to reduce consumption, to improve \nefficiency, or to develop renewable sources of energy.\n  Whatever the question, the answer for this administration and the \nmajority in this Congress is always the same: Hand over some more money \nto their friends in the oil industry, and give them more opportunities \nto drill and explore in environmentally sensitive areas. What do we get \nin return? Higher and higher gas prices. And now they want permission \nto drill in areas that are sensitive, areas where an oil spill could be \ndisastrous. We had an oil spill in the Delaware River that separates \nPennsylvania from New Jersey, and it didn't look too bad, but the cost \nto clean it up was $267 million. So there are a lot of risks with \ndrilling in these areas. Higher prices aren't the only negative \nconsequence of this bill.\n  The bill is going to harm our grandchildren's birthright to enjoy the \nnatural beauty of our coastlines and beaches. I have seen the worst of \noil spills. I was sent to Alaska with the Coast Guard 3 days after the \nExxon Valdez ran aground. Exxon paid approximately $4 billion in \ncompensatory damages and the punitive award was $5 billion, and that \nwas in 1989. So we are looking at 17 years ago, and Exxon has yet to \npay a dime on the punitive damages. The company has smart lawyers, and \nthey have kept it bottled up in court. They say: Don't pay the bill, \nwhatever you do. ExxonMobil makes $10.4 billion in a quarter, and the \ncompany is still trying to get out of paying the $5 billion that \nresulted from the court decision.\n  It is clear the plan is to pass this bill in the Senate, and then \ncombine it with the House bill that opens up the coastal waters of New \nJersey, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, \nNew York, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, \nGeorgia, Florida, California, Oregon, and Washington State to oil and \ngas drilling.\n  The effects of even one spill off the shore of New Jersey would be \ndevastating. Tourism, a principal business for us, is a $26 billion \nindustry in New Jersey, and it supports 390,000 jobs. My State has \nalready seen how much economic damage can result from threats to our \nshore. In 1988, a bag of medical waste washed up on the New Jersey \nshore. The incident was widely reported in the media and we lost a \nthird of our tourism revenues that year--one-third of our tourism \nrevenue.\n  We can be sure of one thing: If we drill for oil, we will spill oil, \nand New Jersey and other States cannot afford to have oil washing up on \ntheir shores or polluting their water. States that depend on beaches \nand marine recreation and clean water for fishing and other activities \ncan't afford to have oil spills along those shores. Our commercial and \nrecreational fishing industries in New Jersey are worth hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. An economic catastrophe would result from an oil \nspill that reaches our shores, whether the drill rigs are located in \nthe waters off New Jersey or Massachusetts or Virginia.\n  In short, it is absolutely certain that the current bill can only go \nfrom bad to worse. This bill is a Trojan horse and it should be \nrejected by any Senators who are concerned about protecting their \ncoastlines and their coastal economies. It also should be rejected by \nSenators who care about developing a long-term, sustainable energy \npolicy, and by any Senator who has a vision for our country which says \nwe owe our children and our grandchildren a clean environment. We owe \nthem relief from what we see now. I have not even discussed fossil \nfuels and global warming.\n  In the Netherlands last week, they reported the hottest temperature \nin June--this past June--ever since temperatures have been recorded: \n1704, I believe, was the year. The hottest month ever since that time, \nsince 1704. We see evidence of global warming all over the place. I \ndon't hear anybody on the Republican side standing up here and saying: \nMy gosh, we have to find a way to get these temperatures normalized. We \nhave to find a way to reduce the number of hurricanes. We have to find \na way to reduce the ferocity of these hurricanes. We don't want any \nmore Hurricane Katrinas. But here we are, big oil companies are soaking \nthe public with $3 per gallon for gasoline. It is not fair. We can do \nbetter than ``more of the same.'' I hope my colleagues will hear from \ntheir constituents back home and oppose this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, am I recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Byrd are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are debating the Energy bill, the bill \nthat would allow drilling in deep sea waters off the coast of the \nUnited States in the Gulf of Mexico. We have heard a lot of \nconversation about that. I don't want to repeat all of the arguments \nthat have been made, but I want to put it in a perspective that I think \nmight be useful to some who would be watching.\n  Of course, we have this debate against the backdrop of $3-a-gallon \ngas. Everyone gets excited about that, and they say it is caused by \n$75-a-barrel oil, and what can we do to bring down the price of oil? \nThe law of supply and demand determines what the price might be.\n  There are those who think that is determined ultimately by oil costs, \nbut that is not true. It is determined by the world market, and the \nUnited States is only one country that is drawing on the world market \nand asking for this oil to fuel our economy.\n  We must start with the understanding that the world runs on oil right \nnow in a variety of ways and in a variety of places, which means that \neveryone in the world--whether they are in China or India, in Europe or \nthe United States--needs oil.\n  Why oil? Why don't we have other kinds of energy? The answer is that \nhistorically oil has been the cheapest source of the energy we need. \nPeople said: Well, let's have wind, let's have solar. Wind and solar up \nuntil now have been unable to survive unless there is a serious \ngovernment subsidy for it. As soon as the subsidy is withdrawn, all of \na sudden we can't afford to generate energy from these other sources \nbecause it is cheaper to generate it from oil. So we have the \ninfrastructure for oil built up, we have the infrastructure for \ngasoline for our transportation system built up, and it would take an \nenormous investment and a great deal of time to try to change it. So \npeople need oil.\n  All right. There is plenty of oil in the world, and it is relatively \ncheap to produce in some parts of the world. But what is known as the \nlifting cost--that is, what it costs to lift a barrel of oil out of the \nground and put it into that tanker--for Saudi Arabia is about $1.50. \nYou can produce a barrel of oil at a cost of about $1.50 in Saudi \nArabia. The lifting costs elsewhere are much higher than that.\n  If we come to my home State of Utah, where we have more oil than they \nhave in Saudi Arabia, the lifting cost to get all of that oil is around \n$30 to $40 a barrel because the oil is locked up in rocks known as oil \nshale. That is why we don't produce oil from oil shale--not because it \nisn't there but because it can be produced more cheaply someplace else.\n  Since it is a world market, people put their oil on the world \nmarkets, and the world law of supply and demand determines what will be \npaid for it. The key number to keep your eye on to determine what the \noil is going to cost is\n\n[[Page S8356]]\n\nthe excess capacity that is available. Let me explain with some \nnumbers.\n  Right now, the world as a whole is using about 85 million barrels of \noil a day. The world capacity to produce oil is about 86 million \nbarrels a day. These figures are not exact. They never are. They change \nfrom day to day. But let us use them as representative figures to \nillustrate the point.\n  All right. If you are in a position where you have to be sure you can \nget your oil for your future needs and you look at the world situation \nand say: You know, there is only a million barrels a day of excess \ncapacity out there, and that million barrels a day could disappear with \nthe snap of a finger--a problem in Iran, a decision by the oil minister \nin Saudi Arabia, another outburst--explosion, if you will--by the new \nPresident of Venezuela. A million barrels a day is not enough excess \ncapacity to guarantee me that my oil will be there when I need it, so I \nwill bid a higher price than I normally would pay just for the \ncertainty that the oil will be there when I need it.\n  So the oil goes from $50 a barrel to $60 a barrel to $70 a barrel. We \nhave seen it approaching $80 a barrel. Then when word comes out: Well, \nthat excess capacity is a little more than a million barrels a day. \nWell, I may not want to bid quite so much for the oil. And the price \nwill settle down a little. When there are indications that the supply \nof oil will be more secure in the future, the price starts to come \ndown.\n  This is what we see in what is called the futures markets because \npeople are buying oil for the future. They are making long-term \ncontracts.\n  All right. The key ingredient in bringing the price of oil down is to \nmake sure the surplus capacity above the amount of oil we use gets \nbigger and bigger. Right now, as I say, it is only about a million \nbarrels per day. If it were 2 million barrels a day, if there were an \nadditional source of oil, then the price would come down because you \nwould have a bigger cushion to be sure you can get your oil in the \nfuture.\n  Look, there is overcapacity of 2 million a day. Back in the days when \noil was available for $30 a barrel or $25 a barrel, the excess capacity \nwas 5, 6 and 7 million barrels a day. People were comfortable making \nlong-term contracts because they knew that excess capacity would make \nthe oil available to them.\n  Just as a side note, in this body, we approved, along with the House \nof Representatives, back some 6 years ago authority to drill in Alaska. \nPresident Clinton vetoed that bill. It takes about 6 years for that \nkind of investment to bring oil on line. If the bill President Clinton \nvetoed had been signed, we would have an additional million barrels a \nday of oil on line in the world right now. That would virtually double \nthe amount of excess capability that is currently available. But that \nwas not done. We are where we are.\n  That is why this bill we are debating is so important--not just for \nthe amount of oil that is there but for the amount of increased \ncapacity it will deliver to the world markets when it comes on line. \nAnd then what happens? Then, by virtue of that amount of excess \ncapacity above the amount the world is using, the futures price for oil \nwill start to come down. That is the way the law of supply and demand \nworks. Around here we have never been able to figure out a way to \nrepeal the law of supply and demand. That particular law trumps \nvirtually everything else we do.\n\n  That is one of the reasons I am supporting this bill, to say the time \nhas come for the United States to have that impact on the world price \nof oil by virtue of our ability to produce that additional capacity.\n  But there is something else here as important as oil with respect to \nwhat is available to us in what we call area 181, and I am talking \nabout natural gas. The same thing that I have to say about the impact \nof excess capacity on oil applies to natural gas. Natural gas is \nsomething more than just energy. This is why natural gas is doubly \nimportant. Yes, we use natural gas to heat our homes. We use natural \ngas to cook our meals. We use natural gas to generate electricity. \nNatural gas is the fossil fuel of choice. Everyone wants it. Everyone \nsays it is clean, it is plentiful. Historically, it is cheap. Let's put \nin natural gas. When everyone wants it, that means the demand for it \ngoes up, that means the supply gets tight.\n  We discovered a few years ago something about natural gas that is \nvery obvious but that some people had not realized. Natural gas is the \none form of energy we cannot import. Natural gas gets imported by \npipeline. The only place we can bring in natural gas once we have \ntapped all of the natural gas available in the continental United \nStates is by pipeline from Canada and Mexico. There is a lot of natural \ngas elsewhere in the world, but we cannot bring it to the United States \nbecause it comes in by pipeline.\n  Now, it can be liquefied. It can be put on a ship. It can come here \nas LNG, liquefied natural gas, but we don't have that many ports that \ncan receive LNG. It is a very major financial investment to build the \nport, to equip the port to handle LNG, to build the tankers that can \nhandle LNG. There are those who are doing that, but in the meantime the \namount of natural gas available in the American economy is confined by \nthe rising demand.\n  Natural gas, the petrochemicals in natural gas, are a critical \nelement of the chemical industry. When the price of natural gas goes \nup, the price of all of our chemicals goes up. It is a critical element \nin the fertilizer industry. We are proud of our capacity to produce \nenough food to feed all of America and still make it a major export, \nbut we cannot do it if the cost of fertilizer drives farmers off the \nland. And the cost of fertilizer is tied to the cost of natural gas.\n  When you realize that in area 181 there is not only enough oil to \nchange the balance of the overcapacity that can bring down the futures \nmarket in oil, there is also enough natural gas to have a significant \nimpact on the price of natural gas and help us with lower costs in the \nchemical industry, lower costs in agriculture, lower costs with \nfertilizer across the board, you realize that opening this area for \nexploration and drilling is something that should have been done a long \ntime ago.\n  We know one of the main reasons why it was not. It has to do with \nState interests and State concerns about what will go on. This bill \nvery cleverly and carefully crafts a series of royalty incentives to \nget the States on board.\n  With Senator McConnell, I went down to Mississippi and then to New \nOrleans to see firsthand the devastation. In the presentation that \nSenator McConnell and I received was an exposition of the damage out in \nthe Gulf of Mexico to those lands that have acted as some kind of a \nbarrier for future hurricanes. That area desperately needs to be \nrebuilt. It needs to be rebuilt for economic reasons, it needs to be \nrebuilt for environmental reasons. It is in serious trouble. The State \ncan't afford to rebuild.\n  But with the revenues that are in this bill for the State of \nLouisiana, there is a possibility that they can start to rebuild and \nproduce enormous benefits for all of their people and for all of the \ncountry. This becomes a source of revenue that can be dedicated to that \nparticular ecological activity that is good environmentally and good \neconomically.\n  So you put it all together, you have a bill that I think should pass \nunanimously. I know it won't. We never do anything unanimously around \nhere unless it is completely noncontroversial, and something of this \nkind always has a little controversy connected to it. It probably comes \nas close to being the right bill at the right time in the right place \nas anything we have seen.\n  A year ago we passed a comprehensive energy bill that has us started \ndown the road toward increased nuclear activity with respect to \ncreating electric power. This bill, coming a year later, is a logical \ncompanion piece to the bill we passed a year ago because it starts us \ndown the road toward alleviating the upward pressure, the constant \nupward pressure on the price of oil and the price of natural gas and \ndoing it in a way that those States that have previously resisted this \nkind of economic activity now say we understand and we will participate \nin a beneficial way. That is why this bill is bipartisan. That is why \nit is supported by the Senators from the States most heavily hit by \nKatrina and the other hurricanes that occurred.\n  One of the things Katrina taught us that should give us further \ncomfort as we debate this bill is that our technology for deepwater \ndrilling is sufficiently stable that it can withstand a\n\n[[Page S8357]]\n\nhurricane of Katrina's force and not produce any kind of an oil spill, \nnot produce any kind of an ecological difficulty.\n  It is interesting to recognize the greatest ecological damages from \noil spills have come from tankers bringing oil across the ocean, rather \nthan from oil platforms drilled in the ocean. If we want to reduce our \ndependence upon the oil being shipped in the most dangerous way in \nterms of the environment, we should pass this bill and proceed with \nthis activity.\n  It comes as no surprise that I express my strong support for this \nbill for economic reasons, for environmental reasons, and for long-term \nplanning reasons. It is, as I say, the right bill at the right time and \nin the right place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wyden are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have enjoyed hearing my distinguished \nfriend from Oregon, who is always an effective and enthusiastic \nadvocate. We worked together on many things, and I hope we will on many \nmore things in the future.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the price of natural gas and how we \ncan get it down. We have an opportunity to do that next week in the \nSenate. The Senate is considering the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security \nAct of 2006. It directs new oil and gas leasing in 8.3 million acres of \nthe Gulf of Mexico. It directs the Department of the Interior to begin \noil and gas leasing in designated parts of what we call lease sale \n181--that is just the name of a geographic area--no later than 1 year \nafter the bill becomes law, and directs leasing in 181 south, an area \nbelow the one just described, as soon as practical.\n  From the revenues that come from that, we will deal with those in the \ntraditional way. First, there is a royalty, and 37.5 percent of the \nroyalty will go to the affected States, which I assume includes \nLouisiana and Mississippi and Alabama, and perhaps the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Texas. Then 12.5 percent will go to the State side \nof the Land and Water Conservation Fund under an arrangement that has \nbeen in the law for 40 years, to take some of the money we use from \noffshore drilling and use it for State parks, soccer fields, city \nparks. The money goes to the States.\n  We do a lot of things here in the Senate, and some may sound more \nrelevant than others. But this is legislation next week that will \naffect blue-collar workers in America, it will affect homeowners, and \nit will affect farmers. It could affect the price of gasoline. The \nprice of gasoline is set by the world marketplace, as the natural gas \nprice is as well. But the major effect, I think, will be on the price \nof natural gas. Let me explain for a few minutes why I am talking about \nnatural gas instead of gasoline.\n  If you stop and think about natural gas, one could easily argue that \nan extraordinarily high price for natural gas has more of an effect \nupon the lives of Americans than an extraordinarily high price of \ngasoline. A year ago, when the price of natural gas was about $15 a \nunit--to put that into comparison, that would be about the same thing \nas if gasoline were at $7 a gallon. That would be about the same thing. \nNow, imagine that. What if gasoline were $7 a gallon across the United \nStates? We would have revolutions from Odessa, TX, to Mountain City, \nTN, and North and South, and in every direction. People would say: We \ncan't stand that.\n  Well, we were having a very hard time a year ago with the natural gas \nprices at $15 a unit. Now, fortunately, they are back down to a little \nbelow $7 a unit. But this economy of ours, this United States of \nAmerica, was built on a natural gas price of about $2. So it is three \ntimes as high as we were accustomed to it being.\n  And what difference does that make? Well, if we pass this legislation \nnext week, we can reduce--or at least begin to stabilize--the price of \nnatural gas, and that helps American workers. A lot of speeches are \nmade here--and the Presiding Officer has heard as many as I have--\nsaying no more outsourcing. Let's not send jobs overseas. Don't let \nthem go to Germany, India, and China. Why don't we adopt policies that \nstop that?\n  Here is a good way to stop jobs from going overseas. There are 1 \nmillion jobs in the chemical industry in the United States today. These \nare good, high-paying jobs. Most of them are blue collar, but many are \nwhite collar. These are manufacturing jobs in the United States of \nAmerica, millions of them. A place like Eastman Chemical in Kingsport, \nTN, is an example. Eastman Chemical, as far as we are concerned in \nTennessee, has been there about as long as the Great Smoky Mountains. \nMy uncle used to work there. In the Appalachian part of Tennessee, \nwhere income has never been high, for a long time Eastman has paid a \ngood, high, steady wage to families. It has transformed the area. There \nare good schools, good roads, strong families, and good communities, \nwith 10,000, 12,000, or 15,000 jobs right there in that area. People \ndrive 50 to 80 miles to go to work. Some have been working there three \nand four generations. Eastman makes chemicals. Out of what? The major \nraw material for chemicals at Eastman is natural gas.\n  The president of Dow Chemical testified before the Energy Committee \nthat natural gas, used as a raw material, accounts for 40 percent of \nDow's costs. So if the price of natural gas goes from $2 to nearly $7, \nas it is today, or to $15, as it was last year, what do you suppose \nhappens? If Eastman is going to expand, or if Dow or another company is \ngoing to build another plant, are they going to build it in the United \nStates? No, those jobs will go overseas, and they have been. There are \nmaybe 100 chemical plants being built around the world. Only one is \nbeing built in the United States, and the major reason is the high cost \nof the raw material, natural gas.\n  So there is the first reason the vote we are having on Monday \nafternoon at 5:30 makes a difference to the average American and to all \nAmericans. Well, none of us are average. We are all individuals. We \nlike our jobs. There are a lot of jobs at stake, and it is not just the \nchemical industry that is affected by the high cost of natural gas.\n  A year ago, the Tennessee Farm Bureau joined me in sponsoring a \nroundtable on natural gas prices when they were at $15. One of those \nwho was at the roundtable was the president of Saturn. The General \nMotors Saturn plant came to Tennessee when I was Governor. It is an \ninnovative plant, and we are proud that they chose Tennessee. At the \nroundtable, the president of Saturn said to me: We have done about all \nwe can, in terms of efficiency, to deal with this incredible cost of \nnatural gas in our automobile plant. After this, it is going to begin \nto affect the cost of our cars.\n  If the cost of auto parts suppliers and the cost of automobiles that \nare manufactured in the United States goes up, the jobs go overseas. If \nyou can put an engine plant in Germany, or some other kind of supplier \nin Mexico, they will do that because of the high cost of natural gas. \nSo it affects manufacturing.\n  The Tennessee Farm Bureau was helping me host that roundtable because \nthe high cost of natural gas affects farming. Farming uses a lot of \nenergy and uses a lot of fertilizer. The biggest raw material in \nfertilizer is usually natural gas. So the price of fertilizer doubles \nwhen the price of natural gas goes up like that.\n  The rising price of natural gas affects millions of Americans--\nworkers, farmers, and also those who are heating and cooling homes with \nnatural gas. What do you suppose the local gas company does after a \nwhile when the price of natural gas goes from $2 to $15? What do you \nthink that will do to your local bill? It is going to go right through \nthe roof. For retired families, for low-income families, the high price \nof natural gas hurts. So the vote we are having on Monday is about blue \ncollar workers, about farm families, and it is about all the families \nwho heat and cool with natural gas. That is the importance of natural \ngas prices.\n  Now, I see my friend from Arkansas here. I assure him that I am not \ngoing\n\n[[Page S8358]]\n\nto be too extensive in my remarks. I look forward to his. I have a few \nmore things I would like to say.\n  The second point I want to make is that the bill we are dealing with \nMonday is part of a comprehensive plan. I have heard a few colleagues \ncome here and say we cannot drill our way out of this big problem we \nhave with oil. They are absolutely right about that. Everybody in this \nSenate knows that because we spent 10 years working on a comprehensive \nenergy bill--the Energy Policy Act--which we enacted about a year ago \nafter weeks and weeks of debate. It could have been called the \n``Natural Gas Price Reduction Act.'' I am not going to stand here and \nsay that bill is the reason the natural gas price has gone from $15 \nlast summer to $7 today, but I hope it helped.\n  Market forces overrode all of that. But the Energy Policy Act surely \nput us on the right path, because to reduce the price of natural gas \nand to begin to stabilize the price of oil and make sure this big \ncountry of ours, which uses 25 percent of all of the energy in the \nworld, has a steady supply of reliable, low-cost energy that is clean \nand as carbon-free as possible, we set this country on a different path \nby passing that comprehensive energy legislation a year ago, and we \nstarted with conservation.\n  We need to be more aggressive about conservation, and there may be a \nconservation bill that we ought to enact later this year or next year. \nWe also aggressively moved to encourage nuclear power because nuclear \npower produces 20 percent of all of the electricity in America and 70 \npercent of the carbon-free electricity in America. That means it is our \nmajor weapon against global warming. If my friend and fellow \nTennessean, Al Gore, were to do a sequel to ``Inconvenient Truth'' and \ncall it ``Inconvenient Truth II,'' it would be about nuclear power. \nThat is the solution to global warming.\n  So, first, we encouraged conservation. Then we began what is turning \nout to be a renaissance of interest in nuclear power.\n  Third, the Energy Policy Act included incentives for clean coal. We \nhave a lot of coal. So if we make more electricity by nuclear power and \nmore electricity by coal and we conserve to begin with, then there is \nless demand for electricity made from natural gas and the price goes \ndown. Almost all of our new electric powerplants over the last 10 years \nwere made by natural gas. That is like burning antiques in the \nfireplace to heat your home. That is a pretty dumb way to go about the \nbusiness of producing electricity.\n\n  Let's conserve, build nuclear powerplants, encourage the use of clean \ncoal, recapture the carbon, deal with global warming, reduce the price \nof natural gas, and that is not all. We also made it easier in the bill \nlast year to import liquefied natural gas from overseas. That is a \ncomplicated process. We don't want to get into the same shape in \nnatural gas that we are with oil, where we get most of it from \noverseas, but we can increase imports of LNG. Bringing it into \nterminals here and piping it into our system helps increase our supply, \nand that lowers the price and, apparently, that has begun to work.\n  Renewables help. There are some things we can do in that area. We can \nmake ethanol from corn. We can make biodiesel from soybeans. I held a \nroundtable in Tennessee on biodiesel the other day. I even heard in a \nhearing that a factory is opening in Oak Ridge that will make ethanol \nfrom coal. We can make fuels from other sources, but we need a lot of \nfuel for cars and trucks, and we need a lot of fuel for electricity in \nthis country that uses 25 percent of all of the energy in the world.\n  One thing we did not do last year was take any significant step to \nincrease the supply of natural gas that comes from the United States. I \nthink any logical person would say if you are going to take a \ncomprehensive look at the high price of gasoline and the high price of \nnatural gas and its affect upon Americans, you would want to include \nincreasing the supply while we are transitioning to other forms of \nenergy production. This is going to take us 5 or 10 years. In the \nmeantime, we don't want to pay $7 for gasoline and $15 for natural gas. \nOne way to do it is to increase our supply.\n  That is why we are voting on Monday on deep sea exploratory drilling \nin one of the most promising areas in the world for more natural gas. \nThat is what we call Lease Sale 181. Someone said on the Senate floor \nthere wasn't much gas down there. I heard the Senator from Louisiana \nsay the following, and I believe this is true: It is enough to heat 6 \nmillion homes for 15 years.\n  It is six times the amount of the liquefied natural gas that we are \nimporting today in the United States. That is a lot of gas. It is more \noil than we import from Saudi Arabia, our principal supplier of \noverseas oil. It is more oil reserves than Wyoming and Oklahoma \ncombined.\n  So in our great big economy, where we use 25 percent of all the \nenergy in the world, it may only be a small part of our overall needs, \nbut it is a lot when you think about heating 6 million homes for 15 \nyears. And I suspect that if we move ahead aggressively to tap this new \nsupply of natural gas and oil, it will help to stabilize the price of \nnatural gas and might even move it down a little and help the blue \ncollar worker, the farmer, and the homeowner.\n  Some say that energy independence is not a real goal. I don't agree \nwith that. What I mean by energy independence is that the United States \nwill not ever again be held hostage by some other country. It doesn't \nmean we won't buy oil from Mexico or natural gas from Canada. But we \ndon't want to have to do that if we don't want to. So that is why, in \nthe comprehensive Energy bill last year, we accelerated research for \nhydrogen fuel cell vehicles and gave incentives for hybrid cars. We \nwant to reduce our dependence of oil overseas and transform our economy \npermanently. We don't want to drill our way out of the problem. We all \nknow we can never do that.\n  Over the next 5 or 10 years, we'd better make sure we use the oil and \nnatural gas we have available in this country if we want people to be \nable to drive their cars, work their farms, keep their jobs, and pay \ntheir bills. That is what we will be voting about Monday at 5:30.\n  We have been extremely careful with the environmental impact of this \nbill. I am very proud of Senator Domenici and others for what they have \ndone on this issue. These rigs will be 125 miles away from Florida. You \ncan only see about 20 miles out to sea. So that is a long way out. They \nare out of the way of airplanes and military craft. The technology we \nhave means there is more natural leakage of oil from the sea floor than \nfrom all these rigs out there. So the environmental damage is minimal. \nPlus, we are going to take half the revenues from this drilling and use \nit for environmental purposes. I think that is great. Mr. President, \n37\\1/2\\ percent goes for wetlands and other areas in the Gulf Coast \nheavily damaged by hurricanes, and 12\\1/2\\ percent is an outdoor \nrecreation and conservation royalty. It is not a lot of money, but it \nbegins to say that we are going to have an environmental benefit. It is \na balanced formula that a majority of Senators can easily support.\n  Mr. President, this is a focused bill. This is a little left over \nwork that we didn't get done last year when we passed a comprehensive \npiece of energy legislation that put that ``freight train'' energy \npolicy moving slowly down the track in the right direction, toward \nlarge amounts of clean, low-cost, reliable, domestic-produced energy.\n  We had in that bill conservation, nuclear power, clean coal, and we \nmade it easier to import natural gas. We had extensive support for \nrenewables, but we didn't do anything about domestic supply. This \nfinishes the job. So that is why this is a focused bill.\n  There are many other great ideas about energy, and whenever we \nsubject ourselves to an energy debate, it will take us a long time \nbecause we have many good ideas and opinions. But from time to time, we \nneed to take a focused idea about which there is emerging consensus and \ndo it.\n  Two years ago, you could not even mention the idea of offshore \ndrilling here. Last year, we had a majority of votes in the Senate for \nit, but we could not get to 60. This year, we got 86 votes on the \nmotion to proceed, and we have a broad bipartisan consensus. I suspect \nin future years we will find other ways to permit, say, Virginia, for \nexample, if it chooses, to permit drilling for oil and gas in certain \nareas offshore where\n\n[[Page S8359]]\n\nthe rigs cannot be seen, and use some of those revenues from drilling \nto create a trust fund for education, use them to lower taxes, or use \nthem to improve the coastlines of Virginia. I know if I were Governor \nof a coastal State, I would do that in a minute. I would rather not \nhave an income tax, and I would rather have the best and biggest trust \nfund for my university system. That is exactly what Virginia could do, \nbut we are not doing that here. We will address that when there is a \nconsensus about it. There is a consensus about this.\n\n  As we move toward the end of the week and as people begin to think \nabout what the Senate is doing that affects their lives, if you are a \nmanufacturing worker in this country, we are going to affect your life \nat 5:30 on Monday afternoon. If you are homeowner paying your bill for \n105-degree heat with natural gas, we are going to affect our life at \n5:30 on Monday afternoon. If you are a farmer and have seen the price \nof fertilizer double, we are going to affect your life at 5:30 on \nMonday afternoon. We are going to vote for you if we vote for the \nenergy security bill on Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 3711. I found \nthe comments of our colleague from Tennessee, the distinguished junior \nSenator from Tennessee, very interesting. Basically, he and I are on \nthe same page on this issue; that is, I hope S. 3711 is part of a \nlarger, smarter energy policy for this Nation.\n  There are really two sides of this equation, and then there are some \ncomplications in between. Basically, the two sides are supply and \ndemand.\n  We have not done a lot on the supply side in the last few years, so I \nthink it is important for us to look at drilling as an option. \nCertainly lease area 181 makes a lot of sense. We have infrastructure \nthere. Generally speaking, we know how much oil and natural gas is in \nlease area 181. It is not a big stretch for people in those industries \nto get out there and find that oil and gas and get it to the \nmarketplace. So traditional drilling in that sense makes a lot of \nsense, in my mind.\n  Also, I hope the Senate will continue to work on legislation to \nencourage alternative fuels, such as biofuels--I know the President in \nhis State of the Union Address mentioned cellulosic fuel, and that is \nimportant--ethanol, agriculture products, animal waste, et cetera. That \nis just smart energy policy, and it creates a supply of energy. And \nthat is very important.\n  On the other hand, we need to look at demand and we need to look at \nconservation. Certainly, this country can do much more with regard to \nconservation, with some industries and some aspect of our economy, and \nalso efficiency. We need to become more efficient and smarter and use \ntechnology to try to get smarter on our energy usage.\n  I certainly concur with what the Senator from Tennessee talked about, \nsupply and demand. We know under the current conditions gas prices will \nnot go down by themselves. We are going to have to do some things in \nthis country to help the oil markets get where the American public want \nthem to be.\n  Also, S. 3711 on offshore drilling makes a lot of sense because it is \nnarrowly focused and narrowly tailored. It is the right policy at the \nright time. Maybe one of the more controversial parts of this bill is \nrevenue sharing. I am from an interior State. Under the circumstances \nas presented today, I don't have any objection to revenue sharing. I \nknow Arkansas will not benefit as much as the States on the coast, but \nthat is OK. We know the devastation the hurricanes caused in that \nregion of the country, and we understand that one of our 50 States--\nLouisiana, in particular--has been dramatically impacted and maybe \nforever altered by Hurricane Katrina. Certainly Alabama and Mississippi \nhave had their share of hardship.\n  When we look at New Orleans and look at that coastal area of \nLouisiana, we understand they are in dire straits. We understand this \nis a unique time in history, and we need to get the resources to the \ngulf coast to help right now rebuild the gulf coast but also help with \nfuture storms.\n  The other point I like about S. 3711 is that it recognizes that the \ncost of energy ripples throughout all of our economy. A few moments \nago, we heard someone mention that with regard to farmers and \nfertilizer, about 90 percent of the cost of fertilizer is the cost of \nnatural gas. If we look at the plastic that is in this pen, some of \nthat cost is in the petroleum and natural gas that is required to make \nthis product. All that eventually, ultimately, gets passed on through \nthe economy. So when we see very high natural gas prices and very high \noil prices, we know it is inflationary and we know the damage those \nhigh prices can do to our Nation's economy.\n  Arkansans--and I think all Americans--feel squeezed right now. If a \nfamily used heat in the wintertime, if they cooked with natural gas, \nthey paid an average of $920 in natural gas last year. That is a lot of \nmoney. That is an increase of $178 just over the winter months I am \ntalking about. That is a lot of money. Those are real dollars to people \nin my State and I know people around the country.\n  The price of natural gas, which supplies a quarter of the energy used \nby Americans, has more than doubled in the past year, and demand is \ngoing to continue to rise. Demand will rise about 40 percent over the \nnext 20 years. This is significant. This dynamic is something which we \nas policymakers need to be aware of and we need to work with that \nreality.\n  About a quarter of all natural gas is used to produce electricity. \nThe rest is to manufacture plastics, cars, computers, medical \nequipment, and all sorts of products, even bottled water. Those bottles \nare made with natural gas.\n  This week, the price of natural gas was $6.15 per million Btu. We \nthink about that and we may not have anything to compare it to, but let \nme tell you, Mr. President, in countries that we compete with for jobs, \nthat we compete with for manufacturing, places such as Russia, natural \ngas is $1.25 per million Btu's. It is $6.15 here to $1.25 there. Look \nat the comparisons around the world. For whatever reason, we are paying \nmore for natural gas, and it is putting the U.S. economy at a \ndisadvantage.\n\n  We see transportation costs have doubled. We know how important \ntrucking and other transportation is in this country. That is overall \nin the economy. But when we look at transportation costs for a family, \nthe average household with children will spend about $3,815 on fuel \nthis year. That is a lot of money. There again, that is going to \nincrease by about 100 percent as compared to 5 or 6 years ago. The \npeople in my State and the people around the country certainly are \nfeeling the squeeze. If you book an airline ticket today, it is \nprobably going to be 11 percent higher, and a big piece of that is the \ncost of jet fuel.\n  One of the last couple of points I wish to mention about this \nlegislation is that it is a compromise. It is a compromise in maybe the \nbest sense of the word. We have a lot of competing interests, a lot of \ngood ideas that have come into this discussion. Many of those ideas \nwere included either in whole or in part in this legislation.\n  This bill will open 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, and it \nlifts production bans in lease area 181. Again, I think that is the \nright policy at the right time. At the same time, it bans drilling \nwithin 125 miles, and that is good until 2022. Again, I think that \nmakes sense. Congress is trying to be very sensitive to various States' \nneeds, trying to respect those needs and those desires. We are \nattempting to do that, and I think we are accomplishing that in this \nbill.\n  Back to natural gas, lease area 181 in this bill will add about 5.83 \ntrillion cubic feet, and that is a lot of natural gas. Right now, we \nuse about 23 trillion cubic feet a year. So this is a significant help \nover time. It will take a couple, 3 years before that actually hits the \nmarket, but it will help. Also, it will produce about 1.26 billion \nbarrels of oil.\n  The last point I would make is that this is a narrowly tailored bill. \nBut there is one person who I think has shown complete tenacity in \ntrying to get us to where we are today, where we will be Monday, and \nthat is Senator Landrieu of Louisiana. She has been amazing. Of course, \nher State has been forever altered by Hurricane Katrina. Certainly, we \njoin her in saying we\n\n[[Page S8360]]\n\nwant Louisiana to come back stronger than ever. New Orleans is one of \nthe great American cities, it is one of the cultural centers of this \ncountry, and we want it to come back stronger than ever.\n  Sometimes we forget how important that New Orleans area is to the \nentire country. It is one of the largest ports in the United States, \nand the fact that it is sitting right at the mouth of the Mississippi \nis critically important to the entire midsection of the country. If you \nlive west of the Appalachians or east of the Rockies, you are impacted \nby what happens in New Orleans because that whole system, that entire \nMississippi River basin or watershed, all the rainwater, all the \nfloods--everything--eventually goes down the Mississippi. If the \nMississippi is not functioning correctly down near New Orleans, it has \na very adverse impact on flood control, on agriculture, on industry, on \nhydroelectric power, and on any number of things up and down this \nentire watershed, which is the largest watershed in North America.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for her tenacity, for the example she set \nfor all of us in fighting for her State and fighting for her country in \na time when we need her leadership. She has shown that time and time \nagain. I bet every Member of this body at some point or another has \nspoken with Senator Mary Landrieu about how important it is to rebuild \nthe gulf coast area and Louisiana specifically. She has done a \nfantastic job. Even if I disagreed with this policy, which I don't, out \nof respect for her and the great work she has done, I would support her \nlegislation because I know how important it is to her.\n  The bottom line is, Louisiana is one of the 50 States. It is a sister \nState. We came to the aid of New York after 9/11, and we should have. \nWe have come to the aid of many States in specific regions after \ndisasters and catastrophe, and we should. That is part of being one \nNation, one people, E pluribus unum. It is time for us to come to the \naid of Louisiana. It is a long-term proposition. Louisiana does not \nhave an easy solution where we throw a few dollars at it and it is \ndone. There are major infrastructure investments we have to make there. \nWe also have to make them along the rest of the coastline in \nMississippi and Alabama.\n  So I think this is an important first step. As I said, I hope that S. \n3711 is part of a larger and smarter U.S. energy policy. I hope next \nyear we will come back and revisit some of these very good ideas the \nSenators have talked about this week and in the previous months when we \nhave been looking at this lease area 181 bill, because there are a lot \nof good ideas out there. I know Senator Warner and I have one that \nwould open the entire OCS, and it is something we would love to have \nincluded here, but we understand we may have to wait until another \ntime. But there are a lot of good ideas out there, and I think it is \ntime for us to think long term and think about energy policy that makes \nsense for everybody.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 3711, the \nGulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.\n  S. 3711 takes a much needed and long overdue step forward in our \nNation's energy policy. For too long we have looked to others to supply \nour growing demand for energy. Too many of our energy resources are \nimported from unfriendly and unstable places in the world like Nigeria \nand Venezuela. We can no longer afford to rely upon the Hugo Chavezes \nof the world to fill up our gas tanks, heat our homes, or provide \nfertilizer to grow our crops.\n  Today we have the opportunity to look in our own back yard for the \nresources necessary to sustain our economy's growth.\n  S. 3711 opens roughly 8.3 million acres to oil and gas exploration. \nAn area with roughly 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.26 \nbillion barrels of oil. One sector of our economy in desperate need of \nincreased oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is agriculture.\n  Mr. President, farm country is struggling to find our next generation \nof farmers. Agriculture's future depends on motivating young people to \nenter into a business with increasing input costs and stagnant product \nprices. Without a revitalized wave of young producers, our Nation's \nfood suppliers will continue to face an uphill battle. Alleviating high \nnatural gas prices is one way to help current producers and entice \nyoung farmers to return to the fields.\n  Agriculture depends on significant amounts of natural gas for \nirrigation, food processing, crop drying, heating homes and farm \nbuildings, and producing fertilizers which are necessary for plant \ngrowth.\n  For agriculture, natural gas is not just an energy source, but it is \nalso a feedstock in the production of nitrogen fertilizer. Natural gas \naccounts for roughly 90 percent of the cost to produce one ton of \nnitrogen fertilizer.\n  In 2005, natural gas prices rose to $15.00 per million BTU's. In the \npast 6 years, the U.S. has gone from spending $50 billion per year on \nnatural gas to $200 billion per year. These high prices have hit the \nnitrogen fertilizer industry hard. Since 1999, 17 ammonia plants \npermanently closed due to the high cost of natural gas. The result is a \nfertilizer industry that recently received 85 percent of its feedstock \nfrom domestic sources to one that now relies on foreign imports to \nsupply 50 percent of their natural gas needs.\n  Much attention in Congress has turned to alternative sources of \nenergy to meet our demand. Ethanol used to be a word spoken only in \nfarm country. Now ethanol is part of the daily jargon on the streets of \nNew York and Los Angeles.\n  What some folks may not understand about ethanol produced primarily \nfrom corn is that farmers in many parts of the country use nitrogen \nfertilizer and irrigation systems to grow corn--two inputs heavily \ninfluenced by the price of natural gas.\n  You see, Mr. President, if we do not increase the amount of \ndomestically produced natural gas, our renewable fuels industry will \ngrow more and more dependant on imports from volatile parts of the \nworld.\n  Now is the time to change our attitude about our energy supply. \nDomestic, environmentally safe production can and should take place on \nAmerican soil and off our shores. S. 3711 moves our Nation's energy \npolicy in the right direction. One that leads to greater energy \nindependence and price stability. I encourage my colleagues to support \nour agricultural industry and vote for S. 3711.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the energy \nproduction bill that is on the floor. Is that appropriate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am a resident of Mobile, AL, on the \ngulf coast. We drive down to the beaches periodically. What I would \nlike to convey to my colleagues is that Alabama, Mississippi, and \nLouisiana have always allowed production of oil and gas offshore. We \neven allow production very close inshore. The beautiful Mobile Bay, a \nfragile estuary, has a number of very large oil rigs in those estuaries \nthat have produced very large amounts of oil and gas. We have never had \na problem of any serious nature of an environmental negative impact.\n  As we begin to discuss this subject, we need to ask ourselves, what \nis the opposition to drilling in an expanded area of the deep Gulf of \nMexico, 125 miles or so south of Alabama and Florida, and 200 miles \nwest of Florida's western beaches of Tampa? What is the opposition to \nit? I ask that question.\n  Is it a sincere environmental objection or is it just a persistent \nopposition to the utilization of oil and gas that many people have in \nAmerica today? Is it some sort of hostility to oil companies? Is that \nwhat is making people have a hesitation?\n  I would like to discuss those areas a little bit.\n  Let's talk about the environment. We have at this time 4,000 \nproducing wells in the Gulf of Mexico--4,000. We have had one of the \nmost devastating hurricanes ever to hit in Katrina last year. We had \nseveral other hurricanes that had very high winds--not quite as big, \nbut their winds at times were nearly as\n\n[[Page S8361]]\n\nstrong as Hurricane Katrina's--that came through the gulf.\n  Official reports have indicated that 3,000 of those 4,000 wells that \nare existing now in the Gulf of Mexico were in the direct path of one \nof those hurricanes last year, and we had not a single spill of any \nsizable amount. Several of the platforms, large as they are, were \ndamaged. But they have, in ways that I am not able to fully explain, \nshut-in valves down under the water, at the ground, and it shuts off \nthe oil from the well, and no matter what happens to the rig there is \nno spill of oil.\n  In fact, only about 2 percent of the oil in our waters around the \nU.S. come from oil production, or maybe less. But 63 percent comes from \nnatural seepage. Most of it comes from runoff from storm sewers and \nthings on the land. All that is really very small. It is not a huge \nimpact in any way.\n  I would just say to my colleagues, when you go fishing in the Gulf of \nMexico, as I like to do when I can, which isn't often, you tend to fish \naround these rigs. Just over Memorial Day weekend I was out with my \nbrother-in-law and nephew. We went fishing around the oil rigs and had \na little luck. That is where people fish. It provides a structure that \nallows growth of foods, sources that feed smaller fish, and larger fish \nfeed around them, and that is where people fish. Nobody worries about \nthat or expects any kind of problem with it. They have been there for \ndecades now.\n  So the environmental question is not a real one, in my view. It has, \nto a degree, been settled more than we can imagine.\n  But I would say this: The same people who may be worried about \ndrilling in the gulf don't seem to be very worried about drilling in \nthe lake at Venezuela, or the Persian Gulf, or the Caspian Sea. These \nare smaller bodies of water, self-contained, in which a spill would be \neven more dangerous. That is where we are getting much of our oil and \ngas today, from those areas of the globe. Many of those areas that we \nproduce oil and gas are far more subject to being damaged, perhaps, \nthan if we had a spill in the vast Gulf of Mexico.\n  Then there is this argument: We don't like the oil companies. You are \ntrying to help the big oil companies.\n  I want to dispute that and dispute that unequivocally. My goal is to \nserve my constituents. How do I serve my constituents? I help them \nreceive the necessary, critical oil and gas that they need to carry on \nwith their lives at as low a price as possible.\n  I don't think it healthy or justifiable to say to my constituents in \nAlabama: We are not going to let you produce oil and gas off the coast \nof Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Florida.\n  We are not going to let you get any gas and oil from there. We are \ngoing to require you to buy it from Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. We are \ngoing to require you to buy it on the markets of the world where it may \nhave come from Iran, and certainly Saudi Arabia, or Iraq, or other \ncountries. Some of those haven't been friendly to us. They charge \nwhatever they can charge. A couple of years ago, it was $35 a barrel \nand now it is $70-plus a barrel.\n  What kind of sense is that? If some big oil company has a long-term \ncontract with one of those foreign countries to buy oil at $35 a barrel \nthat was signed 2 years ago, why would they want production in the \ngulf? In fact, they may not.\n  I don't see the oil companies demanding increased drilling in the \ngulf. This is coming from people who can add dollars and cents, people \nsuch as this Senator who travels the State, talks to our constituents, \nlistens to what their concerns are, goes to church, and goes out on the \nstreet shopping, and people come up to you and they talk about the high \ncost of gasoline. That is what they are talking to me about. I look \nthem in the eye, and I say I am going to do what I can to make these \nprices lower.\n  We tried putting in a law that sets prices, and that was a total \nfailure. You can't fix prices by statute. It is a marketplace out \nthere. And what do you do to make the marketplace work on your side? \nYou increase production. Frankly, it doesn't require a huge increase in \nproduction to make a big price adjustment.\n  If the world demand is here but the supply is a little more than \ndemand, surpluses build up, and all of a sudden the prices start \nfalling. People have oil in their tanks. They cannot sell. So they cut \ntheir price to sell more. Somebody else has to cut the price, and it \ndrops down. If you have a world supply here and demand is a little \nabove the supply, and the world is out here and can't meet it, people \nhave shortages, and they have to bid the price up to get more. Then you \nhave a problem. Even small amounts can make a big difference in prices. \nThat is all I am trying to say to my colleagues.\n  I emphasize again that the reason to produce within the Gulf of \nMexico, as I believe ANWR and several other areas of this country, is \nbecause that money stays at home. It doesn't go to Hugo Chavez or \nothers. It helps generate our economy. It creates jobs in our economy. \nPeople who make money pay taxes to our Government, not to some foreign \ngovernment. The pipes and that kind of thing work. And the \ntransportation costs are less because it is much closer.\n  These are factors which are relevant to any policymaker in our \nNation.\n  We have artificially denied our Nation the right to produce this oil \nand gas that is right off our shore for far too long. It is time for \nthat to end and to go forward with this production which will help our \neconomy, help create jobs, help contain and actually reduce whatever \nthe price of oil and gas may be in the future. It will be less cost to \nproduce in the gulf than it would be otherwise. I have no doubt.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader. I will be pleased to yield \nto him, and at this point I thank him for his understanding of this \ncritical issue. He has been steadfast and clear about it ever since I \nhave been in the Senate, 10 years. And now we are at a point where we \nmight get something done this time.\n  I thank him for his leadership, and I am pleased that both Senators \nfrom Florida are supporting the bill, so we have some cause for \noptimism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, while my distinguished colleague from \nAlabama is on the floor, I thank him for his leadership on this \nparticular issue because it gives us that opportunity to act with \nmeaningful solutions to problems everyone is feeling. So many things \nthat we do here are issues that seem so macro, so big. I am sure when \npeople are watching C-SPAN or television or they even read about what \nwe do, they wonder, are those people up in Washington doing anything to \naddress the issues that affect me, the squeeze that I feel, the cost of \nliving that we know has to be addressed?\n  Then you say, What are those things? Where is that squeeze coming \nfrom, despite the record low unemployment rate of 4.6 or 4.7 percent \nand the creation of 5 million jobs?\n  It comes back again and again--those energy costs, filling up that \ngasoline tank, getting ready to go on vacation, or altering your \nvacation, or paying that heating bill, or this time of year that air \nconditioning bill. And it comes back to energy.\n  Now we are acting and we are acting in a way that in the past has \nbeen stopped--and that is by looking right here at home at the good old \nAmerican homegrown supply.\n  Everybody knows that ultimately in the market-based system there is \nsupply and demand. Now we are addressing supply directly, as my \ncolleague mentioned, in a way that is very protective of our \nenvironment, of our coastlines, that is environmentally sensitive but \nin a way that we know will open as much as a million or more barrels.\n  I thank my colleague for his leadership and also for his explanation \nso people fully understand the impact of that legislation which is now \non the floor.\n  There is a lot going on. I want to make a couple of comments because \nthere are some things going on right now. The House of Representatives \nwill probably be out tomorrow. We will be in session tomorrow. We are \nworking on a whole range of issues in conference and in our discussions \nas we look ahead for the next week that we will be here, and then the 4 \nweeks in September when we come back. I am very hopeful that the House \nwill pass the pensions conference report and sometime here in the next \n24 hours. I know our colleagues from the Senate\n\n[[Page S8362]]\n\nwho are on the conference are working very hard to get the House \nMembers to move ahead on the issue that we know is very important to \nthe American people. Individual retirement security. Again, it goes \nback to this cost of living and the squeeze that people feel. That is \nwhat this pensions bill is all about.\n  Other issues that are being addressed are so-called tax extenders \nbecause we have to act now every year. We would like to make these tax \ncuts permanent, but we have to act every year and extend them for 1 \nyear or 2 years.\n  What is also interesting in terms of message is the great impact that \ntax cuts put forward by this body under the leadership of President \nBush have had--a huge impact on individuals and families.\n  One of interesting things that I find when you say we are going to \nmake the tax cuts permanent and extend them for 3 or 4 years, people do \nnot understand fully what that means and how it affects them as \nindividuals. But 3\\1/2\\ years from now for a family of four making a \nmedian income of $62,000 or $63,000, what percentage of this Federal \ntax will go up if we don't act to make these tax cuts permanent? \nUsually, when I ask a crowd of people if the Bush tax cuts are not made \npermanent, if the Senate doesn't act for whatever reason, or it is \nobstructed from acting, they say, Maybe my taxes will go up 10 percent \nor 20 percent, or 30 percent. Not many people say 30 percent. But the \nfact is, if we don't act in this Senate to make those tax cuts \npermanent, for a family of four, their Federal taxes will go up, 3\\1/2\\ \nyears from now, 58 percent. And now people say: I see the importance of \nwhat you are doing in Washington, DC, why you are following President \nBush in terms of his tremendous leadership in cutting taxes, keeping \ntaxes low, and working hard to make those tax cuts permanent. Then it \ncomes together.\n\n  We are looking at a tax extender package, and we are also looking at \nwhat my colleagues feel strongly about--a permanent solution to the \ndeath tax.\n  First of all, the death tax does not make sense. It is not fair. It \ndiscourages savings and discourages thrift. Therefore, we need to have \na permanent solution. I say bury it forever, but the will of the Senate \nis not to bury it forever and eliminate it totally. Therefore, we are \nworking with what is a very reasonable compromise position. So there is \na lot of discussion on that underway.\n  What we have is crazy. We have a death tax. It used to be high and is \ncoming down. In 2010 it disappears, and in 2011 it goes back up to 55 \npercent. Talk about things that do not make sense, that does not make \nsense. We need to fix that. I hope we can do that in the next 6 to 8 \nweeks.\n  One last thing I comment on because there has been huge progress \ntoday in the House of Representatives which allows us to move forward \non an issue that will affect just about everyone listening to me now, \nan issue we have acted on with meaningful solutions to a real problem, \nis health information technology. The House today passed a health \ninformation technology bill. We have passed one in the past. Now we can \nmarry those two in conference. And we will save lives.\n  Medicines cure, but medicines can also kill. Last week, the National \nAcademy Institute of Medicine, which we all respect, we all look to, \nwhich looks at things very objectively--the committees they put \ntogether are experienced, have broad expertise, and take current issues \nthat are challenging and address them in an environment that is very \nconstructive. They released the most extensive report ever done on drug \nor medication, medicine errors, mistakes that are made, whether they \nare inadvertent or mistakes just made. The report is fascinating.\n  Why do I say it affects everyone? Right now, four out of five \nAmerican adults today--so in all likelihood, everyone listening to me--\ntake one medicine, at least one medicine over the counter or a \nprescription. One out of three adults listening to me now take five \nmedicines. That is amazing. Being a physician, it wasn't true 10 years \nago, it wasn't true 20 years ago. When my dad began to practice \nmedicine 70 years ago, no one would believe the power we have in \nmedicines today--the power to cure but, if misused or mishandled, the \npower to kill.\n  This report just came out last week, and it is fascinating. The \nreport addresses lots of things. I will come back and cite some of \nthem. I will look at findings. How these medicines are administered, if \nnot done correctly, with real care, can result in serious injury, hurt \nthe patient, can cause death--all related to how they are administered, \nthe dosage they are administered in.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I spent 18 years in hospitals, always 5 \ndays a week and 95 percent of the time 6 days a week, working in \nhospitals, taking care of people. There you see it all. You see doctors \ninadvertently writing prescriptions for drugs that interact and are not \ncompatible with certain drugs. Maybe they didn't know the patient was \non that particular drug or they just didn't know there would be an \ninteraction of the two drugs, and it hurts the patients. Nurses or \nhealth care providers mistakenly put the wrong medication in the IV \nbag, the intravenous bag that runs into your hand, or administer the \nwrong blood type. A pharmacist might dispense a 100-milligram pill \ninstead of a 50-milligram pill. These errors are wasteful, obviously, \nbut can also be harmful and can be deadly.\n  The Institutes of Medicine found that at least 1.5 million Americans \nare sickened, injured, or killed each year by errors in either \nprocessing, dispensing, or taking medications. These errors are \nwidespread. The IOM report found on average a hospital patient is \nsubjected to one medication error every day they are in the hospital. \nThat is pretty amazing. A hospital patient is subjected to one \nmedication error each day he or she occupies a hospital bed.\n  That is costly. Not only does it occur, and it occurs frequently, it \ncosts a lot. The IOM report estimates the extra expense of treating \ndrug-related injuries in hospitals alone is $3.5 billion a year.\n  The report--again, it just came out last week--is the most \ncomprehensive report today. It sends a very clear signal; that is, we \nneed to act.\n  The good news is that we have acted with a first step in this Senate, \nand as I mentioned earlier the House acted today, which means together \nwe can produce a bill, and have the President sign it, which will make \na difference.\n  The IOM report offered several recommendations to prevent these \nerrors. In many ways, the recommendations they put forward reinforce my \nvision or a vision I believe is very important as to where we need to \nbe in health care in the future. We have to start today in that \ndirection. That is what the recommendations do.\n\n  That vision is really pretty simple. It is a vision of a health care \nsystem that is not centered on HMOs, bureaucrats, Washington, or \nhospitals or clinics. It is centered on the patient. The patient is in \nthe middle of the system.\n  In this system also is the importance of having the driving force of \nthe consumer. You have the patient, and it is driven by decisions being \nmade by consumers all over the country.\n  The third component is that it needs to be provider friendly. You \nneed physicians participating, nurse practitioners participating, \nnurses and other health care providers, technicians, the people who \ndraw the blood, and the lab technicians all participating in a way that \nthere is a comfortable exchange of both information services as well as \ntrust. So it is a patient-centered, consumer-driven, provider-friendly \nsystem.\n  Now, the engine to that system has got to be value, has got to be \noutcome, has got to be results. When I say ``value,'' I really mean \nalmost in simple terms of the product, the outcome, in terms of value, \ndivided by how many dollars you put in. So you want as much health \nproduced per dollar injected into the system. That has to be the engine \nof this system, and it has to be fueled by three things.\n  That is where the exciting part comes in. That is where this health \ninformation technology plays such an important role. It has to be \ndriven by information, 21st-century information that simply was not \naround the last century. It really was not around when I was doing \nheart transplants every week 10 years ago, 12 years ago. You just \ndidn't have that sort of information generated. It was the knowledge \nrevolution, the explosion of information, computers, the Internet. That \nknowledge is out there today.\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n  The second fuel has to be choice. You have to have people out there \nmaking prudent decisions for themselves each and every day. Obviously, \nthat is very consistent with my principles as a Republican in terms of \nmaximizing choice. The 21st-century information, with empowerment of \nthe consumer by choice, and third, some element of control.\n  The control really comes in if people have to have resources to make \nthose decisions or, if not, need to be assisted. You have to have a \nstrong safety net for a patient-centered, consumer-driven, provider-\nfriendly system based on values, driven by information and choice and \ntechnology. You have to have a seamless flow of information which is \nprivacy-protected and which is secure.\n  No single piece of legislation incorporates all of that, and no \nsingle piece of legislation incorporates all the IOM recommendations. \nBut there are things we can do to move in the direction toward that \nvision.\n  I have sponsored bills in this Senate and urged industry-wide changes \nthat made considerable progress that caused us to move toward achieving \nthat.\n  Last summer, on this floor, I publicly called on the pharmaceutical \ncompanies to implement a voluntary 2-year restriction on direct-to-\nconsumer advertising for newly released drugs. What is direct-to-\nconsumer advertising? It is what you see on television each night or \nover the course of today in terms of the drug ads, in magazines. It is \nthe full-blown pictures you see every day--newspaper ads--where the \nadvertising is directly to the consumer, to the individual, to the \npatient.\n  What I called upon the pharmaceutical companies to do is to review \ntheir procedures and on a voluntary basis give a 2-year restriction on \ndirect-to-consumer advertising for lots of reasons. I will come back do \nthat.\n  I also publicly asked the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, \nto analyze the Food and Drug Administration oversight of such \nadvertising. Are we doing enough to make sure that information which \ncomes out to the consumer is filtered appropriately, to make sure it is \naccurate, that it is honest, that it shows the pluses but also shows \nthe dangers and the weaknesses as well?\n  Spending on direct-to-consumer advertising and prescription drugs was \nsteady over the years. In recent years, it has skyrocketed. Why? \nBecause you put advertisements out there and people buy the drugs. The \nproblem is, and the reason I brought it up in the Senate and made this \npublic call, this advertising can lead to inappropriate use of \ndrugs using too many of these drugs, using them for the wrong \nindications, overuse and underuse of the drugs. It could be an \nunderselling of the risks that are actually in a drug. You see all the \ngood things and the beautiful pictures and people running through \nfields, but at the same time you really do not see the dangers, the \nside effects that could be harmful, that could compromise your safety, \nthe patient's safety and care.\n\n  The good news, based on that call, at least in part, is the \npharmaceutical industry responded and I would say responded fairly \naggressively. They soon after issued a set of guidelines for \nprescription drug advertising on newly released drugs. They got \ntogether and talked about the importance of their responsibility in \nthis direct-to-consumer advertising, the fact that it is not just to \nimprove their bottom line but it is health care, it is patient-\ncentered, that you have to have the strengths but you have to give \nweaknesses of these drugs when you put them forward. So I applaud them. \nAnd that response is making a difference. That is one example. That is \nsort of a first step in guaranteeing patient safety and care.\n  I mentioned the GAO report. It has not come back yet. I look forward \nto receiving their findings, their results on the FDA's oversight, to \ncome soon.\n  Other progress: Last summer, we passed the Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act. It became law July 29, exactly a year ago, 2005. It \nalso contributed to this patient-centered system which is consumer \ndriven. It helps improve the quality and gets rid of the waste. When I \nsay value, that is results, as I said, per dollar of input. You want to \nmaximize that. So you want to get rid of the waste. You want to get rid \nof the abuse. You want to get rid of inefficiency. And we did a lot in \nthat regard.\n  What this Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act did was to help \nboth improve quality and weed out waste by minimizing the fear of \nlitigation. Now, why does that matter? It really comes down to--and I \noversimplified it a little bit, but if you are a physician or you are a \nnurse and you are in a hospital and you make a mistake, and you feel \nbad about it, you should be able to share that information with other \npeople so they can learn from your mistakes.\n  Quality improvement: We see it in airlines. We see it in general \naviation. But we do not see it in health care--or we didn't before \npassing this particular bill. What we have been able to do in that \nparticular bill is basically ease--without fear of a lawsuit coming \nafter you. The reason it is not shared is because you know some greedy, \npredatory trial lawyer is out there and saying: Oh, there is a mistake. \nLet's go after them. What it does is put a barrier up there so no \nlonger does that individual practitioner, doctor, or nurse have to have \nthe fear of sharing information of an inadvertent mistake so others can \nlearn.\n  The IOM report's most striking finding was that many providers do \nfail to report these medication errors that ultimately don't result in \nan injury. They fear these lawsuits. But without reporting this \ninformation, clearly, we cannot learn from our mistakes. That is what \nthe Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act addressed.\n  That brings me, finally, to information technology. The Senate passed \na health information technology bill. It was bipartisan. I thank \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi and Clinton, all of whom worked with me and \nall of our colleagues in producing this bill--a bill called the Wired \nfor Health Care Quality Act. What it does is it promotes the use of \nelectronic medical records. It jump-starts America's transition to this \n21st century system based on choice and based on value and based on \noutcomes by having a seamless network that is fully interoperable in \nterms of the transmission of health information, so doctor can \ncommunicate with hospital, can communicate with pharmacy, can \ncommunicate with patient in a seamless way, where records can be stored \nelectronically. They can be transmitted electronically. If you are in \nNashville, TN, and you live in Princeton, NJ, and you have an \nautomobile accident as you are on I-41 through Nashville and you are \ntaken to Vanderbilt Hospital, they can push a button, and in a secure, \nprivacy-protected way, your record instantaneously shows up at the \nVanderbilt emergency room and they can see what allergies you have, \nwhat medicines you have, whether you had previous heart disease, \nwhether you can tolerate anesthesia--instantaneously; otherwise, they \nwould have to repeat all those tests. They might not even be able to \nget that information.\n  That is the power. What it does is it builds a platform for the \ninteroperable transfer of information--interoperability standards--that \nhas the ability to transform the practice of medicine. That is how big \nthese bills potentially are.\n  Doctors write about 2 billion prescriptions each year. We still write \nthem, for the most part, by hand. And that spelling, what you look at, \nunfortunately, is misinterpreted. And as the IOM report documents, a \nlot of errors are still being made in that transmission of reading what \na doctor had written at the pharmacy or at wherever the hospital might \nbe distributing those drugs and then delivering it to the nurse and \nhaving the nurse give it to the patient. You get rid of all that--not \nall of it but most of it--by having that seamless flow of electronic \ninformation.\n\n  I think back to transplantation. I would have a patient. I would \ntransplant the heart in Nashville and take care of them and have them \non a drug called cyclosporine. And they would go back home, maybe 2 or \n3 hours away, where another doctor would take care of them. If they got \na cold, the local family doctor might put them on erythromycin, not \nknowing--because transplants were so new at the time--that if you put \nsomebody on cyclosporine on erythromycin, their liver would fail. But \nit happened. They\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\nmay not know that cyclosporine was there. Well, with the electronic \ntransfer of information, that physician would know that patient is on \ncyclosporine, and it would be instantaneous and immediate. If he wanted \nto put a patient on erythromycin and tried to prescribe it, a red flag \nwould come up and say: No, you can't do that because the patient is on \ncyclosporine.\n  All this makes so much sense. Medical records today are stuck in the \nstone age. But every other sector of our economy has information \npresented in what is the information age. It is now time to bring \nmedicine--it is amazing that medicine is still stuck in the stone age--\ninto this information age.\n  I will close on all this, but, as you can see, I am very excited \nabout it. This particular bill which we passed and which will be \nmarried with the House bill helps fix all of that. It is going to go a \nlong way to addressing the concerns that were in this IOM report last \nweek.\n  Electronic medical records will improve health care. They will \npromote the secure exchange of privacy-protected information, and they \nwill seamlessly integrate quality standards with information \ntechnology, all of which means to say better care, lower costs, greater \naccessibility, the elimination of waste, elimination of inefficiency as \nwell as the medical errors themselves.\n  So the House has moved. We have moved. Now it is time to get to \nconference as soon as we possibly can. And if we do that, we will move \nour system toward that vision of the patient-centered system which is \ndriven by consumers and 21st century information. It will save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8364-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8364-S8365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 5683\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I recently introduced a bill to \npreserve the cross that stands at the center of the Mt. Soledad \nVeterans Memorial in San Diego, CA, that is under attack by the ACLU to \nremove the cross. This bill would preserve that cross by having the \nU.S. Government purchase the property, as it stands, from the city of \nSan Diego. This acquisition is the action that the U.S. Department of \nJustice tells us is needed to preserve this cross as a part of a \nmemorial that has secular monuments also.\n  Congressman Duncan Hunter has led the effort in the House. He is a \nSan Diego Representative, chairman of the Armed Services Committee in \nthe House. It passed 349 to 74 in the House. So we are trying to pass \nthat in the Senate. It was called up for clearance by unanimous consent \nrecently--I believe last night--and there was an objection from the \nDemocratic side.\n  It is time for us to move forward. I don't think there will be \noverwhelming opposition to it, as there was not in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 5683, the House bill, which was \nreceived from the House. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I object. It has not been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I understand that. I know the Senator \nfrom Florida is a strong advocate of veterans. I am sure this \nrepresents an objection from the Democratic side somewhere else. I am \nurging my colleagues to look at this legislation. It is a time-\nsensitive matter because they have been sued. A Federal judge has \nordered that, under California law, a $5,000 fine be imposed daily for \nfailure to take this down, a symbol that has been up in the Mt. Soledad \narea for 54 years. Justice Kennedy of the U.S. Supreme Court has stayed \nthat penalty to give us a chance to do something like this. I believe \nit is the right thing to do, and I want to share a few comments about \nit.\n  In 1954, this 29-foot cross was erected by the Mt. Soledad Memorial \nAssociation to honor veterans of World War I, World War II, and the \nKorean war. It has stood on Mt. Soledad in San Diego, CA. The memorial \nnow serves to honor American veterans of all wars, not just veterans of \nWorld War I, World War II, and Korea.\n  Since 2000, the memorial association has added significant \nimprovements to the property. The cross is surrounded by six granite \nwalls. They are covered with over 1,600 plaques honoring individual \nveterans, with surrounding small pillars and brick pavers honoring \nveterans groups and supporters of the memorial, and community groups. A \nflagpole proudly flies the American flag.\n  It is very important that we as a nation understand that we are free \ntoday and have the liberties we have because people have sacrificed. \nOur Nation is still able--although some apparently around the world may \nnot be--to call on its people to sacrifice for a common national good, \nand all over America veterans groups and community action groups have \ncreated memorials since the beginning of the Republic to honor those \nwho place their lives at risk for the liberty we are so happy to have \ntoday.\n  It was not until 1989 that any person challenged the legality of this \nmonument. At that time, Philip Paulson, a San Diego resident, sued the \ncity, claiming that the cross display was unconstitutional and violated \nhis civil rights.\n  In 1991, a Federal judge agreed with him and prohibited the display \nof the cross on city property as a violation of the California \nConstitution, which guarantees the ``free exercise and enjoyment of \nreligion without discrimination or preference.'' That is different from \nthe language we have in the U.S. Constitution. So the city attempted to \nmeet the court's demand and protect the integrity of the memorial by \nselling or donating the property to a private party. But Mr. Paulson \nchallenged every potential transfer of the property to a private party, \nrevealing that his true objection was not to the city's ownership of \nthe display but to the cross itself--something he personally did not \nlike.\n  In 1992, 76 percent of the people of San Diego, CA, showed their \nsupport for keeping the cross at the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial by \nvoting to support ``Proposition F'' to authorize the city to transfer \nthe property to a private nonprofit organization, so it would not \nimplicate public matters. What is wrong with that?\n  After Proposition F passed, the memorial association did successfully \nbid for the property. It chose to keep the cross up but also made $1 \nmillion worth of significant improvements to the memorial, including \nthe granite walls, plaques, pavers, flagpole, and American flag. Even \nafter the improvements were completed, Mr. Paulson was still \nchallenging the sale.\n  In 2002, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the west coast--\nconsidered the most activist circuit of all in the country and the most \nreversed by the U.S. Supreme Court--found that the method of the sale \nviolated the ``no aid to religion clause'' of the California State \nconstitution. They transferred it to a private, nonprofit, nonreligious \norganization, but they said this aided religion.\n  I believe this is something on which we can all agree. I know the \nSenators from California, Senators Feinstein and Boxer, have indicated \nthey believe this memorial should remain. I think we will be able to \nwork through these difficulties and get this legislation passed.\n  Mr. President, following up on the Mount Soledad Memorial legislation \nto deal with the court ruling that has imposed a $5,000 fine per day on \nthe city of San Diego, a ruling stayed by Justice Kennedy on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, that ruling deals with the cross that was maintained by \nthe Mt. Soledad Memorial Association on property originally owned by \nthe city of San Diego. Some 35 years after it was placed there, someone \nobjected, and the city sold the property to the memorial association, \nputting it in the hands of a nongovernmental, private entity.\n  As a result of that action, a lawsuit was commenced anyway and still \nsaid it was improper, and the court reached a ruling that was sort of \nbreathtaking and said they still couldn't do it. I would note that in \n1992, 76 percent of the people in San Diego voted to support keeping \nthe cross there, and voted\n\n[[Page S8365]]\n\nin support of Proposition F to transfer the property to a private \norganization. But still they didn't stop, and we have continued to see \nthe litigation go on and on. Some of it arises from the case law and \nthe very strong constitutional provisions unique to California.\n  In 2002, the Ninth Circuit had a ruling on it, and this is what they \nruled: that the ``no aid to religion'' clause of the California \nConstitution prohibited California from transferring this property to a \nprivate association because any buyer who did not desire to keep the \ncross that was there would be required to pay for its removal, whereas \nan entity who wanted to buy and did not want to take the cross down \nwould not have any expense; therefore, this aided religion. Now, that \nis the theory of it. I think that is not a sound analysis.\n  The Ninth Circuit is the most activist circuit in the country and we \ncontinue to have problems with them. They are reversed by the U.S. \nSupreme Court more often than any other circuit. Some years they have \nbeen reversed more often than all of the other circuits combined. One \nyear it was 26 out of 27 cases the Supreme Court considered, they \nreversed. So that is what causes this problem.\n  A plan has been devised. Congressman Hunter, who represents San \nDiego, and Congressman Brian Bilbray, who represents the Mt. Soledad \ndistrict, have worked hard to prepare legislation that would transfer \nit to the Federal Government, because this wouldn't be unconstitutional \nunder Federal law. It passed in the House by an overwhelming vote of \n349 to 74. We want to see that pass here. It has been called up and \ncleared on the Republican side of the aisle, and it is now being \nobjected to by some on the Democratic side. So I would ask my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side to work through this thing and see if \nwe can get it passed. It would allow the veterans to be able to \ncontinue to have the memorial on Federal property that has been in \nplace for 54 years. It does not establish a religion. On Federal \nproperty, it is consistent with the wishes of those veterans and their \nfamilies for over a half a century.\n  I would note we have Democratic support for this concept. I notice \nthat in one of the news articles from the Copley News Service here, \nSenator Barbara Boxer, a California Senator, and one of the other \nDemocratic Members, said:\n\n       [T]he monument is a historic memorial to our veterans and \n     should be allowed to stay.\n\n  Senator Dianne Feinstein, the other Senator from California, has \nsaid:\n\n       [B]ecause of the history and significance of this monument \n     to so many veterans and San Diegans, it should be preserved.\n\n  So the Congressmen there, the people of San Diego, and the Senators \nfrom California are in favor of this. It is as a result of this complex \nhistory and the obsession by the courts, it appears, to just eliminate \nany reference, any expression of religion whatsoever from the public \nsquare, even if it is not consistent with the U.S. Constitution, in my \nview.\n  I believe this legislation is important and should be passed. We can \nmake this happen. I ask my colleagues to review it. I will plan to come \nback and deal with it some more if we cannot get it cleared. We need to \nhave a vote on it, if it cannot be cleared voluntarily. I hope we can \navoid that.\n  Mr. President, I note there are other Senators here wishing to speak. \nWe are on the drilling offshore bill in the gulf, and that is a very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I, again, note I have asked this morning that this be cleared. We \nhave another objection. We will continue to persist with this until we \nget everybody's attention and maybe they can review it and see fit to \nclear it. I think they will. If not, I will be asking the leader to \ninvoke cloture on the legislation.\n  I further add, Senator McCain has also offered legislation similar to \nmine. It would do the same thing. But the bill we are asking clearance \non is the bill that came from the House, H.R. 5683.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8365-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MOUNT SOLEDAD CROSS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor passage of H.R. 5683, legislation passed by the House last week to \npreserve the Mount Soledad Veterans Memorial in Diego, CA. I want to \nassociate myself with the comments made by my colleague, Senator \nSessions. He and I both have introduced legislation similar to H.R. \n5683 and I am pleased that Senator Graham also has joined us in \nadvocating a legislative solution to this important matter.\n  Since 1913, a series of crosses have stood on top of Mount Soledad, \nproperty owned by the city of San Diego. In April of 1954, the site was \ndesignated to commemorate the sacrifices made by members of the armed \nforces who served in World War II, as well as the Korean war.\n  In 1989, one individual filed suit against the city claiming that the \ndisplay of the cross by the city was unconstitutional and, therefore, \nviolated his civil rights. In 1991, a Federal judge issued an \ninjunction prohibiting the permanent display of the cross on city \nproperty. Since that time, the city has repeatedly tried to divest \nitself of the property through sale or donation. But the plaintiff \ncontinued to mount legal challenges to every attempted property \ntransfer. The legal wrangling over this memorial continues today.\n  The Mount Soledad Memorial is a remarkably popular landmark. In fact, \nI had the pleasure of visiting the Memorial during the Fourth of July \nrecess and can personally attest to the profound impression it can \nleave on its visitors.\n  It is also of great importance to the local community. On two \ndifferent occasions, the voters of San Diego have overwhelming passed \nballot measures designed to transfer the property to entities which \ncould maintain the cross. Given the many years of legal disputes \nregarding this memorial, I believe it is past time that this issue be \nresolved.\n  The bill that we are seeking to pass would bring the Mount Soledad \ncross under the control of the Federal Government, and specifically, \nthe Department of Defense and would allow for the just compensation for \nthe property in question. It also would address the required \nmaintenance for the memorial and the surrounding property through a \nmemorandum of understanding between the Secretary of Defense and the \nMount Soledad Memorial Association. The minimal financial commitment \nrequired in this legislation will ensure the endurance of this memorial \nwhich serves as a reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men and \nwomen who made enormous sacrifices when our country called upon them.\n  I understand the bill has cleared on our side, and that we are \nawaiting for the other side to allow its approval. I can only hope that \nall of my colleagues will join us in supporting this legislation, and \nensure the preservation of an important tribute to our men and women of \nthe Armed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8365-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8365-S8367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE WAR IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yesterday the Prime Minister of Iraq \naddressed a joint meeting of Congress. In his speech, he stressed his \nview that great progress has been made in his country in the past \nmonths and equated the violence in Iraq to the al-Qaida attacks on the \nUnited States on September 11, 2001. With the Prime Minister's comments \nin mind, it is worth taking stock of how this war began 3 years, 4 \nmonths, and 1 week ago. Let me say that again. It is worth taking stock \nof how this war began 3 years, 4 months, and 1 week ago.\n  The war in Iraq, that is what I am talking about. The war in Iraq. \nThere is a war going on there, and we are involved in it. Our men and \nwomen are over there in harm's way. They die every day. The war in Iraq \nwas initiated on the false promise of securing our country from the \nthreat of weapons of mass destruction. That was a false promise. There \nhave been many efforts to try to rewrite history. You can't do it. But \nthere have been efforts to try to rewrite history and to try to find a \nnew justification for the invasion of Iraq. But one need look no \nfurther than the use of force authorization passed by the Congress--\nwhen? On October 11, 2002. Look at that use of force resolution.\n  That resolution contains 23 ``whereas'' clauses. You can count them. \nTen of those ``whereas'' clauses pertained to Iraq's efforts to develop \nweapons of mass destruction. The idea that Iraq\n\n[[Page S8366]]\n\ncould threaten our country with weapons of mass destruction was the \nkeystone of the argument for war. It was the one allegation at the \ncenter of nearly all the cases that were made for war.\n  I didn't fall for that. I didn't fall for that reason because I \ndidn't believe it was there. I didn't believe that Iraq was a threat to \nthe security of this country. I didn't believe it. I had reasons for \nnot believing it, and I have said them many times.\n  The agencies that produced the intelligence to build the case for war \nhave admitted that they made massive errors. Intelligence was massaged. \nDid you get that? Intelligence was massaged to remove most of the \ndissenting views. Dissenting views were not listened to very well. \nCongress, in 2004, even rushed to reorganize the CIA and the rest of \nour intelligence agencies based upon these massive failures--failures \nthat built a flawed and discredited case for U.S. entry into that war.\n  I did not buy into the hype and the rush to war. I didn't buy into \nthat. I didn't buy into that case. I didn't believe we had that case \nfor war. I did not believe Iraq posed an imminent threat to the \nsecurity of this country. I did not believe it. I said so. And \ntherefore I voted against turning this whole thing--lock, stock, and \nbarrel--over to one man, the President of the United States. Congress \nrelegated itself to the sidelines, and it has never gotten itself off \nthe sidelines, really. We are still there.\n  I did not believe Congress should have passed the resolution to allow \nthe President--any President, not just this President, any President--\nto decide where, when, and why to launch an attack on Iraq. I did not \nbelieve then, I do not believe now, that one man, Democratic or \nRepublican, or one woman, acting as the chief executive of our country, \nshould be handed the authority to decide on his own to shed the \nprecious blood of our sons and daughters, husbands and wives--to shed \ntheir blood.\n  The American people at this point should pause and reflect now on \nwhere our Nation stands in this war. Where does our Nation stand in \nthis war in Iraq? As of today, July 27, 2,564--2,564--American men and \nwomen have been killed--dead. Upwards of $318 billion--that is a lot of \nmoney--upwards of $318 billion has been drained from our Treasury. Talk \npersists of more than 100,000 of our troops remaining in Iraq for many \nyears to come--many years to come. Most ominously, the violence in Iraq \nappears to have entered a new phase. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ months after \nthe killing of the terrorist leader Zarqawi, an average of 100 Iraqis \nare being killed every day, according to a new report by the United \nNations.\n  Who is responsible for this violence in Iraq? Is it Osama bin Laden \nor some other nefarious outside force? Is it the same terrorists who \nplotted the attack on the World Trade Center? Is it the same miscreants \nresponsible for the train bombings in London and Madrid? The answer is \nno. This wave of violence which has crashed over Iraq is the result of \nIraqis fighting and killing Iraqis. Militias and death squads are \ncarrying out a brutal campaign of violence against fellow Iraqis. \nShiites are fighting Sunnis. Sunnis are killing Shiites. The Kurds of \nthe north are under attack. No one is safe from these indiscriminate \nkillings--not doctors, not teachers, not even children. Iraq is being \nripped apart from the inside out.\n  Could there be any doubt that there is a civil war in Iraq? \nStatistics gathered by the Iraqi Government: 2,669 Iraqi civilians were \nkilled in May; another 3,149 Iraqi civilians were killed in June. \nGovernment figures show that 14,338 civilians were killed in Iraq in \nthe first 6 months of this year. At least 100,000 Iraqis are refugees \nin their own country. Yes, there is a civil war going on in Iraq. It is \na civil war that has been brewing, brewing, brewing since we first \nopened this Pandora's box by invading Iraq in March of 2003.\n  I didn't vote for that invasion.\n  The question is, What are our troops doing in the middle of this \ncivil war? What are American troops doing in the middle of this civil \nwar? The American people should take notice of what is happening in \nIraq. The American people--it is their sons and daughters, yes. Our \ntroops are increasingly being thrust into this fighting with no plan \nfor success. It is time to stop, look, and listen, and time to ask \nquestions about where we are headed. Are our troops on the way out of \nIraq or are they on their way in? Are they being drawn deeper into this \ncivil war? Is there any chance for our troops to win a decisive victory \non the battlefield or is the fate of our soldiers tied to the political \nfortunes of untested Iraqi politicians? Does anyone in this \nadministration have a plan for how to deal with this civil war which is \ngoing on in Iraq?\n  These are not inconsequential questions. These are important \nquestions. These are important questions for the people of our country. \nBut instead of telling the American people how we are going to \ndisentangle ourselves from the sectarian violence in Iraq, we learn \nthis week that the President plans to send more American troops into \nBaghdad to take sides in the Iraqi-on-Iraqi fighting that is tearing \nthat country part. The President announced on Tuesday--yes, he did--\nthat he is sending thousands more U.S. troops into Baghdad, which is \nthe center of the storm of violence.\n  So I say to the people out there watching through those electronic \nlenses, is this our plan? Is this our plan for dealing with an Iraqi \ncivil war? When I asked Secretary Rumsfeld at an Appropriations \nCommittee hearing on March 9 about his plan if civil war were to break \nout in Iraq, he said, ``The plan is to prevent a civil war, and to the \nextent one were to occur, to have the . . . Iraqi security forces deal \nwith it, to the extent they are able to.''\n  Those are quotations. You can look at the Appropriations Committee \nhearings and find these words for yourselves.\n  The plan to have Iraqis deal with their own civil war appears to be \non its way out the window. The Iraqi Prime Minister's attempts to \npacify Baghdad with Iraqi troops has failed. In fact, the Prime \nMinister, in his speech to Congress, pleaded for more foreign aid and \nurged our troops to stay until Iraqis are ready to take up the fight to \ndefend their Government.\n  Sending more U.S. troops to deal with domestic strife is not the \nright course. What we are seeing in Iraq is mission creep, mission \ncreep, creep, creep, creep of the worst kind. The mission to overthrow \nSaddam Hussein is transforming before our very eyes into a mission to \ntake sides between warring ethnic factions. This is a plan for \ndisaster.\n  Our troops have bravely served in Iraq for more than 3 years. They \nhave done everything that has been asked of them. Our troops did not \nask to be sent to war, but the call to service has gone out and our \nservicemembers have responded. They have fought, they have been \nwounded, they have bled, and they have died for what our country has \nasked them to do. But we owe it to our troops to be judicious in what \nwe ask them to do. We owe it to our troops not to send them headlong \ninto fighting when there is no plan for victory. We owe it to our \ntroops not to send them into the center of a civil war without raising \nso much as a question, without raising so much as a question about \nwhether they belong there.\n  We cannot allow the escalating war in Lebanon to distract us from the \ndeteriorating situation in Iraq. Look at what is going on. Open your \neyes. The fighting between Israel and Lebanon has dominated our \nattention, but the administration is on the verge of making \nirreversible decisions about how deeply our troops will be involved in \nIraq's civil war.\n  Before more of our troops are sent to Baghdad, the Senate must ask \ntough questions of Secretary Rumsfeld and our military commanders about \nwhether they have a plan for dealing with the civil war in Iraq. The \nArmed Services Committee on which I serve must have a chance to \nexercise its oversight responsibilities before more of our troops are \nordered to take sides in a fight that is pitting Iraqi against Iraqi. \nWe have seen before the disastrous consequences of ordering our troops \ninto the middle of civil wars. Do we remember the 241 marines who were \nkilled in Beirut in 1983? Do we remember that? Let us remember the \nbloody battle in Somalia in 1993.\n  Let us have more wisdom, more caution, and a coherent strategy before \nwe marshal our forces to send them once more into the breach in \nBaghdad. We owe that much to our brave troops. We owe that much to \ntheir moms and their dads, their wives and their children\n\n[[Page S8367]]\n\nanxiously awaiting their safe return home.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8367-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8367-S8368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISCRIMINATION ON THE INTERNET\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, several weeks ago I came to the Senate to \nannounce I will do everything in my power to block this Senate from \nconsidering the major overhaul of the telecommunications legislation \nuntil that legislation includes specific provisions to ensure that \nthere is no discrimination on the Internet. A discrimination-free \nInternet essentially is what the net neutrality debate is all about.\n  Certainly colleagues have been hearing a great deal about this \nsubject as those who oppose net neutrality have spent millions and \nmillions of dollars trying to convince the American people and the \nCongress that somehow discrimination on the net is a good thing. They \nhave made a big point of trying to say that net neutrality is a very \ncomplicated issue, it is one involving technical issues of \ncommunications law, and it ought to be something left to lawyers and \nlobbyists to sort out in Washington, DC.\n  That is not good enough for me and I don't think it is good enough \nfor the American people. In fact, more than 500 organizations with \nviews all across the political spectrum have come together to support \nnet neutrality and a discrimination-free Internet.\n  This is the fourth time I have come to the Senate to outline examples \nof what will happen if discrimination is allowed on the Internet and \nalso to respond to some of the most directly asked questions about what \nnet neutrality is all about.\n  Today I begin my discussion with a new development just reported by \nthe Reuters News Service. Reuters News Service reported this week that \nthe profits of the AT company were up by 35 percent, bolstered ``by \nstrong growth in wireless and high speed Internet services.''\n  I am of the view this is excellent news. I want to see American \ncompanies be profitable. I believe in markets. I believe in wealth \ncreation. When our companies do well, of course, they pay taxes. They \npay taxes to the American Government and that can be used for health \ncare, education, and other services our citizens have such a great \ninterest in. It is free enterprise that makes markets work.\n  When Reuters reports that AT has made a 35-percent profit primarily \ndue to wireless and high-speed Internet services, the digital part of \nthe economy, that is good news.\n  However, there are other implications with respect to the news this \nweek about AT profits. It seems to me what the news highlights this \nweek is that AT can make money with an Internet that is \ndiscrimination free. They have been arguing, as part of the discussion \ninvolving telecommunications, that somehow it will not be possible for \nthem to make the profits that are necessary for broadband and \nsophisticated communication services to get to all the people of this \ncountry.\n  The news this week shows that AT and other companies can be \nprofitable with an Internet that is discrimination free. They do not \nneed to throw net neutrality into the trash can in order to do well. \nThe events of this past week have proved that AT does not need to \ndiscriminate in order to make money.\n  To continue with the discussion I have begun over the last few weeks, \nI also want to go to the question of ``won't consumers just get their \nbroadband from companies that do not discriminate on the net if somehow \nwe don't have net neutrality.'' This is an excellent question. The \nanswer is simple. If there were a competitive market for high-speed \nInternet services, the market would guarantee net neutrality. Consumers \nwould insist that the Internet remain free of discrimination and they \ncould take their business elsewhere if they didn't happen to approve of \ndiscrimination.\n  Unfortunately, there is not a competitive market today for high-speed \nInternet. Until there is, strong net neutrality protections are needed. \nWhat is the market for high-speed Internet? According to the Government \nAccountability Office, in 2005, about 30 million Americans had \nbroadband service. However, most of these Americans have a choice of \nperhaps only two broadband providers, the local phone company and the \nlocal cable company.\n  Some may have only one provider. Others may have no options at all. \nNo choice, limited choice, certainly is not my view of a competitive \nmarket. A choice between two is only one step beyond a monopoly. Most \nexperts say at least four providers are needed in a market for it to be \ntruly competitive. Today's market is still a long way away from the \nkind of competitive model we need to best serve our citizens with the \ncommunications services they deserve.\n  Many of my colleagues have stressed the possibilities of satellite, \nbroadband over power line, or wireless as competitors to what is called \nDSL and cable. These offerings are not real competitors. Satellite \nhigh-speed Internet is too expensive for the consumer to be a real \ncompetitor with today's services. Both wireless and broadband over \npower line are new technologies, and we all hope that someday they are \ngoing to develop into competitive options to the phone and cable \ncompany offerings. They ought to be encouraged. However, they are still \nnew, and until they become widespread and priced at a competitive level \nwith cable, for example, the market for high-speed Internet will remain \nlimited or will remain a duopoly.\n  A second question I am often asked is: As a small business, what does \nall this Net neutrality stuff mean to me? Last week, I came to the \nSenate floor and explained what it means for consumers. Small \nbusinesses, of course, are just one type of consumer in the market. And \nno Net neutrality is going to mean the same thing for the millions of \nsmall businesses that it means for consumers: a double-barreled \ndiscrimination with less choice and a higher price. Small businesses \nalso have a second concern: They use the Net not just as a consumer but \nalso as a market for their business. They have Web sites. Small \nbusinesses across the country use the Net to market their products. \nThrough Web sites such as NexTag and Yahoo Shopping, small retail shops \nare able to reach millions and millions of homes that they could not \notherwise access. A bed and breakfast, say, in central Oregon, in Bend, \nOR, is able to market itself on the Net and compete with a Holiday Inn. \nFor the small businesses, the prospect of a two-tiered discriminatory \nInternet, where they will have to pay priority access fees to network \noperators, is daunting.\n  For a small business, the fees that the large Bells and cable \ncompanies would charge could have a chilling effect on their ability to \ndo business online. While large businesses can afford to take on these \nadditional costs with only a small hit to their overall profitability, \nmany small businesses are not going to be able to pay these extra fees. \nThis would mean they would either get stuck on the Internet slow lane \nor have to mark up their prices more than big businesses. Either way, \nwithout an Internet free of discrimination, these small businesses are \ngoing to be at a competitive disadvantage.\n  In my previous discussions on the floor, in addition to trying to \nrespond to some of the major questions people are asking about Net \nneutrality, I have tried to bring out several specific examples of the \nkind of discrimination that would be allowed under the bill that was \npassed by the Senate Commerce Committee recently. So today I want to \noutline two additional examples of what could happen to our small \nbusinesses if legislation allowing discrimination on the Net were \nallowed to move forward.\n  Let's say, for the purpose of the first example, we have a family \nknown as the Taylors. The Taylors own an inn on the Oregon coastline. \nOccupancy has been lower lately because a large new national chain \nhotel opened up down the road. George Taylor's son Mike comes up with \nan idea to save the inn by reaching out to new customers: They ought to \nstart a Web site to market their inn and take reservations online.\n  In a world with Net neutrality, the Taylor family, with that small \ninn, would pay to access the Net, create a Web page, and they would be \noff to the races, up and running, marketing their business. Under the \nCommerce Committee bill, in order to launch their Web page in the fast \nlane so they could\n\n[[Page S8368]]\n\nget priority access to customers across the country and around the \nworld, that small business would have to pay an additional fee to \nhundreds, if not thousands, of Internet access providers around the \ncountry. The priority access fees are a drop in the bucket to that big \nnational chain of hotels that is hurting their business, but if the \nTaylor family cannot pay the extra fees, they are not going to be able \nto compete.\n  A second example of how the absence of Net neutrality would hurt \nsmall business--this one involves a business owner who I am calling \nJessica Myers. Ms. Myers owns a small legal placement firm with eight \nemployees. In a world with Net neutrality, she saves money on her phone \nbills as a Vonage customer. She buys all her office supplies on line \nfrom another small business she found at Shopzilla, and saved thousands \nof dollars on new computer equipment from Buy.com. Her employees are \nable to navigate law firm Web pages, learning of open jobs and \npotential clients to market these openings to.\n  Under the Commerce Committee bill, Jessica's business is going to see \na huge increase in her costs. Vonage no longer works properly, causing \nher to pay extra for phone service from the local phone company. The \noffice supply store is no longer on line because they could not afford \nto pay for priority access and cannot compete without it. Her computer \nequipment at Buy.com is now more expensive, maybe 10 percent more, \nbecause Buy.com is passing on the costs they pay the network operators \nfor priority access. Her employees are much less effective because they \nnow spend hours every day waiting for law firm Web sites to load that \nare stuck in the Internet's slow lane. Her costs go up. Her \nproductivity and her profits go down.\n  In each of these two new examples I have outlined of the consequences \nfor our small businesses, the large businesses that own the Internet \npipes are going to be extending their reach to the detriment of small \nbusiness. According to the business plans of the big phone and cable \ncompanies, and what they have told Wall Street, what has been outlined \nin the Wall Street Journal newspaper, that is the direction they are \nheading. Without Net neutrality, neither of the small businesses in the \nexamples I have cited is going to be able to use the Net in the way \nthey do now, and they are going to be disadvantaged at a time when they \nare a big part of America's future in competing in the global \nmarketplace.\n  The big cable and phone companies have spent millions--more than $40 \nmillion since January of this year--to try to make the American people \nthink that Net neutrality is, to quote one Verizon lobbyist, a ``lose-\nlose proposition.'' The absence of Net neutrality will be the lose-lose \nfor consumers. Discrimination will be seen in Internet content, and we \nwill see higher prices for consumers. That is why more than 500 groups \nof all political philosophies and persuasions have come together to \ndraw a line in the sand and say: We are going to insist that the \nInternet remain discrimination free.\n  At the end of the day, this issue of Net neutrality, despite what the \nopponents and the lobbyists want the Senate to think, isn't that \ncomplicated. Today, the way the Net works is you go with your browser \nwhere you want, when you want, and everybody is treated equally. Those \nwho oppose Net neutrality want to change all that. They want to make it \npossible for phone companies and cable companies to play favorites. \nThey will be in a position to charge some people more and some people \nless. They are people who want to change the way the Net works today, \nwhich is that everybody gets a fair shake.\n  And that is, again, the point of my citing this afternoon AT's \nprofits that come from wireless services. I repeat, I am glad to see \nAT do well. I believe in markets, and markets are what make our \ncountry's free enterprise system go. But AT is doing well with an \nInternet that is based on the principle of equality, Net neutrality, \nand no American facing discrimination on line.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Tennessee here, and he remembers \nour discussion about taxation and on-line services and on-line \nbusinesses. The Senate worked together on a bipartisan basis, and we \nhave kept the Internet free of discrimination as it relates to \ntaxation. I think it makes no sense at all for the Senate to say we are \ngoing to let the Internet prosper as it relates to taxation--and \ntaxation is a big factor, obviously, in business opportunities and \nbusiness sales--it makes no sense to keep the Internet free of \ndiscrimination as it relates to taxation and then to throw Net \nneutrality in the trash can and allow discrimination as it relates to \nso many other aspects of on-line business and services that are \nimportant to the American people.\n  So this is the fourth time I have come to the floor to discuss this \nissue. I do not want to see consumers face the double barrel of \ndiscrimination and higher prices on line. It is my intent to keep my \nhold on that overhaul of the telecommunications legislation on until I \nsee that bill has been changed, until I see it has been altered and \nrevised to ensure the core principle of the Internet--that everybody \ngets a fair shake and that the Internet is free of discrimination. My \nhold stays until that bill is altered so we can preserve an Internet \nfree of discrimination for all Americans in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8368-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8368-S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONEST LEADERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY CONTRACTING ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece of legislation which we \noffered previously during this Congress, unsuccessfully, I might add, \nthat I and others intend to offer once again.\n  I want to describe it and describe why we intend to offer it again as \nwe find additional legislation on the floor of the Senate with which to \noffer it as an amendment. It deals with accountability in contracting. \nThe legislation we have introduced is called Honest Leadership and \nAccountability in Contracting Act of 2006. I introduced it on March 2, \nS. 2361. The bill is sponsored by 30 of my colleagues here in the \nSenate. Senator Reid joined me in announcing the legislation that day. \nThe bill includes contributions from a number of Members of the Senate \nand the work they did on issues relating to this which we have put in \nthe bill.\n  I want to describe the bill briefly. It is a bill that will punish \nwar profiteers with substantial penalties for profiteering during \nwartime contracts. It is a bill that will crack down on defense \ncontract cheaters by restoring a rule on suspension and debarment, to \nsay we are not satisfied any longer when we see someone cheating on a \ncontract and cheating the American taxpayer to say, Well, you get a \nslap on the wrist and a pat on the back and a new contract. This gets \ntough. It cracks down on contract cheaters. It will force real contract \ncompetition, and it will do so by prohibiting the awarding of large \nmonopoly, sole-source, no-bid contracts.\n  The legislation has a number of other provisions as well, but it is \nimportant legislation. I want to describe why, and I want to describe \nsome of the things I have been doing.\n  Let me start by saying this is not about Democrats or Republicans. It \nis not about conservatives or liberals. Waste is not part of it. Waste \nis just waste. Contract abuse is not partisan. It is just abuse of the \nAmerican taxpayer. Let me describe a couple of things to begin this \ndiscussion.\n  This is April 30, 2006, in the New York Times. The United States pays \nfor 150 Iraqi clinics and manages to build 20.\n  A $243 million program led by the United States Army Corps of \nEngineers to build 150 health clinics in Iraq has in some cases \nproduced little more than empty shells of crumbling concrete and \nshattered bricks cemented together in uneven walls.\n  What is that about? It is about a huge contract, a contract to \nproduce 150 health care clinics in Iraq, and now we see the money is \ngone, but the health care clinics weren't built--not 150 of them. Only \n20 of them were built. Yet the money is gone. Let me talk about these \nissues and go back to the beginning of what piqued my interest.\n  In February of 2004, I began hearing from some whistleblowers who \nsaid: We want to tell our story. So as chairman of the Democratic \nPolicy Committee, we convened some hearings and listened to them. We \nheld eight oversight hearings on the issue of contracting abuses in \nIraq and heard from whistleblowers. I will describe them.\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\n  We had two oversight hearings on the response to Hurricane Katrina, \nand I will describe just a bit of that. But let me describe this, going \nback to February of 2004, almost 2\\1/2\\ years ago. This is a \ndescription of what is happening in contracts in Iraq.\n  Henry Bunting is a fellow who came to see me. He worked in Kuwait. He \nworked for Kellogg, Brown and Root, which is a subsidiary of \nHalliburton. You might recall, they got big no-bid, sole-source \ncontracts and made a lot of money. He worked as a field buyer in \nKuwait.\n  He told us they spent up to $7,500 a month to rent ordinary cars and \ntrucks. Think of that. American taxpayers pay for that.\n  The company had purchased monogrammed towels for $7.50 apiece when \nthey could have cost $2.50. These are hand towels for American \nsoldiers. The company that was buying them told Henry: We want the \ncompany name embroidered on the towel.\n  That more than doubled the cost to the taxpayer. The company said: It \ndoesn't matter, this is cost-plus; the American taxpayer is going to \npick up the tab.\n  It is almost unbelievable.\n  Another thing Henry told us, 25 tons of nails, that is 50,000 pounds \nof nails, were ordered and delivered to Iraq. They were the wrong size. \nThey are laying in the sand.\n  It doesn't matter. The American taxpayer is going to pick up the tab.\n  Henry came forward. I wonder what kind of courage it took for Henry \nto come forward and tell us that, but he did it and good for him. It \npiqued my interest, however, in February 2004, to hear whistleblowers \ntalk about what was going on with respect to contracting in Iraq. Then, \nin subsequent stories we would hear about contracting abuses.\n\n       ``Pentagon auditors found that Halliburton cannot properly \n     document more than $1.8 billion in work under its \n     contracts,'' Army officials said yesterday. The $1.8 billion \n     amounts to about 42 percent of the $4.3 billion the company \n     has billed to the U.S. Government under the contracts.\n\n  Among other things, they were charging the U.S. Government for \nfeeding 42,000 soldiers every day. It turns out they were only feeding \n14,000 soldiers. I can understand missing a cheeseburger or two, but \n28,000 meals? Overcharging by 28,000 meals a day? I don't think that is \njust missing a meal or two.\n  So we began having some hearings because the committees of \njurisdiction, the authorizing committees where this money was spent, \nwere not having oversight hearings.\n  We had a woman named Bunnatine Greenhouse come to Congress. I want to \ntell you what Bunnatine Greenhouse said. Bunnatine Greenhouse was the \nhighest civilian official in the Corps of Engineers, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, in the Pentagon. She was the highest civilian official, \nhighest ranking procurement official in the Corps of Engineers. She was \nin charge of all procurement.\n  She had the courage to go public. Here is what she said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and \n     improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of \n     my professional career.\n\n  Let me tell you about this woman. Every evaluation ever given her \nsaid she is outstanding, she is exceptional. Now she doesn't have her \njob any longer. She lost that job because she had the courage to speak \nout. They are investigating that now at the Pentagon. But that is what \nshe said.\n  Instead of taking the company to task, instead of taking the folks in \nthe Corps of Engineers to task, they took to task the woman who had the \ncourage to come here and speak the truth.\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse has been replaced. I mentioned she was demoted. \nShe lost her job. She has been replaced by an American who has no \nexperience in procurement. Isn't that interesting? They bring in a \nperson with 40 years government experience and no experience in \nprocurement. They are actually sending her to school to learn about \nprocurement.\n  I don't understand this. We have seen what happens when you bring in \npeople without experience. We saw it in FEMA, filling top jobs with \ncronies who had no experience with disaster preparedness or relief, and \nit just collapsed.\n\n  Now we have the top civilian contracting official in Iraq who pays \nfor it with her job when she speaks out. She says what is going on is \nwrong, and we don't have to take her word for it; just look at the \nheadlines. It is wrong. She pays for it with her job, and she is \nreplaced by someone who doesn't have experience in contracting. It just \nbaffles me that somehow this is continuing.\n  I mentioned we have had a good many hearings. I have not preferred to \nhave the hearings, but I have said if the authorization committee of \njurisdiction isn't going to hold oversight hearings, and there are \nwhistleblowers who want to speak, I am perfectly willing to hear them \non behalf of the American taxpayers. The hearings have shown us just a \ndramatic amount of waste, fraud, and abuse. Much of it is being \ninvestigated.\n  The fellow working for the U.S. Department of Defense for 30 years \nwho ran the fuel operation to get fuel to the soldiers wherever they \nare in the world retired. Then he came to us publicly, and he said: \nWhat the American taxpayer is being charged to fuel those army trucks \nin Iraq is unbelievable. They are being so overcharged.\n  This is from the guy who used to do it all over the world for 30 \nyears.\n  We had a fellow named Rory show up at a hearing. Rory was a food \nservice supervisor in Iraq. Rory actually testified by Internet. He was \na food supervisor, worked for KBR, Halliburton.\n  He said: You know, we had all kinds of food that was transported in \nto feed the troops in Iraq. We had food brought in that had expired \ndate stamps on it: This food is expired. Don't serve after this date. \nOur supervisor said it doesn't matter what the date stamp says, serve \nthe food. Put the food on the table. It doesn't matter that it is \nexpired. He said that was routine.\n  Second, he said he was told and others were told: Don't you dare talk \nto government investigators. When they come around, if you talk to a \ngovernment investigator one of two things are going to happen. You are \ngoing to get fired or you are going to get sent to an area where there \nis significant hostile action.\n  This man named Rory talked to investigators, and guess where he ended \nup. He ended up in Fallujah, during hostilities. It is pretty \nunbelievable to me that we have contractors who tell employees don't \ndare talk to a government auditor if they show up.\n  Let me show a picture of some money. This is a picture of a \ntransaction in the country of Iraq. This fellow came and wanted to \ntestify. He was a fellow who was in Iraq, in this room.\n  This, by the way, is $2 million in cash in one-hundred-dollar bills \nwrapped in Saran wrap. He is the fellow who dispensed the money, early \non. He had all these contracts going on. This money went to a company \ncalled Custer Battles. We had a hearing on that as well. This $2 \nmillion went to Custer Battles.\n  Two guys show up in Iraq with not much experience and very little \nmoney and they decide to get contracts. They get contracts. It is the \nWild West. This guy says it is like the Wild West. They say: You bring \na bag because we pay in cash. That is the way we operate.\n  Custer Battles gets a contract to provide security at the Baghdad \nairport. Among other things, it is alleged they took the forklifts, \ntook them over to a warehouse, painted them blue, and then resold them \nto the Provisional Authority, which was Uncle Sam. But that is part of \nthe story. They ended up getting $100 million, and this is $2 million \nof that. This fellow said we actually played football with these \nthings. We pay in cash, bring a bag, it is like the old West. He said \nit was unbelievable.\n  Let me show what the Baghdad airport director of security said about \nthe company that got this money. He said:\n\n       Custer Battles have shown themselves to be unresponsive, \n     uncooperative, incompetent, deceitful, manipulative and war \n     profiteers. Other than that, they are swell fellows.\n\n  This is from the director of security, in a memo to the U.S. Federal \nGovernment, then called the Coalition Provisional Authority. The \nBaghdad airport director of security, here is what he said about the \npeople who were getting our money.\n  I look at all these things, and I ask the question: What is going on? \nHow can they do this?\n\n[[Page S8370]]\n\n  Just the other day, the Pentagon finally announced that we are going \nto now require some bidding on contracts--billions of dollars late. Let \nme show you what they said. ``Army to end expansive, exclusive \nHalliburton deal.''\n  I am not just talking about Halliburton. It happens most of these \npress things are about Halliburton, KBR, but there are others--Custer \nBattles and others as well. Whenever you have this much money being \nthrown out there with no-bid contracts and sole-source contracts, I am \ntelling you it is like a hog in a crick. All you hear is grunting, \nthere is a lot of shoving, and everybody wants the money.\n  ``Army to end expansive exclusive Halliburton deal,'' It says:\n\n       Army is discontinuing a controversial multibillion dollar \n     deal with oil services giant Halliburton to provide \n     logistical support to U.S. troops worldwide, a decision that \n     could cut deeply.\n\n  Understand, the Army says very late: OK, now we will start bidding. \nWe will have several companies bid. And by the way, once the bidding is \ndone, we will have another company oversee the company that gets the \nbid.\n  Oversight is the responsibility of the Pentagon. When they put out a \ncontract, it is their responsibility to provide oversight. Our \nresponsibility is to figure out what we are spending in Congress, who \nis spending it, with what efficiency, and if it is wasted, to call into \naccount those who are wasting it.\n  Let me go back to the first chart that I showed today. This is yet \nanother company. This company is Parsons.\n\n       A $243 million program led by the United States Army Corps \n     of Engineers, through a contractor, to build 150 health care \n     clinics in Iraq and has in some cases produced little more \n     than empty shells of crumbling concrete and shattered bricks \n     cemented together into uneven walls.\n\n  We pay for 150 clinics and we get 20. The money is gone. The question \nis, Where did the money go and why? Who has it? What did we get for it? \nIs there accountability to the taxpayer for this sort of thing.\n  I understand in wartime money is spent in a way that is different, \nfrom time to time, than it is spent in peacetime. Sometimes you just \nhave to spend extra money to get things done. But $45 for a case of \nCoca-Cola; $7,600 a month to rent vehicles? I don't think so. I mean, \nthat is just the tiny little tip of the iceberg.\n  The question is, What comes of all of this? How do we stop all of \nthis? How do we decide, on behalf of the American taxpayers, that this \nmatters and we are not going to let this happen again? We have some \npeople coming tomorrow who are going to talk about this contract, \npeople who were in Iraq and watched this happen. We are going to \nevaluate what happened.\n  As has been the case in every circumstance, we will refer what we \nfind to the Department of Defense and ask why.\n  We held a hearing on the subject of water. I know the Presiding \nOfficer, in fact, in his subcommittee has taken a look at this and has \nasked some tough questions and is trying to figure out what was \nhappening there.\n  We have never quite figured out what has happened because the \ncontractor and the Defense Department each point fingers and say \nnothing happened. Then they say the other side made it happen.\n  About this water circumstance, we had people come to testify, saying: \nWe were there.\n  Here is the report. The report says they were hooking up for \nnonpotable water--that water which is used by soldiers in Iraq to brush \ntheir teeth, to wash their faces, to take showers--they were hooking up \nhoses that had water that was more dangerous than water that came right \nout of the Euphrates River, water with no disinfectant at all.\n  In fact, we had an e-mail from an Army physician who is in Iraq. She \nsaid: I have seen this. In fact, I went and tracked the hoses to find \nout where this water was coming from and what the contractor was doing \nwith it. It was contaminated water that was worse quality than the \nwater you take if you dip a pail in the Euphrates.\n  It is unbelievable. People get paid for this, they are incompetent, \nand they decide it doesn't matter? The person in charge of all the \nwater in Iraq to be served to U.S. troops for Halliburton wrote an \ninternal memorandum that I have made public. He said this was a near \nmiss for us. It could have been mass sickness or even death. That was \nWill Granger, the top water quality manager, on May 13, last year.\n  Remember, this is a company which says this didn't happen. The \nPentagon says it didn't happen. This is the internal Halliburton \ncompany report:\n\n       This event should be considered a ``NEAR MISS'' as the \n     consequences of these actions could have been very SEVERE, \n     resulting in mass sickness or death.\n\n  Officially, this company still insists this didn't happen. Their \ninternal reports by their own employees in Iraq demonstrate it not only \nhappened, it was very serious.\n  I don't do this because I am trying to make life miserable for \nsomebody. I do this because we need to protect the American troops, \nfirst and foremost; and second, we need to protect the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I much prefer that the authorization committees of jurisdiction \nthrough which this money moves would hold tough accountability \nhearings, call people in, put them under oath. But that has not \nhappened. As a result, I have held a series of hearings as chairman of \nthe Policy Committee. Such a hearing will occur in the morning on this \nissue of health care clinics.\n  My hope is that at some point, we will find an appetite in this \nSenate from people on both sides. This is not a Republican or a \nDemocratic issue. I hope we will find an appetite by everyone in this \nSenate to decide we are going to insist on people being accountable for \nthe money that is spent and for what is done with respect to providing \nfor American soldiers and doing what is necessary to be done under \nthese contracts.\n  These contractors have fallen far short. The American taxpayers have \nbeen fleeced. They have taken a bath as a result of these kinds of \nactions. I know as I say this that there are undoubtedly some very good \ncontractors. They have some good workers who risk their lives. They \nhave done some good work. I say, God bless them. But when I see stories \nsuch as this, it makes my blood boil.\n  Harry Truman served in this Chamber. In fact, the first desk I had \nwas a desk sat in by Harry Truman. He sat in this Chamber back in the \nearly 1940s when we were at war. A President of his own party was in \nthe White House. Harry Truman said: There is too much waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the Pentagon, in military spending, and they established the \nTruman Committee. He went all around the country holding hearings. They \nfound billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. That was the \nlegacy of the Truman Committee.\n  We ought to have one again. I have offered in the Senate, and I have \nbeen voted down. I think I have offered it now three times. By the way, \nI will offer it again. A good idea does not have to die a natural \ndeath. At some point, it can survive and succeed.\n  But more than the Truman Committee, I believe we ought to pass the \nlegislation I described as I started. That legislation is legislation I \nintroduced on March 3 of this year. It is now the end of July. On March \n2, Senator Reid, myself, and 30 of my colleagues introduced legislation \ncalled the Honest Leadership and Accountability In Contracting Act of \n2006. It is long past the time for this Congress to have done what we \nshould have done a month or 2 ago, 3 months ago; that is, pass this \nlegislation, punish war profiteers, and do so aggressively. End \ncronyism in these key positions, especially in contracting, crack down \non contract cheaters, and force real contract competition, real \ncompetition that gives the taxpayer the best price and holds \naccountable those contractors for getting the job done and getting it \ndone in the right way.\n  I am going to pursue this, as I have indicated, with additional \nhearings, if necessary. I would much prefer they be done by the \nauthorizing committees. One way or another, we are going to pursue \nthese questions and ask for accountability and demand accountability.\n  As I said when I started, none of this is about politics. Republicans \nand Democrats work together on things from time to time in this Senate. \nThis is one we can and should and I hope will work together on to fix \nfor the good of this country and for the good of the American people.\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8368-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8368-S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONEST LEADERSHIP AND ACCOUNTABILITY CONTRACTING ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece of legislation which we \noffered previously during this Congress, unsuccessfully, I might add, \nthat I and others intend to offer once again.\n  I want to describe it and describe why we intend to offer it again as \nwe find additional legislation on the floor of the Senate with which to \noffer it as an amendment. It deals with accountability in contracting. \nThe legislation we have introduced is called Honest Leadership and \nAccountability in Contracting Act of 2006. I introduced it on March 2, \nS. 2361. The bill is sponsored by 30 of my colleagues here in the \nSenate. Senator Reid joined me in announcing the legislation that day. \nThe bill includes contributions from a number of Members of the Senate \nand the work they did on issues relating to this which we have put in \nthe bill.\n  I want to describe the bill briefly. It is a bill that will punish \nwar profiteers with substantial penalties for profiteering during \nwartime contracts. It is a bill that will crack down on defense \ncontract cheaters by restoring a rule on suspension and debarment, to \nsay we are not satisfied any longer when we see someone cheating on a \ncontract and cheating the American taxpayer to say, Well, you get a \nslap on the wrist and a pat on the back and a new contract. This gets \ntough. It cracks down on contract cheaters. It will force real contract \ncompetition, and it will do so by prohibiting the awarding of large \nmonopoly, sole-source, no-bid contracts.\n  The legislation has a number of other provisions as well, but it is \nimportant legislation. I want to describe why, and I want to describe \nsome of the things I have been doing.\n  Let me start by saying this is not about Democrats or Republicans. It \nis not about conservatives or liberals. Waste is not part of it. Waste \nis just waste. Contract abuse is not partisan. It is just abuse of the \nAmerican taxpayer. Let me describe a couple of things to begin this \ndiscussion.\n  This is April 30, 2006, in the New York Times. The United States pays \nfor 150 Iraqi clinics and manages to build 20.\n  A $243 million program led by the United States Army Corps of \nEngineers to build 150 health clinics in Iraq has in some cases \nproduced little more than empty shells of crumbling concrete and \nshattered bricks cemented together in uneven walls.\n  What is that about? It is about a huge contract, a contract to \nproduce 150 health care clinics in Iraq, and now we see the money is \ngone, but the health care clinics weren't built--not 150 of them. Only \n20 of them were built. Yet the money is gone. Let me talk about these \nissues and go back to the beginning of what piqued my interest.\n  In February of 2004, I began hearing from some whistleblowers who \nsaid: We want to tell our story. So as chairman of the Democratic \nPolicy Committee, we convened some hearings and listened to them. We \nheld eight oversight hearings on the issue of contracting abuses in \nIraq and heard from whistleblowers. I will describe them.\n\n[[Page S8369]]\n\n  We had two oversight hearings on the response to Hurricane Katrina, \nand I will describe just a bit of that. But let me describe this, going \nback to February of 2004, almost 2\\1/2\\ years ago. This is a \ndescription of what is happening in contracts in Iraq.\n  Henry Bunting is a fellow who came to see me. He worked in Kuwait. He \nworked for Kellogg, Brown and Root, which is a subsidiary of \nHalliburton. You might recall, they got big no-bid, sole-source \ncontracts and made a lot of money. He worked as a field buyer in \nKuwait.\n  He told us they spent up to $7,500 a month to rent ordinary cars and \ntrucks. Think of that. American taxpayers pay for that.\n  The company had purchased monogrammed towels for $7.50 apiece when \nthey could have cost $2.50. These are hand towels for American \nsoldiers. The company that was buying them told Henry: We want the \ncompany name embroidered on the towel.\n  That more than doubled the cost to the taxpayer. The company said: It \ndoesn't matter, this is cost-plus; the American taxpayer is going to \npick up the tab.\n  It is almost unbelievable.\n  Another thing Henry told us, 25 tons of nails, that is 50,000 pounds \nof nails, were ordered and delivered to Iraq. They were the wrong size. \nThey are laying in the sand.\n  It doesn't matter. The American taxpayer is going to pick up the tab.\n  Henry came forward. I wonder what kind of courage it took for Henry \nto come forward and tell us that, but he did it and good for him. It \npiqued my interest, however, in February 2004, to hear whistleblowers \ntalk about what was going on with respect to contracting in Iraq. Then, \nin subsequent stories we would hear about contracting abuses.\n\n       ``Pentagon auditors found that Halliburton cannot properly \n     document more than $1.8 billion in work under its \n     contracts,'' Army officials said yesterday. The $1.8 billion \n     amounts to about 42 percent of the $4.3 billion the company \n     has billed to the U.S. Government under the contracts.\n\n  Among other things, they were charging the U.S. Government for \nfeeding 42,000 soldiers every day. It turns out they were only feeding \n14,000 soldiers. I can understand missing a cheeseburger or two, but \n28,000 meals? Overcharging by 28,000 meals a day? I don't think that is \njust missing a meal or two.\n  So we began having some hearings because the committees of \njurisdiction, the authorizing committees where this money was spent, \nwere not having oversight hearings.\n  We had a woman named Bunnatine Greenhouse come to Congress. I want to \ntell you what Bunnatine Greenhouse said. Bunnatine Greenhouse was the \nhighest civilian official in the Corps of Engineers, the Army Corps of \nEngineers, in the Pentagon. She was the highest civilian official, \nhighest ranking procurement official in the Corps of Engineers. She was \nin charge of all procurement.\n  She had the courage to go public. Here is what she said:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to \n     contracts awarded to KBR represents the most blatant and \n     improper contract abuse I have witnessed during the course of \n     my professional career.\n\n  Let me tell you about this woman. Every evaluation ever given her \nsaid she is outstanding, she is exceptional. Now she doesn't have her \njob any longer. She lost that job because she had the courage to speak \nout. They are investigating that now at the Pentagon. But that is what \nshe said.\n  Instead of taking the company to task, instead of taking the folks in \nthe Corps of Engineers to task, they took to task the woman who had the \ncourage to come here and speak the truth.\n  Bunnatine Greenhouse has been replaced. I mentioned she was demoted. \nShe lost her job. She has been replaced by an American who has no \nexperience in procurement. Isn't that interesting? They bring in a \nperson with 40 years government experience and no experience in \nprocurement. They are actually sending her to school to learn about \nprocurement.\n  I don't understand this.

This is a picture of a \ntransaction in the country of Iraq. This fellow came and wanted to \ntestify.

I know the Presiding \nOfficer, in fact, in his subcommittee has taken a look at this and has \nasked some tough questions and is trying to figure out what was \nhappening there.\n  We have never quite figured out what has happened because the \ncontractor and the Defense Department each point fingers and say \nnothing happened. Then they say the other side made it happen.\n  About this water circumstance, we had people come to testify, saying: \nWe were there.\n  Here is the report. The report says they were hooking up for \nnonpotable water--that water which is used by soldiers in Iraq to brush \ntheir teeth, to wash their faces, to take showers--they were hooking up \nhoses that had water that was more dangerous than water that came right \nout of the Euphrates River, water with no disinfectant at all.\n  In fact, we had an e-mail from an Army physician who is in Iraq. She \nsaid: I have seen this. In fact, I went and tracked the hoses to find \nout where this water was coming from and what the contractor was doing \nwith it. It was contaminated water that was worse quality than the \nwater you take if you dip a pail in the Euphrates.\n  It is unbelievable. People get paid for this, they are incompetent, \nand they decide it doesn't matter? The person in charge of all the \nwater in Iraq to be served to U.S. troops for Halliburton wrote an \ninternal memorandum that I have made public. He said this was a near \nmiss for us. It could have been mass sickness or even death. That was \nWill Granger, the top water quality manager, on May 13, last year.\n  Remember, this is a company which says this didn't happen. The \nPentagon says it didn't happen. This is the internal Halliburton \ncompany report:\n\n       This event should be considered a ``NEAR MISS'' as the \n     consequences of these actions could have been very SEVERE, \n     resulting in mass sickness or death.\n\n  Officially, this company still insists this didn't happen. Their \ninternal reports by their own employees in Iraq demonstrate it not only \nhappened, it was very serious.\n  I don't do this because I am trying to make life miserable for \nsomebody. I do this because we need to protect the American troops, \nfirst and foremost; and second, we need to protect the American \ntaxpayers.\n  I much prefer that the authorization committees of jurisdiction \nthrough which this money moves would hold tough accountability \nhearings, call people in, put them under oath. But that has not \nhappened. As a result, I have held a series of hearings as chairman of \nthe Policy Committee. Such a hearing will occur in the morning on this \nissue of health care clinics.\n  My hope is that at some point, we will find an appetite in this \nSenate from people on both sides. This is not a Republican or a \nDemocratic issue. I hope we will find an appetite by everyone in this \nSenate to decide we are going to insist on people being accountable for \nthe money that is spent and for what is done with respect to providing \nfor American soldiers and doing what is necessary to be done under \nthese contracts.\n  These contractors have fallen far short. The American taxpayers have \nbeen fleeced. They have taken a bath as a result of these kinds of \nactions. I know as I say this that there are undoubtedly some very good \ncontractors. They have some good workers who risk their lives. They \nhave done some good work. I say, God bless them. But when I see stories \nsuch as this, it makes my blood boil.\n  Harry Truman served in this Chamber. In fact, the first desk I had \nwas a desk sat in by Harry Truman. He sat in this Chamber back in the \nearly 1940s when we were at war. A President of his own party was in \nthe White House. Harry Truman said: There is too much waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the Pentagon, in military spending, and they established the \nTruman Committee. He went all around the country holding hearings. They \nfound billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. That was the \nlegacy of the Truman Committee.\n  We ought to have one again. I have offered in the Senate, and I have \nbeen voted down. I think I have offered it now three times. By the way, \nI will offer it again. A good idea does not have to die a natural \ndeath. At some point, it can survive and succeed.\n  But more than the Truman Committee, I believe we ought to pass the \nlegislation I described as I started. That legislation is legislation I \nintroduced on March 3 of this year. It is now the end of July. On March \n2, Senator Reid, myself, and 30 of my colleagues introduced legislation \ncalled the Honest Leadership and Accountability In Contracting Act of \n2006. It is long past the time for this Congress to have done what we \nshould have done a month or 2 ago, 3 months ago; that is, pass this \nlegislation, punish war profiteers, and do so aggressively. End \ncronyism in these key positions, especially in contracting, crack down \non contract cheaters, and force real contract competition, real \ncompetition that gives the taxpayer the best price and holds \naccountable those contractors for getting the job done and getting it \ndone in the right way.\n  I am going to pursue this, as I have indicated, with additional \nhearings, if necessary. I would much prefer they be done by the \nauthorizing committees. One way or another, we are going to pursue \nthese questions and ask for accountability and demand accountability.\n  As I said when I started, none of this is about politics. Republicans \nand Democrats work together on things from time to time in this Senate. \nThis is one we can and should and I hope will work together on to fix \nfor the good of this country and for the good of the American people.\n\n[[Page S8371]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8371-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF MARTY BERMAN\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Senate community is losing a longtime \nand valued employee. After 18 years of loyal and distinguished service, \nMarty Berman is retiring from the Senate Recording Studio. Marty played \nan integral part in the television broadcast of the Senate's \nproceedings and in helping facilitate the audio and video needs of \nSenators and their staffs.\n  His service to his country really started 45 years ago. Marty served \nfaithfully, enlisting twice in a military career that began when he was \n17 and lasted 6 years from 1961 to 1967. Before leaving the military he \nwas a communications specialist with duty in Vietnam.\n  Marty brought extensive television experience to his job at SRS. In \nthe private sector he worked at Satellite News Network, CNN, and \nfinally at CBS. His work for Charles Kuralt and CBS Sunday Morning was \nnominated for an Emmy. A 13-minute-long story he had photographed was \naired, which is the television equivalent of a long book.\n  His career at the recording studio began in 1988 where he quickly \ncame to specialize in audio operations. However, his contributions were \nnot just technical. He also had just the right personal touch with \nSenators. It isn't always easy to get up in front of TV cameras and \nlights to speak, even for Senators, but Marty had the ability to put \nany Senator at ease. When floor directing, he spoke to each Senator \neasily and with warmth, and they trusted him. He was never intimidated \nbut he was always respectful.\n  Marty can be a bit feisty, but his bark is much worse than his bite. \nTo those who have gotten to know him, he is warm and caring, too.\n  Marty ended where he had started, working the Senate television \nshift. In 18 years he braved many long days and late nights through the \nSenate's always unpredictable schedule. Throughout his time at the \nstudio, Marty could always be counted on to be at his post. That \nincluded his work as chief STV audio operator where for most days \nduring his shift he started up in the audio booth, assuring that the \nSenators could always be heard in the Chamber and on television.\n  Marty has two grown sons, Eric and Alex. The two have been the pride \nof his life and have become responsible and caring adults. His marriage \nto Darlene has brought him much happiness. Both share the same three \nhobbies: antique collecting, antique collecting and more antique \ncollecting. Their home is a somewhat cluttered but fascinating museum \nof American Western and American Indian artifacts, pottery, Big Little \nBooks and just about anything else you can think of. Last but not \nleast, there are four others who hold a place in his heart. They are \nHoover the yellow lab, Clarence the bassett hound, Crystal the cat, and \nBirdie the cockatiel. Birdie likes to lie back and listen to the blues \nwith Marty and Darlene and can even whistle ``Bridge on the River \nKwai.''\n  Marty's unique personality, loyalty, and dedication will be missed. \nWe all join to wish Marty the best as he begins this next adventure in \nhis life and know he will enjoy the newfound time for family, friends, \npets, and antique collecting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8371-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8371-S8372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CARL PERKINS CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to support final passage of \nS. 250, the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement \nAct. This legislation represents a bipartisan effort to enhance and \nstrengthen career and technical education programs across the United \nStates.\n  In my home State of Nevada, career and technical education programs \nenjoy strong support. Recently, career and technical educators from \nacross the State came together to come up with common course standards \nfor students that focus on certain career and technical education \nprograms. Nevada also has a Career and Technical Education Plan that \nlinks these course standards with the academic requirements of the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  I have always supported the Perkins Career and Technical Education \nProgram because I believe that these programs often catch students that \nslip through the cracks in traditional education programs. Career and \ntechnical education programs provide students with real world \napplications for what they are learning in the classroom. Students in \nNevada have the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art technology in \ntheir classrooms to learn the skills they need in the workforce. Too \noften these are students that would have dropped out of school had \ncareer and technical education courses not been available.\n  During the conference committee on this important legislation, I was \nhonored to work with my colleagues to strengthen this legislation. We \nworked to ensure that career and technical education programs have \nstrong performance indicators that are linked to meet industry \nstandards as well as academic achievement. The tech-prep grant program \nwas maintained as a separate program to encourage continued innovation \nin career and technical education programs. This legislation also \nencourages states to develop articulation agreements and sequences of \ncourses, something Nevada has already worked hard to develop. Finally, \nthis legislation recognizes the importance of strong partnerships \nbetween high schools and institutions of higher education that support \nthese programs.\n  During the conference I worked hard to ensure that funding for the \nPerkins programs continued to flow to fast-growing States. It is \nvitally important that funding follow students to their new homes. To \nthat end, we maintained the current hold harmless level at the 1998 \nlevel. This allows millions of dollars to move from State to State \naccording to student population counts. As a Senator for one of the \nfastest growing States in the country, it is my duty to ensure that \neach of the children in Nevada, whether they were born in Nevada or \njust recently moved there, are accounted for when Federal funds are \nallocated to States.\n  I am pleased that all of my colleagues supported final passage, and \nlook forward to working with career and technical educators in Nevada \nto implement this important law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the passage of \nthe Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of \n2006. Perkins, the Federal Government's largest investment in our \nNation's high schools, provides critical resources for students \npursuing career and technical education at the secondary and \npostsecondary levels. Although the President has proposed eliminating \nthe program in recent budget requests, Perkins has enjoyed a long \nhistory of bipartisan support. More than 11 million students are \ncurrently enrolled in some form of career and technical education and I \nam confident this reauthorization will improve the programs and \nservices available to help them realize their goals.\n  I am particularly heartened by this bill's heightened focus on \nindividualized student counseling and the use of graduation and career \nplans. For too many students, high school graduation and postsecondary \neducation seem out of reach. That is why I have introduced my Pathways \nfor All Students to Succeed, PASS, Act. The PASS Act provides \nassistance for schools to hire and train mathematics and literacy \ncoaches; supports the collection and reporting of accurate graduation \nrates; and targets funding for struggling schools to implement reforms. \nIt also dedicates resources to increase the number of academic \ncounselors working in schools. Research has shown that providing early \nhigh school students with guidance boosts the likelihood that they will \ngraduate with a diploma. Early, individualized planning also helps \nstudents obtain the coursework and training they need to achieve their \nprofessional aspirations. I applaud the increased focus on \nindividualized student counseling and planning in Perkins, which will \nreach career and technical education students earlier in their \nschooling and put them on a track to graduate.\n  This Perkins reauthorization retains and strengthens the Tech Prep \nprogram, which encourages states to design and implement innovative \nprograms that combine secondary and postsecondary activities into a \ncoherent set of courses. In my home State of Washington, it is \nestimated that workforce training at community and technical colleges \nincreases a student's lifetime earnings by more than $150,000.\n\n[[Page S8372]]\n\nFederal Perkins dollars, matched by States and localities, are \nprecisely the kind of government investment that pays off over a \nlifetime and I salute the continuation of these important programs.\n  In addition, I am heartened by several of the major changes we made \nto update the bill. We strengthened the emphasis on assisting students \nin preparing for high skill, high wage or high demand occupations, \nensuring that we provide our students with skills they need to remain \ncompetitive in today's global marketplace. We promoted partnerships \namong high schools, community colleges, local workforce investment \nboards, business and industry, with the twin goals of providing \nstudents with pathways toward skilled occupations and producing the \ntrained workers that employers need. We promoted professional \ndevelopment opportunities for career and technical education teachers, \ncounselors, and administrators, so that those leading our classrooms \nand schools remain on the cutting edge of ever-changing workplaces and \neconomy.\n  I commend this bill for bolstering the reporting requirements for \nPerkins programs, extending this level of transparency to the local \nlevel and requiring disaggregation for important population subgroups, \nincluding individuals with disabilities; students from economically \ndisadvantaged families, including foster children; people preparing for \nnontraditional training and employment; and single parents, including \nsingle pregnant women. I am pleased that States now are required to \nreport on student rates of attainment of diplomas and GEDs, as well as \nannual graduation rates. Valid and reliable data serves both an \naccountability and diagnostic function, and I am pleased to see that \nthis reauthorization requires states to collect and publicize this \ninformation.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kennedy, Chairman Enzi, Chairman \nMcKeon, and Congressman Miller for their leadership on this bill. I \nalso want to thank Carmel Martin, Jane Oates, J.D. LaRock, Beth \nBuehlmann, Scott Fleming, Whitney Rhoades, and Denise Forte for their \nhard work. The time and effort dedicated by members and staff is \nevident in the quality of the final product and I am pleased to support \nthe reauthorization of the act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8372-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8372-S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION AND AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been advised by Chairman Specter's \nstaff that the chairman is correcting the Record regarding some \nmaterials that were inserted last Thursday, July 20, 2006, during \ndebate on reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. I thank the \nchairman for correcting the Record. Contrary to how it appeared in the \nRecord, those materials did not reflect work of the bipartisan staff of \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  I understand that the chairman filed a committee report last night on \nS. 2703, the Senate bill reported by the committee last Wednesday. I \nhave yet to see a copy of that final report, nor is it yet publicly \navailable. Indeed, no draft committee report on S. 2703 was circulated \nto the committee until July 24, 2006, 5 days after the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously voted to report it and the chairman had reported \nit, and four days after the Senate unanimously passed H.R. 9, the bill \nthat President Bush signed into law this morning. That draft report did \nnot contain findings based on the extensive record created in both the \nHouse and Senate.\n  In this highly unusual development, as the report filed should \nindicate, it does not reflect the views of a majority of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. This, in spite of the fact that all members voted \nto report the bill favorably.\n  Fortunately, we had the foresight to include legislative findings in \nthe body of the legislation itself. Those findings, based on the \nrecord, were adopted by the House and unanimously by the Senate last \nweek. I want to thank Chairman Sensenbrenner, Ranking Member Conyers, \nCongressmen Watt and Lewis, and all those who worked so hard to \nassemble and consider that record in the House. Their outstanding work \ngave us in the Senate a great start, which we supplemented with nine \nadditional hearings. The findings remained the same and were adopted in \nidentical form by both Houses. It is that bill and those findings, \nbased on the extensive record that 18 members of the Judiciary \nCommittee voted to report as part of S. 2703 last Wednesday, July 19 \nand that 98 Senators voted for in adopting H.R. 9 last Thursday, July \n20.\n  With regard to committee consideration, after nine hearings, the \ncommittee held a special business meeting at my request to debate S. \n2703 on July 19. At our business meeting, the committee debated and \nvoted on only one substantive amendment, Senator Coburn's amendment \nrelated to section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. It was debated and \nthen defeated. Other than an amendment I offered at Senator Salazar's \nsuggestion to add the name of Cesar Chavez to the short title, which \nwas adopted, no other amendments were offered. The record is the \nrecord. As reported by The Houston Chronicle the next day, Senator \nCornyn said: ``I decided that any amendments would be defeated, so I \ndecided not to offer any.''\n  As Chairman Specter's deadline approached yesterday for filing views \nto be included in a highly unusual committee report, the Democratic \nSenators learned that the document the chairman was prepared to sign \nand file had changed dramatically from the document he had circulated \nas a draft report on July 24, 2006. As sponsors of the Senate \nlegislation who have supported it pressed for its enactment and voted \nfor it, we felt compelled to file views registering our disappointment \nthat the views then being circulated did not reflect our views, did not \nproperly reflect the record supporting our bill, and did not fully \nendorse the bill we introduced, sponsored and that we and all members \nof the committee voted to report favorably to the Senate. After we \nfiled our views, I understand the report was revised even further to \nincorporate what had previously been styled as supplemental views into \na new and not previously circulated version.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of \nthe signature page showing that even then only nine Republican members \nof the committee, less than a majority, endorsed the report.\n  Of course, at the time of floor debate and consideration of H.R. 9 in \nthe Senate, no Senate committee report on S. 2703 was available to \nSenators. Fortunately at the time of Senate floor debate and \nconsideration of H.R. 9 in the Senate last week, Senators had available \nto them an extensive record to inform their votes. We had the \nvoluminous Senate Judiciary Committee record, including thousands of \npages of testimony. We had the full record before the House of \nRepresentatives, including thousands of pages of testimony. We had the \nHouse Committee Report and the full debate on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives, including debate surrounding four substantive \namendments to H.R. 9 that were all rejected.\n  Leading up to final passage of the Voting Rights Act reauthorization, \nI provided the Senate with some of the extensive evidence received in \nthe Judiciary Committee about the persistence of discriminatory \npractices in covered jurisdictions that supports reauthorization of \nthis crucial provision. I provided evidence regarding the need for \nfixes to two Supreme Court decisions to clarify Congress's intent \nregarding the Voting Rights Act to reinforce the original purpose of \nthe act. I also pointed to evidence supporting the extension of the \nact's critical bilingual language assistance provisions. I included \nstatements in the Congressional Record from Tuesday and Wednesday and \navailable to all Senators during the course of the debate. I referred \nto that evidence early in the debate last Thursday.\n  Most importantly, of course, at the time we voted, all Senators had \nbefore them the detailed findings in section 2 of the legislation based \non the record and all Senators endorsed those findings with their \nvotes. For example, those findings explicitly include:\n\n       ``Evidence of continued discrimination includ[ing] . . . \n     the hundreds of objections interposed, requests for more \n     information submitted followed by voting changes withdrawn \n     from consideration by jurisdictions covered by the Voting \n     Rights Act of 1965, and\n\n[[Page S8373]]\n\n     section 5 enforcement actions undertaken by the Department \n     of Justice in covered jurisdictions since 1982 that \n     prevented election practices, such as annexation, at-large \n     voting, and the use of multi-member districts, from being \n     enacted to dilute minority voting strength; . . . the \n     number of requests for declaratory judgments denied by the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia; \n     . . . the continued filing of section 2 cases that \n     originated in covered jurisdictions; and . . . the \n     litigation pursued by the Department of Justice since 1982 \n     to enforce sections 4(e), 4(f)(4), and 203 of such Act to \n     ensure that all language minority citizens have full \n     access to the political process.'' In addition, those \n     findings include, ``[t]he continued evidence of racially \n     polarized voting in each of the jurisdictions covered by \n     the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \n     demonstrates that racial and language minorities remain \n     politically vulnerable, warranting the continued \n     protection of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.''\n\n  These findings the Senate adopted in its unanimous vote for H.R. 9 \nand as a reauthorization measure also incorporated the statutory \nfindings within the following provisions of the Voting Rights Act of \n1965: section 203(a); section 4(f)(1); section 10(a); and section \n202(a).\n  By passing the legislation, Congress has adopted and reaffirmed the \ndetailed findings in H.R. 9. The Senate unanimously adopted these \nfindings. Nothing inserted in the Record thereafter can diminish the \nforce of those findings contained within the enacted legislation \nitself. As several courts have properly recognized, postpassage \n``legislative history'' is a contradiction in terms.\n  Earlier today, we celebrated the reauthorization and revitalization \nof the Voting Rights Act when President Bush signed that bill into law. \nI know that many in his party are unhappy with him, but I think he did \nthe right thing. The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important \nlaws Congress has ever passed. I am proud to say that our democracy and \nour Nation have been better and richer for it.\n  The Voting Rights Act is the keystone in the foundation of civil \nrights laws and is one of the most important methods of protecting all \nAmericans' foundational right to vote. Several generations have kept \nthe chain of support for the Voting Rights Act unbroken, and now our \ngeneration has done its part to continue that legacy and revitalize the \nact.\n  Keeping the Voting Rights Act intact is important, but enforcing it \nis equally important. Now that Congress has passed this bill--and the \nPresident has signed it--it is up to the President to ensure that this \nlaw and all of its provisions are enforced fully and faithfully. I was \npleased today to hear the President commit to aggressive enforcement \nand to defend the act from legal attacks. Article I of the Constitution \nprovides for the Congress to write the laws, and article II provides \nfor the President to enforce them. Congress has done its part, and now \nthe President must do his. I commend him for saying that he will. That \nwas the most important thing the President said today.\n  The President has not always been a supporter of this important civil \nrights law. While Governor of Texas, President Bush fought against some \nof the key antidiscrimination provisions Congress just reauthorized, as \nnoted in a front page story in today's Washington Times. Today the \nPresident acted on behalf of all Americans and did the right thing \ndespite the backbiting and criticism within his party. I commend him.\n  Now his responsibility is to faithfully execute the law and \naggressively enforce its provisions. I trust we will not see another \nafter-the-fact Presidential signing statement undercutting the \ncommitment he made today in his public statement and by signing the \nFannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act \nReauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.\n  The enactment of this law is a triumph for all Americans and a \ntestament to efforts of its supporters in the House and Senate. On \nseveral occasions there were attempts by some to derail this bill. \nThose efforts continue. Fortunately, the findings in the act itself and \nthe record we have built supports this important measure. We know that \neffective enforcement of these provisions is vital in stamping out \ndiscrimination that, unfortunately, still exists in this Nation today. \nAs the President has acknowledged, the wound is not healed and there is \nmore to do to protect the rights of all Americans to vote and have \ntheir votes count.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the signature page to which I referred \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Arlen Specter\n         Orrin Hatch\n         Chuck Grassley\n         Jon Kyl\n         Jeff Sessions\n         Lindsey Graham\n         John Cornyn\n         Sam Brownback\n         Tom Coburn\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8373-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF FREDERIC S. MISHKIN\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the \nnomination of Dr. Frederic Mishkin to be a Federal Reserve Governor and \nwhy I voted against him.\n  I do not think Professor Mishkin is the right choice for the Federal \nReserve. I am not convinced that he will be an independent voice.\n  I met with Professor Mishkin a few weeks ago and found Professor \nMishkin to be a pleasant and intelligent man. I do not question his \nintegrity or his qualifications for the job. He has spent his entire \ncareer studying and writing about monetary policy and economics. And \nhis passion is evident.\n  To me, the question is not about Professor Mishkin's qualifications \nbut about the kind of Fed we need. I do not hold Professor Mishkin's \nlong friendship with Chairman Bernanke against him, nor do I think he \nwill have problems speaking his mind to the chairman when they \ndisagree. My concern is that those disagreements will be few and far \nbetween, and that the chairman hand picked him for that reason.\n  More than that, I am afraid the Fed has too many people with the same \nbackground. Many Fed members have spent a great deal of time studying \ncentral bank actions, but too few have experience dealing with the \nreal-world consequences of those actions. Even Fed Chairman Ben \nBernanke recently agreed that having people with different backgrounds \non the Fed is healthy, and he stated his support for the next nominee \nto come from the financial services industry.\n  However, Professor Mishkin will only continue the trend toward an \nivory-tower, academic Fed. Because of that, I voted ``no''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8373-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On January 23, 1981, in Chicago, IL, Stevie Lynch, a mentally \nretarded man, was attacked while walking to a friend's house. According \nto police, two men stopped Lynch on the street taunting him about his \ndisability and trying to make him drink beer. They then pulled him into \na passageway punching him and beating his head against the wall. Lynch \nsuffered fractures to his skull and jaw. His disability appeared to be \nthe sole motivation for the attack.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8373-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8373-S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PROBLEM WITH ILLEGAL GUNS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the last 10 years, there have been \nmore than 3.7 million crimes committed with firearms in this country. \nThat is an average of 100 violent gun crimes every day, with almost 60 \npercent of these violent gun crimes occurring in our Nation's major \ncities.\n\n[[Page S8374]]\n\n  America's major cities have been flooded with illegal guns. The \nunderground market for guns is largely a product of the diversion of \nmassive numbers of guns from licensed gun shops into the hands of \ncriminals. A variety of sources supply the illegal market, including \ntheft, unlicensed sellers who buy guns for the purpose of reselling \nthem, corrupt Federal firearms licensees, and straw purchasers who buy \nguns for other unlicensed sellers, criminal users, and juveniles. Based \non its own gun trafficking investigations, the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, has concluded that corrupt gun \ndealers are the source of the largest number of firearms diverted to \nthe illegal market. In 1998, the ATF found that 56 percent of dealers \nand 30 percent of pawnbrokers who sold 50 or more guns, had Federal \nfirearms violations. In addition, 18 percent of the dealers and 45 \npercent of the pawnbrokers had guns missing from their inventory.\n  Despite the fact that the ATF inspections often reveal multiple \nillegal acts by gun dealers, the revocation of a dealer's license is a \nrare and difficult event. In 2003, the ATF conducted 1,812 inspections \nthat uncovered regulatory violations with an average of over 80 \nviolations per dealer. Despite this large number of dealers with \nmultiple violations, the ATF issued only 54 notices of license \nrevocation that year.\n  I have consistently supported commonsense legislation to help stop \nthe flow of guns to the black market. Unfortunately, the failure of \nCongress to act on several commonsense bills has allowed criminals and \nterrorists continued easy access to guns. In addition to endangering \nour families and communities here in the United States, congressional \ninaction may also be helping to fuel international trafficking of \npowerful firearms.\n  If we make it harder for criminals to get guns, there will be fewer \ngun violence victims. By helping to keep guns out of the wrong hands, \nwe can save lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8374-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 3549, the \nForeign Investment and National Security Act of 2006, because it makes \ngreat strides in modernizing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the \nUnited States, CFIUS, process. I firmly believe that national security \nis paramount, and confidence must be restored in the CFIUS screening \nprocess. CFIUS creates a careful balance between national security and \nthe economic benefits of foreign investment. As such, we must protect \nour national security while not inadvertently and unnecessarily hurting \nthis job-creating investment.\n  Over 5 million Americans work for insourcing companies with a payroll \nof nearly $318 billion. In my State of Pennsylvania, 227,700 people owe \ntheir jobs to a foreign-based company. Pennsylvania is a State that has \nworked hard to attract international companies like Mack Trucks Inc., \nSAP America, and Sony. That effort has yielded positive results.\n  With regard to S. 3549, there are a few unresolved issues that were \nraised in the Banking Committee process that could raise barriers to \nbeneficial foreign investment. While the bill passed the committee \nunanimously, with my support, it was understood that a couple of \noutstanding concerns would be addressed before the bill would be signed \ninto law. At this time, these concerns remain.\n  Two provisions in particular that could have a negative impact on \npositive foreign direct investment that creates jobs, fosters \ninnovation and sustains U.S. manufacturing are: (1) the extension of \nthe initial 30-day review period to allow an additional 30-day review \nand (2) the creation of a congressional reporting requirement for \nindividual regulatory filings for each stage of the review process.\n  Mr. President, I hope that these concerns will be addressed in \nconference. While I support CFIUS reform, I believe there are issues \nthat need to be addressed prior to passing a final bill to ensure that \nCongress takes a reasonable approach to reforming this process. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Shelby to resolve these issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8374-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING BOB FELLER\n\n  Mr HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 110, sponsored by my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Ohio, which honors an American hero, Iowa's own Bob Feller.\n  Robert William Andrew Feller, better known to baseball fans as \n``Bullet Bob'' or ``Rapid Robert,'' will forever be recognized for his \ntalent, courage, and heart. Throughout his life, Feller has achieved \ntremendous success. Born on a farm in Van Meter, Iowa, in 1918, Feller \nbegan his baseball career playing American Legion, amateur and semi-pro \nbaseball on fields across the State.\n  He signed a contract to pitch for the Cleveland Indians in 1935 at \nthe age 16. In his first major league start in 1936 he struck out 15 \nbatters, showing the entire league that he was not just a kid but a \ntrue talent that could play with the big names. As anticipated by \nfellow coaches, players, and fans, Feller only progressed. He was the \nfirst pitcher to win 20 or more games by the age of 21 and pitched the \nonly opening day no-hitter in major league baseball history. At the \nheight of his astounding career, Feller put his loyalty to his country \nabove all and enlisted in the U.S. Navy 2 days after the Japanese \nattack on Pearl Harbor. While putting his big-time baseball career on \nhold and valiantly serving in the Armed Forces for nearly 4 years, \nFeller earned eight battle stars working primarily aboard the USS \nAlabama in the gunnery department.\n  After being discharged, Feller was ready to go back to the game he \nloved. Having not played for 4 years, there was much speculation that \nhe would not be the recordbreaking pitcher he once was. That year, he \nproved they were wrong. His 1946 season was the most successful of \nFeller's career. Throwing pitches clocked as fast as 109 miles per \nhour, Feller completed 36 of the 42 games he started while compiling a \n2.18 earned run average. He also pitched his second career no-hitter \nagainst the New York Yankees, pitched a shutout victory for the \nAmerican League in the All Star Game, and, for good measure, saved four \nout of six games in relief for the Indians. Feller overwhelmingly led \nthe American League that year in wins, shutouts, strikeouts, games \npitched, and innings. In 1962, 6 years after his last season, Bob \nFeller was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in recognition for \nhis extraordinary abilities, on and off the field.\n  It is my honor today to stand in support of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 110, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the 1946 season \nof Iowa's native son, Bob Feller and his heroic military service to the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8374-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8374-S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ABRAHAM LINCOLN STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Durbin in \nintroducing the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Act which focuses on the \nimportant issue of preparing future generations to live and work in an \nincreasingly interconnected and complicated world. My colleague and I \nstrongly believe that in order for the United States to effectively \nconfront global challenges, to compete successfully in a global \neconomy, and to lead responsibly in the world, we must dramatically \nincrease the number of Americans gaining international experience \nthrough study abroad.\n  In 2004, Congress recognized the value of study abroad when it formed \nthe Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program. \nThe Commission issued a report in November 2005 calling for a national \nstudy abroad program to greatly increase and diversify the number of \nU.S. students participating in study abroad while at the same time \naddressing the institutional barriers which hinder many students from \nstudying abroad. Again, the Senate recognized the significance of the \nstudy abroad experience when it declared 2006 as the ``Year of Study \nAbroad,'' and encouraged initiatives to promote and expand study abroad \nopportunities.\n  With this legislation, my colleague and I move this important agenda \none step further by sponsoring a bill that will change the country. It \nwill enable our students to graduate with skills\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\nnecessary to work effectively in today's global society by making study \nabroad an integral part of the undergraduate educational experience.\n  Today, only 1 percent of all enrolled undergraduate students spend \ntime living and studying abroad for academic credit. And only \napproximately one-third of those students chose to study in locations \noutside Western Europe, even though an estimated 95 percent of the \nworld's population growth will occur outside that area in the next 50 \nyears. The percentages of minorities among individuals studying abroad \nare extremely low, and underrepresentative of the numbers of those \nstudents in the general student population.\n  Minnesota ranks third in the Nation for study abroad participation \nrates. During the 2003-2004 school year, 8073 students enrolled in \nMinnesotan colleges and universities studied abroad, which is a little \nless than 3 percent of the overall enrolled undergraduate student \npopulation in the State. I would like to see this number grow--study \nabroad opportunities will help make the next generation of Minnesotans \nand all Americans more competitive in the global marketplace.\n  The reality of the global environment commands that far more of our \nstudents study abroad, regardless of their field of study, ethnicity, \nsocio-economic status or gender, and that more of them study in \nnontraditional destinations. In order for graduates to be effective in \nthe increasingly interconnected global society, they must better \nunderstand the broad world, not just a small part of it.\n  Study abroad should become the norm, not the exception for U.S. \ncollege students. It can only be good for our campuses, our communities \nand our Nation to have more U.S. students understanding more about the \nrest of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8375-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PERRY M.

Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to salute \nlabor leader Perry Zimmerman, the distinguished business manager of the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, IBEW, Local 1245, and \na vice president of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO. Perry is \nretiring after 5 years as IBEW Local 1245 business manager and more \nthan 40 years of outstanding service to the labor community in \nCalifornia, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.\n  Perry Zimmerman began his career at Pacific Gas and Electric Company \nin 1962. During his 19 years there, he was an active union member, \nserving as a shop steward, unit chairman, and advisory council member.\n  In 1981, Perry joined the staff of IBEW Local 1245 as business \nrepresentative, where he served members in Sacramento and the San \nFrancisco Bay Area. After 11 years, he was promoted to assistant \nbusiness manager and served area members in both the private and public \nsectors.\n  Perry was elected business manager/financial secretary of IBEW Local \n1245 in 2001. He was reelected in 2004 and has held this post ever \nsince. As the leader of more than 18,000 members working for over 50 \nemployers and 100 contractors, Perry Zimmerman is the voice of energy \nand communication workforces in 5 Western States. During this time, he \nwas also a vice president of the California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.\n  Throughout his career, Perry has demonstrated great enthusiasm and \ncompassion for his fellow workers. As business manager, Perry was \ncommitted to being in regular touch with members, informing them of \nleadership decisions and requesting their opinions. He has said this \nwas his favorite part of his job.\n  After more than 40 years of service to working families, Perry \nZimmerman deserves some time off. Along with his friends and admirers \nthroughout the Western United States, I wish him a long and pleasurable \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8375-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8375-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8375-4", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 9:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       S. 1496.

A bill to authorize the Secretry of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to make grants to facilitate the establishment \nof the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California; to \nthe committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nFeinstein to introduce a bill authorizing the Secretaries of \nAgriculture and Interior to make grants to facilitate the establishment \nof the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California. \nThis bill will create a facility that will help teach visitors from all \nacross the country about the significance of agriculture in our \nNation's culture and economy, the importance of science in agriculture, \nand California's role as the Nation's preeminent agricultural State.\n  This bill will designate $10 million in total grant funding to help \nfund construction costs of the center, with the\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\nfederal share limited to 33 percent of the total cost. I am happy to \nreport that the center is making great progress on raising private \ndonations to complete its share of the construction funding.\n  The center will help promote California's place as the Nation's most \ndiverse and productive agricultural State. With the farmers, growers, \nand ranchers of our State producing over 350 different crops and \ncommodities, and nearly 80,000 active farming operations, agriculture \nis one of California's most important industries. From our vineyards \nand wineries, to the almond, stone fruit, strawberry, cotton, and rice \nfarms, to the citrus groves of central and southern California, to the \ndairy and cattle ranches across the State, farming and agriculture are \nubiquitous in California and impact all of our communities in an \nimportant way.\n  The farms, large and small, produce half of America's produce and are \nexported all across the globe, providing billions of dollars to our \neconomy and balance of trade.\n  The center's mission will place an emphasis on agricultural science \neducation, with interactive, high-technology exhibits designed to \nfoster an understanding of the importance of agriculture, and how \nscience plays an essential role in the farm-to-food process. There will \nalso be a strong focus on highlighting the important relationship \nbetween agriculture, conservation, and the environment.\n  I would also like to thank Representatives Cardoza, Matsui and \nRadanovich for introducing a companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Sarbanes):\n  S. 3747. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act and \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide access \nto Medicare benefits for individuals ages 55 to 65, to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a refundable and advanceable \ncredit against income tax for payment of such premiums, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in 2004, 45.8 million Americans were \nwithout health insurance. That is 15.7 percent of our population, an \nincrease of over 800,000 people in just one year. Yet this number \ndoesn't even reflect the true extent of the problem, as at least \nanother 16 million adults and children are underinsured. This means \nthat even though they have insurance, they are not able to access \nquality health care when they need it because of high deductibles, \nsoaring co-payments, and unreasonable health benefit restrictions.\n  As I have said many times before, it is unacceptable that a world \nsuperpower such as ours has so many people that are uninsured. Lacking \nor having inadequate health insurance has been shown over and over to \nbe associated with poorer health and quality of life. The uninsured are \nover 40 percent more likely to be diagnosed with late stage breast and \nprostate cancers and more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with \nlate stage melanoma. They are hospitalized more often for avoidable \nconditions such as pneumonia and uncontrolled diabetes.\n  The Institute of Medicine estimates that 18,000 people die every year \nbecause they lack health coverage. Thousands more suffer unnecessary \npain and disability because they can't get the health care they need \nwhen they need it. We cannot allow so many of our fellow citizens to \njust fall through the cracks of a deficient health care system. We can \nand must do better.\n  I have introduced several bills to this Congress to provide greater \naccess to health insurance coverage in this country. These bills \ninclude the MediKids Health Insurance Act to improve coverage for kids, \nthe TAA Health Coverage Improvement Act to offer insurance options to \ntrade displaced workers, and the Small Employers Health Benefits Plan \nAct to offer more affordable health care to small business owners and \ntheir employees. Today, I join Senators Kerry, Kennedy, and Sarbanes in \nintroducing yet another key piece of legislation to reduce the number \nof uninsured Americans--the Medicare Early Access Act of 2006.\n  The Medicare Early Access Act of 2006, which has also been introduced \nin the House of Representatives by Congressman Pete Stark, provides a \nnew coverage option for our Nation's near elderly. This legislation \nwould allow people aged 55 through 64, who are not otherwise eligible \nfor coverage under a group health plan or Federal health insurance \nprogram, to buy into Medicare. It also provides a 75 percent tax credit \nfor Medicare early access premiums to make coverage more affordable for \nthe broadest range of near elderly individuals.\n  Insurance coverage for the near-elderly, the 29 million people \nbetween the ages of 55 and 64, is particularly critical. The near \nelderly are the fastest growing group of uninsured Americans--almost \none in seven are uninsured. And, we know the risk of serious illness \nfor adults increases with age, requiring more frequent contact with the \nhealth care system and the related financial obligations. Over 50 \npercent of near-elderly Americans have at least one serious health \nproblem, including diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart \nproblems, or stroke. Without adequate access to health care, these \nindividuals typically delay care until more serious complications \ndevelop that could require high-cost hospital care or even lead to \npremature death.\n\n  With job layoffs, early retirement, and the dwindling number of \nemployers offering health insurance, the near-elderly now face greater \nhurdles to maintaining adequate health care coverage. In March of this \nyear, a major American automotive company offered 113,000 of its \nemployees up to $140,000 to leave the company with no claims to future \nbenefits. It is predicted that more large employers will follow suit in \nthe near future, while other companies continue to seek bankruptcy \ncourt approval to set aside long-standing benefit programs. The \ngreatest impact of these types of buyouts and benefit restrictions will \nbe on the near-elderly age group, who do not yet have the safety net of \nMedicare.\n  Some of my colleagues might argue that Medicare buy-in legislation is \nunnecessary because the near elderly can get coverage in the individual \nmarket. I would say to my colleagues that the near elderly have an \nextremely difficult time buying insurance in the individual market. \nBecause this group tends to have pre-existing chronic illnesses, \nprivate insurers often deny them coverage or offer them coverage at \nunaffordable rates. So the individual market actually fails to be an \noption for most near elderly individuals and they bear the risk of \nforgoing coverage altogether.\n  Lack of insurance and gaps in coverage affect us all, not just the \nuninsured person in need of care. When an uninsured person goes to a \nhospital, clinic, or emergency room and cannot pay for the cost of his \nor her care, the unpaid balances are passed on to those who have \ninsurance or other means to pay. Insurance rates go up as do our taxes \nto support public programs. Whether through higher insurance premiums \nor taxes supporting our public insurance programs, we all pay, one way \nor another, for not doing more to address the problem of the uninsured. \nFailure to achieve a solution now to this burgeoning problem will \nsurely cost us more if we wait, both in human life and in dollars.\n  The Medicare Early Access Act of 2006 may not be the total solution \nto solving America's crisis of the uninsured, but it is an earnest \nattempt to address the problem of the health care access for one of the \nmost vulnerable segments of our population-the near elderly. These \nindividuals often have the greatest need and the least choice when it \ncomes to affordable health insurance coverage. By offering the near-\nelderly access to comprehensive health benefits through Medicare, we \ncan hopefully reduce the long-term costs to our health care system. I \nurge my colleagues to join us in taking this important step toward \nmaking health insurance and personal dignity a reality for all \nAmericans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 3757. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 950 Missouri Avenue in East St. Louis, Illinois, as \nthe ``Katherine Dunham Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Senator Durbin, to honor the lifetime achievements and legacy of \none of Illinois' most treasured figures, Katherine Dunham, who passed \naway on May 21, 2006. Our bill would name the post office on Missouri \nAvenue in East St. Louis, the ``Katherine Dunham Post Office \nBuilding.''\n  Katherine Dunham was born in Glen Ellyn, IL, on June 22, 1909, to \nAlbert Millard Dunham and Fanny June Taylor. Her father was a \ndescendant of slaves from Madagascar and West Africa, and her mother \nwas French Canadian. Her diverse background would foreshadow her \nlifelong commitment to exploring and teaching the history of culture \naround the world.\n  Katherine Dunham's trailblazing life began at an early age when she \nentered the University of Chicago as one of the first African Americans \nto attend the school. She eventually earned bachelor, master's and \ndoctoral degrees in anthropology, and participated in the Rosenwald \nFellowship. Under this program she completed work on Caribbean and \nBrazilian dance anthropology, the first time significant work was done \nin the field. In 1931, Dunham opened her first dance school, which \nwould become one of the most successful dance programs in American and \nEuropean theater, and eventually led to her lead role in musicals, \noperas, and cabarets throughout the world.\n  Dunham first appeared in London in June 1948 with her company in \n``Caribbean Rhapsody'' as part of the first tour to bring black dance \nas an art form, and American modern dance to the European public. After \nher return to the U.S., Dunham continued to dance, choreograph and \ndirect on Broadway with her production, ``Katharine Dunham and Her \nCompany and Bamboche.''\n  When ``Aida'' premiered in 1963, Dunham became the first African \nAmerican to choreograph for the Metropolitan Opera, further \nestablishing her stature in the dance community. Beginning in 1940, \nDunham also appeared in several films, including, ``Carnival of \nRhythm'', ``Cabin in the Sky'', ``Star Spangled Rhythm'', ``Stormy \nWeather'', and ``Casbah''. Dunham also produced the choreography for \n``Pardon My Sarong''.\n  What's more, Katherine Dunham's legacy doesn't stop on the dance \nstage. She used her notoriety to focus the public's attention to social \ninjustices around the world. At the age of 82, Ms. Dunham undertook a \n47-day hunger strike in 1993, which helped shift public awareness to \nthe international relationship between America and Haiti, ultimately \nassisting in the return of Haiti's first democratically elected \nPresident.\n  In 1967, Dunham moved to East St. Louis, where she helped open a \nperforming arts training center and established a dance anthropology \nprogram at the innercity branch of southern Illinois University that \nwas eventually named the Katherine Dunham Centers for the Arts and \nHumanities.\n  Katherine Dunham was a woman far ahead of her time and her \ncontributions earned her the recognition and admiration of her peers. \nAmong her many honors are the Presidential Medal of Arts, Kennedy \nCenter Honors, French Legion of Honor, Southern Cross of Brazil, Grand \nCross of Haiti, NAACP Lifetime Achievement Award, Lincoln Academy \nLaureate, and the Urban League's Lifetime Achievement Award. Dunham was \none of 75 women whose lives were celebrated in the book, ``I Have A \nDream''.\n  At one of the major highlights of her career, Dunham received the \nAlbert Schweitzer Music Award ``for a life's work dedicated to music \nand devoted to humanity,'' in front of a packed house at New York's \nCarnegie Hall.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life and legacy of \nKatherine Dunham and her efforts to bring the cultures of the world to \nthe community of East St. Louis, by naming the post office on Missouri \nAvenue in East St. Louis, the ``Katherine Dunham Post Office \nBuilding.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, post offices are often designated in honor \nof individuals who have made valuable contributions to their Nation. \nToday, I am pleased to honor Ms. Katherine Dunham, the world-renowned \ndancer, choreographer, teacher, and social activist, by cosponsoring \nlegislation that designates the U.S. Post Office at 950 Missouri Avenue \nin East St. Louis, IL, as the ``Katherine Dunham Post Office \nBuilding.''\n  Born in Chicago and raised in Joliet, IL, Ms. Dunham began dancing \nwhile in high school. She became one of the first African Americans to \nattend the University of Chicago and later earned her bachelor's and \nmaster's degrees in anthropology. In 1938, Dunham was hired as dance \ndirector for Chicago's Federal Theatre Project, where her fiery style \nwould mark her work for several decades.\n  In the spring of 1938, Ms. Dunham formed her own company, the Dunham \nDance Company, and began to explore the connection of Caribbean dance \nto its African roots. In 1940, the company traveled to New York and \nperformed a program titled ``Tropics and Le Jazz Hot.'' New York Times \ncritic John Martin said: ``Her performance may very well become a \nhistoric occasion.'' Dunham's company undertook a national tour and \nperformed on Broadway and in Hollywood. In 1945, Dunham opened the \nKatherine Dunham School of Arts and Research in New York. That same \nyear, the company toured Europe with a program called ``Caribbean \nRhapsody,'' which was already a success in the United States. It was \nthe first time Europe had seen Black dance as an art form and also the \nfirst time that special elements of American modern dance appeared \noutside America. In 1963, Dunham secured her place in artistic history \nby becoming the first black choreographer at the Metropolitan Opera, \nwhere she helped stage the new production of ``Aida.''\n  Dunham shut down her dance company in 1965 to become adviser to the \ncultural ministry of Senegal. She attended the first World Festival of \nNegro Arts in Senegal as an official representative from the United \nStates.\n  In 1967, Dunham opened the Performing Arts Training Center, an \nAfrican-American cultural center for local youngsters, in East St. \nLouis, IL. She later expanded the program to include senior citizens.\n  Except for a brief appearance in 1965, Dunham did not perform \nregularly after 1962 as she focused on her choreography. One of her \nmajor works was choreographing and directing Scott Joplin's opera \n``Treemonisha'' in 1972.\n  In February 1992, at the age of 82, Dunham again became the subject \nof international attention when she began a 47-day fast at her East St. \nLouis home. Because of her age, her involvement with Haiti, and the \nrespect accorded her as an activist and artist, Dunham became the \ncenter of a movement that coalesced to protest the United States' \ndeportations of Haitian boat-refugees fleeing to the United States \nafter the military overthrow of Haiti's democratically-elected \nPresident Jean-Bertrand Aristide. She agreed to end her fast only after \nAristide visited her and personally requested her to stop.\n  Ms. Dunham is the recipient of many coveted awards, including the \nAlvin Ailey American Dance Theater Dance Pioneer Award, the National \nMedal of Arts, Kennedy Center Honors, the French Legion of Honor, the \nSouthern Cross of Brazil, the Grand Cross of Haiti, the NAACP Lifetime \nAchievement Award, the Lincoln Academy Laureate, the Urban League's \nLifetime Achievement Award, and numerous honorary degrees. She was also \none of 75 women whose lives were celebrated in the book, ``I Have a \nDream''.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Dunham's humanitarian, \nartistic, and intellectual contributions to the world of dance. She \nrevolutionized American dance and used her fame to bring public \nattention to social injustices at home and abroad. It is appropriate to \nexpress our appreciation to Katherine Dunham for her service to the \nEast St. Louis community and to the world by naming an East St. Louis \npost office in her honor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Rockfeller, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mr. Kerry).\n  S. 3758. A bill to establish certain requirements relating to the \ncontinuation of the Survey of Income and Program Participation; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President. I am joined by Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Bingaman, and Mr. Kerry in introducing important legislation \nregarding\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\nthe Survey of Income and Program Participation, SIPP. This legislation \nis also being introduced in the other body by Mrs. Maloney.\n  The SIPP is the only large-scale longitudinal survey that provides \ndata for evaluating the effectiveness of programs like Social Security, \nMedicaid, unemployment insurance, food stamps, and Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families, TANF. There is no other survey that provides the \nrichness and detail of the data that the SIPP collects. The survey \nprovides essential information on the extent to which programs meet \nfamilies' basic needs and promote upward mobility.\n  Unfortunately, the President, in his fiscal year 2007 budget, \nproposed the elimination of the SIPP, followed by a redesign that would \nnot be ready until 2009 at the earliest. In the meantime, there would \nbe an irretrievable loss of data.\n  By eliminating the SIPP, we not only abandon significant research \ninvestments by government and private researchers but we would also \nlose the ability to examine family outcomes over time. Without access \nto the SIPP's consistent time-series data, we will have to wait years, \nif not decades, to understand the implications of current policy \ndecisions. Researchers and policymakers would no longer have an \naccurate dynamic picture of living standards in America.\n  It is important that we create a process to ensure that we do not \nlose valuable resources for assessing program effectiveness and \neconomic well-being. As such, our legislation would create a SIPP \nCommission whose members would be required to review any proposals to \nchange or eliminate the SIPP. This would allow for necessary input from \nusers of the SIPP. The bill would also prevent the administration from \nunilaterally discontinuing or changing the survey.\n  Mr. President, this survey helps Congress to make good policy choices \nand to be good stewards of American tax dollars. Proposals to cut or \neliminate this survey need to be taken seriously and considered \ncarefully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of Commerce may not--\n       (1) discontinue the Survey of Income and Program \n     Participation,\n       (2) make any change in the design or content of such \n     Survey, or\n       (3) allow any of the foregoing,\n\n     unless the discontinuation or change involved has first been \n     approved in accordance with section 2.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROPOSED ACTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Whenever in the judgment of the Secretary \n     of Commerce it becomes necessary to discontinue the Survey of \n     Income and Program Participation or to make any change in the \n     design or content of the Survey of Income and Program \n     Participation, he shall prepare a written proposal under this \n     subsection.

A bill to name the Armed Forces Readiness Center in Great \nFalls, Montana, in honor of Captain William Wylie Galt, a recipient of \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Galt \nfamily from my home State of Montana. The Galt family first came to \nMontana in 1910 settling in Judith Basin County. They have been leaders \nin their communities ever since.\n  One member of the Galt family paid the ultimate sacrifice for his \ncountry at the young age of 24. U.S. Army CPT William Wylie Galt was \nawarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for his brave actions in 1944. \nThe Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an \nenemy force that can be bestowed upon an individual serving in the \narmed services of the United States.\n  Captain Galt's citation reads:\n\n       For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond \n     the call of duty. Capt. Galt, Battalion S3, at a particularly \n     critical period following 2 unsuccessful attacks by his \n     battalion, of his own volition went forward and ascertained \n     just how critical the situation was. He volunteered, at the \n     risk of his life, personally to lead the battalion against \n     the objective. When the lone remaining tank destroyer refused \n     to go forward, Capt. Galt jumped on the tank destroyer and \n     ordered it to precede the attack. As the tank destroyer moved \n     forward, followed by a company of riflemen, Capt. Galt manned \n     the .30-caliber machinegun in the turret of the tank \n     destroyer, located and directed fire on an enemy 77mm. anti-\n     tank gun, and destroyed it. Nearing the enemy positions, \n     Capt. Galt stood fully exposed in the turret, ceaselessly \n     firing his machinegun and tossing hand grenades into the \n     enemy zigzag series of trenches despite the hail of sniper \n     and machinegun bullets ricocheting off the tank destroyer. As \n     the tank destroyer moved, Capt. Galt so maneuvered it that 40 \n     of the enemy were\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\n     trapped in one trench. When they refused to surrender, Capt. \n     Galt pressed the trigger of the machinegun and dispatched \n     every one of them. A few minutes later an 88mm shell struck \n     the tank destroyer and Capt. Galt fell mortally wounded \n     across his machinegun. He had personally killed 40 Germans \n     and wounded many more. Capt. Galt pitted his judgment and \n     superb courage against overwhelming odds, exemplifying the \n     highest measure of devotion to his country and the finest \n     traditions of the U.S. Army.\n\n  In 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, BRAC, decided \nto permanently close Galt Hall U.S. Army Reserve Center on Gore Hill in \nGreat Falls, MT, and relocate units to a new Armed Forces Readiness \nCenter near Malmstrom Air Force Base across town. The U.S. Army Reserve \nCenter on Gore Hill was dedicated to Captain Galt in 1958.\n  I believe it is a fitting tribute to name the U.S. Armed Forces \nReadiness Center in Great Falls, MT, ``The Captain William Wylie Galt \nGreat Falls Armed Forces Readiness Center'' to carry on the history of \nthis brave Montanan.\n  Captain Galt may be gone, but with the naming of the Armed Forces \nReadiness Center in Great Falls after him, the memory of this true hero \nwill live on and remind us that freedom is never free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8382-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 541--CONGRATULATING SPELMAN COLLEGE ON ITS 125TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Rockefeller) \nsubmitted the following resolution, which was considered and agreed to:\n       Whereas, in 1881, Spelman College was established by Sophia \n     B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles, school teachers and Baptist \n     missionaries, in Atlanta, Georgia, for the purpose of \n     educating African-American women and girls;\n       Whereas as a result of the benevolence of John D. \n     Rockefeller, Sr., and Laura Spelman Rockefeller, the name of \n     the institution was changed from ``Atlanta Baptist Female \n     Seminary'' to ``Spelman Seminary'' in honor of the Spelman \n     family;\n       Whereas the curriculum expanded to include high school and \n     college classes, and the seminary conferred its first high \n     school diplomas in 1887, and its first college degrees in \n     1901;\n       Whereas in 1924, Spelman Seminary officially became Spelman \n     College and grew to become a leading undergraduate \n     institution for African-American women;\n       Whereas Spelman College was ranked among the top 75 Best \n     Liberal Arts Colleges according to U.S. News & World Report, \n     2005 edition;\n       Whereas the Association of Medical Colleges ranks Spelman \n     College fifth among undergraduate programs for African-\n     American students accepted to medical school, and Spelman is \n     1 of 6 institutions designated by the National Science \n     Foundation and the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration as a Model Institution for Excellence in \n     undergraduate science and math education;\n       Whereas Spelman's ninth President, Beverly Daniel Tatum, \n     has initiated a strategic plan for Spelman (``Spelman \n     ALIVE'') that includes 5 goals: Academic excellence, \n     Leadership development, Improving the infrastructure, \n     Visibility of accomplishments of the campus community, and \n     Exemplary customer service, all designed to create a vision \n     for Spelman of ``Nothing Less Than the Best''; and\n       Whereas Spelman College has prepared more than 6 \n     generations of African American women to reach the highest \n     levels of academic, community, and professional achievement: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates Spelman College on 125th anniversary; and\n       (2) commends the President of Spelman College, Dr. Beverly \n     Daniel Tatum, and the administration, faculty, staff, \n     students, and alumnae of the College for their outstanding \n     achievements and contribution to African American education, \n     history, and culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8382-2", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 542--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEAS OF NATIONAL \n               PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Dorgan) submitted the following \nresolution, which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 542\n\n       Whereas peripheral arterial disease is a vascular disease \n     that occurs when narrowed arteries reduce the blood flow to \n     the limbs;\n       Whereas peripheral arterial disease is a significant \n     vascular disease that can be as serious as a heart attack or \n     stroke;\n       Whereas peripheral arterial disease affects approximately \n     8,000,000 to 12,000,000 Americans;\n       Whereas patients with peripheral arterial disease are at \n     increased risk of heart attack and stroke and are 6 times \n     more likely to die within 10 years than are patients without \n     peripheral arterial disease;\n       Whereas the survival rate for individuals with peripheral \n     arterial disease is worse than the outcome for many common \n     cancers;\n       Whereas peripheral arterial disease is a leading cause of \n     lower limb amputation in the United States;\n       Whereas many patients with peripheral arterial disease have \n     walking impairment that leads to a diminished quality of life \n     and functional capacity;\n       Whereas a majority of patients with peripheral arterial \n     disease are asymptomatic and less than half of individuals \n     with peripheral arterial disease are aware of their \n     diagnoses;\n       Whereas African-American ethnicity is a strong and \n     independent risk factor for peripheral arterial disease, and \n     yet this fact is not well known to those at risk;\n       Whereas effective treatments are available for people with \n     peripheral arterial disease to reduce heart attacks, strokes, \n     and amputations and to improve quality of life;\n       Whereas many patients with peripheral arterial disease are \n     still untreated with proven therapies;\n       Whereas there is a need for comprehensive educational \n     efforts designed to increase awareness of peripheral arterial \n     disease among medical professionals and the greater public in \n     order to promote early detection and proper treatment of this \n     disease to improve quality of life, prevent heart attacks and \n     strokes, and save lives and limbs; and\n       Whereas September 18 through September 22, 2006, would be \n     an appropriate week to observe National peripheral arterial \n     disease Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Peripheral \n     Arterial Disease Awareness Week;\n       (2) acknowledges the critical importance of peripheral \n     arterial disease awareness to improve national cardiovascular \n     health;\n       (3) supports raising awareness of the consequences of \n     undiagnosed and untreated peripheral arterial disease and the \n     need to seek appropriate care as a serious public health \n     issue; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8382-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 543--TEMPORARILY SUSPENDING THE RULES FOR THE \n REGULATION OF THE SENATE WING OF THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL AND SENATE \n     OFFICE BUILDINGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERMITTING THE TAKING OF \n           PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE AREA OF THE DAILY PRESS GALLERY\n\n  Mr. LOTT submitted the following resolution, which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today and be joined \nby my fellow Senator from Georgia, Senator Chambliss, in recognition of \nthe 125th anniversary of Spelman College.\n  Spelman College is a historically Black college in the State of \nGeorgia and a part of the Atlanta University complex which is the \nlargest consortium of historically Black universities and colleges in \nthe United States of America.\n  The resolution congratulates the student body, the faculty, the \nfounders, and in particular Dr. Beverly Daniel\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\nTatum, and the administration, the faculty, and staff of Spelman \nCollege.\n  Spelman College was founded in Atlanta, GA, 1881 by Baptist \nmissionaries and teachers Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles for \nthe purpose of educating African-American women and girls.\n  Due to the benevolence of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.--Senator \nRockefeller's great-grandfather--and Laura Spelman Rockefeller, the \nname of the institution was changed from Atlanta Baptist Female \nSeminary to Spelman Seminary in honor of the Spelman family.\n  A Rockefeller has since sat on the Spelman College Board of Trustees, \nincluding Senator Rockefeller's daughter, Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, \nwho currently sits on the Board of Trustees.\n  Spelman later expanded its curriculum to include high school and \ncollege classes, and conferred its first high school degree in 1887, \nand its first college degree in 1901.\n  In 1924 Spelman Seminary became Spelman College and grew to become a \nleading undergraduate institution for African-American women.\n  Spelman is ranked among the top 75 best liberal arts college \naccording to U.S. News and World Report, 2005 edition.\n  The Association of Medical Colleges ranks Spelman fifth among \nundergraduate programs for African-American students accepted to \nmedical school; and not surprisingly Spelman is one of six institutions \ndesignated by the National Science Foundation and NASA as a Model \nInstitution for Excellence in undergraduate science and math.\n  The resolution also commends Dr. Tatum for her excellent work and \nvision of the future for the college. It further calls attention to her \ninitiation of a strategic plan for Spelman called ``Spelman ALIVE'' \nthat includes five goals designated to create a vision of Spelman of \nacademic, community, and professional achievement: academic excellence, \nleadership development, improving the infrastructure, visibility of \naccomplishments of the campus community, and exemplary customer \nservice.\n  It is both an honor and privilege for me today on behalf of the State \nof Georgia and I think the Senate to unanimously commend Spelman \nCollege on its achievement of 125 continuous years of service to \nAfrican-American women in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Isakson from Georgia, to congratulate Spelman \nCollege, the country's oldest historically Black college for women on \nits 125th anniversary.\n  Spelman College was established in 1881 by two school teachers and \nBaptist missionaries, Sophia B. Packard and Harriet E. Giles, for the \npurpose of educating African-American women and girls. Located in \nAtlanta, GA, and started in the basement of the Friendship Baptist \nChurch, the college has come a long way from its beginnings, growing \ninto a 32-acre campus. Spelman is also a member of the largest group of \nhistorically black institutions in the world including Morehouse \nUniversity, the Morehouse School of Medicine, Clark Atlanta University, \nand the Interdenominational Theological Center.\n  Spelman has a very diverse student population with 2,100 students \nfrom 41 States and 15 foreign countries. In 2005, Spelman ranked among \nthe top 75 liberal arts colleges according to U.S. News & World Report. \nEighty-four percent of the faculty at Spelman hold a Ph.D. or higher, \nand the student teacher ratio is 11 to 1, making Spelman a top choice \nfor African-American women to obtain an undergraduate degree. Many of \ntheir students seek advance degrees. In 2000, Spelman ranked second in \nthe country in placing African-American students in medical schools.\n  The Federal Government has seen the promise that the students and \nfaculty at Spelman possess and, in 2003, the National Institutes of \nHealth National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities \nawarded the college a $4.2 million grant for research to help eliminate \nhealth disparities among minority groups. Spelman was one of only six \ninstitutions to receive this funding. Also in 2003, National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, NASA Awarded the college with a \n$4.5 million grant to enhance its Women in Science and Engineering, \nWISE, scholars program.\n  Spelman College also realizes the need to give back to the African-\nAmerican community. With the help of Federal funding, the school \ncreated the Spelman College Health and Wellness Initiative. This \nprogram is helping to gain a better understanding of the many factors \nthat impact the health of young African-American women. The Health and \nWellness Initiative is also helping to create preventive strategies for \nthe unique circumstances that apply to all African-American women. \nThese strategies are currently being developed and used to prevent \ncancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS in African-\nAmerican women.\n  In 2005, six Spelman women qualified for the International RoboCup \n2005 Four-Legged Robot soccer competition in Osaka, Japan. The students \ncreated computer programs for the robots to compete in the soccer \ntournament, requiring the robots play without human intervention. Of \nthe 24 teams that qualified internationally, the SpelBots, as the team \nis called, were the first and only Historically Black College and \nUniversity, the only all women institution, and the only United States \nundergraduate institution to qualify for the tournament. When looking \nback years from now at historically Black colleges and robotics \nresearch, all searches will lead to Spelman.\n  Spelman graduates have gone on to be professionals such as doctors, \nnurses, lawyers, teachers, engineers, and chemists. I want to \ncongratulate Spelman College on their success and developing thousands \nof young women into strong business and community leaders over the past \n125 years.\n  I would also like to recognize the president of Spelman College, my \nfriend, Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, and the administration, faculty, \nstaff, students and alumnae of the college for their leadership, \noutstanding achievements, and contributions that have made Spelman such \na fine institution and a great citizen of our State. It is my most \nsincere hope that Spelman will continue to thrive and prosper for many \nyears to come.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues from \nGeorgia, Mr. Isakson and Mr. Chambliss, to congratulate Spelman College \non the occasion of its 125th anniversary.\n  Spelman College, then known as ``Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary,'' \nwas established in 1881 in Atlanta, GA, by Sophia B. Packard and \nHarriet E. Giles, schoolteachers and Baptist missionaries, who created \nthe school for the purpose of educating African-American women and \ngirls. The institution kindly thanked my great-grandparents John D. \nRockefeller, Sr. and Laura Spelman Rockefeller after their donation to \nthe school by changing the school's name to ``Spelman Seminary'' in \nhonor of the Spelman family in 1924. I am enormously proud that my \nfamily has been associated with this school for the last 80-plus years \nand of the achievements by the school and especially its alumnae. \nToday, my daughter, Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, serves on the board of \ntrustees and she continues our family's proud connection to this \nimportant institution.\n  The school grew to include high school and college classes and \nbestowed its first high school diplomas in 1887 and its first college \ndegrees in 1901. The school expanded to become a leading undergraduate \ninstitution for African- American women. In the 2005 edition of U.S. \nNews and World Report, Spelman College was ranked among the top 75 best \nliberal arts colleges. The Association of Medical Colleges ranks \nSpelman College fifth among undergraduate programs for Black students \naccepted to medical school and Spelman is one of six institutions \ndesignated by the National Science Foundation and the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration as a Model Institution for \nExcellence in undergraduate science and math education.\n  We commend Spelman's ninth president, Beverly Daniel Tatum, who has \ninitiated a strategic plan for Spelman titled ``Spelman ALIVE'' that \nincludes five goals: academic excellence, leadership development, \nimproving the infrastructure, visibility of accomplishments of the \ncampus community, and\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\nexemplary customer service, all designed to create a vision for Spelman \nof ``Nothing Less than the Best.'' For 125 years, Spelman has been at \nthe forefront of education in our Nation, and with this plan I am \nconfident it will continue to grow and thrive.\n  Spelman College has prepared more than six generations of African-\nAmerican women to reach the highest levels of academic, community, and \nprofessional achievement. My cosponsors Mr. Isakson and Mr. Chambliss \nand I also thank the administration, faculty, staff, students, and \nalumnae of the college for their outstanding achievements and \ncontribution to African-American education, history, and culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8397-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATE PHOTOGRAPHS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 359\n\n       Whereas following the execution of Romanian President \n     Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, it was discovered that more than \n     100,000 underfed, neglected children throughout Romania were \n     living in hundreds of squalid and inhumane institutions;\n       Whereas citizens of the United States responded to the dire \n     situation of these children with an outpouring of compassion \n     and assistance to improve conditions in those institutions \n     and to provide for the needs of abandoned children in \n     Romania;\n       Whereas, between 1990 and 2004, citizens of the United \n     States adopted more than 8,200 Romanian children, with a \n     similar response from the citizens of Western Europe;\n       Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) \n     reported in March 2005 that more than 9,000 children a year \n     are abandoned in Romania's maternity wards or pediatric \n     hospitals and that child abandonment in Romania in ``2003 and \n     2004 was no different from that occurring 10, 20, or 30 years \n     ago'';\n       Whereas there are approximately 37,000 orphaned or \n     abandoned children in Romania today living in state \n     institutions, an additional 49,000 living in temporary \n     arrangements, such as foster care, and an unknown number of \n     children living on the streets and in maternity and pediatric \n     hospitals;\n       Whereas, on December 28, 1994, Romania ratified the Hague \n     Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in \n     Respect of Intercountry Adoption which recognizes that \n     ``intercountry adoption may offer the advantage of a \n     permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot \n     be found in his or her State of origin'';\n       Whereas intercountry adoption offers the hope of a \n     permanent family for children who are orphaned or abandoned \n     by their biological parents;\n       Whereas UNICEF's official position on intercountry \n     adoption, in pertinent part, states: ``For children who \n     cannot be raised by their own families, an appropriate \n     alternative family environment should be sought in preference \n     to institutional care, which should be used only as a last \n     resort and as a temporary measure. Inter-country adoption is \n     one of a range of care options which may be open to children, \n     and for individual children who cannot be placed in a \n     permanent family setting in their countries of origin, it may \n     indeed be the best solution. In each case, the best interests \n     of the individual child must be the guiding principal in \n     making a decision regarding adoption.'';\n       Whereas unsubstantiated allegations have been made about \n     the fate of children adopted from Romania and the \n     qualifications and motives of those who adopt \n     internationally;\n       Whereas in June 2001, the Romanian Adoption Committee \n     imposed a moratorium on intercountry adoption, but continued \n     to accept new intercountry adoption applications and allowed \n     many such applications to be processed under an exception for \n     extraordinary circumstances;\n       Whereas on June 21, 2004, the Parliament of Romania enacted \n     Law 272/2004 on ``the protection and promotion of the rights \n     of the child'', which creates new requirements for declaring \n     a child legally available for adoption;\n       Whereas on June 21, 2004, the Parliament of Romania enacted \n     Law 273/2004 on adoption, which prohibits intercountry \n     adoption except by a child's biological grandparent or \n     grandparents;\n       Whereas there is no European Union law or regulation \n     restricting intercountry adoptions to biological grandparents \n     or requiring that restrictive laws be passed as a \n     prerequisite for accession to the European Union;\n       Whereas the number of Romanian children adopted \n     domestically is far less than the number abandoned and has \n     declined further since enactment of Law 272/2004 and 273/2004 \n     due to new, overly burdensome requirements for adoption;\n       Whereas prior to enactment of Law 273/2004, 211 \n     intercountry adoption cases were pending with the Government \n     of Romania in which children had been matched with adoptive \n     parents in the United States, and approximately 1,500 cases \n     were pending in which children had been matched with \n     prospective parents in Western Europe; and\n       Whereas the children of Romania, and all children, deserve \n     to be raised in permanent families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the desire of the Government of Romania to \n     improve the standard of care and well-being of children in \n     Romania;\n       (2) urges the Government of Romania to complete the \n     processing of the intercountry adoption cases which were \n     pending when Law 273/2004 was enacted;\n       (3) urges the Government of Romania to amend its child \n     welfare and adoption laws to decrease barriers to adoption, \n     both domestic and intercountry, including by allowing \n     intercountry adoption by persons other than biological \n     grandparents;\n       (4) urges the Secretary of State and the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development to \n     work collaboratively with the Government of Romania to \n     achieve these ends; and\n       (5) requests that the European Union and its member states \n     not impede the Government of Romania's efforts to place \n     orphaned or abandoned children in permanent homes in a manner \n     that is consistent with Romania's obligations under the Hague \n     Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in \n     Respect of Intercountry Adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8397-3", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8397-S8398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY WITH GERMANY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the treaty be considered as having passed through\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\nits various parliamentary stages, up to and including the presentation \nof the resolution of ratification; that any statements be printed in \nthe Congressional Record as if read; and that the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the resolution of ratification; and further, that when the \nresolution of ratification is voted on, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, the President be notified of the Senate's action, \nand that following the disposition of the treaty, the Senate return to \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the Treaty on Mutual Legal \nAssistance with Germany, a close and trusted partner with the United \nStates on law enforcement matters.\n  I would like to address one issue that arose during the review of the \ntreaty. Article 12(1) of the treaty provides that ``Each Party may at \nthe request of the other Party, within its possibilities and under the \nconditions prescribed by its domestic law . . . take the necessary \nsteps for the surveillance of telecommunications.''\n  After the revelation last December of the program of warrantless \nsurveillance by the National Security Agency, NSA, the question arose \nwhether the treaty would provide another purported legal authority for \nthe NSA program. My view is that it does not. But the President's \nlawyers have proffered highly dubious theories for the program, and the \nSenate should not make assumptions about what the executive branch \nthinks about a treaty, because ultimately it is the President, not the \nSenate, who is charged with ``faithfully executing'' it. So I asked the \nexecutive branch its legal view about whether the treaty provides any \nadditional legal authority for electronic surveillance--whether for the \nNSA program or any other program.\n  On April 6, 2006, I wrote the Attorney General of the United States \nto ask him to confirm that the treaty does not authorize warrantless \nsurveillance. On July 3, after nearly 3 months of deliberation, the \nDepartment of Justice responded to my letter. Why it took so long to \nanswer this simple question is unclear. But the response itself is \nclear: the Justice Department letter concludes that the treaty with \nGermany would ``in no way expand current authority under U.S. law to \nconduct electronic surveillance.''\n  I welcome the Justice Department's response. While I may disagree \nwith the Department about the scope of the current authority under U.S. \nlaw to conduct electronic surveillance, I agree with the Department's \ninterpretation that Article 12(1) does not expand that authority.\n  I urge all Senators to support this treaty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2006.\n     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Attorney General of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Gonzales: Pending before the Senate is a Treaty \n     on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters with Germany \n     (Treaty Doc. 108-27).\n       Article 12(1) of the Treaty provides that each party may \n     request that the other party, ``under the conditions \n     prescribed by its domestic law, take the necessary steps for \n     the surveillance of telecommunications.''\n       I write to request that you confirm that the Treaty does \n     not authorize warrantless surveillance, including any \n     surveillance authorized by the program of surveillance on \n     which you testified before the Committee on the Judiciary on \n     February 6, 2006.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Joseph R.

Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: This responds to your letter, dated \n     April 6, 2006, to the Attorney General inquiring whether \n     Article 12(1) of the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in \n     Criminal Matters with Germany would authorize warrantless \n     surveillance, including under the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program described by the President.\n       By its terms, Article 12 would provide that ``[e]ach Party \n     may at the request of the other Party, within its \n     possibilities and under the conditions of its domestic law[ \n     (1)] take the necessary steps for the surveillance of \n     telecommunications.'' (Emphasis added.). Accordingly, the \n     Treaty would not enlarge existing surveillance authorities.\n       The Terrorist Surveillance Program is a narrowly focused \n     early warning system, targeting for interception only those \n     international communications for which there is probable \n     cause to believe that at least one of the parties to the \n     communication is a member or agent of al Qaeda or an \n     affiliated terrorist organization. It is a critical \n     intelligence tool for protecting the United States from \n     another catastrophic al Qaeda attack in the midst of an armed \n     conflict.

Mr. President, I opened my remarks tonight to say there \nare a lot of issues being considered. Let me in closing mention a great \nevent we had today for a bill that will get a fair amount of \nattention--but not the attention it deserves--in affecting people's \nlives in a very direct way. It is called the Adam Walsh bill, named for \na little boy, 6 years of age, who died 25 years ago today.\n  The bill addresses an issue that has been highlighted a lot, most \nrecently on television, that has to do with sexual predators which had \nbeen facilitated a lot by the Internet. This bill establishes two \nregistries. One is for sexual predators. Right now there are about \n500,000 we know of in this country; 100,000 we don't know where they \nare. It establishes a registry across the country, a national registry.\n  In addition, it will develop a child abuse registry which builds on \nthe recommendations and sponsorship initially of a wonderful nonprofit \ngroup\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nthat focuses on the tragedy associated with child abuse, but also more \nconstructively and optimistically about what we need to do. That is \ncalled Childhelp, stationed in Arizona. Senator Kyl is very familiar \nwith it.\n  One huge disappointment, though, that occurred this week is that we \npassed another bill 2 days ago, the Child Custody Protection Act, which \nfocuses on a real tragedy that occurs today, and that is young girls \ntaken, not by their parents, across State lines in order to get an \nabortion without notifying their parents, flouting the law and not \nnotifying their parents or getting the consent of their parents.\n  We passed that bill overwhelmingly, with 65 votes, on the floor of \nthe Senate. It passed the House of Representatives months ago, and we \nare ready to go to conference on that particular bill.\n  It is very important we go to conference to put an end to this \ntragedy which occurs all too often in this country. We tried to go to \nconference. The Democrats on the other side specifically rejected our \nproposal to go to conference. We put forth a unanimous consent request \nwhich was denied, and that is a real tragedy.\n  I will not proffer that unanimous consent request again right now, \nbut we will be doing so over the coming days. The Democrats have made \nit very clear that they are going to obstruct the regular order of \nbusiness in going to conference. I am very disappointed, and I think it \nis absolutely wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8399-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I thank the leader, and I join with him \nin his excitement in seeing the health care technology bill move. I \nknow how much work he has put into it as a member of the HELP \nCommittee. I have watched that bill for some time, and it would be a \ntremendous thing. It will save lives and reduce errors. Errors mean \npeople stay in hospitals longer and become disabled more, and many of \nthem die. So reducing errors is a great thing and will help us maintain \nthis fabulous health care system we have, and at the same time, not \nhave costs go through the roof. So I am excited about that also.\n  Mr. President, I asked the question earlier: What are people \nobjecting to about this Energy bill? We went through the environmental \nconcerns, and I pointed out that we have 4,000 wells which survived \nsome vicious hurricanes, and we haven't had spills. The technology has \nincreased incredibly well. There has not been a significant spill in 26 \nyears, and that one was such that it did not reach the shores of the \nUnited States. The last spill that resulted at all from a well \nimpacting the coastal areas was 37 years ago in California, and that \nended the drilling off the coast. But we are so much better today. We \nhave so many ways to avoid that, and it is just not happening.\n  Also, we dealt with the allegation that this is all for big oil \ncompanies.\n  That is exactly wrong.\n  All of the oil companies will not bid on the lands in the gulf that \nwill be allowed for production under this legislation. Most of them--\nprobably most of them--won't even bid on it. A number will and a number \nwon't. Those who don't bid already have reserves somewhere else, and \nsizable increases in production of natural gas or oil from the Gulf of \nMexico will drive down the value of their reserves. They probably don't \neven want the oil and gas produced out there, if they already have \nsubstantial reserves. That is a bogus argument, the kind that I hope is \nbeyond the Senate. But I hear it is still echoing a bit.\n  I think some maybe just hate fossil fuels, so they don't want us to \nhave fossil fuels anymore in America. I would like to see us move to \nnuclear and do some other things, too. Why don't they object to us \ngoing down to Venezuela and paying hundreds of millions of dollars to \nHugo Chavez for his oil that we bring over here or Saudi Arabia or \nIran's oil or Middle Eastern oil in any number of areas or Russian oil \nand gas. We are not going to stop this. We are going to use oil and gas \nin America, so why don't we produce it on our lands and keep our money \nat home.\n  I would just note that last year, in the balance of payments deficit \nthat we have, the record balance of payments deficit, $200 billion of \nthat deficit was our money we spent in other countries for oil and \ngas--$200 billion. That is a lot. A big part of our trade deficit is on \nthis one resource. So why in the world wouldn't we want to keep that \nmoney at home to produce jobs here, to produce incomes to Americans who \nwill pay taxes to the U.S. Government instead of having to go to these \nother countries.\n  Oddly, I just have to note parenthetically that we have done \nsomething after many years of battling that is important. In the Energy \nbill we passed last year, we had some improvements in the law relating \nto nuclear power. Nuclear power can reduce our demands for natural gas \nsignificantly. There was a long battle over a number of years. Senator \nDomenici worked on it hard. We made those changes, we put them in the \nlaw, and at that time we had not a single preliminary request for \nbuilding a nuclear power plant in this country. Since that Energy bill \npassed, there are now 18 out there--18 preliminary requests--to \nconsider building a nuclear powerplant in America. We haven't built one \nin 30 years in this country.\n  What I am saying to the American people who may be listening tonight, \nand to my colleagues, is that our job is not to help nuclear power \ncompanies. Our job is not to help oil companies.\n  Our job is to try to provide safe and environmentally good energy \nsources to our people at the lowest possible rate. When the price of \ngasoline goes up substantially, people who are paying $150 a month for \ntheir gasoline now may be paying $225 a month. They may be paying $75 \nmore each month out of their paycheck, money that they want to spend on \ntheir children, money they need to repair their vehicle, money they \nneed to pay their rent. People are struggling. We need to be thinking \nof ways to reduce the cost of energy. Nuclear power is one of those \nways.\n  I have just had a recent meeting with the people at TVA, the \nTennessee Valley Authority, created by Government agents, created by \nFranklin Roosevelt. They are producing nuclear power at about 1.2 cents \na kilowatt hour--1.2 cents. Coal is about 1.8 cents. That is 50 percent \nmore expensive. Nuclear power is 50 percent less expensive than coal. \nAnd natural gas that is being used quite a bit is about 6 cents--five \ntimes as much. So we need more nuclear power and we need to burn a lot \nless natural gas for electricity and we can burn less coal also because \nit is not a very clean fuel. We are doing better with coal, but it is \nstill not nearly as clean as nuclear power.\n  So I say there is a whole host of things we can do to meet the \nlegitimate pleas of our constituents to do something about the high \ncost of energy.\n  Natural gas heats a great many homes in America. It provides the \nenergy for all kinds of industrial production. I visited a chemical \nplant recently. They are exceedingly concerned about the additional \ncosts they have sustained simply as a result of the doubling of the \nprice of natural gas. Trust me. If these wells are producing in the \ngulf, as will be authorized by this bill, it will significantly impact \nthe price of natural gas in the United States. So that is the kind of \napproach we are trying to bring to bear on producing more at home.\n  Then there is one other argument that people have complained about, \nand that is revenue sharing. They say that States should not get any of \nthe money out of this. We have been trying to expand the gulf drilling \nfor quite a number of years and had no success, really. It is time to \nget serious about it. I believe we can make a breakthrough this year. \nWe got, now, both Senators from Florida to say they would support this \nbill. They studied it very carefully, as strongly as Florida is \ncommitted to environmental purity along their coast. I respect it, but \nI am telling you they are very committed to it. They want us to produce \nour oil and\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\ngas off our coast and put it in that pipeline that runs from Mobile, \nAL, to Tampa, FL. That is what we are doing right now. They built, in \n2002, an oil and gas pipeline right off our coast, and shipped it over \nthere. But they do not want oil drilling 150 miles from their coast.\n\n  We are working this out now. We are giving them a guaranteed \nprotection of 125 miles. The Governor, Jeb Bush, is on board now and \nSenators are on board so maybe we are making progress. I think we have \nmore protection than is justified. But it will allow us, probably, to \nhave as much territory available to drill in as we could drill in for \nthe foreseeable future. So maybe that will be acceptable under all the \ncircumstances.\n  But they object to revenue sharing so States get a little part of it. \nOne of our Senators, Mr. Bingaman from New Mexico, has complained about \nit. We should not have any revenue sharing.\n  We had 4,000 wells out there, all these deep gulf wells, and the \nStates don't get a dime out of it--not a dime. But a State like New \nMexico that has a lot of oil and gas and a great deal of federally \nowned lands in those States, what do they get? They get 50 percent of \nthat. This will be just a little over a third; 37 percent would be \nshared with the coastal States and would be earmarked for coastal \nfunds--12 percent for the Land and Water Conservation Fund nationwide, \nand 50 percent to the Federal Government. These are moneys, new moneys \ncoming into the Treasury of the United States that do not exist today. \nUntil we get this approval and this moratorium lifted, we are not going \nto have any money. You know, until we reach accord here and lift this \nmoratorium and allow the drilling to occur, we are not going to have \nany money.\n  So it is not a taking from the Treasury of the United States. It is \nan increase to the Treasury of the United States, and we should see it \nin that fashion.\n  The gulf coast has environmental problems of quite a large degree. We \nhad severe hurricane damages on our coast. The whole area--whole areas \nin Louisiana are sinking, and we will have to spend large amounts of \nmoney to deal with that. So there are a lot of things that this money \ncould be used for that benefit, not just the people of those States but \nall the many hundreds and thousands--millions, really--of visitors that \ncome to the gulf coast areas every year. We will set up estuaries, \nwetlands, and things that will just make the area better. We would like \nto do that for the Nation and not just Alabama.\n  I think the objections are not substantial. I believe it is time for \nus to complete this step. We are at record prices for oil. How do we \nget our oil? Sixty percent of it we obtain from foreign sources. So we \npay this world price, transferring $200 billion in American wealth out \nof our country to those countries when we could keep it at home by \nproducing large amounts off our gulf coast.\n  Just to mention those amounts, they are quite huge. It is 1.3 billion \nbarrels of oil that are projected to be in the Gulf of Mexico. That \nexceeds the proven reserves of Oklahoma and Wyoming combined, two of \nour largest oil-producing States. There are almost 6 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas, enough to heat and cool 6 million homes for 15 \nyears, for example. These supplies are significant enough that they \nwill impact prices. I can't say what the prices will be a few years \nfrom now when this oil and gas comes on line, but whatever it is, it \nwill be less if this oil and gas is coming on line than if it is not.\n  That will redound to the benefit of the American consumers that we \nrepresent--the ones who have sent us here and asked us to do something \nabout energy prices. All of us have told them we are going to do \nsomething about it. This is one vote about which you can have no doubt. \nIf you vote to produce oil and gas off the coast of America, you will \nhelp reduce the price of oil and gas in America. Not only that, you \nwill keep at home billions of dollars that might otherwise be sent to \nforeign nations, some of which are hostile to us. It is the right thing \nto do. We need to follow through on it.\n  I am optimistic more than I have been in quite a number of years. It \nis particularly thrilling to see Senator Martinez of Florida, who has \nworked so hard on this issue, and Senator Bill Nelson from Florida, who \nearlier today said he would support the Senate bill.\n  So we are moving to make this a reality. It will be a positive step \nfor this country. The only thing we have to fear is there will be some \non the other side for what reason I can only imagine who will want to \nfilibuster this legislation. Hopefully that won't happen. I hope not. \nWe need to move it forward and pass it this year.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/07/27/senate-section/article/S8400-1", "month": "07", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 10 A.M.
